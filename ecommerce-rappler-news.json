For Filipinos, it was the website that arguably brought e-commerce into the mainstream fore. “Multiply shopping” became such a huge part of the site, with more than 90 thousand merchants in 2011, that it eventually shifted to a fully e-commerce website. At that time, the Philippines was also said to be the largest and fastest growing market for Multiply. Fast forward to the present, where e-commerce has grown and evolved in many ways. In 2015, there were already 44.2 million active Internet users and 47 million active Facebook accounts in the Philippines. How does this affect e-commerce as a whole? What does the online retail landscape look like right now? Check out the infographic below. Not just for the casual seller While there are still a lot of buy and sell merchants on social media (particularly on Instagram), e-commerce has graduated from being the casual seller’s arena and is now enlivened by a number of big guns. One example is Lazada, an online shop that offers everything from clothing, to gadgets, and appliances. Because the Internet is able to reach all kinds of people, it’s also a great place for stores with more niche markets. There’s Zalora, Asia's leading online fashion destination, Sephora.ph for skincare and makeup lovers, and coupon sites like Ensogo and Deal Grocer for those looking for good deals. For every serious shopper Online stores don’t just pose advantages for sellers. Their main feature is being able to provide shoppers with a fun but convenient way to shop. Since they are not bound by geography, they’re able to bring international brands and experiences within reach. Myshoppingbox and LBC Shipping Cart, for example, allow you to shop from online stores outside the country by providing you a US address to plug in upon check out. They’ll also be in charge of shipping the products straight to you in the Philippines. Travel lovers will surely appreciate sites like Agoda for online hotel bookings as well as Expedia and Skiddoo, which take care of travel needs from flights to accommodations. This same convenience is also apparent in the numerous modes of transactions available. E-commerce has made it easier for people to purchase the things they want with options like cash on delivery (COD), meet-ups, mobile transfer, bank deposit, over-the-counter bank payment, and credit and debit cards.  Special promotions that are online and exclusive to credit cardholders also make for a better experience. In Zalora, shoppers using a BDO Credit Card can get a 12% discount if they spend at least P500. Agoda and Skiddoo have credit card promos, offering discounts, booking fee waivers, and raffles for free airplane tickets. – Rappler.com Special promotions that are online and exclusive to credit cardholders also make for a better experience. Whatever your online shopping needs, BDO Credit Card offers year-round online deals that you can take advantage of. The Internet and mobile are no longer niche technologies. Both have become integral to modern life so it’s not surprising that consumers prefer the Internet for the convenience it offers when shopping. With BDO online promos, cardholders can enjoy bigger savings from the top online shops in town.

Who keeps us safe from these cyber criminals? If you have a credit card or participated in e-commerce, there’s a good chance that Ralph Santos had a hand in your protection. Santos is one of the most successful anti-fraud experts in the country, consulting with everyone from banks, large corporations, and even the Philippine government. His work in this space led him to create the platform VMoney. Santos recalled, “I observed OFWs who frequented brick and mortar money transfer services that levied disproportionately expensive fees and took days to process remittances to the Philippines. I felt that it was imperative to deliver solutions that simplify the experience and enrich people’s lives.” “Hence in 2013,” Santos continued, “I formed VMoney – a powerful consumer-centric system that offers revolutionary technology to the common consumer. I envisioned equipping Filipinos all over the world with the capability to provide for their loved ones and manage their finances in real-time, anytime, anywhere, at highly competitive fees.” Enter VMoney Certified and accredited by both the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), VMoney offers unique benefits to both consumers and businesses alike. For consumers, VMoney could be roughly compared to a Philippine version of Paypal, though it offers financial services unique to our country. Santos said, “For consumers, VMoney enters the picture as a comprehensive payment portal with a secure and simple interface enabling members to access and manage their funds through a dashboard that allows them to easily send and receive funds in real-time, pay bills online, buy prepaid load, shop online, and avail of a VMoney Prepaid MasterCard.” Such features allow any Filipino – even the famously “unbanked” – to avail of the “same benefits as those enjoyed by the banked minority.” Alternatively, on the merchant end, VMoney is infinitely customizable and can include such features as “funds disbursement, online and point-of-sale payment acceptance, and loyalty and rewards programs.” As an example of just how customizable their system is for businesses, Santos said, “If a business would like a proprietary payment-processing platform with the capability to accept multiple forms of payment, including NFC tap payments and even QR code, we present VMerchant.” Cultural challenges As robust of a system VMoney already is, it’s easy to overlook all the many challenges that went its development. For example, to customize the systems for businesses, Santos’ team had to put in an unprecedented amount of legwork, perhaps more than you would expect from a tech company. He said, “One of our biggest challenges would be customizing the platform’s features according to the different needs of consumers and businesses we were talking to, which required tremendous amounts of research and constant communication. We were engaging with banks and dealing with businesses on a daily basis and being able to understand their current systems and how it works is integral to pinpoint what their primary need is.” But many of the challenges involved not just putting in the hours, but going against cultural mores, including the Filipino propensity to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. Santos explained, “Apart from dealing with regulatory and bank requirements, which we completely understand, VMoney met a lot of skepticism when it first entered the local industry. From the onset, we worked to establish VMoney’s credibility as an extensive, end-to-end e-commerce solution for businesses.  Many groups were doubtful about our claim of what our system can do and that we can revolutionize the payment landscape.” And those companies that bought into Santos’ vision often tried to emulate the idea themselves. “Others tried to replicate our technology,” Santos said, “but our years of professional experience dealt us well in development. Our team continued to work hard, businesses saw our solutions, and within a short span, acceptance of our products came organically.”   Most of this traction is coming from the merchant, rather than the consumer, end of VMoney. Santos said, “As for membership, we have a good number so far and we are estimating to have about a million by the end of the year, majority of which we will be getting from project commitments with merchants. I believe that when we start to market more widely, consumers are going to see the value we are offering and thus convert to membership.” The future of VMoney As successful as VMoney is quickly becoming, Santos, being a big-picture kind of guy, is quick to situate the company in the context of what it can do for Philippine e-commerce as a whole.   Santos said, “I like to believe that we are innovating the e-commerce industry and will continue to do so. We want to further an era where consumers are financially empowered and we are working hard to promote acceptance of secure wireless transactions.  We want to transform and streamline the payment landscape by developing technological innovations ahead of our competitors.” “As we continue to do this, we want VMoney to reach maximum ubiquity,” Santos revealed. “We designed VMoney with the idea to help elevate the quality of life for Filipinos, for both consumers and businesses, for them to have instant and convenient access to their money. We continue to build on this idea and partner with businesses and government agencies to bring all payment channels under one place – the VMoney account.” “In sync with our vision,” Santos concluded, “we want to continue redefining the standard for security, simplicity, and convenience for e-commerce in the Philippines with solutions that constantly pave the way for greater business efficiencies and consumer experience.” Santos understands that the success of VMoney many inspire other technopreneurs, some of whom may even be competitors, as is already happening. Still, Santos was eager to share his advice on how technopreneurs can succeed in the Philippines. He advised, “Self-belief, passion, hard work, focus, and perseverance – these are all critical and foundational traits in reaching your goal. But to be competitive, to be ahead of the game and capture the market, you must plan and execute properly. Be prepared, be aware, and widen your peripheral vision as anything and everything can come up to hinder your progress, especially when you have comprehensive and complex products that require great detail and attention.”   Santos went on, “Wear the ‘Project Management’ hat tightly. Lead, direct, facilitate, be an example, resolve issues, collaborate, action deliverables, and most of all, prove it. Prove your product, prove that it works, prove that it will help, prove that it will truly be of service. Expect pain, sweat, and tears, and surrender to the journey completely.” – Rappler.com   Rappler business columnist Ezra Ferraz graduated from UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California, where he taught writing for 3 years.

Besides the Philippines, the Lazada online marketplace also operates across the region in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. A lot of the focus of this various meetings this week held as part of the ASEAN Summit 2017 focused on harnessing the potential of innovation to help spread the wealth more evenly. Some of the discussion topics took on ecommerce as a platform, which allows small-scale entrepreneurs to sell their goods across the country and also globally without the need for much capital. The platform is also arguably the most established of the digital ‘disruptors’ which have caught on tremendously in developed countries, as seen by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba edging traditional retailer Walmart to become the world’s largest retailer by merchandise volume last year.   Ingredients in place While well-established in the mature economies, ecommerce is also rapidly catching on in the developing world. Balci sees the potential of ecommerce in the Philippines as eclipsing other countries' development through ecommerce. “My goal is to make the Philippines number one in the world in terms of ecommerce penetration. I think this is achievable because the country used to have the largest SMS penetration in the world before smartphones and it is now number one in terms of Facebook penetration with 57 million accounts,” Balci pointed out. Filipinos also lead the world globally in terms of amount of time spent on social media, spending an average of 4 hours and 17 minutes a day on social platforms, according to a 2017 report by social media management platform Hootsuite and social media consultants We Are Social Ltd. What’s more, smartphone penetration is on a steep rise in the country at a rate of 117%, with total mobile subscriptions at 119 million last year. The rise has been so steep that market research firm IDC deemed the country the world’s fastest growing smartphone market in Q1 2016. The rise of smartphones bodes well for the future of ecommerce in a country where not everyone can afford laptops. Ecommerce can be done using affordable Android smartphones, Balci pointed out. So integrated has this been to Lazada Philippines' expansion that Balci now refers to the company as an Mcommerce site with the ‘M’ standing for mobile. He estimated about 60% of sales on its platform are done through mobile. By Balci's own estimates, however, the percentage of online retail sales in the country hovers at around 1 -2% of the total retail market presently. Much of this, he explained, is down to the twin challenges of reliable logistics suited for ecommerce and the low penetration rate of credit cards in the country. That may change, however, as the country’s two largest retailers are beginning to make investments into the field. The SM group, the country’s largest conglomerate which already explored ecommerce in the past, has formally entered logistics through a 34.5% stake in the country’s largest logistics firm: the 2GO group. Its retail rival the Ayala group, on the other hand, made an even more direct play by taking a 49% stake in online fashion platform Zalora Philippines. Ayala has also entered into a joint venture with Ant Financial, the world’s largest digital payments firm, in a move seen to spur the growth of digital payments in the country. Even the global big-hitters it seems are taking notice of the potential in the region with the Alibaba Group taking control of all the ASEAN Lazadas in a deal worth $1 billion last year. – Rappler.com"},{"title":"Philippine retail industry gears up for the future","date":"Aug 14, 2017 7:45 PM PHT","snippet":"While e-commerce is a force that won't be held back, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are in the best position to take advantage of that revolution, according to the Philippine Retailers Association","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Get off a bus stop anywhere in the metro and you're likely to be near a mall. Indeed so ubiquitous are malls in the country that the top 3 business groups here – SM, the Ayala Group, and JG Summit – have all built their empires on the back of their retail behemoths – SM Supermalls, Ayala Malls, and Robinsons Malls, respectively. These malls have become such a fixture that they have transcended mere retail and have become part of the culture, even featuring Holy Mass services, as SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) vice chairperson Teresita Sy-Coson pointed out at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum earlier this year. One may think then that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers' position as a key node in the consumption-driven economy is unassailable. Like many other industries, however, they are in danger of being supplanted by internet companies in the form of e-commerce. \"In the developed world, the share of e-commerce is still quite small in terms of overall sales, slightly less than 10%,\" said Paul Santos, president of the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA), at the Stores Asia Expo 2017. The expo was held from August 10 to 11. \"In the Philippines, it's no more than 2%. But it's getting a lot of buzz because it's starting from a low base, it's growing, and there's lot of innovation from that sector,\" he added. That the industry is widely conscious of this threat is evidenced by the theme for this year's Stores Asia Expo: future-proofing retail. \"We want our members to obtain insights into how to conduct their business in the light of the growth of e-commerce,\" Santos explained. It's just as well since it's a crucial time for traditional Philippine retailers, with e-commerce giants Alibaba and Amazon looming over the horizon. Chinese giant Alibaba, now the world's largest retailer by market capitalization, has entered the Philippines by acquiring dominant local player Lazada. Amazon, meanwhile, announced its entry into Southeast Asia, starting with Singapore. Traditional retailers in a good position Despite this, Santos pointed out that traditional retailers are still in the best position to take advantage of the growth of e-commerce. \"Shopping has always been a sensory experience. This is what we've always been good at. What we want [local retailers] to realize is that if you meld this expertise with the kind of information that people get from e-commerce, where all the information on a product is readily available from price to reviews, then they can do very well,\" he explained. \"You see a lot of spending going to virtual reality because e-commerce is trying to recreate the sensory experience that so far has not yet been delivered,\" he added. Local retailers are also fortunate in that the e-commerce space has not yet been dominated by major players, giving them time to carve a niche for themselves. \"We're lucky, we're not China, the US, or the UK yet. E-commerce has not taken that much of a foothold [here] yet but mark my words, the time will come when [e-commerce] growth will come and it will be exponential,\" Santos said. Conglomerates buying in This idea of blending traditional brick-and-mortar retail with e-commerce is an approach the dominant local players have already seemingly taken to heart. All 3 of the dominant retailers – SM, Ayala, and JG Summit – have all made major investments in the e-commerce space this year. Ayala acquired online fashion platform Zalora and subsequently detailed its strategy of creating online and offline retailing synergies. (READ: Ayala's stake in Zalora PH: Fusing online and offline retail) The Gokongweis of JG Summit, meanwhile, acquired a significant stake in Singapore-based Sea Ltd, the firm behind the growing online platform Shopee. SMIC, for its part, has gone a different route by investing in logistics, a crucial part of e-commerce. It took control of the country's top logistics player 2GO Group Incorporated. Traditional retail still alive and kicking It may seem like traditional retail shops would be in danger of extinction in the country, but that is still far from the case in an economy that is predicated on consumption. (READ: Change or die: American malls confront Amazon era) Philippine retail sales grew by 10.6% year-on-year in the 1st half of 2016, with retail sales totaling P926 billion for the period, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Research firm AT Kearney also projected that the retail sector is expected to make up 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025. \"The industry is growing mainly because of the growing population and their consumption. Disposable incomes are growing, driven by OFW remittances and young people employed in the BPO sector,\" Santos explained. That means a huge slice of the pie for traditional retailers, considering e-commerce's meager foothold, so far. But Santos expects that to change in the near future as infrastructure and technology get boosted as well. \"I'd say you'd see the market percentage of e-commerce double in maybe the next 3 to 5 years. All the telcos are also committed to improving their connectivity and you have new players coming in,\" Santos said. \"Once the smartphone user base all gets converted to 3G or LTE mobile technology then that will be the point that you'll start to see exponential growth of e-commerce,\" he added. \"The day will come when e-commerce in the Philippines will grow exponentially and we don't want our members to be caught unawares.\" – Rappler.com"},{"title":"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's revenue jumps 32%","date":"Jan 28, 2016 8:58 PM PHT","snippet":"The quarter includes China's November 11 'Singles Day,' said to be the world's biggest online shopping spree, when Alibaba saw $14.3 billion worth of goods settled through its online payments unit","body":" SHANGHAI, China – Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba saw its revenue jump 32% year-on-year for the quarter ending in December, it said in a statement Thursday, January 28, despite slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy.  Alibaba, which dominates the consumer-to-consumer market in China, said revenue reached $5.33 billion (34.54 billion yuan) in the December quarter, beating an average forecast of 33.2 billion yuan in a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.

Pria 28 tahun yang dulu kesulitan mencari pekerjaan ini, sekarang justru berhasil membuka lapangan pekerjaan untuk orang lain dengan menjadi juragan mainan.  Upaya berwiraswasta bermula beberapa tahun silam saat Fahrudin dan keluarga kecilnya didera kesulitan ekonomi. Kelahiran anak pertama membuat kebutuhan sehari-hari semakin meningkat sementara inflasi terus melaju dan membuat harganya kian tinggi.   \"Saya bekerja lebih dari 12 jam per hari, pulang selalu larut malam, tetapi penghasilan pas-pasan,” ujarnya baru-baru ini.  Mencari pekerjaan yang lebih baik juga tak mudah dilakukan oleh Fahrudin karena pendidikan terakhirnya hanya Sekolah Menengah Atas (SMA). Dari situ, ia akhirnya memutuskan untuk berwirausaha. \"Kalau tidak mungkin mendapat pekerjaan lain yang lebih menjanjikan karena latar pendidikan saya yang tidak tinggi, mengapa tidak berwirausaha saja untuk mendapatkan penghasilan tambahan. Pokoknya saya tidak ingin keluarga saya kekurangan,\" ujar Fahrudin. Karena masih harus bekerja sebagai petugas kebersihan, berbisnis secara daring menjadi pilihan Fahrudin. Menurutnya, berbisnis daring memberikan fleksibilitas waktu dan memerlukan modal yang relatif sedikit. Pada 2012, lahirlah toko mainan daring \"Jurangan Mainan\" yang dibuat Fahrudin di situs marketplace Tokopedia. Perkembangan bisnisnya membuat Fahrudin akhirnya memutuskan untuk menjadi seorang pengusaha secara penuh waktu dan meninggalkan pekerjaan sebagai petugas kebersihan. Ini terjadi hanya satu tahun sejak ia memulai \"Juragan Mainan\".  Fahrudin tak sendiri CEO Tokopedia, William Tanuwijaya mengungkapkan ada banyak \"Fahrudin\" lain yang saat ini telah bergabung dengan situsnya. \"Masih ada lebih dari 300.000 lainnya, pemilik bisnis kecil yang bergabung di Tokopedia.

Zalora says Pinoys have best of both worlds","date":"Mar 23, 2016 2:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Ecommerce is fast establishing itself as a retail channel, but its rise will complement rather than disrupt traditional retail, says the founder of Zalora Philippines","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Like most disruptions in the past, the advent of ecommerce has been framed as a battle between online convenience and the traditional brick and mortar experience: your couch or the mall. Ecommerce has played its part as the upstart in this battle, with brands such as Lazada and Zalora coming from nowhere a few years ago to winding their way into the public consciousness. Despite this, ecommerce currently accounts for only about 1% of the local retail market. However, as Paulo Campos III, founder and CEO of fashion retailer site Zalora Philippines pointed out, \"Where it's going – that’s the exciting part.\" \"If you believe that the concept of ecommerce is universal, and not just a western country thing, then the experience of other countries provides a glimpse of what's in store for the country,\" he said in an exclusive interview with Rappler. In the US and EU, ecommerce now represents about 8-10% of the retail market including big names like Amazon.com. But more relevant to the Philippines is its success closer to home. \"China is the shining story of ecommerce in emerging markets and and somehow validates the thesis that ecommerce is a global, universal thing and that it's going to happen eventually here and everywhere else,\" Campos said. Indeed, some of China's best known companies, including the record holder for biggest IPO ever, Alibaba, are built upon ecommerce and already have 6-7% of China's giant retail market. But its success there doesn’t guarantee it would work here, especially in a country where malls have become the de facto townsquares. This is especially true of a firm like Zalora that plays in the fashion space where the fit and feel of clothes are so essential to the buyer. Unlike Uber Setting up shop in the country in 2012, initially as a venture of Rocket Internet, Zalora has since grown to become the leading fashion-focused ecommerce platform in the country, averaging around 200,000 users per day. To visualize this, that's about on par with the amount of daily foot traffic the big malls get, Campos said. Yet, he doesn't see this as a signal that malls will soon be disrupted in a way Uber has done to taxis around the world. \"Filipinos will continue to go to the mall in the large numbers they do now. Culturally, the mall is more than just a place to go to buy stuff, it's where people hang out, cool off and even go to Mass,\" he said. \"In terms of how I see the development of the brand, we're moving to an omni-channel experience,\" Campos explained. For example, someone goes to the store to check out an item but then does the research online and then might go back to the store or they can just buy from the site. \"This omni-channel experience means that ecommerce and the mall will coexist and in fact reinforce each other in a harmonious way,\" he said. Consumer patterns Another interesting point about this relationship lies in consumer patterns. Campos pointed out that Zalora sales are highest on Wednesday and Thursday, while they are lowest, at only 50% of the highest days, on Saturday and Sunday. Within a day, sales are highest between 1 pm and 4 pm and are lowest between 6 pm and 8 pm. This has been true for every week for 4 years. These patterns are the exact opposite of sales patterns in the offline world. \"What I tell our brand partners is that when customers are in the mall, they are shopping with you. When they're not in the mall like during downtime at the office that's when people are shopping with us,\" Campos said. \"People are shopping with us on hump day and 1-4 pm, taking advantage of fast Internet at the office. Somehow it's complementary,\" he said. He also pointed out that Zalora's retail brand partners also found that online shopping doesn't cannibalize sales. It's just one way of reaching out to customers at another time and through a different channel. This blending of both worlds can already be seen in individual brands that all have their own ecommerce websites. You can buy Nikes online but that doesn't mean they've closed down their stores. Local retailers like Bench and SSI, both of which sell through Zalora, already have online ecommerce sites, although Campos is confident that they will continue to sell on Zalora. \"Customers who are shopping for a specific brand can go to its website directly, and those shopping around looking for many brands can go to Zalora. Brands are basically doubling their retailing channels through us,\" he said. To facilitate this, Campos said that Zalora sells everything at suggested retail price (SRP). This means nothing will ever be cheaper or more expensive in the mall than on the site, and when an item goes on sale offline, it does so online as well. Digital department store Campos said that what Zalora brings to the table for consumers, besides convenience, is the ability to browse established brands while getting  exposed to new ones. \"About half of our brands, 750, are mall brands that work together with us on a virtual inventory basis or a marketplace basis. The other half are independent brands, the SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises], and entrepreneurs that don't have the scale to work with us like the big brands do,\" Campos said. He added that while they have the top 20 online retail sellers, they don't have a store so most consumers have never heard of them. On top of that, Zalora also has its own brand that encompasses about 20% of sales. He also pointed out that many users visit the site as an information resource to check on product alternatives and get reviews on different items. Tip of the iceberg Approaching its 4th anniversary in the Philippines, Campos said that Zalora is profitable on a unit economics basis. But at the moment it is sacrificing profitability for the bigger battle for market share. Far from traditional retailers, Campos said that the main challenge facing Zalora, as well as other big ecommerce players, is getting consumers comfortable with buying online, which is why it is channeling money into various marketing efforts. These efforts include the pop-up stores they had last year as well as hosting a Zalora Style Awards Ceremony to be held on April 7, and a regional model scouting competition to mark its 4th anniversary. Just getting consumers online is also proving to be tricky with Campos sharing that they are still fighting a battle on educating Filipinos on how to use mobile data. \"I recently saw a Google study that showed that among all our peers in Southeast Asia, we use Internet on a fewer number of days per month than any other ASEAN country and significantly so,\" he shared. \"Out of 30 days, only 80% use it 1-5 days a month. So this phenomenon of being constantly connected or being a digital native is not true for most people in the country,\" Campos added. Even potential customers who are connected are hampered by poor network infrastructure. \"We have the benefit of comparing all the ASEAN countries that have Zalora side by side and through the comparison you can really see that we really do have an inordinately slow mobile Internet speed even compared to Indonesia or Vietnam,\" he said. On the flipside, Campos pointed out that 40 million Philippine users have access to the Internet now, and the number is expected to go up to 75 million in the next two years. If the Internet improves in the next few years, this would bring huge potential to online businesses. With Internet speeds improving, the firm is hoping that as more and more consumers become digital natives, they would eventually get comfortable browsing the site from anywhere. Maybe even while hanging out in a mall. – Rappler.com"},{"title":"Change or die: American malls confront Amazon era","date":"Aug 13, 2017 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"The changes to malls are part of a fundamental industry rethink as e-commerce takes market share and alters consumer expectations","body":"NEW YORK CITY, USA – As the retail industry churns in the Amazon era, American shopping malls are turning to a new generation of stores, food, and entertainment offerings to make up for an exodus of department stores. Prime mall real estate is increasingly going to players who began online and are graduating to brick-and-mortar, such as plus-size clothing label Eloquii, or stores selling niche items like candy and conflict-free diamonds. In some cases, these retailers are taking space, literally, from exiting chains like Macy's. Other additions include the trendy burger restaurant Shake Shack, and Dave & Buster's, whose video game and pro-sports viewing restaurants are emblematic of the \"experiences, not stuff\" mantra now resonant among consumers. The changes to malls – climate-controlled beacons to American consumerism that grew rapidly in the latter part of the 20th century – are part of a fundamental industry rethink as e-commerce, led by gargantuan purveyors like Amazon, takes market share and alters consumer expectations. \"This isn't the same culture as 30 years ago,\" said retail industry analyst Dana Telsey, who sees today's moves as the \"early innings\" of a multi-year evolution. Malls will endure because they offer \"the excitement of being able to see what's new,\" she told Agence France-Presse. \"It's a meeting place. It's an entertainment center.\" \"You're always going to have shopping centers that engage,\" said Telsey, chief executive of Telsey Advisory Group. The changing times are a period of reckoning for hundreds of second-tier shopping centers in a country that experts say has long been \"overmalled.\"  A January review of 1,070 malls in the US by Green Street Advisors, a real estate research and advisory firm, classified more than 330 malls as \"at risk to close\" due to declining occupancy, low sales, weak socioeconomic demographics, and anchor store vacancies.  \"These malls only account for roughly 5% of mall value in the US,\" the report said. \"Most won't be missed.\" Survival of the fittest Many of the most vulnerable malls were built in the 1960s and 1970s with department stores as anchors that attracted enough customers to also support secondary stores. But stores in malls were often pricier than free-standing shops because of the heavy rents for common costs such as heating, maintenance, and security, said Fred Hurvitz, professor in retail studies at Penn State University's Smeal College of Business. The arrival of e-commerce and greater price transparency means malls must compete not only with Amazon for more cost-conscious customers, but with discount chains. \"You're seeing a whole movement towards any way you can save the customer money, that's going to make you more viable with the customer,\" Hurvitz said. \"Without high traffic levels, the malls die.\" The exodus of retailers means shopping centers that were once hives of activity are hollowed-out shells with a few well-stocked shops surrounded by empty storefronts. Parking lots that were jammed with cars a few decades ago are now mostly empty seas of asphalt. \"It's a very depressing place,\" Nakul Kumar, an economics professor at Bloomsburg University, said of the Columbia Mall in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, which just lost its JC Penney store. Kumar joined a Planet Fitness gym that opened earlier this year at Columbia Mall in a space formerly occupied by Sears, and he says he hopes that increased traffic from gym members will spur more activity.  But it was not, perhaps, a good sign when Columbia Mall was profiled earlier this year by filmmaker Dan Bell as part of his YouTube \"Dead Mall Series.\" The Baltimore documentarian has also featured visits to seen-better-days malls in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Maryland. Bell's portfolio was spotlighted in a July New York Times Style story that rued the passing of an era. New investments Yet mall developers dismiss talk of their demise despite today's retail industry travails. \"I will tell you, it's not a very fun environment,\" David Simon, chief executive of the real estate investment trust Simon Property Group, said recently about finding new takers for vacated real estate.  \"We're pounding the pavement more than ever,\" he said in a conference call. Simon said he has been encouraged, however, by a trend of e-commerce chains like apparel maker Eloquii or eyeglasses seller Warby Parker raising capital to open brick-and-mortar stores. Some of these newer brands could ultimately have as many as 400 stores, he said. \"In this cluttered world of trying to get people focused, we are seeing more and more brands that want to gravitate to where the traffic is,\" Simon said. \"By and large, in communities throughout the country, that's the mall. And that has not changed.\" GGP, another real estate investment trust, plans $1.5 billion in mall investment, including a greenfield mall in Norwalk, Connecticut and a major expansion to the Staten Island Mall in New York City that it bills as a \"shopping center of the future.\"  Staten Island will add the German supermarket chain Lidl, as well as Dave & Buster's, a new AMC movie theater, and a few new apparel stores. GGP has also budgeted \"refresh capital\" for existing malls – sometimes stretching into the millions of dollars. The company recently removed an old fountain and spiffed up the dining area at its Wayne, New Jersey mall. \"You've turned your old, very tired looking food area into something very modern,\" Kevin Berry, a vice president at GGP, said of the Wayne upgrade. – Rappler.com"},{"title":"Pakistan's untapped resources empowered by e-commerce boom","date":"Feb 28, 2016 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Traditional Pakistani products are now reaching a wider base as Internet access grows","body":" ISLAMABAD, Pakistan – In the Hindu Kush mountains craftswomen painstakingly stitch flowing scarves, skilled artisans who were unable to sell their products beyond the remote region until mobile internet came to Pakistan and dropped the market into the palms of millions of previously marginalized people. The women of northern Chitral are among the unlikely profiteers of an e-commerce boom since 3G and 4G Internet arrived in the deeply conservative Muslim country in 2014, suddenly able to market and sell traditional products without leaving their villages or in some cases even their homes. \"The online platform eliminates the middleman,\" says Nasrin Samad, the entrepreneur behind the artisan brand Kai, which works with women across the region. Now, Chitrali women \"have access to a global audience,\" she says.

Broadband subscribers have topped 26 million people, the Ministry for Information Technology said in February, with broadband penetration going from 3% to more than 15%. The ministry cited World Bank studies showing that a 10% increase in high-speed internet connections can boost gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.38%, adding the arrival of broadband in Pakistan is set to have a \"very positive impact on economic growth.\" Dawood echoed the report's optimism. \"There are tremendous opportunities for everyone to start selling and buying instantly and earn money,\" he said. E-mpowerment Women are seeing the benefits, but e-commerce presents potentially an even greater opportunity for young people in a country where roughly two thirds of the population – of around 200 million – are estimated to be under the age of 30. A recent economic survey by the finance ministry singled out the challenges facing youth in Pakistan, including \"limited job search expertise, a mismatch between education, aspirations and employers' requirements and a lack of mobility, among other factors.\" Seventeen-year-old Daniyal Admaney says he was able to defy skepticism over his youth to launch his T-shirt design business on Kaymu, however.  \"I... thought that I should do something productive during summer vacations when I have nothing to do except getting bored and sleeping,\" he says. Kaymu, a venture of German company Rocket Internet, which builds online start-ups, has helped launch several other e-commerce companies unique to Pakistan such as consumer goods site Daraz.pk. The online marketplace launched in the country about 3 years ago and now boasts 3,000 transactions every day, with around 11 million unique visitors in 2015, Dawood told AFP. Kaymu now employs some 150 people in Lahore and Karachi working with 15,000 vendors like Admaney, and has a customer base of more than 300,000 people from around the country.  It has also helped bring some international e-commerce sites to Pakistan, such as carpooling site Tripda and restaurant delivery site foodpanda.  Scramble for Pakistan? But global giants of e-commerce such as Amazon still do not have an established presence in Pakistan, hampered by a lack of regulations and infrastructure such as a payments system, says IT expert Shahzad Ahmad. Unrest in the militancy-plagued country is also a factor, he says.  The promise of Pakistan remains enormous, he says, adding that the country's central bank \"should undertake a study on the potential of online business and also come up with clear regulatory framework so that foreign giants are attracted to tap into Pakistani e-commerce market.\" Some hurdles are in the process of being removed already. Last year the global Financial Action Task Force removed Pakistan from its list of high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions linked to money laundering.  Following the decision, the IT ministry announced in November it will ease e-commerce regulations and invite online payment giants PayPal and Alibaba to the country, where cash on delivery remains prevalent but use of debit and credit cards is growing. In the meantime, ambitious Pakistanis are crowding the booming market with their own, localized, and in many cases successful products.

You'll never know who and what you'll find.","body":"Bargain-hunting from the sofa Levy admitted that reduced prices is the main reason people visit CashCashPinoy, adding that products constitute the bulk of sales. Bargains are achieved, he said, by taking old inventory from major retailers. CashCashPinoy then buys them in volume to sell in a flash sale to its members. It solves a need of major retailers – especially fashion outlets – to often change their offerings every 3 to 4 weeks, creating large amounts of leftovers, Levy said. This allows consumers who have been coveting a pricey item to purchase them, after a period, at vastly lower costs. BeautyMnl also employs a bargain strategy by offering customers 20% off on their first purchase and a 10% rebate in the form of credits for succeeding purchases. This, in effect, is a 10% discount on every item. Levy emphasized however that convenience also plays a big part in the overall e-commerce experience. Consumers can, after all, access all the information they need, purchase a product, and have it delivered to their doorstep in one day – all from their laptops or smartphones. “If it’s cheap but it’s broken, or if you receive it after Valentine’s, what’s the point?” he said, adding that “it makes sense, [because] as a consumer, you don’t want to sacrifice the price for the quality or the convenience or the reassurance.”  Valentine’s Day caring A large part of Valentine’s Day is wanting to share a romantic evening or getaway, especially since this year, it falls on a weekend. The problem is, most couples plan on having the same intentions. Thus, booking a hotel room for a romantic getaway has been notoriously difficult around Valentine's Day in the past years. The rise of shared economy platforms has provided some unique solutions to this, however. A shared economy platform works by allowing users to temporarily rent out to others, something they are not using, such as a house, cars, or even space in their cars – often for a fee.  AirBnb is one of its most famous examples. The company provides a platform, through its website or app, that allows users to either rent out their lodging or find such a place to stay. Since its inception in 2008, the company has provided about 800,000 listings in 192 countries. The Philippines, with its booming tourism industry, is fast becoming a popular market for the service. Airbnb host Carlos, a 34-year-old marketer, rents out a room in his flat in the heart of Makati for about P1,500 ($33.87) a day. He averages about 3 guests a month, earning him roughly P10,000 ($225.81) in additional monthly income. About 90% of his guests are foreign. Of the remaining 10%, half are people who live outside Manila, while the rest are people looking to spend some time with their loved one, away from the prying eyes of their parents. The majority of the foreigners choose his apartment because it affords them a pleasant environment for a reasonable price. Boutique hotels around his area typically cost roughly P2,500 ($56.45) a night. There are many available rooms at budget motels near the red light district, he said, but a place you can really feel at home in is a much more romantic setting, he added. Creating encounters Even if a romantic setting has been picked out, a couple still needs to get there. This can be a problem as horrible traffic is an added feature of Valentine’s Day. Fortunately another shared economy platform is aiming to tackle that head on. Tripda is a currently free service that matches users with the same intended destination for a carpool. This means less cars on the road and less congested public transportation as each space in a car is maximized. Users who have been matched by the service are given a suggested price to pay to take care of gas and other expenses, allowing for the cost to be shared by a group.  A unique feature of the service is that it “creates encounters” among users, according to country head Erick Coser. “Because the traffic in the Philippines is so bad, you stay in the car for a long time and that leads to friendships developing between users,” Coser said. The online, virtual encounters can come full circle and spring some surprises. A member of his team, Coser said, even found love during a carpool trip, meeting his girlfriend while on a round trip. – Rappler.com   US$1 = P44.29 All images used from Shutterstock"},{"title":"Yahoo brushes up its e-commerce for small business","date":"Aug 15, 2014 11:46 AM PHT","snippet":"The move can help Yahoo regain a foothold in online retailing in a market expected to grow to $304 billion this year","body":""},{"title":"Story of Zalora deal points way for Ayala Corp’s dive into digital future","date":"Apr 21, 2017 10:39 PM PHT","snippet":"Ayala Corp sees the move not just as an entry into ecommerce but as the foundation for logistics. The deal itself shows how the conglomerate’s size and diversity helps it capitalize on new trends.","body":"The story of how Zalora Philippines eventually came to be part of the Ayala Group serves as a signpost to the conglomerates' race to keep pace with world rapidly going digital.   Ayala Corp, along with subsidiaries Globe Telecom, Ayala Land, and BPI, took a combined 49% stake in Zalora Philippines in a deal announced last month. The deal had its roots, not in any of the 3 mainstays of the Ayala Group, but in one of its newer arms: education. \"One of the investors in Zalora had investments in education and they wanted to look for ways we could work together and so they approached Fred Ayala, head of AC education,\" said Jose Teodoro Limcaoco, Ayala Corp’s CFO at the firm’s annual stockholder’s meeting on April 21. “He in turn got a good glimpse into the firm's operations and after over a year of discussions and trying to understand the ecommerce model and their plans, the deal went through. It was teamwork,” he explained. Ecommerce but also logistics For the Ayala Group, the investment represents an entry into not just one but two industries they view as game-changers in the country: electronic commerce (ecommerce) and, potentially, logistics. \"The way we view [the deal] is that there is a trend beginning to take place in the country. We have many young people and the usage of mobile phones and internet in the country is probably among the highest in the world. Yet our use of the ecommerce space is very, very low. We believe there will be a trend of people using ecommerce more and more over time,” said Ayala Corp Chairman Jaime Zobel De Ayala. Underpinning that trend, however, is a way to take products from one point to another and that involves a logistics system. “Logistics is an important component in what makes the country work and we are actually very interested in that field. What was exciting about the Zalora investment is that lying beneath the ecommerce surface is a distribution business built up from scratch,\" Zobel de Ayala explained. “We believe it can become more robust, and we can help grow it as we proceed and have it deliver many more products, not just the ones that Zalora carries at this time,” he added. Limcaoco elaborated on that noting that Zalora delivers 80% of their own goods through to the last mile averaging about 6,000 two way deliveries a day since most of the products are bought using cash on delivery (COD). The deal also dovetails nicely with Ayala Corp’s recent deal, creating a joint venture with Ant Financial, the leading digital payments platform in China along with Globe and its subsidiary Mynt. \"The fact that we’ve also invested in the payments system side is also a big advantage. The vast majority of ecommerce in the country is done through COD, which is unusual in a global setting as most people around the world pay electronically. So rather than seeing that as a problem, we see that as an opportunity. ” Zobel de Ayala explained “People will need a payment system that they can trust and is accessible, and the investment with Mynt, Globe and Ant financial is going to make for a very interesting platform to make that happen,” he added. The group was also drawn to Zalora beyond other ecommerce firms because its revenues were growing at 40% a year with a business model that aims to be profitable by 2019. Hedging retail empires Part of the interest in this is because its conglomerate rival, SM Investments Corportion, has made an even more concrete play into logistics by taking a 34.5% stake and effective control over the 2GO Group; the country’s largest integrated logistics firm. The two conglomerates are the country’s leading retail mall developers, although the rise of ecommerce is threatening foot traffic in physical malls around the world. In what most analysts point to as a sign of the changing times, the online-born Alibaba is now also the world’s largest retailer, having overtaken traditional retailing giant Walmart in sales last year with revenues of $15.7 billion. Digital dive This rise of ecommerce is part of a wider trend of disruption caused by a world turning more towards the digital, a trend that Zobel de Ayala noted the group is keen to keep pace with. “If you really look at all our businesses, the digitization of that space is taking place in many ways not just in fintech and an ecommerce platform,” he noted. “In Globe, its massive, while we’re spending a very substantial amount of money in BPI to upgrade everything to enter the digital space. Ayala Land also uses digitization in many different ways. It is also changing how products and services are delivered in health and education,” he added. (READ: Ayala Corp enters health tech via ePharmacy startup) One of the group's businesses that has benefitted immensely from the world going digital is its manufacturing arm IMI. The firm, which features factories all around the world, has grown on the back of manufacturing semi-conductors and sensors, both of which key components for smart cars and other smart products. “A lot of the new businesses that are growing in manufacturing is a result of the transformation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and how its transforming how cars and other forms of transport are run,” the Ayala Corp chairman noted. To reinforce his point, IMI also just recently announced that it acquired a majority stake in UK based STI Incorporated, further diversifying its manufacturing capabilities into aviation and defense components. Zobel de Ayala also highlighted the group’s size, and the fact it has its hands in plenty of industries, puts it in a unique position in seeking out new opportunities in the fast-changing economy. “The Zalora deal really reveals a unique opportunity that the  Ayala group has with these different window of opportunity that come across. Our size allows us to intelligently harness the flow of  relationships and opportunities that come,” he said. The chairman pointed out that the reason Ayala Corp, aside from its own stake in Globe, got involved in the joint venture with Ant Financial was because the Chinese giant “wanted Ayala Corp’s as part and parcel of that investment given the breadth of interest we have in the group,” “Sometimes it’s a little bit serendipitous but sometimes there’s a little bit of order in the chaos. Sometimes you can spot trends and people approach you and it starts to fit a pattern in our mind of where trends are going and before you know it, you start putting capital and managers towards the project,” he added.— Rappler.com"},{"title":"How PayMaya is helping power e-commerce in the Philippines","date":"Apr 5, 2021 11:15 AM PHT","snippet":"Learn more about their end-to-end suite of payment solutions","body":"Editor's note: PayMaya provides a rundown of its services, such as PayMaya Checkout, PayMaya Mall, and more.

Harganya menjadi lebih murah karena telah didiskon.  Merespon terjadinya kasus ini, pihak Lazada telah menyatakan kesiapan mereka untuk mengambil tanggung jawab. \"Kami telah menghubungi pelanggan yang bersangkutan dan sedang menyelesaikan perihal ini. Kami tanggapi secara serius semua masukan dari konsumen mengenai produk yang dijual melalui website kami dan kami sedang menyelidiki,\" kata co-CEO Lazada Indonesia Elizabeth Craft melalui sebuah keterangan tertulis, Rabu, 15 Juli.  Secara khusus terkait dengan peredaran barang palsu di situsnya, Elizabeth menegaskan bahwa Lazada tak akan memberikan toleransi terhadap penjual yang diketahui menjual dan mendistribusikan barang palsu.  \"Lazada memiliki kebijakan untuk tidak mentoleransi penjualan produk tiruan di website kami. Pada kejadian tertentu dimana ada dugaan khusus terhadap penjual maupun produk yang dijual pada platform kami, tindakan tegas akan diambil, termasuk menghapuskan produk maupun penjual tersebut sesegera mungkin.  \"Kami berjanji bahwa konsumen akan menerima produk yang sesuai, baru, asli dan tidak rusak maupun cacat,\" ujarnya. Jual beli daring bermasalah tanggung jawab siapa? Budi tak sendiri. Andrew Atmadja juga rupanya pernah mengalami nasib serupa dan seperti Budi, membagikan pengalamannya melalui surat pembaca harian Kompas. Andrew bahkan telah berupaya untuk mengembalikan produk yang ia beli, yaitu krim tangan dengan merek L'Occitane. Namun hingga saat ini menurut pengakuan Andrew, upayanya belum memperoleh respon yang memuaskan dari pihak Lazada.   Tak hanya barang palsu, belakangan Lazada juga memiliki persoalan dengn pengiriman barang yang tak sesuai pesanan.  Rizki Kartadikaria yang memesan ponsel pintar Asus Zenfone 6 malah menerima dua kotak pewangi pakaian dari Lazada.

Jadi males blanja di Lazada.... http://t.co/liuh8ORSom — 43D1 N45UT10N (@abdinst) July 15, 2015 Lalu siapa yang harus bertanggungjawab jika terjadi kasus seperti ini? Penyedia platform? Penjual? Atau pengirim? Sayangnya jika merujuk pada draf Rancangan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan (RPP) Perdagangan Elektronik yang tengah dipersiapkan oleh Kementerian Perdagangan, belum ada jawaban yang jelas untuk pertanyaan tersebut. (BACA: Efek kasus iPhone Lazada, penanggungjawab perdagangan elektronik belum jelas) Bagaimanapun, menurut Ketua Pengurus Harian Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Indonesia (YLKI) Tulus Abadi, pihak penyedia platform seperti Lazada tak boleh lepas tangan.  \"Konsumen berhak atas kompensasi dan ganti rugi jika dirugikan oleh penjual. Mereka (penyedia platform) harus bertanggungjawab, kan bagaimanapun mereka ikut menawarkan. Mereka harus bersinergi dengan para penjualnya,\" kata Tulus, Rabu.  Lazada sendiri memang tak menjual barang mereka sendiri melainkan hanya berfungsi sebagai platform tempat berjualan bagi toko-toko daring yang mendaftar ke situs Lazada. — Rappler.com"},{"title":"RPP E-commerce akan dorong bisnis online ke media sosial","date":"Jun 26, 2015 10:17 PM PHT","snippet":"Kewajiban pelaku bisnis online memiliki NPWP dinilai bisa melemahkan pertumbuhan e-commerce","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Rencana pemerintah untuk menggenjot penerimaan pajak dari sektor e-commerce, atau perdagangan elektronik, hanya akan membuat pelaku bisnis online terdorong untuk menggunakan media sosial.  \"Pesannya yang berbahaya, karena akan membuat pelaku bisnis berpikir bahwa pemerintah membatasi kalau e-commerce itu hanya untuk sektor formal,” kata Ketua Asosiasi E-commerce Indonesia (idEA) Daniel Tumiwa, Kamis, 25 Juni.  “Akibatnya yang saat ini masih berada di sektor informal akan beralih menggunakan media sosial dan tidak masuk ke platform e-commerce.” Rancangan Peraturan Pemerintah (RPP) terkait e-commerce ini akan mewajibkan pelaku bisnis online untuk memiliki Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak (NPWP) bila berjualan di pasar Indonesia.  “Menjadi masalah juga ini, orang mau jualan diminta NPWP, ya mereka ujung-ujungnya lari ke Facebook,” kata Direktur Utama situs MatahariMall.com Hadi Wenas.  Hal ini, menurutnya, hanya akan melemahkan bisnis perdagangan elektronik Indonesia yang sedang menggeliat karena didorong oleh meningkatnya ‘ekonomi internet’ di Indonesia.  (BACA: Pelaku startup Indonesia, ayo cari investor!)

Kebanyakan yang tidak memiliki NPWP adalah pelaku bisnis kecil atau perorangan.   Direktur Kepatuhan Internal dan Transformasi Sumber Daya Aparatur Ditjen Pajak Wahyu K. Tumakaka mengatakan bahwa mewajibkan NPWP ini akan membuat pengusaha besar ataupun pelaku bisnis online perorangan patuh membayar pajak.  “Kami itu tidak membedakan antara bisnis online dan offline.

The world's largest retailer posted a slight profit rise and better-than-expected sales for the second quarter, which ended July 31. Wal-Mart cut its 2014 earnings per share forecast to $4.90-$5.15, from the prior estimate of $5.10-5.45, citing investments in e-commerce and higher health care costs than previously anticipated. The outlook was lower than what analysts had expected. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company reported net income of $4.09 billion in the quarter, up 0.6% from a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, matching Wall Street estimates. Net sales beat expectations, rising 2.8% year-over-year to $119.33 billion. Total revenue rose 2.8% to $120.1 billion. Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, said the discount retailer had clocked up encouraging performances in its international business, its new small-format \"Neighborhood Market\" stores in the US and in e-commerce. But US comparable-store sales – sales in stores open at least a year – were flat in the last quarter. \"We wanted to see stronger comps in Walmart US and Sam's Club, but both reported flat comp sales. Stronger sales in the US businesses would've also helped our profit performance,\" McMillon said in a statement. Same-store customer traffic at Walmart US, the company's largest chain, fell 1.1%, while traffic at membership chain Sam's Club rose 0.3%. For the current quarter, Wal-Mart said it expects US sales to be \"relatively flat.\" Wal-Mart is facing a sluggish retail market in the US amid minimal wage growth and high unemployment as the economy still struggles to recover 5 years after exiting severe recession. Greg Foran, the head of Walmart US since early August, said that the most notable operating headwind in the second quarter came from health-care costs, which increased $180 million from a year ago, \"well above our initial estimates.\" Foran, who is in charge of more than 4,000 Walmart stores and 1.3 million employees, said that health-care costs were expected to grow more than $500 million for the fiscal year ending January 31. For the quarter, sales gains were made by all the company's divisions, with Walmart International pulling in the largest increase at 3.1%, topping Walmart US's 2.7% rise. E-commerce in focus Global e-commerce sales grew about 24% in the quarter. The company said its 4 most important markets – the US, Britain, China, and Brazil – saw double-digit growth. \"We remain focused on price investment across all our markets and expect to continue driving improved comp performance,\" said David Cheesewright, Walmart International president and CEO. \"I am pleased with the trends in many of our markets, which were driven by a continued focus on being the lowest cost operator.\" \"Our investments in e-commerce and mobile are very important, as the lines between digital and physical retail continue to blur. Our customers expect a seamless experience, and we're working to deliver that for them around the world,\" McMillon said. He said the company would invest an additional $160 million in e-commerce. To lure more customers to its websites and better compete with online retail giant Amazon, Walmart recently snapped up companies specialized in data analysis and online marketing, and has begun rolling out a global technology platform. The company just launched an online price-comparison app, Savings Catcher, to allow customers to get back the difference they paid when they find a local competitor offers a lower advertised price. Shares in Dow component Wal-Mart rose 0.5% to close at $74.39 on the New York Stock Exchange. – Rappler.com"},{"title":"More and more empty stores in Manhattan as e-commerce grows","date":"Feb 14, 2018 1:09 PM PHT","snippet":"With more people shopping online, plus the higher rent, physical businesses are closing shop in Manhattan","body":"NEW YORK, USA – The New York borough of Manhattan is richer and more populated than ever, but a growing number of businesses are closing their doors under the pressure of exorbitant rents and online commerce. On Wednesday – which happens to be Valentine's Day – Steven Telvi will close down his Upper East Side drugstore, The Source, after nearly 37 years. It fell victim to slower business and high rent, he says. \"The whole island is going down the tube,\" Telvi says of small business in Manhattan. From Soho to the Upper West Side, passing Fifth Avenue or the Meatpacking District, it is no longer rare to see two or three deserted storefronts on the same block, right in the middle of the Big Apple, a shopper's paradise. Nearly all the economic indicators of America's largest city look positive: historically low unemployment; per capita income 34% above the national average; more than 61 million tourists last year. Business people and property agents interviewed by AFP all cite skyrocketing rents as the primary cause of the business closures. Rents rose 68% between 2009 and 2016 in Soho, 70% in parts of the Upper West Side, and 175% in places on Fifth Avenue, according to the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY). Market fundamentals \"This is a classic example of pricing outstripping demand and fundamentals in a market,\" said Brian Klimas, REBNY's vice president in charge of research. Prices have finally started to fall over the past few months in numerous parts of Manhattan.  But the proportion of vacant businesses is still rising, to nearly a quarter of spaces in Soho at the end of 2017, according to property firm Cushman & Wakefield. \"Landlords have been slow to change the price point of their retail offering,\" said Kenneth Hochhauser, executive vice president of Winick Realty Group. For the shopkeepers who remain, sometimes in tenuous financial circumstances, \"it's not helping\" to see neighbors disappear, says Clara, a salesperson at ready-to-wear clothes retailer Variazoni on the Upper West Side. \"Business is not very good. There's no (foot) traffic\" because there aren't enough businesses, said Jennifer Sun, who opened the Magical Kids store for children's clothing on the Upper East Side in May 2016. After an \"OK\" first year, Sun says many surrounding stores have closed \"over the last five or six months\" – and activity slowed. \"I don't even have a salary,\" she said. Online commerce Steven Soutendijk, executive director of retail sales at Cushman & Wakefield, said, \"it's going to take some time\" before the market adjusts. He talks of \"two or three years before it really swings back,\" but isn't worried. \"In the financial crisis, you had all activity dry up entirely for a period of four or five months,\" he said, referring to the global economic collapse that struck in 2008 and peaked the following year. \"It does not feel as negative as 2009. Not even close.\"  But at that time, online commerce represented only 3.6% of retail sales, against 9.1% today, according to the latest government figures. Telvi remembers it perfectly. That was when he changed locations – from one side of Third Avenue to the other. \"That's when the internet kicked in\" for commerce, he said. Since then, his activity has dropped 5% annually. The opening of new subway stations on Second Avenue at the end of 2016 reduced the foot traffic past his store a little more, cutting by a quarter his turnover and pushing him towards the exit. Some New York City Council members say authorities have to act. In a report released in mid-December, they warn that otherwise, the economic downturn could \"undermine the neighborhood character and provision of goods and services that are essential to livability.\" At the end of November, Mayor Bill de Blasio made an initial move, doubling the threshold for which retailers are exempt from municipal tax. The shopkeepers are fighting with their own weapons. \"I do special things that nobody has,\" says Sun, pointing to an embroidered pillow. \"We always struggle to stay relevant to our customers and what they need,\" says Matt Sartwell, of Kitchen Arts & Letters, which specializes in books about gastronomy, on the Upper East Side.  \"People that come here get something in return.\" Another asset: His space belongs to the building's co-owner, who \"would rather have us than another hair salon or bank,\" Sartwell said. For Telvi, the end of The Source may not be the end. He could eventually open up another business. But for now, he says: \"I have to put my feet in the sand for a couple weeks.\" – Rappler.com"}]}
