This was announced by LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada in a press briefing on Friday, February 2. LTFRB said it would work with Transport Network Companies (TNC) Grab, Uber, and U-Hop to complete the database of all drivers applying for provisional authority (PA). \"Current active drivers applying for franchise on March 5 will be prioritized. TNCs will send LTFRB a list of those who should be [present at the LTFRB] to apply for franchise,\" Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino. LTFRB earlier said franchise applications for TNVS would open on Monday, February 5, but was later moved to March 5 to give more time to finalize the list of drivers eligible for franchise. Lizada said schedules would be set for processing applications, and reminded the drivers to only go to the LTFRB on the date of their application as recommended by the TNC. \"If you are not on the list, don't go to LTFRB for the permit applications,\" she said in Filipino. Lizada also said hatchbacks and other compact or smaller sedans are allowed to apply as long as fare rates must be lower than sedans. She added that hatchbacks will only be allowed to operate as Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) within Metro Manila, and this classification will reflect on their Certificate of Public Convenience. Cap on permits LTFRB earlier set a cap on TNVS permits at 45,700 units nationwide. This sparked a debate among TNCs on whether it is the right number of units based on the demand. (READ: Poe to LTFRB: 'Explain the math' behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles) Based on the data submitted by Grab and Uber to LTFRB, Lizada said, only 150,000 to 180,000 of the requested 350,000 to 400,000 bookings made under Uber were served. Meanwhile, Grab was only able to serve 270,000 to 290,000 of the 320,000 to 380,000 bookings during weekdays. (READ:Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB) The Department of Transportation then ordered the LTFRB to review the cap imposed by the LTFRB. Don't buy those cars yet Lizada said the regulatory board sees the need to evolve as technologies innovate. She said, however, that the government's mandate is to regulate, and cautioned drivers against buying new cars to apply for TNVS permits. \"We see the innovations, the needs of riders evolve. What government is doing is adjusting and seeing how we can fit as well. We do this because many might buy cars again. Don't buy cars for TNVS anymore. Let's cut it off,\" she said.   In 2016, LTFRB suspended acceptance of new applications for TNVS permits for ride-hailing apps due to the rising volume of applications and concern of oversupply of units. The LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab in July 2017 for allowing its drivers to operate without permits. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)

TNVS hatchback drivers claimed that about 5,000 of them were deactivated by ride-hailing firms, citing \"safety concerns and convenience issues to passengers.\" Transportation Undersecretary Mark de Leon said that the LTFRB will need to amend the memorandum circular, in order to legally allow hatchback units as public utility vehicles. De Leon also said that the hatchback drivers that were previously delisted should be prioritized. \"Dapat bigyan ng priority iyong mga natanggal sa listahan dahil ‘yan ay ‘yung mga nakapag-invest na sa serbisyo.

That is the sentiment of TeamSpeed president Bobby Coronel after Uber was suspended by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Monday, August 14, for one month. \"Wrong move po talaga si Uber regarding this one, lumalabas talagang wala sila pakialam sa peer and driver partners nila, importante lang sa kanila ang kumita,\" Coronel said. (Uber really made the wrong move. It shows that they really don't care about their drivers and peers, they only want to earn.) Coronel leads a group of some 4,200 drivers partnered with Grab and Uber. He started the viral petition asking the LTFRB to lift its suspension order against Grab and Uber, and its moratorium in processing transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications. Uber's fault, as stated by the LTFRB, was it continued to accredit drivers despite the regulatory board repeatedly ordering all transport network companies (TNCs) to halt accreditation. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) Uber defended itself by saying that it was only responding to \"public demand.\" It also slammed the LTFRB for taking too long in processing thousands of franchise applications. Then, Uber claimed, it was not properly briefed about the July 26 order, which it took to mean that accreditation of drivers was still allowed, but these new drivers cannot ply the roads. The LTFRB rejected the ride-hailing company's explanation. Because of Uber, Coronel said drivers and their families are bearing the brunt of the dilemma. \"Ngayon ganito ginawa nila, parang pinatay nila mga pamilya na umaasa sa marangal na trabaho na gusto lamang makapagbigay ng serbisyong publiko. Alam na ni Uber na may fault sila,\" he said. (With what they did, it's like they killed the families of those who depend on the job, those who just want to serve the public. They know that they are at fault.) Better to impose a fine? While thousands of his fellow drivers will lose the source of their income, Coronel said it was only right that the LTFRB suspended Uber instead of imposing another fine. \"Ipinapakita lamang po ng government natin na may talim ang batas. I'm sure matututo na si Uber niyan... Of course, mas okay kung fine only lang but paano matututo si Uber if magbabayad lang lagi siya ng danyos sa pagiging pasaway?\" Coronel said. (The government just showed them the rule of law. I'm sure they will learn their lesson now. Of course, a fine would be less harsh, but how will they learn if they can just pay every time they violate the law?) Uber earlier criticized the LTFRB for imposing archaic laws and failing to adapt to the changing times. But for Coronel, Uber should have slowed down and complied with the law from the start. With some 66,000 Uber drivers prohibited from operating starting Tuesday, August 15, Coronel echoed the LTFRB's recommendation that the transport network giant provide financial aid. \"Nananawagan po kami sa pamunuan ng Uber na makipag-usap sa mga apektadong partners at panagutan nila ang gusot na ito.

Lizada said franchise applications for these vehicles will be accepted starting Monday, but will be processed after those with official receipts and certificates of registration (ORs/CRs). An OR/CR under the operators' name is part of the requirements for TNVS franchise applications. The LTFRB held talks with loaning institutions so that the ORs/CRs of the vehicle will be released under the name of the operator, and not under the bank or institution that handles the loan. \"In this case, we are in talks with Toyota first but if there are other (loaning institutions) who will approach us, we will talk to them,\" Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino.

The memorandum covers all taxi and TNVS operators that have a valid certificate of public convenience or provisional authority from the LTFRB, as well as those whose permits expired starting March 17. As LTFRB will determine the number of allowed units, transport network companies will have to submit a list of qualified TNVS operators. The regulatory board, meanwhile, will provide the TNC the final list of qualified taxi operators, after the firm submits the initial list of taxi drivers within their system. This means that all taxi operators must be under a TNC, such as dominant ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines and taxi-hailing app MiCab. To date, there are 9 accredited ride-hailing companies, including Owto, Hirna, ePickMeUp, GoLag, Hype, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. TNVS operators must submit to their home TNCs photocopies of their certificate of registration, Land Transportation Office (LTO) official receipt, and passenger insurance policy.

Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines' public policy head, said more drivers would be encouraged to get on the road now that are holding the proper documents.

At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,\" Grab added. In May last year, the transportation department issued the department order, creating 4 new transport categories: TNVS, Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. These are meant to ease traffic congestion \"through efficient use of road space.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/police-seize-millions-worth-shabu-caloocan-buy-bust-december-24-2020","title":"Police seize P34 million worth of shabu in Caloocan buy-bust","date":"Dec 25, 2020 2:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Cops arrest a TNVS driver who was found possessing more than 5 kilos of suspected crystal meth, says the Philippine National Police","body":"Police seized an estimated P34 million ($707,620) worth of shabu or crystal meth in a buy-bust operation in Caloocan City on Christmas Eve, said Philippine National Police (PNP) chief General Debold Sinas.

In turn, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is mandated to issue the corresponding Certificates of Public Convenience (CPCs). The order was made in light of complaints received by ARTA regarding numerous pending completed applications only awaiting CPCs.  ARTA is an agency under the Office of the President that has the authority to investigate and file cases against inefficient agencies or individuals, in line with ease of doing business and anti-red tape reform. The applications have all been paid for and heard 20 days after the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 was implemented.  Section 10 of the act states that if a government office fails to approve or disapprove a request for certification within the prescribed processing time, the application will be deemed approved, provided all documentary requirements and fees have been completed.  Consequently, LTFRB was ordered to issue the corresponding CPCs and other certifications applied for.  The LTFRB is set to release 5,061 CPCs, with 1,130 pending to be processed within two weeks.  In addition, LTFRB was directed to provide a list of all pending applications with completed fees and requirements within 3 days of this order.

Furthermore, LTFRB was ordered to review and revise its Citizen's Charter in accordance with ARTA's policy recommendations, also including the documentary requirements and processing time specific to TNVS applications. It will be subject to review by ARTA. The 2017 LTFRB Citizen's Charter currently provides the requirements and duration for the issuance of a new CPC, but does not include specific stipulations for TNVS applications.  In the past, LTFRB suspended accepting and processing new TNVS applications due to its rising volume. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/cebu-city-tnvs-system-misuse-government-vehicles","title":"Cebu City uses TNVS system to stop misuse of gov't vehicles","date":"Nov 4, 2017 3:06 PM PHT","snippet":"'The days of government employees abusing taxpayer-owned vehicles are finally Uber,' Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña says","body":"CEBU CITY – Starting next week, vehicles owned by the Cebu City government will have the tracking system used by transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to easily monitor the movement of government vehicles and personnel.

Otherwise, what's the point?' transport coalition STOP and GO says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A transport coalition hit the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by a Quezon City court against Uber and GrabCar, after the judge clarified that the order won't stop existing operations of the app-based transportation network vehicle services (TNVS).  Lawyer David Erro, representing the petitioner STOP and GO coalition, said the 20-day TRO was \"useless\" if it only stops transportation agencies from accepting or processing TNVS applications without affecting existing operations. \"We were surprised by the clarification given by the judge because the very intention of our petition is to injunct operations....I don't know why, by a mere interview, the order was amended,\" Erro said during the hearing on Tuesday, December 8. In an interview with reporters, STOP and GO president Jun Magno also criticized the judge's clarification. \"We firmly believe that the TRO should cover everything, including existing operations... Otherwise, what's the point of our TRO?\" he said. Last week, Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 Judge Santiago Arenas stopped the implementation of several department orders and memorandum circulars of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The issuances outlined the guidelines for the accreditation and operation of TNVS. The TRO, however, was limited only to the processing and approval of future applications. In the 7-page TRO, Arenas said the transportation department and LTFRB should stop the \"implementation and enforcement of DOTC Department Order No 2015-11, LTFRB Memorandum Circulars Nos. 2015-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2015-18 and other issuances thereto which include the accepting, processing, and approving of applications belonging to TNVS category…for a period of 20 days effective from date of receipt.\" He made no reference to previously approved applications. Only future applications stopped Following the reports of other media organizations that the TRO supposedly covered existing Uber and Grabcar operations, the judge was prompted to issue the clarification. The TRO will not affect existing operations of TNVS units already accredited by the LTFRB. But Erro, who raised his voice several times during the hearing, said it was \"common sense\" that the group sought a TRO to stop existing operations, not future ones. He also pointed out that the operation of TNVS units falls under the DOTC's department orders, and that stopping the orders should mean stopping operations of TNVS as well. \"These TNVS are creations of the department order. We're questioning the implementation of the department order. If the court restrains that order, then existing operations should also be restrained,\" he said. But Arenas stood by the TRO, citing jurisprudence that previously issued permits are not covered by the restraining order. Arenas also said that Uber and GrabCar were neither ordered to stop their operations, nor were they named in the dispositive portion of the TRO, because the two companies were not included in the body of infomation submitted by the petitioner when they sought the TRO. STOP and GO wants to stop the operations of TNVS. The group said taxi drivers suffer lower income because of the oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units plying the streets of Metro Manila.

What exactly are the requirements for these permits?","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Regulatory Franchising Board (LTFRB) recently raised issues against Grab and Uber drivers over franchising permit violations. What does the LTFRB need from these transportation giants? It all started in July 2016, when the LTFRB, through Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008, suspended the acceptance of new applications for transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) permits of transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Grab. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the government review of the fare scheme. On July 23, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) released a statement on its Facebook page and cited issues of \"accountability of TNCs to passengers and operators alike, and the problem of fare surging scheme.\" \"Equally important issues for compliance is to make sure that TNCs and TNVS contribute their fair share of taxes to the government, and for TNVS to have the required garages to avoid illegal parking on streets to prevent traffic congestion,\" the DOTr said. TNVS permits are legal papers given to accredited TNCs. These are the qualifications for aspiring TNVS applicants prior to the moratorium: LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise valid for one to two years. (READ: LTFRB fines Grab, Uber P5M each for permit violations) The requirements for a CPC permit are as follows: New Certificate of Public Convenience by Kimiko Sy on Scribd  A CPC permit usually takes more time to process. While waiting for the CPC permit, LTFRB gives out a PA permit which is processed just for 7 to 10 days. Here is the cost for filing permits: Filing for a motion to get a PA permit requires a motion for extension of provisional authority to be executed by a lawyer, OR/CR from LTO Registration, receiving copy of the application for CPC, government-issued ID, special power of attorney (for a representative), and the receipt of the payment for motion. No more permits Since the suspension last year, LTFRB has not processed a single application for TNVS permits. However, Grab and Uber have admitted that 80% of their drivers are driving without either a provisional authority (PA) permits or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Those whose status have been held following last year's suspension order can continue to file for PA permits until their CPCs are released.  The LTFRB’s latest estimate is that of the 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers,15,400 at most have adequate papers to operate. Discussions of Grab and Uber’s suspensions raised numerous complaints from commuters, especially those taking metered taxis. (READ: #CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes) The suspension dilemma is also heavily reflected on 50,000 Grab and Uber drivers operating around the country. “Hindi ko naman po alam na kailangan naming kumuha ng ganoon sa LTFRB kasi hindi malinaw ang instructions nila sa amin, ang hirap po kasi lahat kami mawawalan ng trabaho,” said Grab driver Dodie Cabatu. (I didn't know that we had to get [those forms] from the LTFRB because their instructions weren’t clear to us. It’s hard because a lot of us will lose our jobs [because of this]).” Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. Pending the LTFRB decision on the MRs, the TNCs' undocumented drivers can continue their services. The LTFRB has also ordered the Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the TNCs after June 30 this year. – with reports from Hannah Mallorca/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/buses-jeeps-banned-private-cars-modified-coding-metro-manila-gcq","title":"Buses and jeeps banned, modified coding for cars, in pitched Metro Manila GCQ","date":"May 27, 2020 6:09 AM PHT","snippet":"The Metro Manila Council suggests allowing taxis and TNVS, and letting private cars go out on coding day on the condition there are at least two passengers.

Garcia announced the night before that Metro Manila mayors have unanimously agreed to recommend transitioning the metro to GCQ on June 1. Private cars and shuttles of private companies are already allowed in the current modified ECQ. \"Pagdating po sa PUVs, huwag naman po muna sana yung buses at jeepney kasi mahirap po i-control dito yung physical distancing,\" said Garcia on the government's Laging Handa briefer on Wednesday. (When it comes to public utility vehicles, let's not allow buses and jeepneys for now because it's hard to control physical distancing there.) Garcia said that because jeeps and buses \"stop and go\" when taking in and unloading passengers, properly monitoring the passengers wouldn't be possible.  \"Hangga't hindi pa po natin nadidisiplina ang ating mga kababayan sa tamang pagbaba, sa mga bus stop magkakaroon po ng marker 'yan para at least one meter apart,\" added Garcia. (As long as commuters still don't know how to properly unload from vehicles, there should be markers at bus stops to keep people one meter apart.)  The bus and jeep ban, however, is still subject for approval by the national government through the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases. In the meantime, Garcia said taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) can operate in the GCQ. The suggestion was slammed as depriving the poor of accessible modes of transport, but Garcia said health and safety are the top priorities. Garcia said that another suggestion is to implement modified coding for private cars, which means that cars can still go out on coding day on the condition that there are at least two passengers. The rationale behind this, Garcia said, is to maximize cars on the roads, saying that before the pandemic, 70% of the private cars on the road have only one passenger. Garcia said leniency will be extended to frontliners who will take their cars out on coding day with no other passengers, but this will still be on a case-to-case basis, with accommodation for emergency cases.  Unlike the bus and jeep ban, coding adjustments only need the go signal of the MMC, and no longer require IATF approval, – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/dotc-rules-new-transport-categories","title":"DOTC lays down rules for new transport categories","date":"May 13, 2015 7:19 PM PHT","snippet":"The rules will guide companies that want to operate under the 4 new transport categories: Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) on Wednesday, May 13, bared the guidelines for operators who wish to be accredited under the 4 new transport categories, aimed at decreasing traffic congestion through technology. Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya has issued Department Order No. 2015-011, creating 4 new categories that will address increased demand for mobility and traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.”  “Our objective is to encourage innovation across all forms of public land transport in order to increase mobility on major thoroughfares, boost travel times, improve the quality, sustainability, and reliability of public transport services, and respond to the needs of the modern commute,” Abaya stated in the order published in newspapers on Wednesday. He added: “We view technological innovation as a driver for progress, especially in transportation where it can provide safer and more convenient commuting options to the public. App-based transport services help address the increasing demand for mobility spurred by rapid urbanization.\" Under DO 2015-011, the 4 new categories are: Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. For application-based services providers that want to operate under the classification TNVS, the DOTC said they should offer \"pre-arranged transportation services using an Internet-based technology application or a digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.\" The department also created a Premium Taxi category due to \"inefficient and uneven taxi availability coupled with poor customer service and lack of safety and security.\" For taxi companies that want to operate under the Premium Taxi category, their vehicles should not be older than 7 years, and equipped with global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices. \"Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles will be allowed for these categories,\" DO 2015-011 said. Operators of the new transport categories would be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for every vehicle to ensure accountability. To ensure passenger safety is not compromised, Abaya said drivers must be screened and accredited by the operators of the new transport categories, and registered with the LTFRB. Operators are also required to issue electronic receipts.
