Facebook's Emerging Trends Research showed that marketers who were able to pivot digitally amid the health crisis gained profits and it is more likely that consumers will continue to choose online shopping for their convenience. The study indicated 87 percent of respondents are willing to spend more for ease of access to products or services. About 12,500 people across 14 countries, including the Philippines, were studied for changes in consumer behavior in 2020. Among Philippines-based respondents, 93 percent said they highly consider convenience and price when deciding on what to purchase. “Research tells us that we should draw inspiration from the fact that for most consumers, the best journey is no journey at all. And by putting your customer first, you can eliminate friction, inspire discovery, and maybe even set a new standard in convenience,” Facebook Philippines country director John Rubio said during a virtual presentation on Tuesday. Live selling Live Selling, a rising Facebook trend where a business sells auction-style or an inventory show-and-tell in real-time through Facebook or Instagram Live, also gained steam in recent months, with one in four people surveyed having browsed such activity on social media. The research showed that 87 percent of Filipino respondents said that social media allowed them to interact more and deepen their relationship with brands. Respondents in the Philippines were described in the study as adventurous shoppers, with 80 percent interested in trying new and different ways of shopping. Often done in an entertaining fashion with real-time questions and answers, promotions, and games, Live Shopping had 85 percent of respondents say they expect the experience to increase this year. Upgrading the marketplace Preference for payment modes and where to shop is largely fueled by convenience, with 90 percent of respondents opting for mobile payments should they be made more available. The same percentage of those surveyed also wished shopping from their mobile phones was easier. In an interview, Rubio said in the coming months, Facebook will launch more tools to create a level of convenience that will continue to satisfy consumers, particularly on payment options. \"Over the next year, more products that will offer convenience will be launched. Such as showing inventory faster, completing a sale much faster than what we do today, and incorporating in shops to make transactions,\" he said. High hopes The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has recorded a significant increase in online business registrations in 2020. Records from March 16 to August 31, the height of lockdowns last year, showed 73,276 online businesses registered. Experts said the online economy will outlive the pandemic and continue in the new normal. The possibilities opened by the Internet for businesses will make it difficult to live in the new normal without them, they said. “The online platform economy can indeed catalyze inclusive growth but we need to get the government to make that happen, especially in developing countries such as the Philippines,” Philippine Competition Commission chair Arsenio Balisacan said in previous reports. Asian Development Bank chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada also said in previous interviews that e-commerce accelerated during the pandemic. “I think there’s going to be a permanent impact of digitalization and I think there are lots of positive aspects because online platforms can enhance market functioning and there’s a huge potential to make transactions more inclusive,” he said.

The environmental group said spray paint being sold online that were traced back to Davao City were allegedly found to be highly toxic, prompting them to call for a ban on these products. EcoWaste Coalition disclosed three of the 13 spray paint found to contain dangerously high concentrations of lead, a chemical banned in the manufacture of paint, were procured from an online dealer who shipped the items from Davao. “We appeal to online, as well as offline, sellers of lead-containing spray paint to discontinue the unlawful sale of such products that goes against the government’s policy of eliminating lead paints,” Thony Dizon, EcoWaste Coalition chemical safety campaigner, said in a statement. Dizon also appealed to online shopping sites to take down the advertisements for non-compliant paint to protect consumers from ordering items that could later pose a risk of lead exposure. The group said three variants of F1 Aerosol Paint from the dealer were among those found by the coalition with excessively high lead content. A leaf green F1 spray paint has 56,100 parts per million (ppm) lead, a medium yellow F1 has 50,800 ppm lead, and an orange-yellow F1 has 11,500 ppm lead. The manufacturer and country of manufacture of the products are not written on the label. The group earlier announced its discovery of more non-compliant paint with lead content ranging from 4,500 ppm to 56,100 ppm, which are way above the total lead content limit of 90 ppm under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order 2013-24, or the Chemical Control Order for Lead and Lead Compounds. Dr. Geminn Louis Apostol, an environmental health scientist, explained that “lead paint chips and dust are formed when a surface covered with lead paint ages, peels, and breaks.” Apostol warned that children are exposed to lead when they eat such paint chips or swallow or breathe in lead dust, which can affect their developing brains and cause reduced intelligence, learning ability, and attention span, as well as increased risk of behavioral problems, such as aggressiveness, bullying, and violence. The EcoWaste Coalition has so far discovered 50 leaded aerosol paint being sold by online and offline retailers in violation of the country’s lead paint regulation. None of the non-compliant spray paint found by the group was produced by companies belonging to the Philippine Association of Paint Manufacturers.

Dan Wolbert, Visa country manager for the Philippines and Guam, sees e-commerce in the country to “continue to thrive” even after the pandemic.  “We believe that as more people start using digital commerce and platforms, they will embrace the benefits of shopping online, which will lead to the continued growth of e-commerce,” he said in a briefing Thursday.  Wolbert also expects more businesses to operate on digital platforms as more people turn to online shopping for their needs.  “We continue to see more SMEs (small and medium enterprises) going digital,” he added.  Discussing the results of Visa’s 2020 Consumer Payment Attitudes study, an annual online survey being conducted in several Asian countries, Wolbert said results for the Philippines showed that 52 percent of the about 1,014 Filipinos surveyed nationwide said they shopped online for the first time during the pandemic through mobile apps and websites.  Also, about 43 percent of the respondents said they made their initial online purchase through social media channels.  The bulk of these initial online financial transactions involve food and groceries, bills payments, and pharmaceutical purchases, with one in four Visa cardholders posting his first e-commerce transaction in the first half of 2020.  Mirroring the results of the central bank findings of decreased cash usage during the pandemic, Visa’s Consumer Payments Attitude study showed that 53 percent of the respondents carry cash in their wallets, a drop from around 70 percent level pre-pandemic.  Asked for the reasons for lesser usage of cash for their purchases, the respondents said these e-payments lessen the spread of infection, are more convenient, provide consumers with a financial record, and lower the risk of theft.  In terms of financial transactions that consumers consider can be made completely digital, the respondents cited bills payment, grocery shopping, and overseas travel.  Wolbert said Visa data shows a steady month-on-month rise of contactless transactions in the Philippines since August 2020.  “Even though we’ve made progress in digital payments adoption, there remain huge opportunities for us to encourage more Filipinos to embrace digital payments as we look to expand digital payments acceptance across the country,” he added.

IPOPHL signed the agreement with Lazada and Shopee on Monday to build a stronger industry-wide coordination mechanism against rising online counterfeiting and piracy.  Brand owners such as Unilever Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Philippines, Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc., Castrol Ltd., and Solar Pictures, Inc., as well as business groups Philippine Retailers Association and American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines also signed the MOU.  “Before, we used to experience delays especially on complaints on counterfeits and piracy. But with this MOU, we hope that there will be easier coordination and faster action on the part of platform owners to act on complaints of counterfeiting, not only coming from brand owners but especially from the IPOPHL and DTI (Department of Trade and Industry),” IPOPHL director general Rowel Barba said in an online press conference following the ceremonial MOU signing.  Barba added the agreement provides a self-policing measure that will help in cleaning up the marketplace from bogus products online.  Under the MOU, industry players agreed to use the notice and takedown (NTD) system, wherein rights owners can use the NTD procedures to remove contents on the e-commerce sites that have copyright infringement and other intellectual property violations.  It also drafted a feedback mechanism between e-commerce platforms and rights owners.  “With harmonized procedures and deeper ties with platforms, intellectual property rights holders are better able to notify e-commerce and request for swift actions necessary to prevent counterfeiters and copyright pirates from making a sale,” Barba added.  He said with the massive shift to e-commerce last year due to the pandemic, IPOPHL received the highest number of reports and complaints on intellectual property rights violations done online.  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Office received some 121 reports and complaints last year, apart from over 20,000 complaints at DTI-Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau, he said.  Barba said this initiative also aims to keep the Philippines out of the piracy watchlist that will give confidence to investors to bring in their brands and technology to the Philippines without the fear of their intellectual property rights being violated.  The MOU is an outcome of IPOPHL’s collaboration with the British Embassy in Manila under the UK Prosperity Fund Asean Economic Reform Programme.  In the same event, British Ambassador Daniel Pruce highlighted the need to protect intellectual property rights.  “Intellectual property protection is critical -- it’s critical to encourage innovation,” Pruce said. “So we need to build confidence in online transactions by creating a safe and reliable digital ecosystem which is beneficial for all online players in the marketplace.” (PNA)  "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1131878","title":"Insurance firm exec cites rise of sales through shopping app","date":" February 25, 2021, 6:22 pm","body":"MANILA – Banking on Filipinos love for shopping and the surge in online sales during the pandemic, an executive of Sun Life Philippines remains optimistic of their business as more people realize the importance of insurance.

In a statement Tuesday, Shopee said the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has accelerated growth in the e-commerce industry.  Shopee Philippines director Martin Yu said with the community quarantine measures, consumers have turned to online platforms for their daily needs, entertainment, and interaction.  The previous year also transformed e-commerce as online shopping evolved from a purely transactional experience to a more social experience.  “With advancements in technology, increasing internet penetration, and a fast-growing population of young, tech-savvy youths and middle-income families, we expect e-commerce to play an integral role in the way we live, connect, and do business,” Yu said.  For this year, Shopee expects increased adoption of digital payments among Filipino consumers.  As digital payment is the preferred mode of payment for online transactions, people are expected to become more accustomed to e-payment systems and this will also drive cashless payment offline.  For Shopee, orders completed by using mobile wallets improved by four times.  “In line with movement restrictions and continued social distancing efforts, consumers and businesses have increasingly embraced digital payments for greater convenience and security,” it said.  The growth of e-commerce also drives the development of the logistics sector, Shopee said.  “Logistics will become even more important as consumers continue to rely on e-commerce platforms and develop greater expectations for efficient deliveries. The increase in demand is particularly significant for daily necessities and household essentials. In the Philippines, Shopee saw an 8.5 times increase specifically in food-related items shipped from the Shopee warehouse,” it added.  The online shopping firm said brands and sellers should make effective use of technology to deliver parcels in a timely and cost-effective manner.  Shopee expects brands and sellers to implement innovative retail strategies to continue reaching customers amid community quarantine restrictions.  “At Shopee, we are committed to improving the lives of people in the region using technology. I truly believe that our region has the potential to chart a new path forward in influencing the way businesses and consumers connect. We will continue to innovate to stay ahead of these evolving trends, and to drive the growth of e-commerce in 2021 and beyond,” Yu said.  Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry targets the e-commerce industry to be a PHP850-billion industry by end-2021 under its e-commerce roadmap.  The roadmap also aims to increase e-commerce’s share to the economy from 3.4 percent in 2020 to 4.3 percent this year and adding 250,000 e-commerce enterprises from 2020’s half a million online businesses.

Marlon, a delivery man for almost two years, is from Barangay Calepaan in the same town.  Jhasin May said Marlon was different from her former suitors.  \"Mararamdaman mo talagang yung care niya tapos talagang pursigido po siya. Sobrang effort po siya noong nanliligaw siya sa akin.

On Tuesday, the Covid-19 cases in the world's fourth most populous country rose by 13,094 in the past 24 hours to 1,012,350, the country's Health Ministry reported. To date, more than 28,000 people have died and around 820,000 have recovered from the coronavirus epidemic, showed the official data. Indonesia posts the highest numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the Southeast Asia region. The virus has spread to all the country's 34 provinces with Jakarta being the hardest hit, and East Java the highest death toll. Across the country, a massive Covid-19 vaccination program was launched on Jan. 14 with healthcare workers being the first group to receive the vaccine. The mass vaccination began one day after President Joko Widodo took the first shot of a vaccine developed by China's biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, in a move to convince the public of the vaccine's safety. The President was reportedly scheduled to receive the second jab on Wednesday, Jan. 27. Doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus have been distributed by Indonesia's state-run pharmaceutical company Bio Farma to all the provinces since early January. The government was targeting to deliver 5.8 million doses of the vaccine this month, 10.45 million doses in February again to those regions, and 13.3 million doses in March. The Sinovac vaccine was approved for emergency use by Indonesia's Food and Drug Control Agency (BPOM) following interim results of its late-stage trials in the country. As many as 18 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac have been delivered to Indonesia. Widodo recently said the government had ordered a total of 426 million doses of vaccines from four pharmaceutical manufacturers in different countries. He also said that the government has readied 30,000 vaccinators, 10,000 community health centers (locally known as Puskesmas) and 3,000 hospitals to support the vaccination of at least 181.5 million Indonesian people, which is about 70 percent of the population. The vaccine is free of charge for all Indonesians. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin earlier said the massive vaccination goal would be reached in around 15 months. However, Widodo said at a virtual conference on Monday: \"I have ordered the vaccination to be completed before the end of 2021.\" At present, the government is implementing a new stricter anti-coronavirus policy, locally known as PPKM, on the country's main island of Java and holiday resort island of Bali. Indonesia was recording a greater number of daily cases in recent days. The new public activity restriction requires a workplace to have 75 percent of its staff to work from home, teaching and learning activities to be continued online, shopping centers to open for limited hours, and restaurants to receive customers with no more than 25 percent of their seating capacity. Among the new measures are also more stringent health protocols for construction work activities as well as a 50 percent limit of capacity for places of worship. The policy began to work on Jan. 11 and will last through Feb. 8.

The company thus added buri planters to its existing buri bags and mats to cope with the demand of plant lovers.  Buri are leaves from buri palm that are dried and used to make different handwoven products.  “The local government unit of Bolinao reached out to me for the livelihood of the communities in the town making buri products. So I said, we will introduce in-demand items that they could make and right now buri planters are a hit,” Cayaon said.  Cayaon said the five barangays, including Barangay Salud, Pilar, Victory, Boli, and Enve, at the Santiago Island in this town are producing the buri-made products being sold by her company.  “Each barangay is making a specific design or product for us and we name the products after the barangays. This is also to give livelihood to the community,” she added.  Cayaon said their products are sold through the online shopping platform, Shopee.  “We are also open for resellers in the Visayas and Mindanao areas,” she said.  The buri-made products are also made available through the provincial government of Pangasinan’s ‘Pamanang Yaman, Produktong Pangasinan’ project wherein a truck carrying products of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) from the different towns and cities in the province sell these goods in the province.  Aside from the local market, the company has received orders from Singapore, some inquiries from Turkey, and other countries with the help of Cayaon’s overseas Filipino worker (OFW) friends.  Cayaon herself is an OFW and a travel consultant who is now working from home while managing the business with her husband.  She said her company, which they launched late last year, has introduced eco-friendly products such as reusable bamboo straws, bamboo tumblers, bamboo sunglasses, bamboo toothbrushes, wooden comb or hairbrush, plantable pencils, products in the Maldives, and later on added buri-made products.  “Buri is known (for its) formats and bags but in the Maldives, we are marketing it as a beach or picnic mats. Since I am from Bolinao, I thought of marketing buri as I saw how the foreigners have embraced eco-friendly products,” she added. (PNA) "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1118381","title":"C.

The APEC finance ministers met online against the backdrop of major global economic and health crises and deliberated on fiscal and monetary interventions for mitigating the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  They also endorsed a joint statement reflecting the finance ministers’ views on policy actions that are required to reduce risks and fast-track recovery, according to a written statement issued by the APEC Secretariat, which was received here on Wednesday.  “As the pandemic threatens to overwhelm health and economic systems around the world, member economies have responded with a wide range of measures, including the containment of movement and bolstering healthcare services, while at the same time providing financial support to households and businesses,” said Malaysian Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, who chaired the online APEC finance ministers’ meeting.  Member economies have rolled out significant fiscal stimulus packages for up to 40 percent of the regional economy’s collective growth domestic product, coupled with monetary easing policies to address the impact of the pandemic.  The measures are aimed at protecting employment, supporting health systems and providing direct support to households and businesses, including vulnerable communities and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).  Recognizing the protracted duration of the pandemic, the ministers acknowledged the continued need to advance stimulus measures to help with recovery, while underscoring the importance of improving fiscal sustainability and transparency to support long-term and resilient development and future financing needs.  “Due to the movement restrictions and the need to comply with social distancing requirements, it is interesting to observe how quickly the world (has) embraced digitalization, with more people and businesses turning to online shopping, contactless payment, and online or mobile banking,” Tengku Zafrul said.  At the meeting, APEC finance ministers also encouraged the expansion of financial services through digital tools, highlighting the need to expedite digital adoption and innovation as it allows economies to advance financial inclusion and operate despite social distancing.  Looking ahead, the ministers have been committed to supporting the momentum towards economic recovery by pushing structural reform efforts, keeping markets open, reinforcing global supply chains, investing in high quality infrastructure and health systems, protecting jobs, supporting communities and businesses, and strengthening social protection.

In a statement, AllHome vice chairman Camille Villar said the company’s wide range of products contributed significantly to sales growth despite the imposition of a modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) and general community quarantine (GCQ) in most of its areas of operation.  “During the second quarter of this year, appliances contributed 40 percent of our sales, generated by our tactical pop-up stores placed near All Day Supermarkets. We recognized and capitalized on our AllValue retail ecosystem, of which AllHome is an integral part,” she said.  The company said as consumers are spending more time at home due to the pandemic, their respective incomes were diverted from travel and non-essential entertainment to renovations and passion projects.  “This time presented opportunities to continue and start DIY (do it yourself) home improvement projects, while others bought new kitchen appliances to further culinary hobbies and refrigerator and freezers to assist their business ventures,” it said.  AllHome said it also saw an increase in sales of furniture and equipment for home office and virtual classes with the new normal of work from home arrangements and online classes.  “These shifts in shopper behavior cushioned somehow the disruption caused by the pandemic such as closure of stores and stoppage of construction activities during the ECQ,” it added.  As reported in the shopper survey commissioned by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the upper-middle economic class priority levels on home furnishing remained the same --both online and in-store.  Validating AllHome’s quick pivot to e-commerce during the pandemic, Nielsen Philippines online survey Pandemic Impact on Shopping Behavior fielded in April 2020 at the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) situation showed that ABC1 segments are more positive that online shopping habits will continue post ECQ.  The survey showed that the purchase of appliances and furniture in the ABC demographic remained unchanged by ECQ.  “This community lockdown has pushed AllHome to find new channels to bring its products and services closer to its customers,” AllValue chairman Manuel Villar, Jr. said.

At the Senate committee hearing for the Internet Transactions Act, Lopez said bulk of internet-based businesses was registered during the start of community quarantine.  He said there were 73,276 online businesses that registered between March 16 and August 31.  Registration of online entrepreneurs from January to March 15 this year only reached 1,753, he said.  In July, DTI reported that total online business registration in the first seven months of the year reached 37,000. This means registration of online businesses quickly doubled in one month and hit the 75,000-mark.  While enterprises grow their presence online, complaints related to these also surged in the past months, Lopez said.  From 2,457 complaints related to online transactions in 2019, complaints filed with the DTI in the first eight months of the year reached 12,630, the trade chief added.  “The quadruple increase of this is attributed to the surge of online transactions due to the pandemic. The highest number of complaints, around 8,000, was during the months of April and May when the strictest level of community quarantine was in all areas. Due to the limited movement of people, consumers heavily relied on online shopping,” Lopez said.  He reiterated DTI’s support to pass the Internet Transactions Act to boost the country’s e-commerce law.  “The proposed Act will support the government’s, at least, for the government's role of enabling businesses and protecting consumers,” Lopez said.  Lopez added the bill will enable the growth of e-commerce in the country and support the digitalization of the micro, small, and medium enterprises.  This will also establish a regulatory framework for internet transactions, he said.  “(It’s a) path for DTI to address regulatory gaps in the field of e-commerce, or when it is unclear whether existing regulatory agencies could exercise jurisdiction over emerging businesses,” he said.

Actually, it was nationwide that we saw an increased general usage of the platform. And I think that’s (because) a lot of people (are) turning into the solution to find their basic necessities and needs,” said Shopee Philippines Associate Director Martin Yu during the virtual launch of the Where You Shop Matters partnership with digital payments solution provider, Visa.  He said orders from all over the country “registered (a) pretty steep increase”.  He, however, failed to provide any figures.  He said demand for personal hygiene products and necessities like groceries and diapers was “quite higher”.  The Shopee Philippines-Visa partnership aims to encourage consumers to support local businesses. It is also targeted to boost the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector by helping them to have or to increase their online presence.  Dan Wolbert, Visa Country Manager for the Philippines and Guam, said this tie-up is in line with their small business program to support 10 million small and micro businesses in the Asia Pacific and part of the Visa Foundation’s global commitment to provide USD210 million as Covid-19 emergency support to the small business sector.  He said the tie-up will give discounts to Visa cardholders when they shop at local merchants registered with Shopee.  Wolbert said “the impact of Covid-19 for these businesses along with shifting consumer behaviors to e-commerce reinforced the need for Visa to launch Where You Shop Matters.”  “Furthermore, the partnership with Shopee will help us support thousands of local businesses in the Philippines. We are confident that Filipinos will help support the local economy, especially since our study showed that 95 percent of Filipino consumers will purchase from local retailers to support small business recovery,” he said.  Wolbert said the same study shows that about 77 percent of Filipino consumers consider it a must for local retailers to have online presence.  “The pandemic has accelerated several years’ worth of change into the span of a few months, and this rapid acceleration of the shift to digital payments also means that businesses need to go through a digital transformation and adapt to changing consumers’ behaviors to do well,” he added.  With the tie-up, Visa will be providing local SMEs with a Visa e-Commerce Starter Kit that will help them start, manage, and grow their online storefronts.  Visa has teamed up with BigCommerce, an electronic commerce platform, to help the SMEs start their online store and to give special discount rates for SMEs to sign up with the program.  SMEs will also be given several offers like access to the Office 365 business packages and cashback on Google Ads to help them get their online business up and running.  SMEs with physical stores can order free Visa POS signage to build trust with consumers.  Wolbert said they expect thousands of merchants in Shopee Mall and Shopee Mart to avail of the program and provide discounts to Visa cardholders.  He said they decided to partner with Shopee because it is now a household name, and is among the biggest e-commerce platforms in the country.  “With the pandemic hampering our activities and forcing many of us indoors, the need and usage for Shopee has risen exponentially for both consumers and merchants. With that, we saw a great benefit in partnering with Shopee to help as many buyers and businesses as we can,” he said.  Yu said there are about close to 500,000 active sellers in Shopee to date.  “I do expect a lot of uptake and it’s something that we’re excited about,” he added.

During the virtual launch of the Unionbank-Lazada credit card Friday, Union Bank of the Philippines (Unionbank) senior vice president and card business head Antonio Sebastian Corro said consumers’ behavior changed during the implementation of the community lockdowns because online purchases rose while face-to-face transactions declined.  Corro said there was a significant rise in electronic commerce (e-commerce) for basic goods like food, clothing, and groceries.  He, however, said overall credit card usage is down.  “This is mainly, obviously, because a lot of shops have been closed and second, the biggest factor is travel. There’s no travel. And a lot of usage for cards is really for travel and entertainment…So that is hundred percent down,” he added.  Corro said spending is “really focused domestically”, adding a lot is moving to e-commerce.  During the same briefing, Lazada country chief marketing officer Neil Trinidad said transactions for groceries rose 15 times since the lockdown, and demand for hygiene products like alcohol and household cleaning materials grew 10 times.  Trinidad said demand for electronics, fashion times and general merchandize also posted expansions.  He said consumers are spending and using online transactions “two times more.”  “So it’s really a time of massive acceleration across all categories and I’m really seeing new behaviors starting to shift during this pandemic,” he added.

In a statement, Bagong Henerasyon Rep. Bernadette Herrera said the proposed VAT would be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher prices. Herrera called the move “totally unacceptable at this time of economic uncertainty.” She also warned that aside from consumers, small-time businesses and sellers would also be directly affected by the imposition of a 12-percent VAT on popular online shopping platforms, such as Lazada and Shopee. “It’s not good to impose undue administrative burden associated with VAT on Lazada and Shopee, which have been of great help to small businesses and budding entrepreneurs,” Herrera said. These online shopping platforms, she said, play a big role for consumers as the government promotes contactless transactions amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Herrera noted that these shopping platforms have been a source of alternative livelihood for Filipinos affected by the public health crisis. “Many of our kababayans (who) have lost their jobs due to the pandemic had to resort to selling products and services online just to make ends meet,” she said. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Committee approved a proposal imposing a 12-percent VAT on digital transactions in the country. It seeks to amend Section 105 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) by taxing digital service providers that operate through online platforms. Digital services include online licensing or software, updates and add-ons, website filters and firewalls, mobile applications, video games, and online games, and webcasts and webinars. Also included are the provision of digital content, such as music, files, images, text, and information; online advertising spaces; electronic marketplaces; search engine services; social networks; database and hosting; and online training, among others. Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, panel chair, said no new taxes would be imposed, as he guaranteed exemptions for small businesses. “If your sales are below PHP3 million, you are exempt from paying or filing VAT. If your net income as a sole proprietor is below PHP250,000, you are exempt from paying and filing income taxes. So, the small Facebook online seller will not be taxed. I guarantee you,” Salceda said. Some 77 percent of the projected revenues would come from upper-middle-income families and above, he said, adding that only 0.04 percent of all revenues from this proposal would come from the bottom 20 percent of the population.

The NEDA-led Inter-agency Task Force Technical Working Group for Anticipatory and Forward Planning (IATF-TWG for AFP) launched three separate surveys from April 5-8, 2020, targeting the consumers, agriculture, industry, and services sectors and the general public.  The results of the consumer survey, which generated data from 389,859 respondents, show that more than 50 percent in the non-government sectors experienced a decline in income, largely due to the loss of their source of livelihood.  Moreover, many had difficulty in accessing goods and services because of the closure of business establishments, imposition of early curfews, and lack of public transportation.  “Businesses need to innovate and make full use of technology to resume operations and cater to consumer needs and preferences while still managing risks of Covid-19 infection,” Chua said.  Among the recommended legislative actions contained in the We Recover as One report is to revisit the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 to make it more comprehensive in detailing transactions covered by the law, specifying the rights of consumers and strengthening the penalties imposed on service providers.  “Businesses need to make online shopping easy, affordable, and secure for consumers so that they need not go out to buy what they need and want,” Chua said.  Chua added investments in information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure will also have to be boosted to meet the surge of online transactions and the consumers’ expectations for reliable digital connectivity.  Financial institutions are also encouraged to implement better cybersecurity measures and regulations for both consumers and merchants/establishments.  In addition, changes in consumer preferences such as the rising demand for safe and nutritious food would require strict enforcement of food safety laws, regulations, standards, and sanitation protocols.  To help protect consumers from loss and uncertainty, information, and education campaigns on insurance policies will also be needed.  “The passage of the Financial Consumer Protection Bill will provide the regulatory framework to protect the interest of financial consumers and reinforce confidence in financial markets,” Chua added.

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the Duterte-inspired mask, which is sold for USD32.99 by Caili’s Company through online shopping platform Amazon, only proved that the President “has arrived.” “That means he (Duterte) has arrived. Can you imagine, [he’s] trending all over the world,” the Palace official said in a chance interview with Palace reporters. Online shopping firm Amazon described the masks inspired by Duterte as an “excellent realistic craftsmanship, [and a] quality latex mask.” There are only four masks left, but these are not available for shipping to the Philippines, Amazon noted. Duterte has gained prominence internationally for his massive campaign against illegal drugs. Panelo said the sale of the Duterte masks was not offensive, as it was an indication that the Chief Executive “scaring criminals” is effective. “Hindi [kami offended]. Talagang tinatakot niya ang mga kriminal eh (No, we’re not offended because it’s true that he’s scaring criminals),” he said. “Di ba ganyan naman ang tingin, 'pag ikaw daw ay nagiging topic ng lahat hanggang sa ginagawa kang…, niloloko ka or pinupuri ka, ibig sabihin you have arrived.

Caritas Manila Inc. and online community store “Goodwear” entered into an agreement wherein sellers from the community store may choose to donate their unsold items from the store. “Sellers and buyers from the community store also have an option to provide cash donations to Caritas Manila,” Caritas Manila said in a statement Saturday. It noted that the cooperation between the Church and the private sector aims to help indigents. “This partnership aims to further help the less fortunate to be given more scholarships through Caritas Manila’s Youth Servant Leadership and Education Program or YSLEP, with the help from Goodwear online store’s generosity,” the statement said. “Good Wear shares an advocacy with Caritas Manila and believes that ‘good, mindful style isn’t expensive if it’s shared,’ and it is setting itself as an example of its belief through helping share their products for those in need through the option of donating,” the Caritas Manila added. On the other hand, the company would like to dispel notions that donations or second-items are less worthy than new ones. “Goodwear also aims to break the barriers of a common belief that pre-loved items are less prestigious from brand new products, and focuses on the trend of sustainability through these pre-loved items,” it said.

It is a special day for both the Chinese billionaire and the e-commerce giant he co-founded. Ma, a former English teacher, turns 55 Tuesday, which also marked the 20th anniversary of Alibaba Group and coincided with Teachers' Day. Ma handed over the CEO position in 2013 and made an announcement in an open letter on Sept. 10, 2018, saying that he would step down in a year, with Zhang taking over. Yet his retirement is not a goodbye. He will continue to serve on Alibaba's board of directors until the general meeting of shareholders in 2020 and remain a permanent member of Alibaba's partners and employee No.1. \"Alibaba never belonged only to Jack Ma, but he will always be with Alibaba,\" he wrote in the open letter last September. With a starting fund of 500,000 yuan (about USD70,000), Ma founded Alibaba in a residential community in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, on Sept. 10, 1999, together with his 17 partners. Last month, Alibaba reported a strong revenue growth in the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year ending June 30, with a 42 percent year-on-year increase to 114.9 billion yuan and a 30.95-billion-yuan net profit, up 54 percent compared with the same period of the previous year. As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the e-commerce powerhouse of China, which set the record for the largest IPO when it went public in the United States in 2014, has a market capitalization of more than USD460 billion. Jack Ma's 20 years with Alibaba has ushered in the booming e-commerce industry into China and cultivated the country's online consumption potential which amazed the world. The Singles' Day sales on Alibaba's online shopping platforms, including Tmall and Taobao, reached a record 213.5 billion yuan last year, which was over 4,200 times more than that of 2009 when the company launched the annual online shopping promotion on November 11. Alibaba has also been saving people’s time during the past two decades with unremitting efforts to increase efficiency. The Chinese now can get 200 more things done in 10 minutes than they could 20 years ago. Based on strong computing power, intelligent algorithms, and data analysis and processing ability, the company has provided people with a better and more convenient way to live their lives. To resign as group chairman is a new beginning for both Jack Ma and Alibaba. \"The value of life should be seen in what a man has experienced and not in what he has received,\" Ma said, noting that he is not \"retiring\" but spending more time and energy on education, philanthropy, and environmental protection. Ma's successor, Zhang, explained the three future strategies of Alibaba, which lie in the promotion of global transaction, payment, delivery and entertainment, the creation of new domestic demands and the further application of data and cloud computing. Zhang, the chief designer of Tmall's Singles' Day shopping carnival, joined Alibaba in August 2007 as Taobao's chief financial officer and was appointed as the group CEO in 2015. The company also announced a new vision to celebrate its 20th birthday. It plans to provide services for 2 billion consumers, create 100 million new jobs, and help 10 million small and medium-sized enterprises to achieve profitability. Alibaba's mission to \"make it easy to do business anywhere\" has never been more crystal clear.

This, after Nelson Sarmiento, regional director of CSC 6, said CSC Commissioner Aileen Lizada has caught violations of some public servants at the Iloilo Provincial Capitol and Iloilo City Hall during a surprise inspection on Monday. “Commissioner Lizada held an on-the-spot visit to check what is happening here in the agencies in Iloilo. She saw the practices that we can stop or improve, especially in the frontline services in the city and the province (of Iloilo),” Sarmiento said in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon. The video footage of the CSC shows some windows unmanned at the Iloilo Provincial Treasurer's Office during noon time despite the \"no noon-break policy.\" One of its office desktops was reportedly logged in to an online shopping site. A public servant at the Iloilo City Hall, meanwhile, was caught busy on her mobile phone. Police at the entrance of both the Iloilo Provincial Capitol and the Iloilo City Hall were also busy on their respective mobile phones while on duty. “The purpose is not really meant as a punitive measure, that you will be dismissed or terminated, what’s important is it is a wake-up call for all public servants to improve the way of delivering public service,” Sarmiento added. He said the CSC-6 already communicated with Iloilo Provincial Administrator lawyer Suzzette Mamon to “make them known of the practices so they can take appropriate action.” The commission can look into measures to be done but the CSC-6 will respect the action to be undertaken by the heads of offices of the public servants concerned with the violation, he said. “We will continue to have a direct line, talking with the heads. At their level, we will leave it to them. For us, we will be rendering technical assistance on whatever they need for the improvement of our government,” he assured. Mamon, meanwhile, said Iloilo province will gather the public servants caught, together with the Human Resource HR) office and the General Services Office (GSO) concerned with the offices and security personnel at the Capitol’s lobby. “We will convene together with the HR and the GSO who are in charge of the personnel and the security aspect here in the lobby and the other frontline services to address the matter,” Mamon said in a separate interview. Sarmiento said the Commissioner has also visited national government agencies like the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources but she has not found any violations or wrong practices from among its workers.

A netizen also shared that Shopee has taken away her ticket and claimed that she received a notification because there was a system error. Another fan shared that 10 of them were asked not to join the top 40 spenders who could approach Blackpink for an autograph.

Tugna, during the distribution, said it is imperative to have a PayMaya citizen's ID because it gives users certain benefits.

Diokno said on Thursday.","body":"TAGAYTAY CITY – The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is adopting more budgetary and fiscal reforms for an innovative, effective, and responsive government in the long term, Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno said on Thursday. The reforms include the budget and treasury management system; modernized Philippine government procurement system; and Project DIME or the Digital Imaging for Monitoring and Evaluation, Diokno said during the opening ceremony of the “International Conference on Public Sector Productivity”, hosted by the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) and the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) at the DAP Conference Center here. “This event is very timely given the reforms under the Duterte administration are internally implemented for more innovative, effective and responsive government in the long-term,” he said. The budget chief told some 200 delegates composed of national and local executives, economic and industry experts and public sector analysts that innovation is important. A public sector that will not adapt to changing circumstances will become too rigid, rendering it incapacitated in delivering public goods and services, resolving complex problems, and achieving national development goals, he said. To change the way of doing things, Diokno said the DBM has introduced budgetary and fiscal reforms after assessing that the country’s public financial management (PFM) system is highly fragmented with thousands of spending units. He said the Budget and Treasury Management System is aimed at eliminating multiple stand-alone systems that are used for different PFM activities, including accounting and fiscal reporting and provide real-time online monitoring on budget information. It also aims to standardize and automate processes, formats, and reporting across the national government and consolidate government-wide reports for a systematic, real-time reporting of all revenues, expenditures and liabilities. He said the budget and management department is undertaking to modernize the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (MPhilGEPS) in a bid to set in place a single, central electronic portal that will serve as the primary and definitive source of information for government procurement using cloud-based technology, a reliable system for various users. The MPhilGEPS is the modernized upgraded system that aims to replace the old practice of posting of bids and awards, notices, and uploading of eligibility documents. It includes an e-bidding and e-reverse auction functionality to make procurement more transparent. “To complement this, the new electronic procurement system would now be using a platform for online shopping for common-use supplies and equipment with an e-wallet and virtual store,” he explained. The DBM secretary also introduced Project DIME, which will be adopted to monitor selected high-value government projects by comparing fund use vis-à-vis physical accomplishment to instill transparency and accountability, such the use of drones, LIDARs and satellites. Project DIME was hatched to verify that the people’s money is well-spent in the provision of goods and services and that this will also assist the implementing agencies in the provision of their programs, activities and projects. “We are making headway in training personnel in agencies about Project DIME in utilizing the technologies provided to us by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), specifically on the use of various imaging technologies and geo-tagging applications,” Diokno said. He said the DIME project technology is necessary, especially in overseeing projects in remote areas wherein in-person physical inspection would prove difficult. Citizens in the vicinity are also engaged to ensure implementing agencies are accountable for their unfinished projects because they are encouraged to upload photographs of the projects with the date, time and even the GPS coordinates to the DIME portal. He also assured to institutionalize two budgetary and fiscal reforms through legislative measures, such as the Budget Modernization Bill and the Government Rightsizing Bill that would be permanent before President Rodrigo Duterte’s term ends by 2022. “The budget modernization bill is meant to strengthen the government’s accountability to the people for the use of public funds through greater transparency,” Diokno said. He confirmed that the budget reforms thus far established would be irreversible; set more results-focused budgeting system; strengthen discipline in government to implement the annual budget as legislated; and increases the capacity of government to implement projects, activities and programs. On the other hand, the government rightsizing bill enhances its institutional capacity and delivery of public services. The bill includes the elimination of functions, programs and projects that are already redundant or no longer needed, as well as the abolition of agencies with overlapping or redundant operations and functions. According to Diokno, both bills, which have already passed the third and final reading at the House of Representatives, are in the period of interpellation at the Senate.

(IPC), has partnered with Singapore-based digital media solutions provider Conversant Solutions to offer the country’s first local content service delivery network (CDN) that will reportedly enhance the delivery of Internet-based services by local enterprises. The IPC Contentcast CDN is expected to improve the experience of consumers that depend on content providers such as video streaming, online shopping, logistics and booking services, etc. “The benefit of the service is really for the consumers. It’s the online user’s experience that will be greatly improved. As far as enterprises go, obviously those consumers are customers of enterprises. These enterprises are the ones that actually carry content on their websites and deliver it online,” IPC Director for Marketing and Digital Innovation Nino Valmonte said in a press briefing held in Makati City on Wednesday. “Any company that has a website that operates in such a way that deliver streaming content or online transactions; there’s online retail, websites with government services, logistics, online booking, video streaming, the media can also take advantage of this. Online gaming, anything that involve real-time delivery of content will require this,” he added. IPC sees online startup businesses, such as software developers that create online applications, to significantly benefit from the CDN service. CDN acts as an intermediary between the point of origin of data and an Internet-connected device, wherein companies can deliver digital content, such as websites or videos, faster, safer and more reliably to end-users through a network of servers located across the world. “IPC is able to empower industries more by providing a CDN service that helps organizations establish a reliable global presence by eliminating issues that interrupt long-distance online transactions as well as the delivery of digital content, affecting customer experience and thus, resulting in revenue loss. CDN is a logical step towards becoming a future-ready digital business,” according to IPC Chief Operating Officer David de Leon. The company assures that it will be able to offer continuous and reliable online services to its clients as they it is able to utilize communication facilities of various telcos. “We are telco agnostic. Even if we are owned by PLDT, we are actually allowed to get lines from Globe and other carriers international as well which allows us to offer customers lines which are always up or connectivity that is always up. Since we are subscribed with Globe, PLDT and the others when we detect a single cut in one area we divert the traffic going to another route. This how we can keep the uptime high or 100%; this is how our customers can avail of better uptime from us,” according to De Leon. For his part, Cheong Kong Wai, Conversant Solutions Executive Chairman and CEO, said that the partnership with IPC will enable them to strengthen his company's international presence. “This strategic alliance allows IPC to provide CDN services to its customers by leveraging on the reach and scale of our network, through our SwiftFederation Partners.

We harvest banana, pineapple, cassava, corn, coffee, rice, vegetables. What we lack is technology,\" she pointed out. Mamba said despite their rich natural resources, the people of Apayao cannot market their products well nor attract tourists without \"proper knowledge\" and technology.

Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez met with Zalora co-founder Christoph Barchewitz during the economic cluster’s London Roadshow last month, wherein they discussed the online retailer’s prospects in the country. “We know it’s a long-term horizon,” Barchewitz told Lopez. He also mentioned that the bulk of the online orders in the Philippines came from emerging second and third-tier cities. “[M]ajority of our orders come from outside Metro Manila, which reflects the faster economic growth happening in the regions,” he added. On the other hand, Lopez affirmed the bright prospects for online retail platforms like Zalora in the Philippines with the rising income here, as well as its tech-savvy and young population. “The robust Philippine economy under the Duterte administration leads to a growing middle class that has greater purchasing power. The generally young population is also tech-savvy. This provides the perfect market for Zalora’s brand and its e-commerce business model,” he noted. Meanwhile, e-commerce aggregator iPrice Group reported that international players have driven the online market activity in the Philippines. Its report showed that Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, and eBay were the most visited e-marketplaces in the Philippines in the second quarter of the year. “The rationale behind the dominance of the international players in PH e-marketplace is because Filipinos’ online shopping preference is mainly based on brand familiarity,” the iPrice Group report read. It added that the partnerships of giant mall operators in the country such as SM and Ayala with these leading online retailers amplify the dominance here of these international e-commerce players.

Marjury Lorezco, chief trade and industry specialist of DTI-Pangasinan, said in an interview Friday that consumers must exercise their right to information for their safety and so they could make better choices. “Before buying the product online, one should check or verify if the website is secured and valid before clicking or accepting the offer. Consumers are encouraged also to compare the offered products online to nearby business establishments selling the same product to validate its price and quality,” she said. Lorezco added that her office encourages paying online transactions through cash on delivery (COD) to ensure that the goods bought by the consumer are delivered in good condition. “Consumers doing online shopping should read and take note of the terms and conditions given by the online seller,” she said. Lorezco noted that these rules apply even to consumers buying products in physical stores. “The rights to information and better choices are the most underrated rights of consumers. We all must read labels and the warranty’s terms and conditions since the best way to protect our rights as consumers is to be informed,” she said. DTI-Pangasinan celebrates Consumers Welfare Month this October with the theme, “Making Digital Marketplaces Fairer”, which it kicked off with a fun-run in La Union province. Lorezco said DTI-Pangasinan conducts seminars and fora to strengthen consumers’ awareness of their rights. “Aside from seminars and fora, we will also recognize our Bagwis Awardees. These are business establishments that complied with the requirements of excellence of upholding the rights of consumers while practicing responsible business,” she said. In Pangasinan, eight establishments will be presented the Gold Bagwis Awards (highest excellence award) this year, she said.

Results of the Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes Study, an online survey done in July 2017 and participated in by 500 Filipinos with monthly income of Php12,000 and above, showed that 59 percent of the respondents identified settling their utility bills as the primary reason for using electronic payment, which was unchanged from last year’s survey. Payments for fashion products came in second at 43 percent and was followed by travel services, 40 percent, and beauty products, 36 percent. Citing the study, Visa Country Manager for the Philippines and Guam Stuart Tomlinson, in a briefing Thursday, said more Filipinos are now into online shopping and are actually buying more items than before. “In fact, based on our data, they are spending almost 30 percent more on online purchases as compared to a year ago,” he said, noting that online shopping accounts for about 20 percent of total spending using Visa cards. Tomlinson said the latest survey showed a 15 percent year-on-year jump of digital payments by Filipinos using their cards. He attributed this to technological innovations and consumers’ realization of its benefits on their payment options. Results of the survey also showed that respondents are willing to use other payment methods, with 71 percent aware of contactless payment technology, which allows customers to just wave their cards or put their mobile phones on top of a contactless terminal for any payment. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has instituted a program that will increase digital payment usage to 20 percent to total payments by 2020. Tomlinson said the central bank’s program is helping bring down cost and increases efficiency of payment network. He said the central bank’s goal is a “lofty target” but stressed that all stakeholders are doing their best to contribute to this. He explained that “there are enormous amount of work going on now in the background with the industry to help drive towards that. It’s what the industry is embracing. I’m confident that electronic payments in the Philippines will grow very quickly. On whether we’ll hit 20 percent by 2020 I’m not sure but the industry is vested on making that happen.\" (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1039176","title":"DepEd-10 chief says bidding for P2K razor 'above board'","date":" June 22, 2018, 5:48 pm","snippet":"The head of the Department of Education’s (DepEd) office in Northern Mindanao denied any hand in the purchase of school materials for senior high school classes, even as he dispelled any irregularity in the bidding of razor blades that cost nearly PHP2,000 each.DepEd-10 (Northern Mindanao) Director Allan Farnazo said his office had nothing to do with the procurement of Gillette Vector razors and other supplies needed for the Technical Vocational and Livelihood (TVL) strand of the region’s senior high school students.The items, bought for use during the 2016-2017 school year, were to be used for the Hairdressing NC II course, Farnazo said.According to him, the suggested retail price for a Gillette Vector razor was set at PHP2,000 by the DepEd national office.

Concurrently the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director-General, Pernia said the use of technology to support financial services, also known as Fintech, is expected to bridge the gap between banks and the unbanked and underserved markets. He cited as an example the collaboration of FINTQ with Camalig Bank in Catanduanes wherein digital lending was introduced this year to teachers and personnel of local government units. Pernia said to date, FINTQ and Camalig Bank were able to disburse a loan amount of at least PHP15 million to qualified individuals in several towns of Catanduanes through online transactions, thus eliminating the need to physically appear in the bank. The NEDA chief said digital reforms are also being introduced in the health sector. Pernia noted that the Department of Health’s vision for e-health strategic and framework plan is to have an ICT-enabled Philippine Health System by 2020. This will increase access to quality health care services, as well as real-time and quality health data and information for evidence-based decision making, he said. The NEDA chief further cited data indicating that 47.8 percent of respondents use the internet while 32 percent of households have internet access at home. Based on statistics from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Philippines ranked 89th out of 137 countries worldwide in terms of readiness to support online shopping and other business-to-consumer electronic commerce. “We are confident that we can improve on these figures,” he added.
