Kung meron man mababago rito, ito 'yung paghigpitin at maging masinsin ang pag-i-implement ng seven commandments sa public transport (If there will be changes, it will be the stricter and careful implementation of the ‘seven commandments’ in public transport),” DOTr Undersecretary Artemio Tuazon said in a Laging Handa briefing. Tuazon noted that only authorized persons outside of residence (APOR) such as health workers, and other front-liners are allowed to take public transportation. Public utility buses (PUB), both traditional and modern jeepneys, and UV Express remain allowed to carry 50 percent of its maximum passenger capacity, or one seat apart distancing, with no standing passengers. Only one passenger is allowed on the driver’s row. In addition, all provincial buses are only allowed to offer point-to-point transportation, no picking up passengers on the way to its destination. Taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) are allowed to carry a maximum of two passengers per row with only one passenger allowed on the driver’s row. TNVS are also not allowed to take multiple bookings. Tricycles are only allowed to carry one passenger in their side-car while the seat behind the driver is prohibited for passengers. Trains, meanwhile, are allowed to carry 20 to 30 percent of their maximum passenger capacity. Meanwhile, both domestic and international flights are still allowed for APORs. However, inbound passenger capacity at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) is limited to 1,500 per day. Sea vessels such as roll on/roll off ships also remain in operation for APORs and are allowed to carry 50 percent of its maximum passenger capacity. To help control the spread of Covid-19, the DOTr released its “seven commandments” in public transport. These include the mandatory wearing of a face mask and shield, no talking, no eating, ensuring proper ventilation inside public utility vehicles, regular disinfection, barring symptomatic passengers, and observing proper physical distancing.

On March 16, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte placed the entire Luzon under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to restrict the movement of the population and control the spread of Covid-19 through policies such as physical distancing in public transportation. As the disease continued to spread, public transport through air, sea, and land was eventually suspended in most parts of the country. On June 1, Metro Manila and surrounding areas were placed under general community quarantine which marked the beginning of resumption of public transport in the country. Since then, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and its attached agencies began the gradual resumption of public transportation while following health protocols such as the mandatory wearing of face masks and shields, no talking, no eating, ensuring proper ventilation, regular disinfection, restricting passengers with Covid-19 symptoms, and physical distancing. As of Dec. 22, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has authorized 399 routes with 35,153 units of traditional public utility jeepneys (PUJ), 48 routes with 865 modern PUJs, 35 routes with 4,552 public utility buses (PUB), 41 routes with 1,372 provincial PUBs, 42 routes with 608 point-to-point (P2P) buses, 124 routes with 7,184 UV Express units, two routes with 40 modern UV Express Units, 21,663 taxis, and 25,495 transport network vehicle services (TNVS) all over the country. Train ridership in the National Capital Region (NCR) has also started to pick up in November through eased physical distancing requirements and improvement in rail services. From December 1 to 27, data from the DOTr showed a total train ridership of 7,858,367 of the four train services in NCR -- the Light Rail Transit Line 1 (LRT-1), the Light Rail Transit Line 2 (LRT-2), the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3), and the Philippine National Railways (PNR). This, compared to total ridership of 30,687,278 for the four rail services from June 1 to November 30. Air travel in the country -- both international and domestic -- has also resumed with strict requirements such as mandatory RT-PCR testing, quarantine, and other documentation. As of Dec. 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) said a total of 43 airports have been cleared by their respective LGUs for commercial operation but still subject to prior coordination and approval. These are Antique Airport, Bacolod-Silay Airport, Basco Airport, Bohol-Panglao International Airport, Borongan Airport, Busuanga Airport, Butuan Airport, Calbayog Airport, Catarman Airport, Catbalogan Airport, Caticlan Airport, Cauayan Airport, Clark International Airport, Cotabato Airport, Davao International Airport, Dipolog Airport, Dumaguete Airport, General Santos Airport, Guiuan Airport, Hilongos Airport, Iloilo International Airport, Jolo Airport, and Kalibo International Airport; Others include Laguindingan Airport, Laoag International Airport, Legazpi Airport, Maasin Airport, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, Marinduque Airport, Masbate Airport, Naga Airport, Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), Ormoc Airport, Ozamiz Airport, Pagadian Airport, Palanan Airport, Romblon Airport, San Jose Airport, Siargao Airport, Surigao Airport, Tacloban Airport, Virac Airport, and Zamboanga International Airport. Six airports remain closed by their LGUs: Camiguin Airport, Puerto Princesa International Airport, Roxas Airport (permits exceptions through special clearance), Tuguegarao Airport, San Vincente Airport, and Sanga-Sanga Airport. Maritime transportation in the country continues to decline based on data from the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) as of Dec. 17. From a weekly average of 869 passenger ships and 372 cargo ships operational from May 29 to June 4, MARINA has recorded a decline to 484 passenger ships and 324 cargo ships from Dec. 4 to Dec. 10; and 466 passengers ships and 331 cargo ships from Dec. 11 to Dec. 17. Transport programs against Covid-19 To ensure continued operation of essential services while controlling the spread of the pandemic and support to the Filipino people, the DOTr and other government agencies worked together through programs against Covid-19. To help support drivers and operators who suffered through declining revenue due to restrictions in public transport during the pandemic, the LTFRB launched the Service Contracting Program to provide them with additional benefits aside from their regular income. As of Dec. 10, it said a total of 11,450 drivers of public utility vehicles (PUV) have joined the program throughout the country. In addition, cash subsidies have been provided to PUV drivers and operators. As of Dec. 4, the LTFRB said about PHP802 million in cash subsidies have so far been distributed to operators of 123,517 PUVs -- 87.52 percent of the PHP1.158 billion direct cash subsidy budget of the \"Bayanihan to Recover as One Act.\" The DOTr and its attached agencies provided free transportation to health workers in the NCR and eventually in other parts of the country through the ‘Free Ride for Health Workers Program.’ As of Dec. 28, the program has provided a total of 1,981,684 free rides -- 551,196 in NCR-Greater Manila Area and 1,430,488 in the rest of the country. To assist overseas Filipino workers (OFW) who need to undergo quarantine, One-Stop Shops (OSS) were established at the NAIA Terminals 1, 2, and 3. From April 21 to December 27, these OSS have served a total of 457,828 OFWs, aside from 114,935 overseas Filipinos or tourists. Some of these OFWs were also helped through the government’s ‘Hatid-Tulong’ Program to transport those stranded in Metro Manila and other areas to their home provinces. As of Dec. 17, the program has assisted a total of 373,293 OFWs through land, air, and maritime travel. To safeguard the country’s position as one of the top providers of manpower in the shipping industry and help support the country’s economy, the DOTr, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and their attached agencies established six crew change hubs in the country. These crew change hubs, which house OSS for arriving and disembarking seafarers, are located in Batangas, Subic, Bataan, Port of Manila, Cebu, and Davao. As of Dec. 11, these crew change hubs and their OSS have served a total of 1,409 ships and 23,609 seafarers, both foreign and domestic. Mandatory cashless transactions in tollways To curb the further spread of Covid-19 in both public and private road transport, the DOTr required mandatory cashless transactions in Luzon tollways through radio frequency identification (RFID) tags beginning Dec. 1. However, the program caused heavy traffic in some parts of these tollways due to problems with RFID scanners, proximity of RFID installation areas to tollgates, among others. In a virtual hearing with the Senate Public Services Committee on Dec. 17, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade laid out his orders to the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) and tollway operators to address these problems. This includes the conversion of emergency signage to cash signage, transfer or reposition of RFID installation and reloading sites to gas stations or larger areas, putting a designated lane for RFID and cash lanes, allowing emergency vehicles to pass through any lanes, studying the possibility of removing barriers in toll gates, placing separate RFID and cash lanes in small toll plazas, and increasing the wattage specification for RFID sensors. NAIA rehabilitation Following repeated calls from civilian groups for the rehabilitation of NAIA, Tugade said the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) will continue its ongoing rehabilitation and reconstruction of the NAIA despite the revocation of Megawide’s “Original Proponent Status,” the contractor of the PHP107.54 billion NAIA Comprehensive Capacity Enhancement Project. He said the “procedural rights” of Megawide will also be recognized, allowing the contractor to appeal the revocation. Metro Manila Subway The construction of the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP) has continued throughout the year despite limitations brought by the pandemic. On Dec. 21, the DOTr signed contract package 107 of the MMSP to order a total of 240 train cars for the subway with a total approved cost of almost PHP367 billion. In September, the DOTr showcased six tunnel boring machines (TBM) manufactured in Japan that will be used to dig through the partial operability section of the project -- from Valenzuela City to North Avenue in Quezon City. It said the TBMs will arrive in the country by January or February 2021. Despite the continued challenges brought by the pandemic, these are only a few of many ongoing government projects in transportation. With no end in sight yet for pandemic, restrictions in transport services in the country continue to ease with the hope of continued economic recovery.

Villanueva said the MOA aims to contain the emerging trend where, in some instances, accredited Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) and delivery service drivers have unknowingly became conduits of drug trade by accepting transport and delivery services from persons engaged in illegal drug trafficking “The signing of the agreement is an opportunity for PDEA and Grab Philippines to formally strengthen their partnership in the fight against illegal drug trafficking, and closer coordination and cooperation in the interception of illegal drugs,\" Villanueva said. Grab Philippines said it supports PDEA’s campaign against illegal drugs by helping interdict and prevent the transport and delivery of packages containing illegal drugs and controlled precursors and essential chemicals, or CPECs, using TNVS and delivery services. It will also assist PDEA in the investigation on reports on suspected delivery packages, design mechanisms where the items for delivery are properly recorded and visible to the driver. Grab will also implement policies for a drug-free workplace in its premises, as well as ensure that the accredited delivery service drivers are not involved in illegal drug activities.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has endorsed the drafting of an “appropriate Congress resolution” on resuming pilot studies on motorcycle taxis. “Hindi kasi pupuwede naman na mag-operate na walang franchise pero kung papayagan naman po ng Kongreso through a resolution yung continuation ng pilot study prior to the approval of a franchise eh mapapayagan naman po sila (They can’t operate without a franchise but if Congress allows them through a resolution calling for the continuation of the pilot study prior to the approval of the franchise, they will be allowed),” he said in an interview over CNN Philippines’ The Source. However, Roque said the “best solution” is to pass the law granting a franchise to motorcycle taxis. “The best solution of course is for Congress to pass the franchise as law already but we leave that to the sound judgement of Congress,” he said. Last week, Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Hope Libiran said motorcycle taxis would not be back on the streets unless Congress passes a law granting their franchise. The Motorcycle Taxi (MC Taxi) Technical Working Group (TWG) has completed the pilot run of MC Taxis back in March. The Department of Transportation said it will support a Congress resolution that will serve as legal basis to allow the resumption of motorcycle taxis’ operation. One-seat apart Roque also defended anew decision of the Cabinet to approve the “one-seat apart” policy among commuters in public transport amid the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. He said the lack of public transport remains a problem for commuters who need to physically report for work. “Bagamat 50 percent bukas ang ating ekonomiya under GCQ…e kulang po ang transportasyon. Thirty percent lang yung nabibigay nating transportation doon sa 50 percent na workforce na pumapasok na (Even if 50 percent of our economy is open under GCQ, we lack transportation. Only 30 percent of our transportation is available for 50 percent of the workforce physically reporting for work),” he said. As long as health and safety protocols are observed, Roque said commuters can prevent transmission of Covid-19. The Cabinet also approved the recommendation to expand rail capacity to 30 to 50 percent; expand the number of provincial buses, motorcycle taxi, shuttles, and transport network vehicle service (TNVS), and accelerate use of service contracting to expand bus and jeep services. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board opened 44 additional routes of the traditional public utility jeepney (PUJs) and allowed 4,820 more traditional PUJs to ply their routes in Metro Manila.

This was after President Rodrigo Duterte and his Cabinet decided to approve the recommendations proposed by the economic development cluster to aid economic recovery. Tugade directed the agencies to adhere to the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) Operation Plan AIR (Add routes/PUVs, Increase speed/capacity, Reduce travel time) to serve as the baseline in formulating and implementing transport initiatives to increase public transport capacity, especially while the government is aiming to revive the country’s economy amid the pandemic and under the \"new normal\". He ordered the immediate adoption of the “one-seat apart” rule to increase the present capacity in PUVs and gradually increase capacity or allow sitting together, provided that plastic barriers are placed in between passengers, or that UV lights are used. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will issue a clarificatory memorandum circular explaining in detail the \"one-seat apart\" rule and the use of measures to increase capacity while ensuring the safety of passengers inside PUVs. Tugade also ordered the LTFRB to open up more public transport routes and authorize more roadworthy units, such as provincial and city buses, as well as public utility jeepneys (PUJs). He directed the agency to allow the operation of additional transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and taxis. Under the current policy, there is no cap on the number of additional taxis and TNVS units to be deployed so long as they are accredited by the transport network corporations (TNCs) for purposes of contact tracing, are authorized to operate (with appropriate CPC or PA), and are compliant with public health protocols set by the inter-agency task force addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Return of motorcycle taxis Regarding the clamor for the return of motorcycle taxis on the streets, Tugade reiterated that the DOTr would fully support this, provided that a Congress resolution is passed to serve as the department’s legal basis for its implementation. \"The DOTr recognizes the role of motorcycle taxis in transporting our commuters to their destinations. Malaking tulong ho ito lalo na ngayong limitado pa din ang kapasidad ng pampublikong transportasyon. Kaya nga ho ba (This is a big help, especially now that capacity is limited in public transportation. That's why), as long as there is a Congress Resolution, which will be our legal basis to allow the operation of MC Taxis, we will fully support this. We will abide by the directive of Congress and the IATF on the health and safety protocols,\" he said. Easing processes on shuttle service use To add more transport service for employees and workers, Tugade ordered the LTFRB to speed up the processes needed for the deployment and operation of shuttle services. \"Noon pa man, binigyan ko na ng direktiba ang LTFRB na dapat pabilisin ang proseso. Ayoko ng may prosesong matagal at manghihingi pa ng permit. Nasa pandemic tayo (I have ordered the LTFRB to hasten the process. I don't want a delayed process that needs permit. We're in a pandemic). We should just observe the basic protocols,\" he said. To recall, the LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2020-039 dated last August 17, which exempts shuttle services for transport workers during the general community quarantine (GCQ) from securing franchise or Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), so long as they fall under the exemption on the following conditions: 1) Vehicles must be secured by a Contract of Lease for at least three months but not exceeding Dec. 31, 2020, and the contract must at all times be readily available for presentation during on-road operations or as the board deems necessary; 2) Vehicles must be used and driven by the lessee or his/her authorized representatives; 3) Vehicles must be currently registered and covered by a comprehensive passenger insurance policy; and 4) Vehicles subject to the lease contract shall bear the proper marking of the company that it is servicing for identification. For PUV operators contracted by private companies for shuttle service, they may apply for special permits, which is expedited through the LTFRB’s online facility. The permit is issued within the same day of the filing of application provided all requirements are submitted online. Service contracting Meanwhile, to give transport operators and drivers a steady source of income while improving the commuters’ riding experience, Tugade ordered the LTFRB to accelerate the implementation of service contracting for buses and PUJs this month. According to the implementing guidelines on the PUV service contracting program released by the LTFRB last October 8, a “Net Service Contracting scheme” will be implemented, under which payments will be calculated based on rates set for the distance and routes that drivers will be covering over a particular period. In this scheme, the government will pay drivers a subsidy that will cover the cost of service rendered per kilometer by their buses and jeepneys plying on specific routes, based on a set of performance indicators. Expanding rail, maritime, air transport capacity Aside from PUVs, Tugade ordered the rail sector to increase passenger capacity by 30 percent to 50 percent. In the maritime and aviation sectors, he directed agencies to allow more roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ferries and more flights to cater to passengers. 7 commandments To curb the spread of Covid-19 amid these developments, Tugade ordered the transport sector to ensure the strict enforcement of the seven commandments inside public transport, as recommended by health experts: 1) Wear face masks and face shields; 2) No talking and making phone calls; 3) No eating; 4) Keep PUVs well-ventilated; 5) Conduct frequent disinfection; 6) No passengers with Covid-19 symptoms would be allowed inside public transportation; and 7) Observe appropriate physical distancing (\"one-seat apart\" rule).

In a Palace press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said this was among the economic cluster's recommendations “unanimously” approved during the 48th Cabinet meeting on Monday night. “Inaprubahan po ng gabinete, na sa pampublikong transportasyon, one-seat-apart na po ang distansya (The Cabinet approved that in public transportation, one-seat apart is the distance),” he said. Roque said the seating capacity will gradually increase or seating together with plastic barrier or use of UV light will also be allowed. “Magsimula sa pagkakaroon ng one-seat apart at paunti-unting pataasin ang seating capacity o payagan na makaupo na magkatabi basta may plastic barrier (From one-seat apart, the seating capacity will be gradually increased, allowing passengers to sit next to each other as long there is a plastic barrier),” he said. Roque said the one-seat apart policy will replace the \"one-meter\" physical distancing policy among commuters previously being implemented in public transport. He explained that the decision to replace the policy was based on studies made by former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit which were submitted to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). “As far as reducing the one meter distance is concerned, it was arrived at as a matter of consensus and it was based on science, it is based on studies which Dr. Dayrit presented to the IATF,” Roque said. The one-seat apart policy, he said, will take effect immediately after publication on the Official Gazette. There is no need to issue an IATF resolution to enable its effectivity, he added. According to Roque, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) will issue guidelines on the one-seat apart policy. “I’m sure DOTr will issue the final guidelines pero (but) one-seat apart is one-seat apart po, hindi pupuwedeng magkakatabi (they can’t sit next to each other),” he said. He said the need to revitalize the economy is the main reason behind the Cabinet’s decision to approve the one-seat apart policy. “The fact that we needed really to open the economy because the lockdowns have been causing poverty and malnutrition on the part of our children and the fact that we have the seven commandments,” he said. The seven commandments for all public transport, he said, are wearing of face masks; wearing of face shield; no talking and no eating; adequate ventilation; frequent and proper disinfection; no symptomatic passengers, and appropriate physical distancing. Roque said the Cabinet also approved the recommendation to expand rail capacity to 30 to 50 percent; expand the number of provincial buses, motorcycle taxis, shuttles, and transport network vehicle service (TNVS), and accelerate use of service contracting to expand bus and jeep services.

In a statement Thursday, DSWD-7 assistant director for operations Shalaine Marie Lucero said the drivers were endorsed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB-7) and whose families were eligible to receive cash aid based on SAP guidelines. They have not yet also claimed assistance from any government agencies and have not been included in the first tranche and waitlisted of the SAP. Eligible PUV drivers in Cebu endorsed by LTFRB received PHP12,000 for their family while those drivers in Bohol and Negros Oriental claimed PHP6,000. Lucero said all PUV drivers endorsed by LTFRB have undergone a deduplication process to get a clean list for assessment and verification on the field for their eligibility. She added that they were certified by LTFRB whether they were drivers transport network vehicle service (TNVS), taxi, jeepney, and tricycles that have associations or cooperatives. “The DSWD-7 coordinated with LTFRB-7 on the findings and issues encountered such as drivers were not found in the area, already part of the Pantawid Pamilya, first tranche, and waitlisted, as well as those ineligible and have already received assistance from different NGA (national government agencies,” Lucero said. Those reported lists of unlocated drivers in the area and those who have no data from LGUs will be sent back to LTFRB for the agency to trace their whereabouts. Lucero added that there might be additional drivers to receive the emergency subsidy of SAP if they are traced and will be found to be eligible for the program. To facilitate cash aid disbursement, Lucero said DSWD and LTFRB inked a memorandum of agreement with the GCash, a financial service provider, to bring the aid digitally to 1,710 PUV drivers with mobile numbers while those 95 drivers who were not included in the FSP received their assistance through direct payout from the agency.

Ronabelle Ann Tadic, a transport network vehicle service (TNVS) driver and Social Amelioration Program (SAP) beneficiary, found that she received two more batches of the cash assistance apart from the aid intended for her family. She returned it to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in mid-August. “Nakatanggap na po kasi ako ng para sa akin, sobra na po yung nakuha ko (I already got my aid but they sent me more),” she said in a Viber message on Tuesday. Tadic’s honesty was featured on DSWD’s uSAP Tayo episode on Tuesday. She is one of the SAP beneficiaries who were cited by the agency for their honesty and empathy to other beneficiaries who have not received their aid yet. She returned some PHP16,000 worth of aid to the central office, knowing the money can lighten the burden of another suffering family. “Sinauli ko po ito dahil alam ko naman na hindi ito para sa akin na, at alam ko rin po na may iba pang nangangailangan ng ayuda.

I am grateful for the financial assistance that my family received. We used it to pay for the bill, buy our food),” she said. Being jobless during the pandemic, the beneficiary, who was also a single parent, said she knows how hard it is for some families to wade through these trying times. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has limited the number of TNVS drivers on the roads. The figure gradually increases as the quarantine measures ease. Voluntarily waived cash aids DSWD spokesperson Irene Dumlao said the agency is aware that the drivers were one of the most affected sectors, that is why they were prioritized in their list. Dumlao said on Wednesday that many beneficiaries came forward to return the extra cash aid they received. Some beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) have returned duplicate cash assistance that they got from other government agencies who were also giving out financial aid. Vilma Millamina, Jocelyn Colingan, and Maureen Kiloyen were among the 4Ps beneficiaries from Baguio City who willingly returned the PHP5,000 cash assistance they received under the COVID Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP) of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), while Imelda Sibayan, also from Baguio City, willingly returned the PHP4,150 aid she received under the second tranche of the SAP implemented by DSWD. The 4P’s beneficiaries received PHP3,650 to PHP6,650 SAP cash aid per month for two months as a top-up amount added to their regular cash grants and rice allowance. “This meant they are no longer eligible to receive cash aid from other government agencies,” she said in a statement. In a previous report, the agency announced that they have trimmed down recipients of SAP 2 from 17 million to only 14.1 million families after some reassessment. On July 26, DSWD Undersecretary Rene Glen Paje said 58,725 families have voluntarily returned their cash aid thinking that others might need it more than them. DSWD is yet to provide a new figure of the returned cash aids from July 27 to present. Current SAP 2 figure As of 4 p.m. August 25, the agency has so far completed their payouts of the second tranche of SAP (SAP 2) to more than 13.55 million family beneficiaries with PHP81.1 billion worth of aid. “Patuloy ang pamamahagi ng emergency subsidy sa mga benepisyaryo ng SAP, kabilang ang mga “waitlisted” o karagdagang mga pamilya (The distribution of emergency subsidy to SAP beneficiaries including the people on the waitlist is still ongoing),” they said on Wednesday. SAP is a product of Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act of 2020, intended to help 18 million Filipino families who were most affected by the series of lockdown measures of the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Bautista, during a Cabinet meeting, reported to President Rodrigo Duterte that the SAP has a total budget of PHP207.6 billion. “[From DSWD, we poured in] PHP10.6 billion from the realigned regular budget in order to support the necessary budgetary requirements of the program,” he said during his presentation. The total budget is broken down by the PHP197-billion fund rolled out by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). It was released in three tranches on April 2, April 16, and June 24. In a viber message, DSWD spokesperson Irene Dumlao told reporters that they are now 93-percent complete in the distribution to some 14.1 million family beneficiaries. Even with the delayed timeline, Bautista assured the public that they will complete the distribution to provide help to low-income family beneficiaries who were identified by their local government units (LGUs) as the hardest-hit sector of the public health crisis due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “The DSWD, along with its payout partners, both in direct and digital schemes have been working hard to secure 100-percent accomplishment rate,” he said. DSWD Undersecretary Rene Glen Paje said during Tuesday’s uSAP Tayo virtual conference they have delivered PHP79,812,223,150 to 13,364,913 family beneficiaries nationwide as of August 25. Of this number, 1,386,121 were Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4P’s) beneficiaries; 5,791,600 were low-income and non-4p’s beneficiaries; 3,162,312 were waitlisted, low income, and non-4p’s beneficiaries; 1,757,789 were waitlisted family beneficiaries from areas that were declared under the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ); 150,695 were transport network vehicle service (TNVS) and public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers; and 33,336 were drivers from ECQ areas. Meanwhile, during the Cabinet meeting, President Duterte announced that he would take accountability for the fund released by the government during the pandemic. “I will hold myself responsible for this sole and solemn duty of answering for and on behalf of the executive department of all the funds that were spent in the fight against Covid,” he said. The National Task Force for Covid-19 will provide a detailed report on how all funds were spent and also the intended purpose, the President said. Certain measures will be put in place to ensure transparency in government expenditures, he added. The Bayanihan to Heal As One Act has given the national government powers to provide emergency subsidies to low-income families. The Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 of 2020 stated that the subsidy shall amount to a minimum of PHP5,000 to a maximum of PHP8,000 a month for two months to provide for basic food, medicine, and toiletries.

In a news release, the DOTr said the Mega Manila Consortium, one of the two consortiums operating the EDSA Busway route launched Wednesday three units from HM Transport Inc., with both left-side and right-side passenger doors. Seven more units with the same configuration will be deployed next month. Meanwhile, RRCG Bus will also add more left-entry buses next week. DOTr Assistant Secretary for Road Transport and Infrastructure Steve Pastor said the arrangement between the agency and among private bus companies for the use of such units was created to ensure safe service for the commuting public. “These bus units will better accommodate commuters who will now be using the new loading and unloading bus stops located in the innermost lane of Edsa. Aside from the installation of canopies and lighting fences, we have also placed concrete barriers and steel separators on Edsa’s median lanes to ensure utmost safety and comfort,” Pastor said. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chairman Martin Delgra III reported a total of 3,662 units operating and opened 31 traditional city bus routes in Metro Manila. Alongside the operation of PUBs, he said the LTFRB has opened other routes and approved more units of public transportation that includes modern and traditional public utility jeepneys (PUJS), UV Express (UVE) vehicles, Point-to-Point Buses (P2Ps), Transport Network Vehicles services (TNVS), and taxi services. “For modern PUJs, 716 units have begun operating in 45 routes; while for traditional PUJs, the LTFRB has allowed the operation of an additional 4,498 units in 60 routes. This brings the total number of authorized traditional PUJs to 12,443 in 126 routes,” Delgra said. An additional four routes with 641 units have been authorized for UV Express, which totals to 1,621 authorized UVEs currently plying in 51 routes. Some 364 units of P2P buses are operating in 33 routes, with 20,493 taxis and 23,776 TNVS ferrying passengers in the metro, Delgra added. All units of road transport are still required to strictly follow the existing health guidelines and safety protocols provided by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-IED) to help curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019. All forms of road public transportation will follow a limited passenger capacity of 50 percent while maintaining physical distancing and sanitary practices in their vehicles. The DOTr is ensuring that law enforcers and on-ground marshals are monitoring all public transport vehicles. Violators face penalties, Pastor said. Commuters are now required to wear a face shield on top of their face masks in order to be permitted to travel—be it on land, sea, or air— as mandated by the newly issued Memorandum Circular No. 2020-14 of the DOTr. The new requirement took effect upon allowing public transportation anew last August 18. Aside from Metro Manila, the provinces of Laguna, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, the cities of Iloilo, Cebu, Lapu Lapu, Mandaue, Talisay, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu province are now also placed under general community quarantine.

In Cebu City, however, LTFRB-7 regional director Eduardo Montealto Jr., on Wednesday said his office has not approved yet the permits for TPUJs as the existing number of buses and modern PUJs (MPUJ) plying the city routes is enough to cover the limited number of passengers due to ongoing general community quarantine (GCQ) here. His reaction came after passengers blamed Mayor Edgardo Labella for the long queue at the Bulacao area due to lack of public transport going to the city. He explained that the early morning long queue of passengers in Barangay Bulacao here “is a normal situation mostly every Monday”, stressing that \"40 buses deployed in the area can only accommodate for up to 1,000 pax” in addition to the delayed turnaround due to numerous private cars during the rush hours from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. Montealto said the regional office of the LTFRB is complying with the guidelines issued by the Board through Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2020-017 which covers public transportation for areas under GCQ. \"The mayor does not decide for the PUJs,\" he added. “Under this MC, the LTFRB regional office shall be the one to identify the specific routes to be operational under the period of GCQ following the hierarchy of service to operate. For identified routes, buses shall be the preferred units of transport service followed by tourist bus, Omnibus Franchise Guidelines (OFG)-compliant or modern PUJs, UV express, then the traditional PUJ already consolidated as cooperative or corporation and the last is tourist van,” he said. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure proper observance of minimum health protocols, which Montealto said, can be easily observed in bigger PUV units such as buses and modern PUJs. Because of this, the LTFRB-7 approved 139 special permits for buses and MPUJs that are plying different routes in Cebu City while 275 of the same kinds of public transport are permitted to ply inter-city routes between the cities of Cebu, Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu, he said. Also, the agency allowed 162 buses to transport passengers from different northern towns and another 310 buses from southern towns in the province who are working in the city, and vice versa. In addition to this, four units of UV (utility vehicle) Express are permitted to fetch passengers. Montealto said the city now has an existing 3,556 taxi units and 250 cars servicing passengers under the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) using mobile app platform in booking for rides. “Most of the companies are commissioning TTS and TB (tourist transport service and tourist bus) as shuttle service for their workers/employees. This is one of the factors that lessen passenger demand on commuting with PUVs,” he told the Philippine News Agency. He said the agency has recorded 1,228 TTS and 81 buses being utilized by companies in transporting their employees from their homes to the workplace and are covered with special permits from the government.

The guidelines, contained in a 12-page memorandum issued by Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, covered safety hours, transportation, businesses allowed, and the mandatory reporting of symptomatic persons and suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Based on the guidelines, the city’s public safety hours shall remain from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. However, barangays may request the city government for authority to impose a stricter curfew “on a case-to-case basis.” Each barangay may issue up to two quarantine passes per household and must be presented upon entering an establishment. Company identification cards may also be presented. Mass gatherings for leisure or non-essential purposes shall be prohibited while religious gatherings are again allowed but only up to 30-percent capacity of the venue. Public transportation shall be allowed but on a limited basis, and seat markers, as well as wearing of face mask and face shields will be required. However, the guidelines state that “prior to operating, PUV drivers are encouraged to undergo health screening at any health center to determine whether they should be tested for Covid-19 and to ensure that they are fit to work.” Jeepney and bus operations may be allowed at 50-percent passenger capacity for specific routes allowed by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), while UV Express must not exceed two passengers per row seated one seat apart. TNVS and taxis may operate, provided they are capable of contactless transactions, according to MC No. 2020-018 or the guidelines for operations of TNVS and taxis during the period of GQC issued by the LTFRB. Tricycles, pedicabs, and e-trikes may operate on the condition that they only have one passenger per vehicle with no back rider. Permitted businesses under the GCQ, as defined by the Inter-Agency Task Force, such as food, beverage, water, medical, and health, and essential retailers may fully operate. General manufacturing and production, malls and shopping centers, and barbershops and salons will have limited operations with no more than 50 percent of their workforce reporting on-site. Furthermore, leisure and entertainment centers, gyms, fitness studios, and other indoor sports facilities, massage parlors, and tattoo shops are still not allowed to operate under the GCQ. Although gyms and fitness studios are closed, non-contact sports are allowed like golf, tennis, and badminton. Outdoor sports facilities, sports clubs, golf clubs, and parks are also allowed to operate for limited outdoor activities. Businesses with 10 or more employees should have a Covid-19 response plan and contact tracing should be immediately conducted in case of any suspected, probable, or confirmed Covid-19 case among their employees. Companies are also obliged to report symptomatic and suspected or confirmed cases to the Quezon City Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (CESU). “To the extent feasible, each barangay and neighborhood (purok, sitio, etc.) should have its own quarantine facilities for isolation of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases. The concerned barangay or area should report the establishment of such a facility to the CESU for coordination,\" it added. Belmonte said the city government may sanction any establishment that conceals suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases or hinders the city’s Covid-19 response teams or contact tracers in the performance of their duties. “Sanctions may include, without limitation, suspension, or revocation of business permits and the filing and prosecution of criminal charges under applicable laws,” the memo states.

With the reopening of public transportation services during the GCQ, the DOTr reminds passengers that strict health and safety protocols will be enforced to help curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Commuters are reminded that the “no face mask and no face shield, no ride” policy will be strictly enforced in all sectors of public transportation — road, railways, maritime and aviation — as mandated by DOTr and which has been effective since Aug. 15 in areas where public transport is allowed. Strict physical distancing will also be implemented onboard public utility vehicles, terminals, in rail line facilities, and aboard trains to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. Passengers must follow the marking in PUV terminals, stations, and onboard PUVs and trains. Train marshals and law enforcers will guide and ensure that the protocols are being observed. Commuters are also encouraged to practice regular sanitation and disinfection procedures, using footbaths, available wash stations, and hand sanitation supplies. Passengers will also have to accomplish contact tracing and health declaration forms before entering the rail stations and terminals. All passengers will have to undergo body temperature checks before entering the terminal and stations, as well as boarding vehicles and trains. For the MRT-3, LRT Line 2, and PNR, passengers with a body temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius and above will not be allowed to enter the rail station, while for LRT1, the threshold is 37.6 degrees Celsius. At the PNR, the strict health checks will be enforced in its stations and trains. Once inside the station, passengers will proceed to a sanitation station and their body temperature will be checked using a CCTV-based mass thermal scanner. All passengers are enjoined to refrain from talking and using cell phones and other communications device while inside the train to avoid the spread of respiratory droplets which may carry the virus. To help protect the health of the riding public, strict health and safety measures are being implemented by transport authorities such as the wearing of full personal protective equipment for front-line employees; disinfection of trains at every half-loop, and of vehicle units after every trip or every two hours; disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in stations and terminals, and onboard trains and PUV units; and encouraging the use of contactless/online payment systems.

He said both the UV Express vans and PUJs will be tapped if the current modes of public transportation are not enough to send commuters to their respective destinations. “It's the convenience of the riding public that is being considered. If what we have is not enough then it will surely be allowed. I think the UV Express stand a better chance than jeepneys,” he said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel’s Headstart.

Earlier, Roque said PUJs may no longer be allowed to resume operations if other modes of public transport will be enough to service commuters. He said UV Express vans and PUJs are at the bottom of the transport hierarchy, which means they can service fewer passengers and they will only be allowed once the existing transport modes continue to be insufficient. Meanwhile, Roque also denied that the decision of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to limit vehicles on the roads is anti-poor since it favors those who own private cars. “The priority of the IATF is still upholding public health. And that is why as far as public transportation is concerned, it’s not just cars that are being given priority,” he said. He said that also allowed are the country’s railway systems, buses, taxis, transport network vehicle services (TNVS), shuttle services, point-to-point buses, and bicycles. “It’s not true that the favored mode of transportation is private because we all know that the majority of people still don’t have access to private transportation. So I don’t think that is the case, that it is not pro-poor,” he added. As for sports, Roque denied that the IATF also allowed only pro-rich sports such as golf to resume saying that all non-contact sports were allowed under relaxed quarantine protocols. “The prevailing and most important criterion is ‘Is it a contact sport?’ Because if it’s not a contact sport it’s allowed to,” he said. He said contact sports such as basketball cannot be allowed unless there is an improvement in the country’s rate of Covid-19 infection.

This after the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) affirmed exemption of PUVs from local curfew ordinances under Resolution No. 47. Modern PUVs will be allowed to ply roads when the second phase of transport resumption kicks off on Monday (June 22). Under the resolution, only non-workers in areas placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), general community quarantine (GCQ), and modified GCQ will be covered by the curfew. \"[Local government units] are enjoined to enact the necessary ordinances to enforce curfew only for non-workers in jurisdiction placed under MECQ, GCQ, and MGCQ to penalize, in a fair and humane manner, violations of the restrictions on the movement of people as provided under these Omnibus Guidelines,” the resolution read. The IATF-EID also urged law enforcement agencies to treat curfew violators fairly and humanely. “Law enforcement agencies in implementing and enforcing said curfew ordinances are likewise strongly enjoined to observe fair and human treatment of curfew violators. Public transportation, however, shall not be restricted by such curfew ordinances,\" it added. Besides PUVs, public utility buses (PUBs) and UV Express with limited passenger capacity will also be allowed when the second phase of the resumption of transportation starts. Currently, only train and bus augmentation, bus augmentation units, taxis and Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), shuttle services, point-to-point buses, and bicycles are allowed. Malacañang earlier said backriding on motorcycles will soon be allowed despite the strict quarantine restrictions to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. The IATF-EID ordered the departments of Transportation, Science and Technology, and Health; the Metro Manila Development Authority; and the Bureau of Philippine Standards to look for the “safest and effective” manner to ensure the safe backriding amid the outbreak. The government has imposed a “no backride” policy amid the nationwide community quarantine due to health safety reasons. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque expressed hope that the second phase of transport resumption would provide commuters with relief. Around 3,600 PUBs and 1,500 other transport vehicles are expected to operate in Metro Manila starting Monday. “Siguro matatapos na iyong hinagpis natin sa kakulangan ng public transportation beginning June 22 po (Perhaps the suffering of our citizens in terms of lack of public transportation will end starting June 22),” he said.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque explained that although the initial plan of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) is to allow provincial buses under Phase Two, it was decided on the assumption that Metro Manila would have already transitioned to a less strict modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). Metro Manila and other parts of the country remained under general community quarantine (GCQ) until June 30 due to the increasing number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. “Bantayan po natin at abangan ang anunsiyo ng DOTr kung papayagan nga po ang mga provincial buses sa second phase pagdating po ng 22 June 2020 (Let us monitor and wait for the announcement of the DOTr if provincial buses will be allowed to operate during the second phase starting June 22),” he said in a virtual presser.

Meanwhile, Roque announced that the DOTr opened on Thursday three new bus routes namely PITX-Sucat, PITX-Naic and PITX-Cavite City. Currently, he said 27 out of 31 bus routes are now open. There are also 8, 830 TNVS units, 16, 701 taxis at 271 P2P buses operating in 28 P2P routes, he said. He said that 90 buses currently operate under the MRT 3 Bus Augmentation Program while all railway stations continue to operate. The DOTr also continues to provide free ride service for healthcare workers, he said. In a congressional hearing on Tuesday, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra told lawmakers that they have identified at least 100 rationalized PUJ routes to be opened if the GCQ will be lifted on June 30. Locally stranded individuals As part of government’s vow to send locally stranded individuals (LSIs) back to their respective homes, Roque said data from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) showed that a total of 34,571 out of the 45,565 LSIs have returned home.

I have to walk the talk, when I announce that they will be relocated, I need to make sure that they were in fact relocated,” he said in an interview in ABS-CBN News Channel’s Headstart. Roque admitted that he did see a crowd during his first visit to the expressway, but during his second visit, it was already empty. “I went twice. The first time I saw the crowd I told my wife we should get permission from the Pasay local government that we should give them food but we did not have to because by the time I returned they were gone,” he said. He also expressed doubts over survey results released by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS), that around 4.1 million Filipinos were left stranded due to the community quarantine. “I doubt if that’s true because the phenomena of locally stranded individuals became a problem after we had some commercial flights which were in fact canceled.

More public transport With Metro Manila remaining under general community quarantine (GCQ) until June 30, Roque said he would have to “verify” with the Department of Transportation (DOTr) whether phase 2 of the resumption of public transport would resume. “I just don’t know if they will proceed with the second phase because of the assumption that we were going to be downgraded to MGCQ [modified GCQ].

Last week, he said 764 LSIs have been transferred to Villamor Airbase Elementary School and the Philippine State College of Aeronautics according to data from the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). “As a matter of government policy it will continue. I’m not sure when, but now that the problem of locally standard individuals will be addressed, it will be resumed soon,” he said. Roque urged Vice President Leni Robredo to suggest solutions to the alleged “lack of coordination” between national and local government units over the program in terms of sending home the BP2’s beneficiaries. He, however, acknowledged the problem that lies in the nature of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which makes it necessary for LGUs to also conduct again facility-based quarantine and testing of arrivals. \"If you’re tested now, you can test negative and a few days later you could test positive. So what we’re doing now is in addition to the testing being done in Metro Manila, which is PCR [polymerase chain reaction], before being sent to the provinces, we have developed also the capability of the local government units outside of Manila to conduct their own PCR test,” he said. Balik Probinsiya program executive director Marcelino Escalada Jr. earlier said they decided to suspend the program to focus on bringing home LSIs. Escalada said deployment might resume next month if the number of stranded persons going to provinces decreases. To date, some 79,000 individuals have enrolled online for the BP2 program while a hundred have been sent home. The BP2 program, a pet project of President Rodrigo Duterte’s former aide and now Senator Christopher \"Bong\" Go seeks to decongest Metro Manila, which is home to 12.87 million Filipinos.

In a news release on Wednesday, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said on June 16, the LTFRB will launch in the National Capital Region the Public Transport Online Processing System (PTOPS). The system, which is still on pilot-testing and for consultation with stakeholders from June 1 to 15, will allow transactions to be made online, making LTFRB services faster and accessible. This, however, excludes the publication and hearing of cases. In partnership with pisopay.com, the PTOPS not only aims to make transactions faster and more convenient but also ensure that physical distancing will be continuously observed, as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Through PTOPS, a user can create an account, select the type of transaction, and schedule an appointment online with the LTFRB. The new system also prevents opportunities for corrupt practices as there is now less human intervention. \"Kailangan na po nating masanay na ito na ang magiging normal simula ngayon (We have to start getting used to the new normal). We are making our services accessible at the comfort of your homes and we have to adapt to this new reality. In this way, we lower the risk of possible virus transmission,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said. Aside from PTOPS, the DOTr is also pushing for the implementation of safety protocols by promoting cashless transactions or digital payments as part of the “new normal\". It has encouraged various digital payment providers to make their services available to transport operators and drivers to pave the way for cashless or contactless transactions in public transportation, such as taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS). The LTFRB had also directed the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags on all public utility vehicles (PUVs) plying expressways and tollways. The LTO said the new normal procedures would be observed in various transactions made with the agency through the Land Transportation Management System (LTMS). Through the system, anyone can process transactions online with the LTO, including driver's and conductor’s application for renewal of licenses, requests for revision of records, and requests for Certificate of No Apprehension. For the settlement of traffic violations, motorists with admitted cases may settle their violations outright by paying fines at any of its district office cashier or via electronic payment channels and online banking. Meanwhile, for contested cases, motorists can submit their position papers online through the LTMS. Notification of the hearing schedule and settlement updates will then be sent through e-mail or portal dashboard. LTO Assistant Secretary Edgar Galvante said the system is on pilot-testing at some LTO offices that are under general community quarantine. “We are doing the pilot-test at 24 LTO Offices to iron-out the technical glitches, and thus ensure that everything will run smoothly. Once all are in place, the LTMS will be implemented in all LTO offices nationwide,” Galvante said. “The LTMS will limit human intervention so as to comply with the safety protocol advised by health authorities. Aside from this, I encourage everyone to be a responsible motorist so that our roads will be safer and settlements will be less. In this way, we can contribute to the faster healing process of our country,” he added.

For Phase 2,  public utility buses, modern public utility vehicles, and UV express will be added from June 22-30, 2020. Roque also assured that daily assessments are done on the transportation sector. “The government is trying to do more in order to help of everyone,” he said. Meanwhile, Roque also reiterated his appeal to the private sector to provide shuttle services to their employees and only allow half of their workforce to physically report for work. “What the administration is doing is balancing the need to revitalize the economy so that we can have livelihood and jobs while looking out for and protecting the health and safety of the public as well,” he said. There are 21,895 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection in the country with 1,003 deaths and 4,530 are recoveries, as of Sunday.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this clarification after saying in an earlier press briefing that sidecars are now allowed on national highways. “Regarding the issue on tricycles/those similarly situated, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año clarifies that although apprehension from the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) is temporarily suspended, such are still prohibited from traversing the national highways,” he said in a statement. On Monday, Año suggested that those who wanted to ride on the same motorcycle should get a sidecar since motorcycle backriding even for married couples remains banned. “Unti-unti po ay gumagawa tayo ng bicycle lane, gagawa tayo ng tricycle lane at lagyan na lang po ng sidecar iyong motor at puwede namang isama niya iyong kaniyang misis (We are slowly making bicycle lanes and add a sidecar to a motorcycle so that you can travel with your wife),” he said. Motorcycle backriding is prohibited in areas under general community quarantine (GCQ) and modified GCQ since physical distancing cannot be observed. In a separate statement on Thursday, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said the urgent clarification was made after conferring with Año, Roque, and Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Arthur Tugade. “Nililinaw po ng DILG na bawal pa rin ang tricycles at pedicabs sa national highways kahit pa nasa GCQ o MGCQ level na ang ilang lokalidad. Bago pa man magsimula ang pandemya ng Covid-19 ay ipinagbabawal na ito ng batas para na rin sa kaligtasan ng publiko (The DILG wants to clarify that tricycles and pedicabs are still banned on national highways even in GCQ or MGCQ level. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, these were already prohibited for the public safety),” he said. He said what was suspended because of Covid-19 was the Road Clearing Operation 2.0 but the prohibition on tricycles and pedicabs is provided for by law and could not, therefore, be suspended by the DILG. On top of Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, prior DILG directives – DILG Memorandum Circulars (MCs) 2020-036, 2020-004, 2011-68, and 2007-11 – have already been issued prohibiting the operation of tricycles and pedicabs on national roads and prescribing the operating conditions and franchising of tricycles. Año said local government units (LGUs) are the ones regulating the operation of tricycles and pedicabs on the secondary roads. “Pinapayagan lamang po ang operasyon ng tricycles sa secondary roads at ipinag-uutos na ng Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) ang one-passenger, no-back ride policies sa lahat ng GCQ at MGCQ areas (Tricycles are allowed only on the secondary roads and IATF-EID ordered no-back ride policies in all GCQ and MGCQ areas),” he said. Año reiterated Roque’s pronouncement that mayors may not give authorization in allowing back ride in GCQ and MGCQ localities in line with the directive of the IATF. “Batid man ng gobyerno ang daing sa transportasyon ay kailangang manguna pa rin ang pagsunod sa physical distancing at iba pang health safety protocol dahil hindi pa naman po nawawala ang banta ng Covid-19. ‘Di pa tayo puwedeng maging kampante (Though the government is aware of the transportation problem, physical distancing and other health safety protocols still need to be followed because the threat of Covid-19 is still there. We cannot afford to be complacent,” Año said. Safety protocols Malaya said that tricycle drivers must wear face masks or face shields, gloves, and allow only one passenger per trip in observance of physical distancing except during a medical emergency wherein the patient needs to be accompanied. In MC 2020-083, the DILG reminds LGUs that all forms of public transport vehicles, terminals, and facilities should be regularly disinfected and implement physical distancing measures as prescribed by the Department of Health (DOH) and the IATF. To maintain physical distancing, all public utility vehicles (PUVs) and private vehicles shall only ferry at most 50 percent of their seating capacity and still observe physical distancing inside the PUV and the terminal, to include queueing for boarding the vehicle and upon entering the terminal premises. Malaya also underscored the policy that transportation for medical front-liners should be continuously provided. “Priority shall be given to medical front-liners in terms of access to public transportation, which should include free transport services, provision of government transportation, and priority in terminals and in PUVs,” he said in reference to MC 2020-083. From June 1 to 21, only trains and bus augmentation services, taxis, transport network vehicle services (TNVS), shuttle services, point-to-point buses, ands bicycles are allowed to operate in limited passenger capacity. Provincial buses will remain banned from entering Metro Manila. Public utility buses, modern public utility vehicles and UV Express units will be permitted to operate with limited passenger capacity from June 22 to 30. Starting Friday (June 5), there will also be more bus routes from Monumento to Balagtas, Bulacan; Edsa to Montalban in Rizal; and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Loop.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB-7) regional director, said on Thursday that 61 special permits were issued to buses that will ply different routes in Cebu City and 29 for buses in Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, Talisay, and Consolacion. “Based on Section 4 of the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine, ‘the movement of all persons in areas placed under GCQ shall be limited to accessing essential goods and service,'” he said in a statement. The movement of people for leisure purposes is not allowed and those aged 21 below and 60 above are still required to stay at home, he noted. Montealto said students who account for 40 percent of ridership are not yet going to school. “The increase in the number of vehicles allowed to ply the routes would be in phases, depending on the passenger demand, which will be monitored by LTFRB-7,” he stressed. He said Memorandum Circular 2020-017 provides for the hierarchy of transport service if there is a need for additional PUVs. Topmost in the hierarchy are buses followed by Omnibus Franchising Guidelines (OFG)-compliant public utility jeepneys (PUJs) or modern PUJs, then UV Express. The fourth is traditional PUJs, which have already been consolidated as cooperatives or are fleet-managed and last are the tourist vans. The LTFRB-7 on Tuesday also issued 150 special permits for taxis and Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) such as Grab and Micab. However, the operators might still be conducting training for their drivers since the taxis and TNVS would be using the cashless payment system, Montealto said. According to him, the LTFRB continues to validate applications for special permits and is coordinating with the LGUs to determine if there is a need to add more PUVs to serve a certain route. LTFRB, in coordination with the local government units, has come up with rationalized routes, which were identified due to the presence of businesses offering essential services, he explained. He called on commuters in areas that have not been covered yet by the routes to be patient and understanding since there would still be limited number of PUVs that will be allowed to operate.

Roque said the cash aid will still come from the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act or Republic Act 11469. Under Bayanihan Law, some 18 million low-income families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic will be given cash aid of PHP5,000 to PHP8,000 for the months of April and May. Aside from cash assistance, PUJ drivers also receive a fuel subsidy which covers 30 percent of their daily fuel consumption for three months. PUJs are still not allowed to transport passengers under more relaxed community quarantine protocols. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is also pushing for an economic stimulus package that would see a portion going to fuel subsidy, mitigating drivers' lost income, and augmenting their operations. From June 1 to 21, trains and bus augmentation services, taxis, transport network vehicle services (TNVS), shuttle services, point-to-point buses, as well as bicycles are allowed to operate in limited passenger capacity. Tricycles will be allowed to operate in areas under general community quarantine (GCQ) with approval from concerned local government units. Provincial buses will remain banned from entering Metro Manila. Public utility buses, modern PUJs, and UV Express units will be permitted to operate with limited passenger capacity from June 22 to 30. Malacañang on Wednesday said the government is considering giving an alternative livelihood to PUJ drivers affected by the community quarantine. Earlier, Roque said there is a proposal to employ PUJ drivers as contact tracers to enhance local government units’ efforts to identify those who have come in contact with Covid-19-infected persons. “We’re actually considering alternative livelihoods for them. There’s a suggestion that they be employed as contact tracers,” he said in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel’s Headstart on Wednesday. Roque said the government is looking to hire around 120,000 contact tracers nationwide to augment the existing over 30,000 contact tracers. Additional bus routes Meanwhile, Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte has also ordered the DOTr to add city bus routes to ferry passengers in Metro Manila starting Friday. “Ramdam din po ng Presidente ang hirap ni Juan Dela Cruz sa pagko-commute. Nagbigay ng derektiba ang Presidente na dagdagan pa ang ruta ng mga bus na bumibiyahe sa Metro Manila simula po bukas, araw ng Biyernes (The President understands the struggle of Juan Dela Cruz when it comes to commuting.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will also be meeting with concerned bus operators to identify the number of buses that will be allowed to resume operations, he added. The three bus routes which will open on Friday are from Monumento to Balagtas, Bulacan, Edsa to Montalban in Rizal and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Loop.

Roque said the government is looking to hire around 120,000 contact tracers nationwide to augment the existing over 30,000 contact tracers. Currently, only limited public transportation is allowed under the general community quarantine (GCQ) and modified GCQ. He said the government is also considering the complete reconfiguration of the traditional PUJs to comply with minimum health standards. Since the traditional PUJ has front-facing seats, Roque said deploying this type of vehicle is “not in the immediate horizon.” “It’s almost a physical impossibility to have social distancing when passengers face each other in a jeepney,” Roque said. However, the government is considering the deployment of modern PUJs where the seating arrangement is similar to modern buses. “These kinds of modern jeepneys might be deployed sooner than later. The traditional face-to-face jeepney, out of the question for now,” he said. Currently, PUJ drivers also receive a fuel subsidy which covers 30 percent of their daily fuel consumption for three months. PUJ drivers will get 12 liters worth PHP360. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is also pushing for an economic stimulus package that would see a portion going to fuel subsidy, mitigating drivers' lost income, and augmenting their operations. The bill is currently pending in Congress. DOTr acted 'expeditiously' Roque, meanwhile, defended Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade from criticism that they lack resolve in addressing the lack of transport systems for commuters. He said the Department of Transportation (DOTr) acted “expeditiously” to provide rides for passengers by deploying additional buses in commercial lanes and shuttle services for front line healthcare workers. Citing Tugade, he appealed to employers and business owners to only allow half of their workforce to physically report for work. “I think the response of Secretary Tugade in my yesterday’s briefing was an appeal to employers. Although we have opened the economy and the workforce can come back a 100 percent, it does not mean that we should let them into the work premises a 100 percent because we simply don’t have the capacity yet to provide public transportation,” Roque said. He urged them to follow the example of government agencies that have only required 50 percent of their workforce to physically report for work while others are offered alternative work schemes. “The appeal is for employers to resort to what the government is doing. Government is back a 100 percent but still on a 50-50 work arrangement where 50 percent of the workforce actually work from home and there’s a schedule where there’s a shifting of government personnel reporting for office,” he said. While physical distancing remains among protocols to minimize the risk of catching and spreading Covid-19, Roque said public transportation will remain operating in a limited capacity. “We will never get to the point that we can provide 100-percent transportation to what we used to have in the workplace,” he said. He also said that health concerns will “take precedence over anything else”. In an interview in PTV-4, he turned down calls for government officials to take public transport to understand the plight of the commuter saying he has already accepted the challenge in the past by taking the Metro Rail Transit-3. “Ginawa ko na po yan dati either way babatuhin ka. So hindi ko na po gagawin muli ‘yan. Naintindihan po natin na mahirap talaga ang nangyayari sa ating mananakay (I have done that before, either way they’re going to criticize you so I’m not going to do that anymore. I understand that it’s really difficult for our commuters),” he said. The gradual resumption of public transport in areas placed under GCQ will be done in two phases. Phase 1, which covers June 1 to 21, allows the operation of trains and bus augmentation services, taxis, transport network vehicle services (TNVS), shuttle services, point-to-point buses with limited passenger capacity, as well as bicycles. Tricycles will be allowed to operate in areas under GCQ with approval from concerned local government units. However, provincial buses will remain banned from entering Metro Manila.

Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade, in the same briefing, observed that physical distancing was successfully implemented in the country’s rail systems while the bus augmentation system “worked”. He said the transport department is eyeing additional routes to address the traffic situation in major thoroughfares in Metro Manila. Shuttle services will also continue to be provided for all healthcare workers, he added, baring that his agency has served over 1 million passengers to date. “Kahapon, lumagpas na kami sa isang milyon na siniserbisyuhan na mga front-liner at mga medical practitioner (Yesterday, the number of front-liners and medical practitioners we have been transporting to work has surpassed 1 million),” he said.

DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade, in his presentation to President Rodrigo Duterte and the Cabinet on Thursday, both the Light Rail Transit line 1 (LRT-1) and line 2 (LRT-2), and the Metro Rail Transit line 3 (MRT-3) will be limited to 10 to 12 percent of its total passenger capacity once they resume operation, while the Philippine National Railway (PNR) will be limited to 20 to 30 percent. To ease the effects of the limited passenger capacity of the rail services, he said a bus augmentation system will run along the rail routes to transport more passengers. “Ikakasa namin ‘yung operation ng tren with bus operation following the same line. Para sa ganoon, ma-achieve natin more or less the same volume of passengers (We will consolidate trains and buses to run in the same line. This would allow us to transport about the same volume of passengers),” Tugade said.

However, DOTr Undersecretary Goddes Hope Libiran said only city buses have been approved to operate in the second phase, with no decision yet on the resumption of operations for provincial buses. Meanwhile, the resumption of service of traditional jeepneys, she said, would depend on whether PUBs and other larger public transportation modes would be unable to cope with the demand on public transportation. “Kung magkulang ang bilang ng buses and modern PUVs, that’s the time they will be allowed to operate. Ang priority eh yung nasa taas ng hierarchy — trains, buses, modern PUVs (If available buses and modern PUVs are not enough, then that’s when we’ll allow traditional jeepneys. The priority are those at the top of the hierarchy—trains, buses, modern PUVs),” Libiran said. Stringent measures For passengers in Metro Manila’s “new normal,” the DOTr said stringent sanitary and health measures will be enforced to control the possible spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). These measures include wearing of face masks at all times, implementation of no contact measures such as cashless payments, use of thermal scanners, availability of alcohol and sanitizers in PUVs, regular disinfection of PUV surfaces, the establishment of disinfection facilities in various public transport terminals, and contact tracing. For PUV drivers and operators, the DOTr said it would also “vigorously pursue and promote” online transactions in licensing, registration, and other documentary requirements. One of these initiatives is the Public Transport Online Processing System of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board which is set to begin its operation on June 1. It said that the system allows for almost all transactions with the LTFRB to be completed online, except for publication and hearing of cases.

Retired Colonel Eduardo Montealto Jr., Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB-7) regional director, said that 52 bus units (36 for north-bound and 16 for south-bound) from different operators were issued with special permit (SP) to travel in Cebu province. Also, 60 bus units in Bohol and 60 units from the original 113 units that applied in Negros Oriental were allowed to travel due to the lower risk classification of the two provinces as per Resolution No. 37 of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). Montealto said his office allowed only around 50 percent of the total bus inventory in the province to travel, considering the continued limitation of movement of people even during GCQ. According to the agency’s new normal “hierarchy of transportation”, mini-buses will be permitted to travel if the number of buses could not cope with the demand from the passenger. Next to minibuses will be Utility Vehicle (UV) Express, then the traditional public utility jeepneys (PUJ). If all the local government units (LGU) in the entire Cebu island will be placed under GCQ, taxis and transport network vehicle service (TNVS) will be allowed to travel. As of now, the capital city and Mandaue are still under enhanced community quarantine. Aside from the buses, the LTFRB-7 has also issued SPs to 10 modern public utility vehicles in Lapu-Lapu City. Operators can apply for the permit from LTFRB-7 through online and issuance of SPs are free of charge, Montealto said. “Right now, it is not necessary to deploy all the buses that we have in the inventory because not all people are allowed to go out of their homes. The other factor is that those who are 20 years old and below and 60 years old and above are not allowed to move out,” he said. Because of the ongoing enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Cebu and Mandaue cities, Cebu province has decided to temporarily move the terminals away from the central city. In the north, the temporary terminal is now at Consolacion town and Talisay City in the south. Under the new normal in public transportation, Montealto said strict boarding protocols like mandatory wearing of face masks for the drivers, conductors, and passengers, physically-distanced sitting arrangements, regular disinfection of bus units and no physical contact policy especially in paying the fare. “The driver must always wear face mask and gloves. The fleet manager in their garage will check the driver’s temperature and health condition before he is allowed to drive,” he said. Before boarding the bus, passengers will have to write their name, address and contact number in a travel manifest which, Montealto said, would be used for contact tracing in case a passenger will be tested positive of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The Inter-Agency Council for Traffic (IACT), composed of the LTFRB, Land Transportation Office, Highway Patrol Group (HPG), and traffic enforcers of LGUs, is now monitoring violations in the strict travel protocols. He said violations to the protocols would be treated as breach to the terms and conditions of the franchise that carries penalty of PHP5,000 for first offense, PHP10,000 for second offense, and PHP15,000 and possible suspension or cancellation of franchise for the third offense. A passenger caught violating the protocols will be slapped with charges in violation of Republic Act 11469 to the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which has a PHP10,000 minimum and maximum PHP1 million penalties, and not more than two months of imprisonment or both.

In a #LagingHanda network briefing, LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III said the LTFRB, cashless payment providers and transport network companies (TNC) met on Sunday to discuss the use of digital payment platforms to avoid transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in public transportation. “Nandun po yung mga GCash, PayMaya, nandun din po yung mga cashless payment providers na gumagamit ng card kagaya ng Beep. So pinagpulong po natin yan kahapon (GCash, PayMaya, cashless providers using cards such as Beep were there as well. We met with them yesterday) so that we’d be able to push (for) cashless transaction,” Delgra said. Aside from mandating cashless payments in taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS), he said the LTFRB is also promoting the scheme in public utility buses and other public utility vehicles (PUV) as part of the government’s PUV modernization program. “Even before this pandemic came into our lives, sinusulong na po natin ito (we were already pushing for this) as part of the modernization program of our public transport,” Delgra said. The pandemic, however, added to the urgency of using digital payment platforms. “Ngayon lang nagiging urgent yung pangangailangan to go cashless. Kaya mabilis at pina-igting pa natin yung polisiya, for all public transport to go cashless po (It’s only now that the need to go cashless became urgent. That’s why we’re working faster and establishing policies for all public transportation to go cashless),” Delgra said. Aside from promoting cashless payment between passengers and PUVs, the LTFRB in a Facebook post on Sunday released Memorandum Circular (MC) 2020-020 which directed PUV operators to install radio frequency identification (RFID) in their units for contactless transactions in tollways and expressways. “LTFRB also reminds drivers and operators of PUVs in areas under GCQ that the directive is simultaneously in effect with social distancing guidelines prescribed under MC 2020-017,” the LTFRB said. It added that PUVs not yet allowed to travel in areas under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), GCQ, and other forms of quarantine are required to comply with the directive once they resume their operations. In a media bulletin, the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) offered free installation of RFIDs for PUVs plying expressways. “With RFID, transactions are contactless, fast, and convenient. We urge our motorists to use this innovative payment transaction at toll plazas as this will prevent long vehicle queues and will definitely make your travel hassle-free,” TRB Executive Director Abraham Sales said.

As of 8 p.m. of May 17, DSWD said it has already distributed PHP78,933,406,900 to 13,034,930 non-Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4P’s) grantees. That is part of the PHP81,684,964,650 total fund that was downloaded to the local government units (LGUs) in the country to allocate for those families who qualified for the program or considered as low-income and are the most affected sector by the government’s containment measures. The 4P’s grantees received their cash assistance directly through their cash cards. DSWD said they already sent PHP17,477,328,550 to 4,021,496 families. The DSWD has also coordinated with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to support the families of drivers of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and public utility vehicle (PUV) who were affected by the suspension of mass transport in the National Capital Region (NCR). It has recently entered into a partnership with G-Xchange, Inc. (GCash), one of the leading mobile wallet platforms in the Philippines, for the distribution of the emergency subsidy under the SAP for a quicker and safer approach of cash disbursement. TNVS driver-beneficiaries may withdraw their subsidies via GCash from any Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) nationwide or use the funds to pay for physical and online transactions. They may also use GCash to pay bills to over 70,000 merchants and billers, buy airtime load, and easily transfer money to other GCash account owners or bank accounts from over 40 financial institutions nationwide.

In a Facebook post, the LTFRB said the memo also includes other conditions for the operation of taxis and TNVS in GCQ areas, such as a daily record of passengers for contact tracing that would be made available at the request of LTFRB and other government agencies. Existing fare rates for taxis and TNVS will apply upon their resumption of operation, it added. Early in May, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases released public health safety protocols for public transportation in GCQ areas. These protocols include wearing face masks and gloves at all times by public utility drivers, “no mask, no ride” for commuters, regular disinfection, and reduction of capacity for taxis and TNVS to two persons per row (including the driver).

In an online briefing on Thursday, DOTr Undersecretary Artemio Tuazon, Jr. said that the guidelines, pending the signing of President Rodrigo Duterte, will allow the gradual reopening of public transportation in GCQ areas, while areas under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) will still be denied the operation of public transport. Formulated by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) and integrated into its omnibus guidelines, Tuazon said the new rules require a special permit for public utility vehicles (PUV) before its operation and the reduction of passenger capacity for buses, jeeps, and UV Express to 50 percent—in adherence to a 1-meter physical distancing rule. “Yung mga lumang jeep, magkakaharap at dikit dikit ang mga pasahero, hindi papayagan. Ang uunahin na payagan ay mga modernized jeepneys (Old jeepneys, where passengers are sitting astride and close together, will not be allowed. The first ones to be allowed will be modern jeepneys),” Tuazon said. For taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS), he said they will be allowed to carry a maximum of two passengers, for tricycles a maximum of one passenger, while motorcycle taxis are still banned as these do not comply with social distancing guidelines. Tuazon said all drivers are required to wear facemasks and should be protected further by a plastic or acetate wall to separate him or her from passengers, while all passengers are also required to wear facemasks or be denied entry to PUVs. To allow for minimum contact, he said automatic fare collection will be encouraged and if not available, passengers will be required to pay the driver first before boarding the vehicle. Aside from denying entry to those not wearing facemasks, he said those who exhibit signs of low-grade fever or worse will also not be allowed to board PUVs. To reduce the possibility of transmission of the disease, footbaths will be required in passenger loading areas while a one-meter physical distancing rule will be enforced for passengers waiting in line. DOTr Assistant Secretary Mark De Leon said PUVs will be required to undergo disinfection after every round-trip, while the installation of disinfection facilities will be required in all transport terminals, including hand-washing stations and provision of sanitizers. Martin Delgra III, chair of Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), said drivers and operators of PUVs may secure their special permits starting Friday by applying online or visiting the LTFRB central office or any regional offices. He added that while the special permit will be free-of-charge, only a limited number of PUVs will be allowed to operate and must be approved as roadworthy by the Land Transportation Office (LTO). Tuazon said the DOTr and its line agencies will partner with the Philippine National Police for proper enforcement of the guidelines. ‘Stimulant package’ To help ease the burden on PUVs operating at a reduced capacity, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade said the DOTr was currently formulating an incentive package for PUV drivers and operators. “The stimulant package may be composed of several things. Tinitignan naming ang tulong o ayuda sa fuel. Siguro 30 percent of daily consumption (We’re looking at providing support on fuel costs. Maybe 30 percent of daily consumption),” Tugade said. He added that the support package may also include loan agreements with favorable terms as well as extension of existing loans for up to three months with no interest. Delgra said there were no plans to increase the fare on public transportation as it would only add to the burden of the average commuter. Earlier, the IATF-EID announced that Metro Manila, Central Luzon (except for Aurora), Calabarzon, Pangasinan, Benguet, Iloilo, Cebu, Bacolod City, and Davao City will still be under ECQ beginning May 1, while those not included will be under GCQ. It said that quarantine rules in GCQ areas will be relaxed, reopening of several non-essential businesses will be allowed, among other measures meant to ease the economic impact of the pandemic in the country.

Meanwhile, other recipients who qualified as target beneficiaries will receive PHP5,000 to PHP8,000 in emergency cash aid, depending on the minimum wage in their area. This, as stated in the Republic Act 11469, which granted President Rodrigo Duterte additional special powers where some 18 million low-income families are to receive the emergency subsidy. DSWD-Field Offices coordinates with local government units (LGUs) for the schedule of distribution of the emergency subsidy to their qualified constituents. DSWD said it continues to deliver the social amelioration assistance to low-income families or those on subsistence economy or workers in the informal economy, and with members belonging to the vulnerable sector, assessed to be the most affected by the declaration given their existing life situations or circumstances, while adhering to health and safety protocols.

The financial assistance is part of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed last April 3, 2020 between LandBank, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for the distribution of emergency subsidy to qualified drivers of TNVS, Public Utility Jeeps (PUJs), UV Express (UVs), Public Utility Bus (PUBs), Point-to-Point Bus (P2P), Taxi, School Transport, Tourist Transport, and Motorcycle (MC) Taxi.

He said the time is of the essence, especially with many Filipinos have been sidelined due to the enhanced community quarantine to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) As chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee that oversees the implementation of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, Go said there should be no politics involved in the distribution of aid and that the funds must be allocated fairly and distributed equitably, especially among the poorest of the poor. “Ang mga ahensya tulad ng DSWD dapat mamahala sa pagbibigay ng tulong. Ang mga pulitiko hindi dapat makialam. Huwag niyo po haluan ng pulitika dahil mas humahaba pa ang proseso. Huwag na natin pahirapan pa ang mga tao, pabilisin na natin ang pagbigay ng tulong sa kanila,” Go said. (Government agencies such as the DSWD, should supervise the distribution of relief assistance. Politicians must not interfere. Don't let politics get in the way because the processing becomes longer. Let us not burden our people, let us speed up the distribution of assistance to them.) Go said the priority now is to be able to provide immediate healthcare needs to solve the health problem and defeat the virus and, at the same time, to provide cash and food assistance to those who are affected the most by the crisis. “With the passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the bulk of government spending is now allocated to DOH (Department of Health) for immediate healthcare needs, DSWD for social assistance especially for affected vulnerable sectors, and DOLE for assistance to displaced workers,” Go said. The Senator noted that the law has already given the necessary authority and flexibility to the government to use the funds as deemed necessary to respond and address the growing threats of Covid-19, and the economic impact that comes with it. As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee, Go said he assures that the funds are properly used, prodding those concerned government agencies to provide the needs of those affected by the pandemic. “Alalayan rin natin ang mga displaced at informal economy workers – mga vendors at Public Utility Vehicle drivers, tulad ng mga namamasada ng taxi, tricycle, bus, jeep at iba pa. Pati na rin po ang mga trisikad, pedikab, habal-habal at mga nagtatrabaho sa Transportation Network Vehicle Services o TNVS, katulad ng Grab, Angkas, Joyride. Lalong lalo na po ang mga kababayan natin na ‘isang kahig, isang tuka’ o ‘no work, no pay’ – mga daily wage earners na kinailangang tumigil sa pagtatrabaho para maging ligtas mula sa pagkalat ng sakit na ito,” he said. (We would also support our displaced informal workers-- the vendors and public utility vehicle drivers like those who drive taxi, tricycle, bus, and jeep and the like. Those who worked in the transportation network services or TNVS like Grab, Angkas, Joyride, especially those who are in 'no work, no pay' scheme, the daily wage earners who have to stop working to contain the spread of this disease.) Citing the burden placed on Filipinos as they go through the enhanced quarantine measures, Go said it is the responsibility of the government to secure and sustain their needs as their lives grind to a halt. “Responsibilidad natin na alagaan ang ating mga kababayan na pinilit nating hindi lumabas ng kanilang mga bahay. Nag-impose tayo ng strict measures para maprotektahan ang kalusugan nila pero hindi dapat doon nagtatapos ang responsibilidad natin sa pag-aalaga sa kanila,” he said. (It is our responsibility to take care of our countrymen that we force not to go out of their homes. We impose strict measures to protect their health but our responsibility to them does not stop there.) Meanwhile, the Department of Budget and Management has requested for the release of a budget amounting to PHP2.84 billion for the benefit of displaced workers through DOLE. The funds for DOLE are intended “to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 among affected the private sector employees who have no or insufficient leave credits and are required to undergo community quarantine, among others.” Go said as the country continues to fight to contain the Covid-19 transmission, the government must take care of poor Filipinos who are becoming hungry and restless. Over 85 percent of the requested fund of DBM that will be given to DOLE will be allotted for the Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers and Government Internship Program (TUPAD-GIP). TUPAD is a community-based package of assistance in the municipality or barangay level that provides emergency employment for displaced workers, underemployed, and seasonal workers, for a minimum period of ten days but not to exceed 30 days, depending on the nature of the work to be performed. On the other hand, GIP provides opportunities for young workers to serve the general public in government agencies or entities’ projects and programs at the national and local levels. Go said the will also closely monitor the provision of the cash and food aid to low-income Filipino families as part of the Social Amelioration Program, based on the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. “As a member of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee, pursuant to the provisions of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, it is my duty to scrutinize how the Executive spends the funds we allowed to be used to combat Covid-19.

Go cited government data indicating that majority of Covid-19 deaths are elderly because they are more prone to respiratory infections due to their weak and compromised immune systems. “I’m ready to help. Whatever needs to be done or processes that need to be fast-track so that DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) and other agencies can respond to the needs of the people, I will do it,” he said in Filipino. Go, whose priorities include the welfare of one of the most vulnerable sectors, would like the DSWD to implement social welfare and social protection programs and services by prioritizing the provision of the Social Pension for indigent senior citizens. He also wants the DSWD to provide assistance to individuals in crisis situations, distribution of food and non-food items, and sustainable livelihood programs to vulnerable sectors affected by the quarantine. He said this is in on top of the provision of food assistance and non-food essentials to the most affected families and persons. “We want all Filipinos affected by Covid-19 to be given necessary attention and support. Priority should be given to the senior citizens because we know that they are week and having difficulties to move around and find food,” Go said. “Let’s admit that it’s difficult for them to get their resources especially now that quarantine is being implemented, they are not allowed to go out. And they can easily get this kind of disease,” he added. Citing a government advisory, Go reiterated that those who are most vulnerable, those with pre-existing medical condition, like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cancer; and others, as well as pregnant women should not go out of their homes. An indigent senior citizen is entitled to PHP500 monthly pension. Considered as indigent senior citizens are those who are frail, sickly or with disability and without pension or permanent source of income of regular support from their relatives to meet their basic needs. Go said those who should also be a priority are solo parents, indigent indigenous peoples, Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) and Transport Network Companies (TNC) drivers, and informal economy workers. To ease the distribution of the relief goods due to the travel restrictions, Go is calling for door-to-door delivery of government aid, including the social pension for the indigent senior citizens. He said DSWD should be assisted by LGUs since the latter have the necessary database. “Let’s have compassion to our countrymen, particularly the poor. Anyway, it is the money of the Filipino. Let’s not make life difficult for them,” Go said. Go urged the DSWD should find ways to immediately download the funds for social pension to the LGUs so that the senior citizens will be able to get their pensions. “The barangay officials can assist the DSWD in the distribution of social pension,” Go said.

On Saturday, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) issued the guidelines on social distancing and community quarantine in the transport sector, which is effective \"immediately\". The said document specified that all public utility vehicle (PUV) operators and drivers would observe the following passenger limit: For Taxis/Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS), including accredited airport taxis, there should be no more than four passengers including the driver. For UV Express, there should be no more than six passengers including the driver. For old units of Public Utility Jeepneys (PUJs), there should no be more than half of their regular capacity, including the driver. For Omnibus Franchising Guidelines (OFG) compliant units (Class 2 and 3), there should be no more than one-half of the seating capacity and without any standing passenger. For PUBs, there should not be more than 25 passengers including driver and conductor and without any standing passenger. The DOTr said passengers inside these vehicles are required to be one seat apart from each other. Multiple bookings for a single trip in a TNVS and motorcycle taxis are also suspended. \"Should any of their passengers manifest any symptoms of the COVID-19, they shall assist the said person to the nearest hospital and to report the incident to the Department of Health (DOH) or the Philippine National Police (PNP) for proper handling,\" the DOTr said. Meanwhile, provincial buses and inter-regional trips of jeepneys and UV Express, to and from Metro Manila will also be \"terminated\" on the entry points as identified by the PNP. The agency also reminded all PUVs entering and exiting Metro Manila to remind all passengers to ready their valid company ID showing the place of work and government-issued ID showing the place of residence. The Point-to-Point (P2P) Buses from Ninoy Aquino International Airport to Clark International Airport and Sangley Airport will be allowed to operate as scheduled, subject to DOH and PNP protocols/procedures. RAIL SECTOR For the rail sector, the DOTr said trains will be loaded at reduced capacity to lessen the concentration of passengers per train. The same reduction will also be implemented in station platforms, concourses, and elevators. \"It is noted that the above measures will lower our railway lines’ capacity and result in longer queues. We appeal to our passengers’ understanding as these public health measures are implemented to manage the current Public Health Emergency. Operating hours may be extended on a case-to-case basis to accommodate passengers who are already in queues,\" the agency said. PNR operations from Alabang, Muntinlupa City to Calamba in Laguna province and vice versa shall also be suspended during the period of community quarantine. AVIATION SECTOR In the aviation sector, all domestic flights will cease operations in the community quarantine area, except for cargo flights, air ambulance and medical supplies, government/military flights, weather mitigation flights, and maintenance and utility flights. \"No general aviation flights within the community quarantine area during the period. General aviation flights will be diverted to Sangley Airport and Clark Airport,\" it said. On the international and other commercial flights, the DOTr added that a special airport-to-airport trip arranged by the airlines, in coordination with the airport authorities will be allowed. Passengers may also opt to terminate flights in Manila, and arrange their own transport within Manila. Airlines may also communicate options beyond Manila travel. The same one-meter radius distance from the other passengers shall be implemented and areas where queuing take place (Xray, check-in counter queues, etc.) shall have signages for people to observe proper social distancing. MARITIME SECTOR In the maritime sector, there would be an enhancement of passenger awareness on precautionary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The crew of cargo vessels originating from Covid-19 affected ports will also be subject to stringent quarantine procedures. For ships and cargoes, the passenger traffic in all ports going in and out of the NCR will be suspended during the period of community quarantine.

He said the drivers of these vehicles use the ride-hailing app inDriver which has not applied for accreditation with the LTFRB to engage as transportation network company (TNC). “On Feb. 19, the joint ACO (anti-colorum operation) of the Highway Patrol Group (HPG-7) and LTFRB-7 apprehended the two colorum TNVS inside a mall in Mandaue City,” he told Philippine News Agency (PNA) in a message. Since inDriver is not one of the accredited TNCs in Cebu, he said the two drivers are engaged in colorum operation and will be penalized as they are without authority or a certificate of public convenience (CPC). He also said on Feb. 13, an anti-colorum operation “resulted in the apprehension and subsequently impounding of two units of Innova using non-accredited inDriver\" ride-hailing apps.” The penalty would be PHP120,000 for Sedan cars, PHP200,000 for Sports Utility Vehicles, Vans and Pick-up type and PHP1 million for coasters and higher classification vehicles. Like inDriver, Montealto said another Russian ride-hailing apps, Maxim, has been monitored to be operating in Cebu without an accreditation from his office. The Feb. 7 joint operation of the LTFRB-7 and HPG-7 caught a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup truck for using the Maxim app in booking trips from passengers. However, the Maxim Service, in a statement sent to the PNA, apologized for the inconvenience caused by the apprehensions. “At the moment, Maxim is only testing the software and preparing to start working in Cebu. Among other things, the company is in the process of obtaining all the necessary permitting documents. At this stage, we are in the process of registering with the SEC,” the statement read. It added that immediately after the registration of a legal entity, Maxim will submit the documents to LTFRB to obtain accreditation to engage as TNC. “In order not to lose this time and to prepare for a full launch, Maxim is testing the application and checking rates settings. In this way we will be able to optimally set up the service so that passengers and drivers can use it by the start of the company's operations,” it said.

Retired Col. Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of LTFRB-7, said that Maxim, a ride-sharing app that originated from Shadrinsk, Russia is actively operating in Cebu despite absence of accreditation from their office. “On Feb. 7, a joint operation with LTFRB-7 and Highway Patrol Group-7 apprehended a transport network vehicle service (TNVS) using the so-called Maxim ride-hailing app. The units that we apprehended are a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup type truck,” Montealto said. Maxim has not sought accreditation with the LTFRB to operate legally as a ride-hailing app for booking of trips by customers via mobile phones or tablets, he said. Montealto admitted there are so many unaccredited TNVS operating in Cebu and using apps that are not registered with the agency. Last month, LTFRB-7 operatives apprehended six cars for illegally operating as TNVS using inDriver, another unaccredited ride-hailing app. Both inDriver and Maxim are not among the list of LTFRB-recognized apps such as Grab Car, MiCab, Hype and Hirna. InDriver was founded in 2012 but Maxim started as a modern taxi-ride ordering service in Russia in 2003 and simultaneously opened branches in seven cities worldwide in 2009. It expanded to 17 more cities in 2010. Montealto lamented that Filipino counterparts of Maxim and inDriver operators abroad could clandestinely operate in Cebu without fear being detected by authorities. According to initial investigation by the LTFRB-7, Maxim has revealed in its Facebook account the address of its office along J. De Veyra Street in North Reclamation Area here. Montealto, however, said operations personnel will continue to monitor their movements and conduct apprehensions against TNVS operators using Maxim and inDriver based on intelligence reports that they can gather. TNVS operating via unaccredited ride-hailing app are not paying taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, he said. He said the two vehicles apprehended on Friday in a mall in Mandaue City were placed in the impounding area pending payment of penalty ranging from PHP120,000 to PHP200,000 for engaging in colorum operations, aside from being blacklisted for 90 days.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., director of LTFRB-7, said their operatives issued the 10 drivers inspection report summons (IRS), directing them to show cause why they should not be fined for violating the franchise guidelines. The operation was conducted Tuesday morning after the central office issued Memorandum Circular 2020-005, which set the guidelines for all public utility drivers, conductors, and terminal operators in ensuring safe public transportation because of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare. The circular has directed “all PUV drivers and conductors to properly wear a face mask at all times while on duty and for all franchise holders to ensure compliance” with the policy. Terminal operators have also been directed “to ensure proper sanitation and cleanliness in their premises, to provide face masks, as well as disinfectant or sanitizer dispensers for the free use of the passengers.” Montealto said the circular covers all drivers and conductors of public utility jeepneys, taxis, buses, and transport network vehicle service (TNVS). “Franchise holders are bound by all memorandum circulars issued by the LTFRB. They have to comply or else, they will be facing breach of franchise that carries a minimum penalty of PHP5,000 for the first offense, PHP10,000 for the second offense, and PHP15,000 plus impoundment of the unit and cancellation of franchise (for the third offense),” he said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The circular, he said, was issued to protect the health and well-being of the drivers and conductors who are vulnerable to diseases due to exposure to different health conditions of passengers. Meanwhile, Montealto advised the drivers to just follow what has been required of them under the new memo to avoid being fined. His reaction came after some drivers complained about social media that the PHP5,000 penalty for not wearing a face mask is too big. “They can devise a mask. They can use their handkerchief or face towel to cover their nose and mouth. Table napkin can even be used, as long as they are protected from the virus,” Montealto said. He also warned the PUV drivers against using the new circular to refuse to convey passengers who are Chinese-looking, noting that this is also a violation of the franchise, which has a separate penalty. \"That's why they are required to wear a mask because, aside from ensuring safe public transport, the drivers should not be given a reason to refuse to take a passenger because of suspicion that he is infected with coronavirus because of his looks,” Montealto said. Passengers, he said, are exempted from the circular but are encouraged to also wear a face mask while onboard the PUVs.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in Region 7 (Central Visayas), said on Wednesday that although inDriver maintains a \"virtual office\" with no physical office in Cebu, it has been actively operating through social media. This, Montealto said, was despite the warning he issued on Monday against private car owners and taxi operators not to use the app as it has not been accredited with the LTFRB as transport network vehicle service (TNVS). “We have conducted intelligence gathering for one month after we received the report that inDriver is engaging the public using Facebook. It’s impossible for them to operate legally as there is an existing moratorium from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) on the accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies),” Montealto said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. He said only Grab Car, MiCab, Hype, and Hirna are the legitimate ride-hailing apps in Cebu. There are three more TNVS that have a pending application for accreditation with the LTFRB-7, but Montealto said that due to DOTr’s moratorium, their operations remain pending. He said inDriver, a Russia-based ride-hailing app, is not among the applicants to operate as TNVS. He said despite the moratorium, inDriver continues to entice Cebuanos to use their private cars to earn income. “It’s easy to use inDriver. All that a car owner can do is to register with the app and submit their documentary requirements through electronic transmission. It means that there is no human contact as what they have here is just a virtual office,” he added. Montealto said inDriver has not been collecting a commission from the car owners, unlike the legitimate ride-hailing apps which have an established sharing-scheme. He reiterated that private cars apprehended for colorum operation will be slapped with PHP120,000 penalty for sedan models and PHP200,000 for van and sports utility vehicles (SUV), aside from the mandatory 90-day impounding of the unit. Impounded cars, he said, can be released earlier than 90 days but not earlier than 30 days, through a motion addressed to his office. “We are quite sure that InDriver operators and drivers have not undergone the mandatory defensive driver training and the driver’s academy training of the LTFRB. They don’t also have passenger insurance,” Montealto added. He also said that inDriver is not a safe transport system as it does not have the gadget to detect a vehicle's location. “They can unscrupulously use it to kidnap anyone because you cannot trace them,” he said.

The regional director of LTFRB-7 said he could not ascertain who are behind the operations of inDriver in Cebu as they could not locate its office here. “One of the owners who came to the LTFRB-7 regional office confided that private car owners like him and the taxi operators were enticed to go into TNVS because a public official himself posted in his Facebook account patronizing inDriver ride-hailing app as a sideline income using his own car,” Montealto said in a message sent to the Philippine News Agency on Sunday. He said taxi operators and private car owners planning to engage in app-based passenger booking service should choose accredited TNVS. “They may inquire at our regional office to know which are the legitimate Transport Network Companies (TNCs) accredited by LTFRB and the list of the requirements,” he said. To avoid inconvenience, he urged passengers to use any of the apps accredited with the board in booking their trips, adding that colorum vehicles have no insurance and their operators are not paying the required taxes. LTFRB record showed Cebu has reached the cap of 1,500 TNVS while the request for additional units has not yet been approved by the board.

In a statement released Thursday, the LTFRB said the fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was due to Grab’s failure to follow through with a voluntary commitment it made with the antitrust body. “To put it in proper context, the fine issued by PCC in its decision recently rendered pertains to the failure of Grab to fulfill its commitment to PCC as embodied in Grab's Undertaking which it voluntarily submitted to PCC. It has nothing to do with LTFRB's fare structure,\" LTFRB Board Member Ronaldo Corpus said in a meeting between the LTFRB and the PCC on Monday. The LTFRB said a review would be made to find out whether Grab violated the existing fare structure imposed by the board. “The agency shall continue to work closely with the PCC regarding this issue,” the LTFRB said. According to the LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular 2019-036 which contains the fare matrix imposed by the LTFRB on Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) such as Grab, TNVS companies shall charge a flag down rate of up to PHP40 for car sedans, up to PHP50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (SUV), and up to PHP30 for hatchbacks/sub-compact vehicles. There will be a PHP15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, PHP18 for SUVs, and PHP13 for hatchbacks—aside from PHP2 charge per minute of travel. TNVS companies are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charge through surge pricing. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab contested claims of overcharging against the company and the call for additional fines from Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Party-list) Rep. Jericho Nograles. Grab clarified that its fares were within the fare matrix of the LTFRB and the acceptance of the fine imposed by the PCC was made “in the interest of showing good faith.” “We will comply with the PCC although clearly we could have filed a motion for reconsideration or appealed to a higher authority, which we did not since we want to focus on our business instead,\" said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president. On Nov. 18, the PCC imposed a total fine of PHP23.45 million on Grab for breaching its voluntary pricing commitments during the first to third quarters of the initial undertaking between Grab and the PCC. Through amendments made between the two parties, the total fine of PHP5.05 million for its overcharging violations in the third quarter of the undertaking will be refunded to Grab’s customers instead of being paid as a fine to the national treasury.

In a message, DOTr Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran said these kits will be available to all commuters and will be distributed starting October 31. However, the MRT-3 will reserve a hundred kits for persons with disabilities and senior citizens in each MHD within the rail line. Libiran said the number of kit allocation will vary per agency but airports under the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) will receive at least 500 kits each while MHDs in stations of the MRT-3 will receive at least 100 kits each. In addition, the DOTr Communications and Commuter Affairs Office (DOTr-CACAO) said Terminals 1 to 4 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) were allocated 1,000 kits each to “complement the services airports give for delayed flight departures.” The office added that allocations for passenger terminal buildings (PTB) under the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) will vary depending on their capacity. “For PPA ports, allocation of MHD kits depends on the passenger capacity of the PTB. CDO port, for example, has 3,000 MHD kits,” the DOTr-CACAO said.

In a statement, House Deputy Speaker Michael Romero said also included in his proposal to expand the coverage of the government’s fuel subsidy program are drivers of commuter taxis, and freight forwarding cargo trucks. Romero said the funds that will cover the additional beneficiaries of the Expanded Pasada program would be sourced from the Malampaya fund, which has a reported balance of PHP198 billion. Romero said his House Resolution No. 349, also calls for the establishment of a national strategic fuel reserve to address energy crises such as fuel shortage. The implementation of the Philippine Strategic Fuel Reserves (PSFR) program would be funded through the Malampaya fund. “[This] will cushion the economic impact of the sharp rise in oil prices triggered by the drone strikes at Saudi Aramco’s oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia,” Romero said. Romero said HR 349 grants President Rodrigo Duterte the authority to draw the necessary amount of funds from the Malampaya funds to “initially establish the PSFR and implement an expanded Pantawid Pasada cash grants programs. The proposal also urges the Energy Regulatory Commission to direct oil firms operating in the Philippines to “maintain their own fuel reserves” at a level sufficient to meet 45 to 60 days of daily consumer demand. On Tuesday, oil companies have implemented a price hike on gasoline by as much as PHP2.35 per liter, diesel by PHP1.80 per liter and kerosene by PHP1.75 per liter. These price upticks are results of a similar trend overseas due to supply issues following the drone attacks on government-run oil facilities in Saudi Arabia more than a week ago. Saudi Arabian authorities, however, said supply is expected to normalize in the near-term. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy said a team from the DOE met with the proposed members of the Oil Contingency Task Force last Sept. 20 to finalize the draft establishing the inter-agency group that would implement contingency measures vis-à-vis the impact of supply issues following the drone attract on Aramco facilities. “We realize the importance of addressing issues beforehand so that the government may have contingency measures to sustain the country’s economic growth and provide basic services to the people,” Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said in a statement.

In a message sent to reporters, the LTFRB said it has so far released a total of 5,061 CPCs to aspiring TNVS drivers and operators since the inception of TNVS in the country. A total of 1,437 CPCs are in the process of being signed by the LTFRB. As of Wednesday, the LTFRB said it has issued a total of 46,583 provisional authorities (PA) to TNVS applicants. A CPC is a document issued by the LTFRB that allows for the legitimate operation of a TNVS and is valid for two years, subject to renewal after its validity. Before a CPC is issued, a TNVS operator may be given a PA, which temporarily allows the operation of a TNVS and has a validity that has recently been extended from 45 days to 90 days. In a summary of findings and recommendations by the ARTA on the LTFRB’s processing of TNVS applications, the anti-red tape body recommended the validity of a PA to be extended further to one year or have no expiration at all subject to the good standing of the holder of the PA as a public transport operator.   On Tuesday, the ARTA released an order declaring all pending but complete, duly-paid and duly-heard TNVS applications as automatically approved, and ordered the release of CPCs and other appropriate licenses or certifications by the LTFRB to these applicants. “In a meeting yesterday with ARTA Director-General Jeremiah Belgica, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade instructed Undersecretary for Road Transport Mark De Leon to ensure LTFRB’s immediate implementation of ARTA’s order, provided that substantive completion of documents/requirements are met by applicants,” DOTr Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran said in a message on Wednesday.

ARTA released a summary of their findings and recommendations following complaints from the TNVS community of red tape in the processing of TNVS applications. In the summary, ARTA said they found “unreasonable and undue” delay in the processing of TNVS applications. “Contrary to LTFRB’s 2017 Revised Citizen’s Charter, it failed to process TNVS applications within the processing time of 45 days for the conduct and hearing and evaluation of such application,” the summary read. To address the delays, ARTA recommended the “automatic approval of all pending TNVS applications that have submitted all documentary requirements, paid the appropriate fees, and have been duly heard, but are still awaiting the issuance of PAs (Provisional Authorities).” The validity of the PAs are to be extended from the current 90 days to one year, “or better yet, shall have no expiration at all,” recommended ARTA. It was noted that a PA may be revoked in cases of serious traffic violations, including ethical and legal considerations. The anti-red tape body also recommended reinstating the old process of having Grab organize TNVS applications instead of individual applicants so that they would only need to appear during their hearing at the LTFRB. In the second part of the summary, ARTA found the LTFRB to be imposing requirements that were not stated in its Citizen’s Charter. “The Authority further found that the LTFRB suddenly imposed changes in the documentary requirements without properly revising its Citizen’s Charter. This created confusion among TNVS applicants,” the summary read. ARTA also recommended the removal of Bank Certificate of Conformity as a requirement, devising of an appropriate regulatory framework for TNVS, conduct of a regulatory impact assessment to improve regulatory frameworks, revision of some other requirements, and to provide basis that would justify the cap of 65,000 TNVS units in Metro Manila. ARTA also said they found fixers to be prevalent in the premises of the LTFRB, and also recommended action against officials or employees of the LTFRB found violating RA 11032 or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007. On July 7, 2019, the ARTA began a dialogue with TNVS groups following “problematic” pronouncements from the LTFRB, which included the prohibition on hatchbacks as TNVS. Three days later, the LTFRB, DOTr, and ARTA held a dialogue, where TNVS groups raised their concerns to the government bodies. Tugade eventually signed an order amending past DOTr provisions to permanently allow hatchbacks as TNVS.

In a text message, Mark de Leon, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Undersecretary for Road Transport and Infrastructure, also confirmed that the memorandum is bogus. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chair Martin Delgra III earlier said \"colorum\" (unregistered) TNVS drivers and operators will still be apprehended by traffic enforcers after the TNVS community complained of the difficulties TNVS operators face in securing documents for their legitimate operation. He said giving an exception to the TNVS community may force the LTFRB to give immunity, as well to other public transport sectors. He, however, vowed that concerns of the TNVS groups will be discussed further by the LTFRB. “The issue that was raised is valid, and that is precisely why kailangan pag-usapan (it needs to discussed). Rest assured that we will address this,” Delgra said.

During a dialogue among the representatives of the LTFRB, Department of Transportation (DOTr), the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), and TNVS groups, LTFRB Technical Division Head Joel Bolano said all policies set by the Board for hatchbacks were based on existing department orders from the DOTr and LTFRB memorandum circulars (MC). He said MC 2018-005, a memorandum that allows for hatchbacks as TNVS until February 2021, only applies to accredited hatchback units. These accredited hatchbacks are part of 55,000 TNVS units in the master list made by Transport Network Companies (TNC) like Grab in cooperation with the LTFRB. Of the 55,000 units in the master list, a total of 24,805 filed their respective applications and out of these applications, 2,235 were hatchback units. Bolano said hatchbacks which applied for TNVS accreditation from March 5 to December 15, 2018 are also entitled to the benefits granted by the MC 2018-005. “Hindi po totoo na hindi natin pino-process yun, at hindi po totoo na hindi ini-implement yung [MC 2018-005]. Katunayan po diyan ay yung nag-apply na 2,235 units na hatchback (It’s not true we’re not processing them. It’s not true we’re not implementing MC 2018-005. The proofs are those 2,235 hatchbacks who applied for accreditation),” Bolano said. He said the accredited hatchbacks were actually in violation of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) orders 2015-11 and 2017-011 that only allow sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles for TNVS. The mistake happened due to a misunderstanding where TNCs misinterpreted the vehicle types allowed and wrongly accredited hatchback units. This paved the way for the LTFRB to act as the sole accreditor of TNVS operators instead of TNCs. MC 2018-005 was later released to help transition those already accredited until hatchbacks are phased out on 2021 from serving as TNVS. “Ibig sabihin noon, kung walang problema yung 2,235 (hatchbacks) na nag-apply doon sa master list, dapat po tumatakbo siya hanggang 2021 (That means if there are no problems with the 2,235 which applied in the master list, they can operate until 2021),” Bolano said. However, no new TNVS applications from hatchback operators are processed by the LTFRB following said orders from the DOTr, he added. TNVS counsel Ariel Inton challenged LTFRB's definition of TNVS vehicle types which are allowed in the department order. “Meron bang nakalagay na bawal ang hatchback sa (Did it say that hatchbacks are not allowed in the) department order? In fact, if you construe what the department order says, all other similar vehicles, malawak ‘yun (that’s broad). A similar vehicle would be a four-wheel vehicle,” Inton said. LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III, on the other hand, said legal opinions will vary on the matter but the DOTr has made it clear on their department orders what vehicle types are allowed for TNVS. “There is a listing. AUV, Sedan, SUV...The minimum is sedan and it goes all the way up to an SUV. And it says any similar vehicles,” Delgra said.

Ernesto Perez, ARTA officer-in-charge, director general, said the issue of \"red-tape\" in securing CPCs would not be solved until the question on bank conformity is resolved. This was tackled during a dialogue with the LTFRB, Department of Transportation (DOTr), and TNVS groups at the LTFRB central office in Quezon City. “But we all know that the LTFRB has no regulatory power over the bank. And we all know, as a practicing lawyer for many years, we all know that (a bank’s) main concern is to protect its investment, protect its interest,” Perez said. Perez said banks impose requirements that are hard to comply with for small TNVS operators. “Maybe for the big operators, PHP10,000 or PHP50,000 maybe peanuts. But for the ordinary driver, this really matters much,” Perez said. He said TNVS franchising is a “regulatory innovation” and the LTFRB should be more understanding to TNVS operators since there is no clear governing legal framework. “Naiintindihan ko po 'yung sitwasyon (I understand the situation), if we cannot appeal and we do not expect the bank to grant our request, then we turn our appeal to the LTFRB to relax its rule on bank conformity,” Perez said. LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III noted that Perez raised a good point, adding it is fundamental to set certain standards, “and part of that standard are the requirements”. He said bank conformity is a requirement between three parties, the LTFRB, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the banks and so it must be discussed with other parties before a decision can be made. “The issue that was raised is valid, and that is precisely why kailangan pag-usapan (it needs to discussed). Rest assured that we will address this, we will have to take it up with the bank and with LTO as well,” Delgra said. The LTFRB chief said the discussion and a decision on requiring bank conformity would happen within the week. Leniency to ‘colorum’ TNVS operators Lawyer Ariel Inton, TNVS legal counsel and president of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, asked the LTFRB to be more lenient to colorum (unregistered) TNVS operators due to issues with the processing of TNVS provisional authorities (PAs) and CPCs. Perez reiterated Delgra’s point that giving an exception to colorum TNVS operators may force the board to apply the rule to all transport services for the sake of fairness. However, he said that since TNVS franchising is a regulatory innovation, TNVS drivers and operators should be distinguished from an ordinary colorum operator. Delgra said the matter would also be discussed with the board along with other concerns of the TNVS community during the dialogue.

During a dialogue with TNVS groups and stakeholders in Quezon City, LTFRB Technical Division head Joel Bolano said some changes have been made to the current process of securing franchises known as provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) for TNVS drivers and operators. Beginning the third week of July, the LTFRB will add more hearing dates to address the huge volume of TNVS applications. “Yung isang araw, dalawang araw namin na hearing for TNVS, gagawin na po namin na three to four days. Siguraduhin lang po natin na complete requirements na po tayo (The usual one, two days hearing for TNVS will be extended to three to four days. Just make sure that the requirements are complete),” Bolano told operators during the dialogue. The move would lessen the processing time to secure papers and at the same time allow the regulator to process more applications, he added. It will also allot two Saturdays every month for follow-ups on applications for all types of transport services. Upon the acceptance of a valid and complete TNVS application, the LTFRB will automatically give a PA to operate for 90 days if the applicant has a previous application and if they provide passenger insurance and proof of garage. Bolano added that to get a PA, new applicants will also need to secure a bank certificate of conformity which is necessary for public transport as the usage of private vehicles for public service is in violation of bank rules. The streamlining came after drivers affected by the deactivation from the system of ride-hailing app Grab for failure to secure proper permits to operate in the ride-hailing industry sought for the LTFRB to reduce the process of franchise application. In the same dialogue, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the agency was doing its best to address the concerns of TNVS groups. “On behalf of the board, humihingi ako ng paumanhin (I ask for forgiveness). And that’s precisely why we are addressing it. We’re trying to find ways to address this,” Delgra said. On Saturday, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) stepped in and arranged dialogues between leaders of the TNVS community, the LTFRB and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) after complaints of red-tape were filed against the LTFRB by TNVS drivers and operators. The LTFRB did not participate in the first two dialogues but arranged a third dialogue after a transport holiday by the TNVS community last Monday. Lawyer Ariel Inton, president of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, expressed satisfaction with some of the changes that the regulator presented to them. “Yung sa proseso, ito ay magiging mas madali. At yung mga requirements ay mabawasan. In fairness to the board, madami sila pinakita na pagbabago na gagawin nila sa proseso,” Inton said. Janina Pineda, president of the TNVS group Road Grabbers, said even though the dialogue took about six hours with no breaks, the opportunity given to members of their community to air their grievances was worth it but its results are yet to be seen. “Lahat ng operator nagkaroon ng chance na mag-speak up regarding their concern (All operators got a chance to speak up regarding their concern). Most concerns are ongoing for a board of directors meeting so we’ll wait within this week for updates,” Pineda said. But Jun de Leon, leader of the Metro Manila Hatchback Community and Laban TNVS, expressed his dissatisfaction after the regulator stood their ground on prohibiting hatchback operators and drivers from becoming licensed TNVS. “Hindi naman dialogue yung nangyari dito, 'yung gusto pa rin nila ang nasunod. For review, eh hanggang kelan 'yung for review? Samantalang kabuhayan ng pamilya yung inaalala natin dito kaya gusto natin ng agarang solusyon (This was not a dialogue. What was followed was only what the LTFRB wanted. But livelihood of families are at stake and that’s why we want a quick solution),” de Leon said.

Poe made the statement after the TNVS drivers held a nationwide \"transport holiday\", wherein they went offline from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday to protest government policies affecting their operations. “We will continue to work hard in the Senate to tackle bills that would put in place a law governing TNVS operations,” Poe told reporters in a text message. Poe said this includes the re-filing of a bill, which proposes that only Transport Network Companies such as Grab will be directly regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). She emphasized the need to strike a balance on the need to regulate and to serve the riding public. Poe particularly noted that the LTFRB should make its policies more consistent and processes much easier for the TNVS sector. “While we respect the LTFRB’s mandate to regulate the industry and ensure the safety of the riding public, we also have to recognize that call to make the process easier according to the Ease of Doing Business Act is only for the good of everyone,” Poe said. \"Matagal na nating kinilala ang kakayanan ng industriyang ito na tugunan ang kakulangan ng maayos na transportasyon sa kalakhang Maynila. Bakit natin kailangang pahirapan ang lahat? (We have already recognized the capacity of this industry to make up for the lack of an efficient transport system in Metro Manila. Why then are we making things difficult for everyone?),” she added. Poe also questioned the LTFRB for not implementing its Memorandum Circular 2018-005, which allows existing hatchbacks in the system to continue for three more years in order to recoup their investment. “These are issues which have been raised in previous hearings of the Senate committee on public services. What we should look into is not just the necessity of the requirements issued, but the scope of what the LTFRB can regulate and the consistency of its regulations,” Poe said. “Hindi pwedeng paiba-iba ang ipinatutupad na regulasyon. Hindi ito patas sa mga mananakay at sa mga namumuhunan (We should not be unpredictable in the implementation of regulations. It is not fair to commuters and to investors),” Poe added. Poe said the transport holiday is an opportunity for the parties to come to the table, especially with the scheduled dialogue between the LTFRB and the TNVS drivers on Tuesday to address concerns relating to the “process of accreditation and the necessity of such regulations and requirements.” “We support the dialogue tomorrow and hope that both the LTFRB and TNVS drivers can come to terms for the good of the riding public. While the parties are on the table, we hope that the LTFRB can consider lifting the deactivation on those who failed to comply with the requirements,” Poe said.

Based on a complaint filed by TNVS groups, ARTA Deputy Director General Ernesto Perez said they are mandated to investigate allegations of the groups against the LTFRB and intervene to solve issues of bureaucracy in the government. “If there are allegations of delay in the processing of documents, these are included in the mandate of the ARTA to hear complaints from the people,” Perez said in Filipino. He said Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-005, a document issued by the LTFRB and signed by two officials of the board, should allow the registration of hatchbacks as TNVS. “We read a circular approved by the LTFRB on February 2018. And there are no other circulars revoking it. Until such time it is revoked, it should be implemented. Now, if there are TNVS with pending applications following the said circular, it should be acted upon in a timely manner,” Perez said. The MC, signed by former LTFRB Board Members Aileen Lizada and Ronaldo Corpus in 2018 reads: “Hatchback units shall be accepted subject to a transition period of three years in order for the peers to recoup their investments.” He said it is still too early to render a decision on the matter as only one party to the issue has given its arguments. “We’re not giving a pre-judgment. We’re also not saying who is wrong on this issue. We need to hear both sides of the issue first,” he said. During the dialogue, Jun de Leon, leader of the Metro Manila Hatchback Community and Laban TNVS, said the ban of the LTFRB on hatchbacks is affecting a large part of the TNVS community. He estimated that more than 1,200 drivers and operators are affected by the LTFRB ban. “Kasama po ang pamilya nila na dito lang kumukuha ng pangkabuhayan (Their families are also relying on this for their livelihood),” de Leon said. More dialogues on the issue Perez said they have set more dialogues next week with concerned agencies and parties to fully address the issues involving the TNVS and hatchbacks. “On Monday, we will have CSC Commissioner Aileen Lizada with us to have a dialogue with the TNVS. We also invited LTFRB chairperson [Martin] Delgra and Usec. Mark de Leon of the DOTr [Department of Transportation] to join us in our dialogue,” Perez said. He, however, said the LTFRB has formally withdrawn from the dialogue on Saturday and Monday. It will sit down with ARTA, TNVS groups, and other stakeholders on Tuesday (July 9). Christian Yamson, executive director of labor group Defend Job Philippines, welcomed the dialogue opened by the ARTA and hoped that the succeeding dialogues will mark the beginning of a better environment for TNVS operators and drivers. “At the end of the day, pag maayos ang kanilang proseso, na-accredit sila, maraming mga TNVS na maging available, magiging beneficial naman ‘yan sa part ng mga consumers (if their process is proper, drivers and operators are accredited, it will all be beneficial to the consumers),” Yamson said. Plight of TNVS community Janina Pineda, president of TNVS group Road Grabbers, welcomed the dialogue with ARTA and other government agencies, calling for an amnesty for all deactivated drivers and operators. “Gawan ng proseso para hindi naman agad-agad mawalan ng hanap buhay ang mga driver, operator and kanilang pamilya na makaka-apekto sa kanilang mga riders (A process must be made so that the livelihood of affected drivers, operators and their families must not suddenly disappear),” Pineda said. He said the TNVS community request is for the LTFRB to come up with an efficient process that will simplify documentary requirements. “Marami kasing mga dokumento na umaabot ng libo-libo na nagiging dahilan kung bakit hindi nagpapatuloy ang isang simpleng operator para magpatuloy kumuha ng permit (Because there are so many required documents, reaching thousands, that become the reason why operators do not continue with the process of securing a permit from the LTFRB),” she said. She added that it could take months before proper documents are released by the LTFRB, noting that TNVS drivers who have filed the proper documents pending a provisional authority (PA) should not be deactivated or fined. Pineda said aside from the 5,000 deactivated TNVS, more TNVS drivers fear to go out and serve their clients for fear of being apprehended for colorum operation. “There are many drivers who are offline nowadays. Why? Because they are scared to drive and get fined PHP120,000 to 200,000 if caught as colorum,” she said. A group of TNVS drivers and operators initially announced a transport holiday on Monday due to alleged “problematic” policies of the LTFRB.

For this year’s celebration, frontline agencies will distribute a limited number of Malasakit Help Kits to fathers in various airports, seaports, land terminals and train stations. These kits may contain drinks and light snacks, battery-operated fan, face towel, foldable fans, wet wipes, hand sanitizer or lotion of permitted volume, and ballpens, among others. Participating agencies include the Manila International Airport Authority, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, Civil Aeronautics Board and Office for Transportation Security for the aviation and airports sector; MRT-3, Light Rail Transit Authority, and Philippine National Railways for the railways sector; Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office, and Toll Regulatory Board for the road sector; and Philippine Ports Authority, Cebu Ports Authority, Maritime Industry Authority, and Philippine Coast Guard for the maritime sector. Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Arthur Tugade instructed the distribution of Malasakit Help Kits to passengers as an act of appreciation for their continued patronage of the country’s transportation hubs, as well as an expression of ‘malasakit’ or care beyond duty or requirement especially to women, children, senior citizens, and Persons with Disabilities. “President Rodrigo Duterte tasked the DOTr to give the Filipinos a comfortable life. While we do our best to enhance mobility and connectivity through transportation infrastructure, we also want to express our ‘malasakit’ to the public through small gestures that will give them additional convenience and comfort in their travels,” Tugade said. The distribution of Malasakit Help Kits also serves to strengthen the role of MHDs as a one-stop shop for passenger assistance in airports, seaports, train stations, and land terminals. It serves as a convenient and accessible nexus for various government services in public transport. As an integrated assistance center, the DOTr Malasakit Help Desk can receive or handle airport/seaport/terminal-related inquiries and complaints, provide road-related assistance (i.e., booking TNVS/taxi rides), facilitate the refund of terminal fees, provide attestation of cause of trip cancellation or delays, deliver emergency medical assistance, accept reports of possible security threats, and extend other forms of assistance to passengers or commuters. In this regard, Tugade expressed gratitude to all DOTr attached agencies that are in the front lines of ‘malasakit’ service. “We are one government and, therefore, one team. I truly feel the unity and collective effort of our sectoral offices and attached agencies in realizing the directive of the President to make the lives of our countrymen comfortable,” he said. Malasakit Help Kits will also be distributed on other special occasions such as Mother’s Day, International Women’s Day, and Valentine’s Day, as well as during “Oplan Biyaheng Ayos” campaigns in dense transit seasons such as Christmas, All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day (Undas), Holy Week, and school opening.

For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III urged hatchback drivers to substitute their units with vehicles that are compliant with its rules and regulations. Delgra said the drivers were given a transition period by the Board to be able to comply with its directive. “Hatchback is not allowed under the rules kasi maliit yung engine (their engines are small). It’s not up to the standards for what a taxi service and TNVS is. So as not to disrupt the service and in consideration of those hatchbacks at the time we allowed a transition for hatchbacks but only until after their franchises would expire,” Delgra told reporters on the sidelines of its hearing on the deactivation of TNVS drivers.

Cu said Grab deactivated 10,000 TNVS drivers who have no documentation such as certificates of public convenience (CPCs) or PAs from January to May. The ridesharing firm deactivated 500 drivers on a weekly basis during that period. He said 3,000 TNVS drivers were saved from deactivation last Monday because they were able to submit proof of PAs and CPCs to the LTFRB. The company earlier announced that 8,000 drivers were set for deactivation on June 10 because they do not have PAs from the Board. Grab said they deactivated the drivers in compliance with the June 7 deadline set by the LTFRB for the application of 20,000 TNVS units, which was opened last December. The company also assured its riders that it will ensure that its fares will still be able to maintain the 2x surge price amid the reduction of the supply of its TNVS units. “Our team will closely monitor that should prices go up, we will adjust fares downwards as we still have commitments to the PCC (Philippine Competition Commission),” Cu said.

LTFRB chairperson Martin Delgra III noted that most of the TNVS drivers on the system of TNCs are not online on a full-time basis, resulting in the lack of supply for its riders. “Whatever the numbers are on their system right now that goes to all accredited TNCs di po lahat ay online (most of them are not online). Lower number of those are online anytime. It is up for the TNCs to get the majority of those who are not online to go online to serve demand. Yun po ang kasagutan (That is the solution),” Delgra told reporters. “What is clear is not all of them accredited to any TNCs are full-time. Kapag lahat ng nasa system (If all TNVS units on their system) are online, there will be no issue on the lack of supply,” he added. The Board is also opening 10,000 slots for new applications of TNVS units starting June 10 after it opened 20,000 slots last December until June 7. “After getting provisional authority (PA) or certificates of public convenience (CPC), TNVS applicants would then apply for accreditation with any of the active accredited TNCs. Once accredited and active online, they can start to accept bookings. TNVS may be accredited with more than one TNC,” Delgra said. The LTFRB has accredited eight TNCs-- Ipara Technologies and Solutions Inc, Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc, Hype Transport Systems, Inc, Micab Systems Corp., E-Pick Me Up Inc, GoLag, Aztech Solution, and RYD Global. The accreditation of Grab Philippines, which has the biggest share of TNVS units, has yet to be renewed. Data from the LTFRB show that there are 40,522 TNVS units with PAs or CPCs as of May 29. Meanwhile, the LTFRB has issued a show cause order to Grab last Thursday to explain the deactivation of at least 8,000 TNVS drivers without PAs. The ridesharing company is set to appear before a hearing of the Board set on June 11. “The LTFRB regularly sends a report to Grab containing the list of drivers who apply for LTFRB accreditation. Drivers who do not apply at all for a Certificate of Public Convenience should have already been deactivated by Grab per LTFRB order issued months ago,” the LTFRB said in a statement. There are more than 5,000 unclaimed PAs issued by the LTFRB. Earlier, Grab said it deactivated the drivers in compliance with the June 7 deadline set by the LTFRB for the application of 20,000 TNVS units, which was opened last December.

This, as the DOTr reiterated that amendments to Republic Act (RA) No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code are needed to allow motorcycles to operate as public transport. The law prohibits motorcycles from operating as public transportation services. “The DOTr has maintained that the best recourse for conversion of motorcycle taxis to public transport is amendment of the law. In fact, this lack of an enabling law is best reiterated by the various proposed bills in the House (of Representatives) and the Senate seeking to allow motorcycle taxis to operate as a public transport mode,” the department said in a statement on Saturday. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to review the issue of allowing motorcycles for public transportation. The TWG was mandated to conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of motorcycles and drivers for public transport service, which include determining the types of motorcycle that can be awarded a franchise, the minimum cubic centimeter (CC) capacity, travel speed, franchise routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for motorcycle bikers looking to register as a public utility vehicle driver. “Much as it understands the perspective of some lawmakers on the issue of motorcycle taxis operating as public transport, the DOTr also seeks public understanding as its TWG threshes out the numerous concerns involved in the proposal, foremost of which is commuter safety,” the DOTr said. Various lawmakers have called on the DOTr to issue a department order (DO) that would allow motorcycle ride-hailing firms to provide public transport to passengers. They have noted that the transportation department has issued an order in 2015, which introduced the category of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) that allowed private vehicles under transportation network companies to operate as public transportation. The DOTr said issuing a DO to legalize motorcycles-for-hire should be based on existing laws. “According to Republic Act 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code), passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (‘for hire’), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification. On the other hand, RA 4136 clearly does not allow motorcycles to be classified as ‘for hire’ or for public utility,” the department’s statement read. The DOTr said that issuance of a DO will violate the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court against motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas to halt its operations last December, which might lead to filing of contempt charges against transportation officials. “The DOTr wishes to reiterate that it does not intend to antagonize Angkas. In fact, the DOTr has welcomed motorcycle groups in TWG discussions to thresh out the requirements and other contingent issues. These issues are ultimately directed at regulation for passenger safety and nothing else,” it said. The TWG, consisting of the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools, has started its deliberations last January 18. The group will submit a report on its deliberations to Congress as inputs for lawmakers to decide on the proposed amendments to RA 4136. The House has approved on second reading a bill that will allow motorcycles to provide public transport earlier this week. House Bill No. 8959 or the Motorcycles for Hire Act will authorize the LTFRB to legalize the operation of motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Under the bill, motorcycles must be registered and granted a certificate of public convenience or special permit by the LTFRB.

In a statement, Quezon City Rep. Winnie Castelo said the DOTr can issue a Department Order to allow Angkas’ ride-hailing operations in the same manner that transportation network companies (TNC) or transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab were allowed to do so. “A mere DO can suffice to lessen the suffering of the commuting public. DOTr should realize this. If they cannot provide efficient and reliable mass transportation system as they are mandated to do, they should at least be creative and use modern technology. We should not be technical and legalistic on this while millions of Filipinos are suffering from traffic and losing PHP2 billion in lost opportunities,” Castelo said. “DOTr can give its best Christmas gift to the suffering public by withdrawing its petition to the Supreme Court against Angkas,” Castelo added. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) earlier this month ordering Angkas to stop its operations. Castelo also noted that there are pending bills filed in Congress that would legalize motorcycles for hire. “This would take a lot of time because of the long legislative process. There are other ways to legalize it, to expedite its operations especially now that we are suffering from traffic congestion aggravated due to the holidays,” Castelo said. The DOTr has created a technical working group (TWG) that will review the issue of making motorcycles as a mode of public transport. In a statement on Friday, the DOTr said the TWG will consist of the DOTr, Land Transportation Office, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Philippine National Police–Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations, and law schools. The TWG will conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of the motorcycles and drivers for public transport service which are: the types of motorcycles to be permitted; acceptable travel speed of motorcycles for hire; whether to allow the motorcycles on all roads or be limited only to secondary roads or areas not serviced by large vehicles such as buses or trucks; seat and helmet requirements and training for motorcycle bikers that will register as public utility vehicle drivers. The Supreme Court issued a TRO last December 5 against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers. Tugade has ordered the LTFRB to apprehend Angkas bikers, who deliberately defy the order of the high court. Angkas bikers and operators proven to have continued their service will be meted a PHP6,000 fine and to have their vehicles impounded for three months. They will also be blacklisted from securing a franchise from the LTFRB.

MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the agency respects the view of the senators, who cited that it was crafted without consultation with various sectors and this might lead to heavy vehicular volume on alternate routes. “We respect the resolution. What we are trying to do is to convene the Metro Manila Council hopefully soon,” Garcia said in a TV interview Thursday. The MMC is the policy-making body of MMDA, consisting of the mayors of the 16 cities and a municipality in Metro Manila. Senate Resolution No. 845 urges the MMC and the MMDA to suspend the HOV scheme and look for long-term solutions to ease traffic in Metro Manila. The resolution pointed out that the driver-only ban would effectively deprive thousands of people of the use of the country’s major thoroughfare since it would be in effect during the working and commuting hours of the week. Garcia said traffic has eased in Edsa during the first day of the dry-run Wednesday. “Lumuwag ang Edsa. Napunta yung traffic sa mga alternate routes (Traffic eased on Edsa and was diverted to alternate routes),” he added. He reiterated that the scheme aims to encourage carpooling among motorists and is one of the short-term measures being implemented by the MMDA to improve the traffic situation in the metropolis. “HOV is not a band aid solution; it’s a short term measure while infrastructure projects are being constructed for the long term,” Garcia said. Data from the MMDA show that a total of 2,905 vehicles were monitored to have violated the HOV scheme through closed circuit television cameras under the no contact apprehension policy and handheld cameras of its enforcers on the ground Thursday morning. A total of 3,628 violators were flagged down during the first day of the dry-run on Wednesday. The MMDA is eyeing to purchase thermal cameras to effectively catch violators of the expanded HOV traffic scheme. Ridesharing firm Grab Philippines, meanwhile, urged its passengers to avoid setting pickup and dropoff points along Edsa. The company encourages its drivers to use the yellow lane and take the nearest exit away from Edsa if it is unavoidable to pass by without a passenger. “We ask our drivers and passengers to be patient as we work with the regulators to set an acceptable scheme that carefully considers sentiment and suggestions of our TNVS market,” Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said in a statement. Around 60-70 percent of vehicles that pass along Edsa have only single occupants, according to data from the MMDA. There are 367,738 vehicles traversing the major artery daily, 67 percent of which are private vehicles based on Edsa's annual average daily traffic in 2017.

The MMDA's policymaking body, the Metro Manila Council (MMC) that consists of mayors in the National Capital Region, approved the traffic scheme during its regular meeting Tuesday. Under the policy, vehicles with two or more occupants, including the driver, would be able to pass through Edsa using the special lane. “Sa usapin po ng guidelines, implementing rules and regulations at penalties, ano 'yung rush hours mga oras na kung kailan bawal, paano ma-monitor ang mga heavily tinted vehicles, wala pa po kaming maisasagot dahil tinatapos po namin 'yung guidelines na mag-fit po sa lahat ng sektor (On the matter of guidelines, implementing rules and regulations as well as penalties, what are the rush hours and what time vehicles are not allowed, how to monitor heavily tinted vehicles, we cannot yet answer that at the moment as we are still crafting guidelines that would fit all sectors),” MMDA Spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a television interview Wednesday. The MMDA hopes the HOVL would encourage carpooling among motorists to further ease the traffic situation in Metro Manila. “'Yung mga guidelines kailangan pa pag-meetingan at i-submit for consultation. Hintayin ninyo po muna ang guidelines. Magkakaroon pa po ng dry run at publication within 15 days before implementation (The guidelines are yet to be deliberated and submitted for consultation. Let us wait for them. A dry run will be conducted and these guidelines will be published within 15 days before implementation),” Pialago added. Ridesharing firm Grab Philippines said it will be initiating dialogues with the government to seek clarification on the policy. “We will initiate dialogues with the authorities and our regulators as we seek clarity on this new scheme. We will include your TNVS leaders in the discussions to make sure that your concerns will be well represented,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement. Other countries like Indonesia have the same policy and Grab has found a way to make it work, Cu said. He assured Grab's drivers and operators that they “will do (their) best to also make it work here.” The MMDA had proposed the HOVL last year to reduce vehicular volume along Edsa. Vehicles with at least two or more passengers were allowed to pass through Edsa using the fifth and leftmost lanes. A dry-run was conducted in December last year to test the feasibility of the scheme but the MMDA later decided to cancel its implementation as its traffic enforcers were having difficulty inspecting heavily-tinted vehicles.

Grab said the per minute rate was in accordance with Department Order 2015-011 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) which allows transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose their own fare rates subject to the oversight of the LTFRB. “DO 2015-011 shall be considered valid until it is set aside with finality in an appropriate case by a competent court,” the firm said in its motion for reconsideration which was filed on July 19 and released to the media late Monday. “As such, when respondent began imposing the assailed PHP2 per minute fare on June 5, 2017 to ensure that its hardworking TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) drivers would still be able to make ends meet despite the worsening traffic conditions, respondent did so in good faith and pursuant to prevailing government issuances at the time,” it added. The DOTr has issued DO 2018-013 last June authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. DO 2017-11 which was issued by the department on June 19, 2017 allows TNCs to have a pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB. “Any issuance by this Honorable Board which would ultimately determine the fare that may be charged by TNCs and TNVS should only be applied prospectively and should not prejudice respondent for relying on a valid and subsisting DO 2015-011,” according to Grab. The company further said that it has informed the Board of its fare structure which includes the per-minute charge. “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,\" the firm further said. MyTaxi.PH is the registered company of Grab in the country. The LTFRB said in its order that the fine shall be reimbursed through rebates that will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier. The amount of the rebate is limited to the portion of the income of Grab which is directly related to the PHP2-per minute charge during the period of its imposition. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any per minute rate when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flag down rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges.

In her dissenting opinion dated last July 9, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the per-minute charge was imposed before the Department of Transportation (DOTr) issued Department Order No. 2017-011 or the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines for Public Utility Vehicles on June 19, 2017. The order authorizes the LTFRB to determine the fare structure of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). “Facts would show that the basis of the respondent in prescribing the per-minute charge was Department Order No. 2015-011. Additionally, the assailed PHP2-per-minute charge was communicated to the Board, through the Office of the Chairman. Emphasis is made that the PHP2 per-minute charge was set when Department Order No. 2015-011 was not yet amended,” Lizada said. The Board order fines Grab PHP10 million for overcharging and to reimburse the per-minute charge through future ride bookings of its passengers. “Thus, in the imposition of any administrative sanction, the Board must only do the same after the effectivity of Department Order No. 2017-011. Said issuance should be applied prospectively and not retroactively. However, if after thorough evaluation and investigation, respondent will still impose the per-minute charge after the effectivity of the said Department Order, then and only then can the Board impose the appropriate penalty. Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,” she added. Grab has reiterated that the PHP2-per-minute travel charge is legal, adding that it is deliberating on its next legal moves regarding the LTFRB order. “But no matter how we decide to move forward from this, be assured, Grab will stay,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. Department Order No. 2015-011, which was issued by the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), authorizes transportation network companies to set their own fares subject to the oversight of the LTFRB. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until April 19 this year, when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The LTFRB, in its order dated July 9, said the rebates should be availed of for only 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab starts its implementation. “The amount of the rebate shall be limited to the portion of the income of the respondent only, directly related to or arising from the PHP2-per-minute during the period of its unauthorized imposition,” according to the Board. Grab may be able to file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days upon release of the order and may appeal to the DOTr in case this was denied. The LTFRB has previously said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in December 2016. The order states that Grab should impose a flag-down rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per km., excluding per-minute travel charges.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said.

Kush is a variety of hybrid marijuana that originated in South Asian countries and also cultivated in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Unlike the common cannabis plants propagated in the country, kush is a dwarf type of marijuana plant, making it more untraceable for authorities. In the Philippines, it is found in Kalinga and Sagada. The proliferation of kush started in Europe prior to its cultivation in Kalinga. The price varies from 20 to 25 euros (PHP1,230 to PHP1,530) per gram. In the Philippines, it is sold from PHP1 million to PHP1.5 million per kilogram. “Kush undergoes a process called ice process, manual and mechanical process to produce a chocolate like result,” Aquino said. Hashish is an extract of cannabis plant containing concentrated psychoactive resins. The price of hashish varies from PHP20,000 to PHP25,000 per gram. These types of drugs have the same effects as common marijuana, like euphoria, prolonged feeling of being hungry, increase heart rate, anxiety, panic attacks, and always in deep thought. But their effects are heavier and more potent. The cannabis plant, which is the main ingredient of kush and hashish, is transported from Kalinga to Sagada in Mountain Province, the pick-up point, before it is delivered to Quezon City. The cultivation of this type of marijuana is not limited to Kalinga. It is also cultivated in Mindanao. Aquino said that drug personalities continue to develop these types of drugs, which are being sold to young professionals, college students, young celebrities, and children of prominent and affluent families including politicians using Transportation Network Vehicle Service or TNVS to evade authorities,” Aquino said. The PDEA chief said these celebrities and politicians are subject of PDEA case build-ups, treating them as red flag personalities, considering that they have personal contact numbers with the arrested drug personalities.

The antitrust body through its report, reiterated that the acquisition of Uber by Grab has resulted in a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in the ride-hailing market. But the review also found out that “an overwhelming majority of riders” would still continue using on-demand car-based private transportation online booking service via mobile ride-hailing application despite a 5 to 10 percent increase, “which is borne out by actual events of post-transaction”. It was also noted that there are key qualitative differences between TNVS and other modes of public transportation. Moreover, the PCC stated in the SOC that in the aftermath of the merger, Grab now controls 93 percent of TNVS registered vehicles, solidifying its unrivaled dominance in the relevant market. Despite the increase in supply of drivers after the deal, Grab fares have continued to increase. “This upward trend in price is apparent through the higher fares and increased frequency of surge-pricing applied by grab,” the SOC read. “The review indicated that prior to the transaction, prices charged by Grab have been flat to declining, while post-transaction prices have been increasing, despite the supply of drivers available to Grab post-transaction,” it added. The Commission also cited the declining quality of service of Grab after the transaction, which include increased driver cancellation, forced cancellations of rides, and increased waiting time. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were likely less to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” the SOC noted. PCC’s issuance of SOC is part of its motu proprio review on the Grab-Uber deal launched on April 3. The Commission has given the parties time to file their comments on the SOC. The PCC earlier said that based on its review, the Commission has the power to approve or block the deal. But the parties can also give their commitments and remedies to address the anti-competitive concerns of the PCC.

MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim thanked Grab Philippines head Brian Cu for the donation of 100 body cameras during Monday’s flag-raising ceremony. “These are the equipment that we need. This will go a very long way in terms of making a difference in performing the duties of our traffic enforcers. This is very important. Thank you very much. Let's continue to help each other for the good of Metro Manila,” said Lim during the turn-over ceremony. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the donation would be a big boost to the agency’s operation, particularly in going after erring motorists on the road. “This will show transparency in our jobs because there will be evidence of the apprehension through video recording. These cameras will serve as protection ng traffic enforcers and also of the motorists,” Garcia said. He said that the donation will not in any way protect erring Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers under Grab should they commit any traffic violation. “There is no such order. These donated body cameras will show transparency. These gadgets will somehow protect our traffic enforcers who would be harassed or verbally abused. For motorists, there will be evidence if the traffic enforcers ask for bribes,” said Garcia. He said the body cameras will be issued to traffic enforcers manning Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) and chokepoint areas in the metropolis after undergoing training. “We are giving warning to all motorists who violate a traffic regulation, do not attempt to bribe our traffic personnel. If you know you are wrong, then just let the traffic enforcer give you a citation ticket,\" said Garcia. He said the agency hopes to procure more body cameras for other traffic enforcers in the future but it cannot be easily done due to budget constraints. For his part, Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Grab Philippines Public Affairs head, expressed optimism that the body cameras would help the agency in managing traffic in the metropolis. “We are one with the MMDA. They need eyes on the road. They need to be visible during any apprehension or any part of their work to dispel any questionable transactions between the parties,\" Gonzales said. The body camera, which costs PHP9,000 each, can be used all throughout the day as they have 10 to 12 hours battery life. Gonzales also pointed out that the donation will not spare even their drivers if they are cited for a traffic violation. “We are putting our foot forward in saying that please go ahead. If there is erring TNVS driver under Grab that committed any violation, apprehend them by all means,” said Gonzales.

This, as Grab has reiterated its commitment to work with transport regulators on replenishing the supply of drivers in response to increasing demand from its passengers. “Our immediate priority is to work with regulators to onboard the 6,000 displaced drivers who are not part of the LTFRB masterlist. We are continuously working with government agencies to find a long-term solution on the supply issue,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a statement. To address the situation, Grab is regularly releasing incentives to increase driver productivity by at least 15 percent per day. The firm also encourages its riders to utilize the Grab Share feature on its mobile app to share its available cars to fellow passengers and to save on fuel costs. Passengers may also use GrabCar’s Multi-Stop feature for multiple destinations instead of booking separately. “We also seek our passengers to plan their trips and book ahead of time,” Toh said. Grab currently receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests each day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve the riding public. The overflow in demand and severe undersupply of cars has resulted in longer waiting times for passengers or not getting allocated a vehicle according to the ridesharing firm.

We've seen people posting about driver cancellations, their rude behavior, all of this we see and we know that it's been a very difficult time for the people that we are serving,\" she added. To improve driver behavior, Grab will implement an improved Driver Code of Conduct (COC), a set of updated rules and regulations that will stipulate the tasks and traits of a responsible Grab driver-partner. Drivers must comply with the COC for them to continue access to the Grab app. A Driver Academy will also be established that will provide modules on road courtesy, customer service and data privacy and social media handling on top of driver onboarding and rehabilitation training services. Grab drivers will also be qualified for perks such as discounted gas prices, driver lounge and maintenance discounts under the company’s rewards program. Passenger will be able to expect a new app interface for iOS and Android by July. The new app will enable them to easily set their pick-up points and quickly select their preferred service.

Grab said the suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides. “Driver numbers continue to drop as uncertainty in maintaining sustainable livelihood increases. With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs. If we will subtract something from the pool, we will replenish,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination, everyone is working on the fly.

Grab Philippines said it will comply with the order of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to maintain the independent business operations of Uber and Grab for the duration of its motu propio review of the acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. “With respect to the interim measures imposed by the Commission, the Commission has required the parties to maintain independent business operations and separate operation of the ride-hailing platforms, which means that the Uber app should be kept open, throughout the review period, but left it to the parties to agree on cost allocation. Grab believes that this measure increases the transaction costs of the parties, contrary to the spirit and rationale of interim measures. Grab intends to discuss this matter with the PCC,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on 25 March and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure. In the spirit of cooperating with the PCC, Grab has also agreed to continue to bear the costs of the Uber app extension (from March 25 to April 8) until April 15, 2018. Our understanding from the PCC is that this interim arrangement, which was fully explained to the PCC, is not a breach of its Order,” Cu added. Grab also said that although the Uber app will be able to operate, it has already limited functionality and support. Uber has disclosed that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. “Grab noted that the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) has expressed concerns pertaining to customer support and safety issues arising from Uber’s limited operations. Grab wishes to stress that this interim arrangement is only for the purposes of satisfying what the PCC appears to require until Grab is able to discuss with the PCC,” Cu said. Grab will seek for a dialogue with the PCC to present its views on the impact of the interim measure on its business operation. Grab's app continues to operate as Uber drivers migrate to their platform. It will continue to provide support to accredited transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers who wants to become a part of its system. Grab earlier said that Uber’s Southeast Asia operations will continue only until April 8 after acquiring its ride-sharing and food delivery businesses last March 26. The PCC has formulated various interim measures that would ensure the credibility and integrity of its review on the merger of Uber and Grab for possible anti-competition concerns. Among these include maintaining the independence of their business operations; refraining from sharing confidential information, such as pricing and operations; and refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses. Both Uber and Grab were also asked to refrain from performing any practice that could lead to reduced viability of their businesses and prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies. The PCC is conducting its review to determine how the acquisition of Uber would affect the ride-sharing market, as well as its impact on the thousands of its partner drivers who could be displaced.

I am worried that the deal will be extremely detrimental to commuters because the merger will create a monopoly in the ride-sharing sector which has become very popular as a means to address transportation shortage and problems in the Philippines,” Ejercito said in a statement. On March 26, Singapore-based Grab acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, as well as Uber's operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber's last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. Ejercito noted that the merger has virtually created a monopoly, raising the risks of higher fares. “With Grab capturing 80 percent of the market with this merger, the market will virtually eliminate any form of competition thereby increasing the possibility of riders paying higher fares, and diminished incentives to improve services,” he said. He said the PCC probe into the Grab-Uber merger, as well as similar probes in Singapore and Malaysia by their respective regulators, are a welcome development. “We need to protect our commuters by offering improvements -- in terms of quantity and quality -- in transportation instead of limiting their choices.

Pimentel made the statement following news of the imminent exit of ride-hailing platform pioneer Uber from the country next week. On March 26, Singapore-based Grab acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, as well as Uber's operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber's last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. Pimentel said that given these developments, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry. “Many regular TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride -- an option that will no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9,” he noted. \"There is a legitimate fear among regular TNVS users that Grab's acquisition of Uber's operations in the country will lead to higher fares, which is the natural consequence when a player monopolizes a particular industry,\" he said. He said that it would be beneficial if any one of them starts operation, referring to the reported application of other local ride-sharing companies for accreditation to operate in the country. Last week, the LTFRB said that Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their TNVS accreditations before the agency. \"The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,\" Pimentel said. \"We need real competition, not potential competition. As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service -- and this is where the LTFRB must come in,\" he added. He also called on the LTFRB to \"strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country's TNVS guidelines.\" He urged the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in place mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. \"Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. LTFRB should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” Pimentel said.

Grab is set to meet with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) next week as it expressed their openness to a possible review on its merger with Uber. The company said that the merger will enable them to efficiently provide rides to their customers. “With the increased supply base under one TNC, you should see that allocation times will get better because the density of cars across the maps should get better.

The initiative was derived out of the current practice of TNVS drivers who are accredited by more than one transportation network company (TNC). “The policy on a common supply base for TNVS was envisioned to create a distinct denomination for this type of public transport service and not defined by the individual business models of the TNCs, thus giving the Board a more focused regulatory function on such service,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in a statement over the weekend. “As it is now, the current TNCs and several other TNCs who have expressed interest to the Board to provide this type of service are now free to get the supply from the common supply base for their respective network unbridled by any preference over any TNC,” he added.

The ridesharing firm needs around 70,000-80,000 units in order to replenish their supply of transport services to the commuters. “What this supply cap does is take away the power of the part-timer who adds supply during critical supply. 45k DAILY ACTIVE DRIVERS in Manila make sense, but we need around 70k-80k total franchise holders since not all of them will be driving every day, despite any minimum active hours required,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a social media post.

The signing took place in a ceremony held at the PDEA Activity Area, PDEA National Headquarters in Quezon City on Wednesday. “Realizing that drug syndicates have exploited the use of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), the PDEA, LTFRB and TNCs signed the MOU to stop this new trend of drug trafficking,” PDEA Director General Aaron N. Aquino said. Aquino said drug syndicates now use TNVS or mobile-based application of TNCs to deliver their illicit goods concealed inside packages right at the doorsteps of their intended receivers. Under the MOU, the parties have committed themselves to interdict and prevent the transportation of packages containing illegal drugs using drivers/operators of TNVS, identify and report timely intelligence information for the purpose of anti-drug operations; and implement applicable policies on drug-free workplace in the TNCs premises to ensure that operators with existing contracts with Uber, My Taxi.PH and U-Hop are not involved in any illegal drug activities. Among the provisions stated in the agreement, PDEA shall take the lead role in the conduct of overall investigation, arrest and subsequent filing of drug cases in cooperation with LTRFB and TNCs. Also, PDEA shall map out plans in the prevention of the drug delivery and conduct trainings/seminars to contracting parties relevant to the anti-drug law. “The signed agreement among PDEA, LTFRB and TNCs is a step forward in achieving a new partnership that would suppress the use of TNCs drivers from being exploited as unknowing drug couriers and finally put a stop to this emerging drug trend,” the PDEA chief said. On the other hand, LTFRB pledged to facilitate any programs and activities for the effective implementation of the MOU; encourage TNVS operators/drivers to undergo PDEA trainings to be integrated into the LTFRB Drivers’ Academy Training; provide sanctions and penalties to TNVS operators or drivers who shall violate any policies issued by LTFRB; and provide legible decals and/or stickers with PDEA and LTFRB Hotlines to all TNVS operators/drivers. Aquino said that under the MOU, “the TNCs shall communicate with partners and drivers on the dissemination of the detailed PDEA contact information for the speedy relay of criminal and other suspicious activities to authorities”. Also, the TNCs agreed to exercise due diligence in the selection and hiring of their drivers by requiring the submission of additional identity requirements such as NBI, Police and Barangay Clearances. TNCs shall design a mechanism by which all items for delivery shall be properly marked with the name and complete address of the sender and the consignee to be recorded by the drivers, maintain a record of parties’ transactions under Uber, My Taxi.PH and U-Hop subject to the provisions of the Data Privacy Act, among others.

The company is projecting that there was a 30-percent increase in demand since October this year, while the supply of its transport network vehicle services (TNVS) remain the same, according to Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu. “The extra load of 30-percent growth in demand will be very hard to serve. What we are doing now is trying to improve our allocation methodologies and algorithms -- the way the supply is set, providing incentives to our drivers to get them to drive a bit longer and to expand their opportunities for this holiday season,” Cu said in a press conference at Grab’s main office in Makati City Friday. “The only thing we can do is to stretch our supply because we cannot add more supply,” he added. Grab is not accepting new TNVS applications in compliance with the directive of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last July for transportation network companies (TNCs) not to accept and activate new drivers into their systems, pending review of regulations governing the ridesharing industry. Cu stressed that the TNCs should not be the ones to be blamed for the traffic jams being experienced in Metro Manila. “Well, put it this way. We stopped adding cars in August. Has traffic got better or worse? Traffic has worsened. It’s not the TNCs or TNVS that are causing traffic,” Cu pointed out. He said an average Grab ride is now taking around 45 minutes, up from 38 minutes six months ago. Grab is advising passengers to adjust their travel schedules because of the expected heavy influx of vehicles for the Christmas season. Riders may avail of the app’s carpooling feature Grab Share, wherein they can share rides with passengers traveling in the same direction and split on the payment of the fares. “Grab Share is one of the features that we have to stretch supply because it allows passengers to share their rides. It will help stretch the existing supply base that we have,” Cu explained. Grab currently has around 54,000 accredited TNVS nationwide. Of this number, 20,000 are full-time drivers. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said TNCs are not being blamed but these are among the contributing factors to the heavy traffic in Metro Manila. “On the matter of Metro Manila traffic, we are not blaming them because there are other causes as well. However, they are contributing to the heavy vehicular volume, which is the top cause of the current traffic situation in Metro Manila,” MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The MMDA expects an increase of 50,000 in vehicular volume, based on data gathered from car dealers. Other causes of the traffic in the metropolis are the malls and bus terminals located along EDSA. Around 4,022 stalled vehicles along the major thoroughfare were likewise recorded by the MMDA from January to August this year. MMDA is urging TNCs to comply with the regulations that are being implemented by the LTFRB. “We hope that the TNCs will be able to settle the matter with the LTFRB. They need to comply with the regulations. Whatever the decision of the LTFRB is, we will just enforce it,” said Pialago. LTFRB is eyeing to create a common pool number that will manage the allocation of the TNVS of ridesharing firms to address passenger demand.

Maquidato picked her up but did not ask for payment for the trip out of kindness. Prima passed away last August 22 due to complications of diabetes. During the awarding ceremony, the Ornum family was given a chance to thank Maquidato in person for taking care of Prima. “Our prayers and sympathies go out to Mr. Maquidato’s family. He was a good father to his four children, a good friend to many of his fellow drivers, and a good driver who was always willing to outserve his passengers,” Grab stated as it express condolences to the family of the driver.

In a press conference in UP Diliman, Confederate for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government Employees president Ferdinand Gaite said the plan to phase-out old-jeepneys would result in higher fares ranging from PHP12 to PHP20 from the current PHP8. Gaite said that several government workers with their meager salaries could not afford the more expensive options of transportation such as taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab and Uber. “As it is, transportation expenses already eat up a substantial portion of employee’s salaries. Our take-home pay is not even enough to take us home,” Gaite said. Gaite said that while he sees the need to improve the public transport system in the country, the modernization program should take into account the welfare of the affected sectors and not that of the private investors and capitalists. “In many countries, a highly efficient publicly-owned mass transport system is operated not for profit but as a service of the state to bring the people to their destinations,” Gaite said. For her part, Advocates of Science and Technology for the People (AGHAM) campaign officer Cleng Julve echoed Gaite’s sentiments, saying that the government should undertake schemes that would benefit drivers, operators, and the commuting public. Julve suggested that the government grant subsidy to small and single-unit operators for rehabilitation and upgrading of technology of their vehicles. She said the “palit-jeep” scheme should allow jeepney drivers and operators to swap their old jeepneys with new ones at a subsidized value instead of the current scrap value offered. Other groups present during the press conference include the Crispin B. Beltran Research Center and All-Workers Unity. The Department of Finance reported that the program would cost PHP417 billion for the next five years, including the PHP8 billion subsidy for the purchase of PUVs and PHP3.9 billion for the Office of Transport Cooperatives. Under the PUV Modernization Program, jeepney units that are 15 years old will be replaced with Euro 4 engines or electrically-powered engines with solar panels for roofs. These will also be equipped with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, a GPS navigation system, an Automatic Fare Collection System (AFCS), speed limiters, dashboard cameras, and Wi-Fi.

In a statement, the LTFRB said it has not yet lifted its suspension on the acceptance and activation of TNVS applications issued last July pending the resolution of the Technical Working Group (TWG) on the transportation network companies (TNCs).

Lizada said the board was able to take hold of certificates of accreditation issued to two different U-HOP drivers who used the same vehicle. For its part, U-HOP clarified that it has not activated anyone who is not part of its initial list of TNVS applicants submitted to the LTFRB. “We would like to clarify that we have not activated anyone who is not part of the 5,000 initial list and allocation we submitted to LTFRB. Out of the 5,000, we only activated less than 300 and 56 in Cebu due to the clamor of the public for affordable rides,” the firm said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. U-HOP said they have received their accreditation last March and stopped their activation after the suspension order was released in July. “When U-HOP received the TNC Accreditation last March 2016, we were only allowed to run for four months and immediately stopped after the July suspension. We incurred considerable losses but we never complained. We followed the order even if it almost got us to the ground,” U-HOP said. “During the TNC-TWG, we asked permission to allow us to run 5,000 units, to be able to survive the competition and provide decent service to our users. We got a verbal approval,” they added. U-HOP will remove the logo in all their future certification as well as on the vehicle markings in compliance with the LTFRB order. It will likewise file a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) and clarify the matter on the activation of new applicants to the LTFRB.

Aquino, together with LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra, met the operators of Grab and Uber to address growing concerns of their drivers being used by drug dealers in delivering the said contraband. The schedule for the MOU signing is tentatively set on the second week of October, he said. Aquino suggested to the operators of TNVS – Grab and Uber – to open packages sent through their drivers in order for them not to be used as unwitting drug couriers. “To Grab and Uber operators and drivers, please exercise due diligence to prevent your line of work from being tainted with involvement with illegal drug activities,” Aquino said in a statement. Both representatives of Grab and Uber who were present during the meeting supported Aquino’s suggestion.Aquino also encouraged Grab and Uber operators and drivers to help enhance intelligence efforts by reporting information to authorities. “Report suspected packages directly to us,” Aquino said. The PDEA chief issued such proposal following the arrest of Jovit Atillano, a suspected ecstasy dealer admitted that he has been hiring the services of TVNS drivers to deliver packages containing illegal drugs to his on-line clients. The suspect, who yielded 500 pieces of party drugs and other illegal drugs worth PHP1 million, was arrested by PDEA agents on Sept. 19, in his condominium unit in Mandaluyong City.

Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) spokesperson Aileen Lizada said Uber and Grab have agreed, during its technical working group meeting Wednesday afternoon, to comply with its memorandum circular providing for an enhanced personal accident insurance program. “We directed TNCs to provide insurance coverage the same as LTFRB is providing extensive coverage and all risk policy. We asked both Uber and Grab to improve the coverage that their TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should be having,” Lizada said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The Board has partnered with the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc. (PAMI) and SCCI Management and Insurance Agency Corporation (SCCI) for its insurance coverage. Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2015-028, passengers of public utility vehicles are entitled to monetary benefits from PHP3,000 to PHP200,000 including accidental death and other injuries. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated PAMI coverage since these are recognized by the LTFRB to have legitimate operations. Grab’s insurance policy mandates that those without PA or CPC should be enrolled to an insurance premium while those with PAs/CPCs get the same on top of PAMI. As such, all TNVS drivers accredited by Grab are covered by insurance and passengers can settle claims against the ridesharing firm. The LTFRB earlier said Uber offers limited insurance coverage compared to its competitor that has no fault indemnity clause and all-risk coverage. A no-fault indemnity insurance clause assures that the insurance company will pay for damages incurred regardless of whose fault has caused the accident. An all-risk insurance policy provides broader coverage as it insures passengers for losses that might arise from any extreme conditions. LTFRB will issue stickers for the identification of TNVS units with PAs or CPCs, Lizada said. The TNCs also agreed that their partner TNVS drivers and operators will participate in the Drivers Academy for public utility vehicles (PUV) which was established by the LTFRB to ensure road safety and discipline. Some of the issues that were also discussed in the meeting were: penalties for erring drivers; accountability of the TNCs; fare discounts and determination; and fleet management.

Gonzalez stressed the company is looking more on the demand side under such operation. He said the company has already expressed interest with the Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB) to operate in the city. GrabCar is a car-booking application that dispatches private vehicles. The app has high demand in Metro Manila. Grab has been operating in Davao City since 2014 when it partnered with taxi operators and drivers in Davao for GrabTaxi. Jose Thor Villarreiz, Grab Davao Manager, said there are now 1,300 Grab-a-Taxi drivers still using the Grab platform averaging about 500 drivers active per day. When Grab started in Davao City there were about 2,600 because of the incentives they offered to establish the brand.

Cu stressed that Grab understands very well about the lack of supply to serve the need of the riding public. With LTFRB’s resolution, Cu is optimistic Grab can meet the demand beginning on Monday. To maintain Grab’s quality of service, Cu said drivers will undergo training, cross check their background. “We’re focused on serving drivers and consumers, and ensuring that the car-and-taxi-hailing transport continues to run as smoothly as possible,” he said. He added that aside from the fare cap which Grab put in place to ensure consumers continue to pay a reasonable fare, Cu said Grab also ensures that the onboarding process will be smooth so that TNVs drivers can start to make a loving again.

The complaint comes after the one-month suspension imposed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against the transport network company (TNC). Based on the complaint filed by Kilusan sa Pagbabago ng Industriya ng Transportasyon chairman Vigor Mendoza II, Melencio “Boy” Vargas of the Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines, Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Associations of the Philippines (Fejodap) President Zenaida Maranan, Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) president Efren de Luna, Pasang Masda President Roberto Martin, Orlando Marquez of the Liga ng Transportasyon at Opereytor sa Pilipinas and Fermin Octobre of the Drivers Unite for Mass Progress Equality and Reality (DUMPER), Uber has accredited 74,687 vehicles but only 21,353 have been authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). This means that the remaining 53,334 vehciles are 'colorum' or operating illegally. “These vehicles were operating without a valid authority from the LTFRB, thus colorum…Respondents [Uber officials], as officers and members of the Board of Director of Uber, knowingly and willfully violated the orders of the LTFRB, and consented and approved their company’s illegal activity of operating vehicles as public utilities without the proper and valid authority coming from the LTFRB, otherwise known as ‘colorum’ activities,” the complainants said. Complainants said they are not against Uber but against its stance “of wanting to be above the law.” “Operating more than 50,000 colorum vehicles sets a dangerous precedent, and if not stopped would wreck havoc to the country’s transport plans and programs, specifically the Modernization Program, which aims to enhance transport service and uplift the lives of transport workers,” the complaint stated. “If Uber can get away with this, then all other modes of transport service might as well forget their franchise and just operate as colorum, just like Uber,” they added. Complainants also noted that LTFRB already ordered TNCs to suspend accepting applications for additional vehicles, but still, Uber continued to accept new applicants. They added that despite LTFRB’s order suspending Uber’s operation, it continued with its operation citing the experience of a certain Kenneth Lugtu who managed to book Uber services on Aug. 15, a day after the LTFRB suspended its operation. On Tuesday, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said Uber' suspension remains in effect despite its pending motion for reconsideration asking the LTFRB to lift the suspension order issued Monday. Lizada said the agency will continue to apprehend the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) of Uber if they were found to be still operating on the road. In its motion, Uber stated that the LTFRB suspension order against it was a “blatant violation” of its right to due process. Furthermore, it said that there was no proof it violated the LTFRB’s order stop the activation of new drivers. “Over the course of this morning, tens of thousands of riders were left stranded, causing needless inconvenience, while drivers were unable to access the earning opportunities they rely on. We are looking forward to urgently resolving this matter with LTFRB in the interests of everyone who depends on Uber every day,” Uber said in its official Facebook page. Lizada questioned Uber for resuming operations despite the suspension order, after filing the MR. “What Uber did now saying that they will now be online, they are putting at risk all of its TNVS. What kind of a partner is that? We want Uber to uphold a level of accountability and not leave their TNVS partners behind,” Lizada said. She further said that the board considers Uber’s continuing operations despite the suspension of its accreditation as acts of contempt. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III reiterated that the mere acceptance of Uber of new drivers into its system is already a violation of its order. He said the board has apprehended 19 “colorum” Uber and 16 “colorum” Grab TNVS which have no certificates of public convenience or provisional authority. “The TNCs have already admitted that some of their TNVS are colorum. We just want this problem to be nipped in the bud before it becomes worse,” Delgra said. “We are supporting innovations in our transportation system through the use of modern technology but we also want to ensure that these will be compliant with the law,” he added. Lizada explained that the LTFRB only wants to ensure that TNCs will be able to protect the welfare of their TNVS partners. “It is incumbent upon the Board to choose TNCs that will protect the welfare of TNVS. This is not a fight; we just want to support TNCs that protect the public welfare,” she said.

At a Palace briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that while the government appreciates the benefits provided by transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber, it also has to support the mandate of the LTFRB to regulate public transport services. On Monday, the LTFRB suspended the accreditation of Uber for a month after it found that the company continued to accept additional accreditation of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) and/or activation of accounts despite the agency's order. “The issue here is striking a balance between innovation and laws and regulations that LTFRB has to implement as part of its administrative function in regulating common carriers,” he said. “We affirm the positive and beneficial service offered by the TNCs. However, as per LTFRB, Uber Systems unduly challenged its rules and instructions. The Palace understands the situation and therefore, will support LTFRB,” Abella said. The Palace official said that it also respects the suggestions coming from lawmakers, particularly from Senator Grace Poe, that Uber should be just sanctioned with additional fines rather than suspend its operations given the large impact on commuters. “Well, I suppose Ms. Poe’s comment has its own merit. However, we do need to understand that the one in charge is LTFRB and we go by that,” Abella said. However, Abella stressed that Malacañang is hoping that the issue between LTFRB and Uber could be resolved soon for the benefit of the riding public. “We do empathize with the traveling public.

Poe, in a statement, said that she was hopeful that the meeting with the LTFRB would help resolve the issue as public interest requires the Senate to exercise congressional oversight. She described the decision of LTFRB to suspend Uber services as “cruel and absurd.” “I am aghast that this agency that committed before the Senate to resolve the issues has just imposed a cure that will only make the disease much worse. It does not solve the problem, but further exacerbates the problem of having an utter lack of safe, reliable, and convenient transportation options for our people,” Poe said. Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, described the LTFRB’s suspension order as a “defiance of the LTFRB officials’ commitment to provide a solution to the issues surrounding transport network vehicle services (TNVS) operations.” “When the Senate Committee on Public Services, during the last hearing, asked them to straighten out issues with the Transport Network Companies by October, the committee did not mean for them to suspend the operations of any TNC,” Poe said. “I was wrong to think that the LTFRB was on the same page with the Committee on how to come up with remedial rules pending the crafting of pertinent legislation,” she added. Poe said that the LTFRB suspended Uber’s services not because of lack of roadworthiness but because of “a mere administrative violation” which should have merited a corresponding administrative penalty. The senator pointed out that Uber’s penalty should not limit the public of their transport options. She further said that the public deserved to have options when it comes to choosing convenient, safe, and reliable transportation services to brave the daily punishing traffic jam. “Why can’t the LTFRB be innovative in coming up with an appropriate penalty that is fair and that will not prejudice the riding public? Is there no other less crippling penalty at our disposal? Thirty days is a long time,” Poe said. “Without reliable public transportation, those who depend on Uber for their daily commute will have to find an alternative or revert to their long and usual daily grind. Was the interest of the riding public, that is now compromised and jeopardized, ever factored in when the LTFRB came up with the suspension order?” she added. Automotive journalist James Deakin, in a statement, said that he supported the LTFRB’s decision to suspend Uber for a month but expressed hope that the board would be equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. “As big a fan as I am of ride sharing, I support the LTFRB's decision to suspend Uber for a month. Harsh as it may be, rules are rules. And if Uber broke those rules by accrediting vehicles after the deadline, then so be it. The LTFRB are just doing their job. We have to respect that,” Deakin said. “I hope that in the spirit of fairness we can also hold the LTFRB equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. After all, rules are rules,” he added. He, meanwhile, urged the LTFRB to also suspend operations of other public transport vehicles that transport passengers without permits.

In a statement, the transport network company (TNC) said it has its own third party private insurance that covers all its transport network vehicle service (TNVS) partners and passengers in the Philippines and the rest of the Southeast Asian region. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated Passenger Accident Management and Insurance (PAMI) coverage. Grab’s third party insurance policy from Great American Insurance Company ensures that those without PA or CPC are enrolled to an insurance premium as early as April last year. Those with PA/CPC get the same insurance on top of PAMI. “Our passengers are protected by a third-party insurance, whether they ride a GrabCar TNVS unit with PA/CPC or not,\" Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Public Affairs Head and Spokesperson of Grab Philippines, explained as he assures that the TNC complies with the no fault policy which entitles passengers to full insurance claims regardless of who’s at fault at the time of the accident. Grab’s insurance package which is the first of its kind insurance policy in the industry to be provided by a ride sharing platform applies to all 65 cities in the seven countries that it currently operates making it the largest in terms of coverage in Southeast Asia. Its insurer Great American Insurance offers coverage in the event of accidental death, permanent dismemberment and bodily injuries in the event of accidents for drivers and passengers. For death or permanent disability, Grab's TNVS drivers, partners, and passengers can claim up to USD 4,100 or PHP 200,000; while up to USD 410 or PHP 20,000 can be claimed for medical reimbursements.  Moreover, coverage varies for different types of injuries. Grab also reminds its TNVS partners to always abide by the law. “Any violation that would result to serious physical injuries or would put Grab’s credibility in question would be tantamount to suspension or even deactivation of their respective accounts,” according to Gonzales. “Grab always puts the interests and welfare of its partners and passengers at the heart of its priorities. It is important for us that they are assured of peace of mind as they take and complete a Grab ride,” he added. Accountability was one of the issues discussed during the two congressional hearings held last week to tackle the issues involving TNCs. Insurance coverage for the passengers was identified as the means to ensure passenger safety and security.  (PNA)"}]}
