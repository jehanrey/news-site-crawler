Joey Salceda is pushing for taxation on digital services—specifically, subscriptions to video and music streaming apps, ads on social media sites, and making online sales platforms as withholding tax agents—to offset an estimated P120 billion in foregone revenues once the government cuts corporate income taxes to 25 percent to soothe the pain inflicted by COVID-19 on businesses.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — House ways and means committee chair and Albay Rep. Joey Salceda is pushing for taxation on digital services—specifically, subscriptions to video and music streaming apps, ads on social media sites, and making online sales platforms as withholding tax agents—to offset an estimated P120 billion in foregone revenues once the government cuts corporate income taxes to 25 percent to soothe the pain inflicted by COVID-19 on businesses. Salceda told the Inquirer on Monday that he intended to call these new tax measures as “Netflix tax,” “Facebook ads tax,” and “Lazada tax,” respectively.  In the case of “Netflix tax,” Salceda said the current standard digital services tax slapped on subscriptions worldwide was 5 percent, although he noted that Chile imposes a higher 19 percent. Salceda said the Philippines might as well slap a new 12-percent tax on subscriptions to video and music streaming sites, a market currently worth about P5 billion.  At present, whatever subscription fees were being collected by apps like Netflix or Spotify weren’t levied any tax by the Philippine government, Salceda noted. For “Facebook ads tax,” Salceda said the idea was to “require that digital advertisements be made through a country representative of Facebook and Google so it becomes least problematic.”  As such, collection of 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax among digital advertisers will augment the current revenue base, he explained. “The big money is in finding a way to tax the advertising on Facebook and Google,” Salceda said, adding that these two tech giants operate like a duopoly in the country as they dominated the online space here. Citing a model proposed by 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics winner Paul Romer, Salceda said tax on digital advertising will be “based on how much companies earn from displaying the ads in the tax jurisdiction, because that’s where value is created.” As for the proposed “Lazada tax,” Salceda noted that only 50 percent of vendors who sell their goods and services via online marketplaces like the Alibaba Group’s Lazada, Amazon, and Shopee, among others, pay VAT. Among online sellers, “around half are fully-compliant [with VAT payments] since they are large taxpayers and accredited shops,” he said.To capture the still unpaid VAT, Salceda said these online platforms will be tapped to also serve as withholding tax agents of their suppliers.  With sales of the Philippines’ e-commerce sector estimated to reach about P260 billion this year, VAT collections should reach around P30 billion, Salceda said. Once passed into law, Salceda said the government can block online or digital platforms that will neither pay the right taxes nor comply with tax laws. For Salceda, these proposed new taxes on all digital platforms in the country being used by Filipino citizens and Philippine residents alike, alongside the pending higher motor vehicle user’s charge (MVUC) pending in the Senate as well as the bigger 5-percent franchise tax on Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) seen hurdling the Lower House soon, can keep revenue streams alive despite the Department of Finance’s (DOF) push to cut the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent by July from 30 percent at present, instead of the original plan to gradually reduce it over a 10-year period. Based on Salceda’s calculations, the higher MVUC will raise P24 billion, while the so-called POGO tax will generate another P44 billion during the first year of implementation. Under the DOF’s proposed Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (Create), new investors will enjoy “targeted, time-bound, and tailor-fitted tax incentives to proactively attract the right types of investment (demand driven led by the Board of Investments, not supply driven, to attach investors leaving China, etc.),” Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua said last week. An upgraded version of the pending Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Reform Act (Citira), Create will also retain tax perks of existing investors for the next four to nine years, longer than Citira’s 3-7 years, Chua had said. Create formed part of the economic team’s up to P160-billion Philippine Program for Recovery with Equity and Solidarity or “PH-Progreso” being pitched to Congress in order for the economy to recover quickly. First-quarter gross domestic product already shrank by 0.2 percent and the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown during the second quarter was expected to bring the Philippines into recession, with full-year GDP seen declining by 2-3.4 percent in 2020."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/308973/celebrating-two-successful-girlbosses-on-lazada","title":"Celebrating two successful #GirlBosses on Lazada","date":"08:20 PM October 07, 2020","snippet":"Nowadays, social media is an integral factor when building any business.

Today’s generation of consumers makes discerning purchase decisions by checking out curated social media feeds, real-time stories, and comments from peers. We meet two women entrepreneurs who have thrived in the age of social media and have become successful girl bosses through their hard work as they empower others by sharing their entrepreneurial journey, remaining passionate in what they do, and “never quit” attitudes. Handcrafting passion and success    Glyza Go’s path to success wasn’t always the smoothest. An IT graduate with an entrepreneurial spirit, Glyza has always had a passion for setting up her own business. She had gone into selling printed t-shirts, ready-to-wear fashion pieces and K-drama merchandise, however her ventures did not pan out the way she expected. “I was disappointed during my initial few years when I first launched my business. I was disappointed and found myself comparing to others, thinking why I could not reach the same level of success. I did not have any background in advertising nor marketing, and had to learn the ins and outs of business management from scratch. But my desire to succeed is much stronger than my fear of failing,” says Glyza. After past failures from previous ventures, she started saving up capital to open another shop. Glyza started collecting 5 and 10 peso coins towards her capital and in 6 months saved over Php 3,000 to jumpstart her new business. Earlier this year, Glyza started her latest venture, Get Celeste, a jewelry shop. Glyza starting selling her jewelry pieces on Instagram, but only a few weeks in, the coronavirus hit the world. Based on research and quick thinking to pivot her business and continue operations, she onboarded onto Lazada a month later. Despite the pandemic, her handcrafted pieces continued to sell and were definitely getting more attention. “At the start, I received around seven orders a week and I was really grateful. However, I was worried about maintaining consistent sales. Hence, I worked on maximizing my presence on Lazada and decided to participate in Lazada’s campaigns. This really helped boost my sales, and in the latest 9.9 shopping event, I saw a 5x uplift from my usual sales,” says Glyza.   Glyza also gives credit to her social media presence and how it has helped drive customers to her Lazada store. “With over 26,000 followers and growing on my store’s Instagram account, I was able to drive the traffic to check out my products on Lazada. Using Lazada’s seller resources, managing payments and deliveries became more convenient as some customers had requests such as cash-on-delivery that I could not previously accommodate on my other sales channels,” says Glyza. From a fledgling shop just a few months ago to an up and coming social media brand, Glyza is thankful for all the support that her latest business baby has received. “It makes my heart happy to see my business grow and receive such love and support from customers, giving positive comments and waiting for restocks on my pieces. As a one-woman team, I’m always eager to learn more from my peers who are successful in business. My failures in the past have served as learning experiences for me to grow, and have taught me to always keep trying even I fall down again and again,” says Glyza.

Having experienced personal struggles with teenage acne, Jonalyn wanted her business to help people with their skincare journey and make them feel good about themselves. Together with her sister Aileen, they put up their beauty brand Skinpotions in 2013. With no background in business and management, Jonalyn built Skinpotions from the ground up, learning as she went along. They started selling primarily through Facebook and Instagram, as well as at bazaars and collaboration stores. The sisters’ hard work and perseverance paid off and the brand eventually built a cult following, being known for its signature pink label and cute, feminine style. They also evolved the business through the years, like transitioning to organic and natural-based products, expanding their line to include cosmetics, as well as opening kiosks in retail mails and partnering with distributors and resellers in different parts of the globe. Their bestsellers have been shown a lot of love on social media feeds, particularly the Tomato Serum, Peach Thy Lash, Pit Potion, Acne Pie Soap, and crowd-favorite Snowberry Sleeping Cream Mask.    Jonah wanted the business to expand even further, and they saw that eCommerce platforms were a good way to reach an even wider audience and target more than just their regular consumers. They onboarded the business on Lazada in 2019 and from there saw Skinpotions’ continuous growth. “Our sales boosted significantly since we joined Lazada. During our first 11.11 campaign last year, we managed to achieve our first million in sales,” says Jonalyn. Having built the brand through social media, it definitely worked to their advantage to drive their already loyal customers to their Lazada store. “Social media has been our main way to promote our mega campaigns, hot items and new products. As much as possible, we maximize our social media presence to optimize awareness to our consumers and lead them to shop our items online,” says Jonalyn. Jonalyn has definitely learned a lot of things in the seven years she’s been in business. For her, building a successful brand is all about being passionate in what you do, keeping yourself grounded and making decisions with your consumers always in mind. “Connect with the community who buys and loves your products. Also work with a team that has the same drive and passion, who share your values and will do their best to help the business thrive. Skinpotions would definitely not be what it is today without the support of both our customers and our staff who have helped us build it from the ground up,” says Jonalyn. It’s only upward from here for Skinpotions. Even with their huge success on eCommerce, Jonalyn plans to supplement the expansion of her beauty empire through experiential retail stores to make her consumers feel the brand’s “skincare magic.” Shop Skinpotions at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/skinpotionsph.

Guballa said the BIR had asked the country’s online sellers to register to keep track of their number, but it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year.  Local subscription fees to Netflix, which is based abroad, include a value added tax which “the government wants to collect under the destination principle,” Guballa said at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday. The BIR also wants to tax merchants who sell their items via shopping sites like Lazada, he added.  “We are not really looking at those who were locked down and selling pansit online. We are looking at bigger businesses in online selling,” Guballa said. Outraged netizens and lawmakers had described as “ill-timed and insensitive” the BIR’s directive for online sellers to register, saying that people who had lost their jobs because of the lockdown had turned to online selling to earn a living. Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Jose Maria Concepcion meanwhile appealed to the government to delay its plan to tax online sellers until January next year, to allow them to make ends meet during the pandemic.  The BIR has given online sellers until July 31 to register their business, or face penalties.“We should allow these people to continue and then be stricter later on, maybe next year starting in January,” Concepcion said during the online conference “Flattening the Unemployment Curve,” where he raised the tax issue. Taxing online businesses is not new, as the requirement has been in place since 2013. However, the government’s decision to push for strict compliance amid strict lockdown protocols because of the pandemic has drawn criticisms from various sectors. In the Senate, Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday called on the BIR to withdraw and revise its order for online sellers to register with the bureau, since “it has caused confusion among online sellers,” she said in an online forum. Also in the forum were Bernie Bernal and Michael Adina who sell electronic gadgets and native delicacies online, respectively. The two said they were anxious when they heard about the BIR directive. —With reports from Roy Stephen C.

The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

In April 2016, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba sealed a $1-billion deal with Lazada and bought $500 million in new shares as part of its expansion plain in Southeast Asia, its biggest overseas investment yet to date. Another milestone that Lazada marked last year was its integration with Singapore-based grocery e-commerce RedMart.  READ: E-commerce as great equalizer “[Our partnership with Alibaba] is going great. We are learning a significant lot of things from Alibaba. It is as if we are a child in a primary school and we are learning every day and we are applying those learnings in our business at the strategic level,” Balci said at Lazada’s fifth anniversary event in Makati on Tuesday.  “What we are doing at the moment, this is one of the learnings that we got from Alibaba, is we focus on our core business and we are creating an ecosystem among ourselves,” he added. Balci said Lazada sent five of its merchants last month to the Alibaba Campus in China “so that they could get the best training from Alibaba sellers, merchants, and trainers.”  Lazada, a one-stop online retailer based in Singapore, was launched in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in 2012 and in Singapore in 2014. Today, with over 2,000 employees, Balci said the company occupies a 91-percent share in the Philippines’ e-commerce category in just five years of existence, selling about 6.3 million items and more than 14,000 brands. “This is also my fifth year in the Philippines and we love doing our job in the Philippines. We started from nothing, and we are trying to bring the e-commerce of the Philippines to the next level,” Balci said. “We have been working really hard in the past five years and the question always is, how is Lazada doing? Our vision for the next five years is to become a technology-driven platform empowering our sellers and brands for our customers. We identify ourselves five pillars of growth: assortment, empowering sellers and brands, customer experience, seller and product transparency, and ecosystem,” he added. Balci reiterated Lazada’s commitment to make the Philippines the next top e-commerce hub in the region and in the world by encouraging more people to sell and shop online. E-commerce, he said, is the “biggest entrepreneurial opportunity” in the Philippines in this day and age as it reaches more consumers without having to invest millions. “Why should someone sell in Lazada? One of the most frequent questions I get is if we are competing with shopping malls. The obvious thing is Lazada does not compete with any of the offline stores. What we do is we offer an additional sales channel to all the businesses in the Philippines so they can reach out anyone in the Philippines,” he said.  “This is the reason why I’m saying that Lazada is the biggest entrepreneurial opportunity. There is no bigger entrepreneurial opportunity in the Philippines other than Lazada. Why? Because you don’t need any investment in order to reach millions of pesos. You don’t even need a laptop. You only need an Android phone to start selling on Lazada… And at the same time Lazada is a level playing field. Even if you are the smallest merchant, even if you are the largest corporation in the Philippines, you get the same rates,” Banci added. By yearend, Lazada is eyeing to expand its innovation by utilizing its brand assets and increase, partnerships by maximizing co-marketing efforts with additional 60 local and international brands, and attracting more brands that see it as a disruptive sales channel. “We want people to buy things easy, affordable without spending a lot of time. And I think e-commerce is the best thing that can provide this to customers in the Philippines and again our birthday wish is a great economy for the Philippines and a larger e-commerce landscape,” Banci said. “I think Lazada is one of the biggest contributors in e-commerce in the Philippines. We have been investing heavily in different parts of the Philippines starting with logistics to marketing, for it to be one of the top e-commerce countries in the world,” he added.

Among online sellers, “around half are fully-compliant [with VAT payments] since they are large taxpayers and accredited shops,” he said.To capture the still unpaid VAT, Salceda said these online platforms will be tapped to also serve as withholding tax agents of their suppliers.  With sales of the Philippines’ e-commerce sector estimated to reach about P260 billion this year, VAT collections should reach around P30 billion, Salceda said. Once passed into law, Salceda said the government can block online or digital platforms that will neither pay the right taxes nor comply with tax laws. For Salceda, these proposed new taxes on all digital platforms in the country being used by Filipino citizens and Philippine residents alike, alongside the pending higher motor vehicle user’s charge (MVUC) pending in the Senate as well as the bigger 5-percent franchise tax on Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) seen hurdling the Lower House soon, can keep revenue streams alive despite the Department of Finance’s (DOF) push to cut the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent by July from 30 percent at present, instead of the original plan to gradually reduce it over a 10-year period. Based on Salceda’s calculations, the higher MVUC will raise P24 billion, while the so-called POGO tax will generate another P44 billion during the first year of implementation. Under the DOF’s proposed Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (Create), new investors will enjoy “targeted, time-bound, and tailor-fitted tax incentives to proactively attract the right types of investment (demand driven led by the Board of Investments, not supply driven, to attach investors leaving China, etc.),” Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua said last week. An upgraded version of the pending Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Reform Act (Citira), Create will also retain tax perks of existing investors for the next four to nine years, longer than Citira’s 3-7 years, Chua had said. Create formed part of the economic team’s up to P160-billion Philippine Program for Recovery with Equity and Solidarity or “PH-Progreso” being pitched to Congress in order for the economy to recover quickly. First-quarter gross domestic product already shrank by 0.2 percent and the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown during the second quarter was expected to bring the Philippines into recession, with full-year GDP seen declining by 2-3.4 percent in 2020."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/308973/celebrating-two-successful-girlbosses-on-lazada","title":"Celebrating two successful #GirlBosses on Lazada","date":"08:20 PM October 07, 2020","snippet":"Nowadays, social media is an integral factor when building any business.

Today’s generation of consumers makes discerning purchase decisions by checking out curated social media feeds, real-time stories, and comments from peers. We meet two women entrepreneurs who have thrived in the age of social media and have become successful girl bosses through their hard work as they empower others by sharing their entrepreneurial journey, remaining passionate in what they do, and “never quit” attitudes. Handcrafting passion and success    Glyza Go’s path to success wasn’t always the smoothest. An IT graduate with an entrepreneurial spirit, Glyza has always had a passion for setting up her own business. She had gone into selling printed t-shirts, ready-to-wear fashion pieces and K-drama merchandise, however her ventures did not pan out the way she expected. “I was disappointed during my initial few years when I first launched my business. I was disappointed and found myself comparing to others, thinking why I could not reach the same level of success. I did not have any background in advertising nor marketing, and had to learn the ins and outs of business management from scratch. But my desire to succeed is much stronger than my fear of failing,” says Glyza. After past failures from previous ventures, she started saving up capital to open another shop. Glyza started collecting 5 and 10 peso coins towards her capital and in 6 months saved over Php 3,000 to jumpstart her new business. Earlier this year, Glyza started her latest venture, Get Celeste, a jewelry shop. Glyza starting selling her jewelry pieces on Instagram, but only a few weeks in, the coronavirus hit the world. Based on research and quick thinking to pivot her business and continue operations, she onboarded onto Lazada a month later. Despite the pandemic, her handcrafted pieces continued to sell and were definitely getting more attention. “At the start, I received around seven orders a week and I was really grateful. However, I was worried about maintaining consistent sales. Hence, I worked on maximizing my presence on Lazada and decided to participate in Lazada’s campaigns. This really helped boost my sales, and in the latest 9.9 shopping event, I saw a 5x uplift from my usual sales,” says Glyza.   Glyza also gives credit to her social media presence and how it has helped drive customers to her Lazada store. “With over 26,000 followers and growing on my store’s Instagram account, I was able to drive the traffic to check out my products on Lazada. Using Lazada’s seller resources, managing payments and deliveries became more convenient as some customers had requests such as cash-on-delivery that I could not previously accommodate on my other sales channels,” says Glyza. From a fledgling shop just a few months ago to an up and coming social media brand, Glyza is thankful for all the support that her latest business baby has received. “It makes my heart happy to see my business grow and receive such love and support from customers, giving positive comments and waiting for restocks on my pieces. As a one-woman team, I’m always eager to learn more from my peers who are successful in business. My failures in the past have served as learning experiences for me to grow, and have taught me to always keep trying even I fall down again and again,” says Glyza.

Having experienced personal struggles with teenage acne, Jonalyn wanted her business to help people with their skincare journey and make them feel good about themselves. Together with her sister Aileen, they put up their beauty brand Skinpotions in 2013. With no background in business and management, Jonalyn built Skinpotions from the ground up, learning as she went along. They started selling primarily through Facebook and Instagram, as well as at bazaars and collaboration stores. The sisters’ hard work and perseverance paid off and the brand eventually built a cult following, being known for its signature pink label and cute, feminine style. They also evolved the business through the years, like transitioning to organic and natural-based products, expanding their line to include cosmetics, as well as opening kiosks in retail mails and partnering with distributors and resellers in different parts of the globe. Their bestsellers have been shown a lot of love on social media feeds, particularly the Tomato Serum, Peach Thy Lash, Pit Potion, Acne Pie Soap, and crowd-favorite Snowberry Sleeping Cream Mask.    Jonah wanted the business to expand even further, and they saw that eCommerce platforms were a good way to reach an even wider audience and target more than just their regular consumers. They onboarded the business on Lazada in 2019 and from there saw Skinpotions’ continuous growth. “Our sales boosted significantly since we joined Lazada. During our first 11.11 campaign last year, we managed to achieve our first million in sales,” says Jonalyn. Having built the brand through social media, it definitely worked to their advantage to drive their already loyal customers to their Lazada store. “Social media has been our main way to promote our mega campaigns, hot items and new products. As much as possible, we maximize our social media presence to optimize awareness to our consumers and lead them to shop our items online,” says Jonalyn. Jonalyn has definitely learned a lot of things in the seven years she’s been in business. For her, building a successful brand is all about being passionate in what you do, keeping yourself grounded and making decisions with your consumers always in mind. “Connect with the community who buys and loves your products. Also work with a team that has the same drive and passion, who share your values and will do their best to help the business thrive. Skinpotions would definitely not be what it is today without the support of both our customers and our staff who have helped us build it from the ground up,” says Jonalyn. It’s only upward from here for Skinpotions. Even with their huge success on eCommerce, Jonalyn plans to supplement the expansion of her beauty empire through experiential retail stores to make her consumers feel the brand’s “skincare magic.” Shop Skinpotions at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/skinpotionsph.

Guballa said the BIR had asked the country’s online sellers to register to keep track of their number, but it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year.  Local subscription fees to Netflix, which is based abroad, include a value added tax which “the government wants to collect under the destination principle,” Guballa said at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday. The BIR also wants to tax merchants who sell their items via shopping sites like Lazada, he added.  “We are not really looking at those who were locked down and selling pansit online. We are looking at bigger businesses in online selling,” Guballa said. Outraged netizens and lawmakers had described as “ill-timed and insensitive” the BIR’s directive for online sellers to register, saying that people who had lost their jobs because of the lockdown had turned to online selling to earn a living. Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Jose Maria Concepcion meanwhile appealed to the government to delay its plan to tax online sellers until January next year, to allow them to make ends meet during the pandemic.  The BIR has given online sellers until July 31 to register their business, or face penalties.“We should allow these people to continue and then be stricter later on, maybe next year starting in January,” Concepcion said during the online conference “Flattening the Unemployment Curve,” where he raised the tax issue. Taxing online businesses is not new, as the requirement has been in place since 2013. However, the government’s decision to push for strict compliance amid strict lockdown protocols because of the pandemic has drawn criticisms from various sectors. In the Senate, Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday called on the BIR to withdraw and revise its order for online sellers to register with the bureau, since “it has caused confusion among online sellers,” she said in an online forum. Also in the forum were Bernie Bernal and Michael Adina who sell electronic gadgets and native delicacies online, respectively. The two said they were anxious when they heard about the BIR directive. —With reports from Roy Stephen C.

The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

In April 2016, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba sealed a $1-billion deal with Lazada and bought $500 million in new shares as part of its expansion plain in Southeast Asia, its biggest overseas investment yet to date. Another milestone that Lazada marked last year was its integration with Singapore-based grocery e-commerce RedMart.  READ: E-commerce as great equalizer “[Our partnership with Alibaba] is going great. We are learning a significant lot of things from Alibaba. It is as if we are a child in a primary school and we are learning every day and we are applying those learnings in our business at the strategic level,” Balci said at Lazada’s fifth anniversary event in Makati on Tuesday.  “What we are doing at the moment, this is one of the learnings that we got from Alibaba, is we focus on our core business and we are creating an ecosystem among ourselves,” he added. Balci said Lazada sent five of its merchants last month to the Alibaba Campus in China “so that they could get the best training from Alibaba sellers, merchants, and trainers.”  Lazada, a one-stop online retailer based in Singapore, was launched in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in 2012 and in Singapore in 2014. Today, with over 2,000 employees, Balci said the company occupies a 91-percent share in the Philippines’ e-commerce category in just five years of existence, selling about 6.3 million items and more than 14,000 brands. “This is also my fifth year in the Philippines and we love doing our job in the Philippines. We started from nothing, and we are trying to bring the e-commerce of the Philippines to the next level,” Balci said. “We have been working really hard in the past five years and the question always is, how is Lazada doing? Our vision for the next five years is to become a technology-driven platform empowering our sellers and brands for our customers. We identify ourselves five pillars of growth: assortment, empowering sellers and brands, customer experience, seller and product transparency, and ecosystem,” he added. Balci reiterated Lazada’s commitment to make the Philippines the next top e-commerce hub in the region and in the world by encouraging more people to sell and shop online. E-commerce, he said, is the “biggest entrepreneurial opportunity” in the Philippines in this day and age as it reaches more consumers without having to invest millions. “Why should someone sell in Lazada? One of the most frequent questions I get is if we are competing with shopping malls. The obvious thing is Lazada does not compete with any of the offline stores. What we do is we offer an additional sales channel to all the businesses in the Philippines so they can reach out anyone in the Philippines,” he said.  “This is the reason why I’m saying that Lazada is the biggest entrepreneurial opportunity. There is no bigger entrepreneurial opportunity in the Philippines other than Lazada. Why? Because you don’t need any investment in order to reach millions of pesos. You don’t even need a laptop. You only need an Android phone to start selling on Lazada… And at the same time Lazada is a level playing field. Even if you are the smallest merchant, even if you are the largest corporation in the Philippines, you get the same rates,” Banci added. By yearend, Lazada is eyeing to expand its innovation by utilizing its brand assets and increase, partnerships by maximizing co-marketing efforts with additional 60 local and international brands, and attracting more brands that see it as a disruptive sales channel. “We want people to buy things easy, affordable without spending a lot of time. And I think e-commerce is the best thing that can provide this to customers in the Philippines and again our birthday wish is a great economy for the Philippines and a larger e-commerce landscape,” Banci said. “I think Lazada is one of the biggest contributors in e-commerce in the Philippines. We have been investing heavily in different parts of the Philippines starting with logistics to marketing, for it to be one of the top e-commerce countries in the world,” he added. As part of its 5th anniversary, Lazada is holding a big sale from March 21to 23 with discounts of up to 90 percent, time-based flash sales, exclusive offers from popular brands, and raffle prizes like tour packages.

Salceda told the Inquirer on Monday that he intended to call these new tax measures as “Netflix tax,” “Facebook ads tax,” and “Lazada tax,” respectively.  In the case of “Netflix tax,” Salceda said the current standard digital services tax slapped on subscriptions worldwide was 5 percent, although he noted that Chile imposes a higher 19 percent. Salceda said the Philippines might as well slap a new 12-percent tax on subscriptions to video and music streaming sites, a market currently worth about P5 billion.  At present, whatever subscription fees were being collected by apps like Netflix or Spotify weren’t levied any tax by the Philippine government, Salceda noted.

Today’s generation of consumers makes discerning purchase decisions by checking out curated social media feeds, real-time stories, and comments from peers. We meet two women entrepreneurs who have thrived in the age of social media and have become successful girl bosses through their hard work as they empower others by sharing their entrepreneurial journey, remaining passionate in what they do, and “never quit” attitudes. Handcrafting passion and success    Glyza Go’s path to success wasn’t always the smoothest. An IT graduate with an entrepreneurial spirit, Glyza has always had a passion for setting up her own business. She had gone into selling printed t-shirts, ready-to-wear fashion pieces and K-drama merchandise, however her ventures did not pan out the way she expected. “I was disappointed during my initial few years when I first launched my business. I was disappointed and found myself comparing to others, thinking why I could not reach the same level of success. I did not have any background in advertising nor marketing, and had to learn the ins and outs of business management from scratch. But my desire to succeed is much stronger than my fear of failing,” says Glyza. After past failures from previous ventures, she started saving up capital to open another shop. Glyza started collecting 5 and 10 peso coins towards her capital and in 6 months saved over Php 3,000 to jumpstart her new business. Earlier this year, Glyza started her latest venture, Get Celeste, a jewelry shop. Glyza starting selling her jewelry pieces on Instagram, but only a few weeks in, the coronavirus hit the world. Based on research and quick thinking to pivot her business and continue operations, she onboarded onto Lazada a month later. Despite the pandemic, her handcrafted pieces continued to sell and were definitely getting more attention. “At the start, I received around seven orders a week and I was really grateful. However, I was worried about maintaining consistent sales. Hence, I worked on maximizing my presence on Lazada and decided to participate in Lazada’s campaigns. This really helped boost my sales, and in the latest 9.9 shopping event, I saw a 5x uplift from my usual sales,” says Glyza.   Glyza also gives credit to her social media presence and how it has helped drive customers to her Lazada store. “With over 26,000 followers and growing on my store’s Instagram account, I was able to drive the traffic to check out my products on Lazada. Using Lazada’s seller resources, managing payments and deliveries became more convenient as some customers had requests such as cash-on-delivery that I could not previously accommodate on my other sales channels,” says Glyza. From a fledgling shop just a few months ago to an up and coming social media brand, Glyza is thankful for all the support that her latest business baby has received. “It makes my heart happy to see my business grow and receive such love and support from customers, giving positive comments and waiting for restocks on my pieces. As a one-woman team, I’m always eager to learn more from my peers who are successful in business. My failures in the past have served as learning experiences for me to grow, and have taught me to always keep trying even I fall down again and again,” says Glyza.

Having experienced personal struggles with teenage acne, Jonalyn wanted her business to help people with their skincare journey and make them feel good about themselves. Together with her sister Aileen, they put up their beauty brand Skinpotions in 2013. With no background in business and management, Jonalyn built Skinpotions from the ground up, learning as she went along. They started selling primarily through Facebook and Instagram, as well as at bazaars and collaboration stores. The sisters’ hard work and perseverance paid off and the brand eventually built a cult following, being known for its signature pink label and cute, feminine style. They also evolved the business through the years, like transitioning to organic and natural-based products, expanding their line to include cosmetics, as well as opening kiosks in retail mails and partnering with distributors and resellers in different parts of the globe. Their bestsellers have been shown a lot of love on social media feeds, particularly the Tomato Serum, Peach Thy Lash, Pit Potion, Acne Pie Soap, and crowd-favorite Snowberry Sleeping Cream Mask.    Jonah wanted the business to expand even further, and they saw that eCommerce platforms were a good way to reach an even wider audience and target more than just their regular consumers. They onboarded the business on Lazada in 2019 and from there saw Skinpotions’ continuous growth. “Our sales boosted significantly since we joined Lazada. During our first 11.11 campaign last year, we managed to achieve our first million in sales,” says Jonalyn. Having built the brand through social media, it definitely worked to their advantage to drive their already loyal customers to their Lazada store. “Social media has been our main way to promote our mega campaigns, hot items and new products. As much as possible, we maximize our social media presence to optimize awareness to our consumers and lead them to shop our items online,” says Jonalyn. Jonalyn has definitely learned a lot of things in the seven years she’s been in business. For her, building a successful brand is all about being passionate in what you do, keeping yourself grounded and making decisions with your consumers always in mind. “Connect with the community who buys and loves your products. Also work with a team that has the same drive and passion, who share your values and will do their best to help the business thrive. Skinpotions would definitely not be what it is today without the support of both our customers and our staff who have helped us build it from the ground up,” says Jonalyn. It’s only upward from here for Skinpotions. Even with their huge success on eCommerce, Jonalyn plans to supplement the expansion of her beauty empire through experiential retail stores to make her consumers feel the brand’s “skincare magic.” Shop Skinpotions at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/skinpotionsph.

Guballa said the BIR had asked the country’s online sellers to register to keep track of their number, but it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year.  Local subscription fees to Netflix, which is based abroad, include a value added tax which “the government wants to collect under the destination principle,” Guballa said at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday. The BIR also wants to tax merchants who sell their items via shopping sites like Lazada, he added.  “We are not really looking at those who were locked down and selling pansit online. We are looking at bigger businesses in online selling,” Guballa said. Outraged netizens and lawmakers had described as “ill-timed and insensitive” the BIR’s directive for online sellers to register, saying that people who had lost their jobs because of the lockdown had turned to online selling to earn a living. Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Jose Maria Concepcion meanwhile appealed to the government to delay its plan to tax online sellers until January next year, to allow them to make ends meet during the pandemic.  The BIR has given online sellers until July 31 to register their business, or face penalties.“We should allow these people to continue and then be stricter later on, maybe next year starting in January,” Concepcion said during the online conference “Flattening the Unemployment Curve,” where he raised the tax issue. Taxing online businesses is not new, as the requirement has been in place since 2013. However, the government’s decision to push for strict compliance amid strict lockdown protocols because of the pandemic has drawn criticisms from various sectors. In the Senate, Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday called on the BIR to withdraw and revise its order for online sellers to register with the bureau, since “it has caused confusion among online sellers,” she said in an online forum. Also in the forum were Bernie Bernal and Michael Adina who sell electronic gadgets and native delicacies online, respectively. The two said they were anxious when they heard about the BIR directive. —With reports from Roy Stephen C.

The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

In April 2016, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba sealed a $1-billion deal with Lazada and bought $500 million in new shares as part of its expansion plain in Southeast Asia, its biggest overseas investment yet to date. Another milestone that Lazada marked last year was its integration with Singapore-based grocery e-commerce RedMart.  READ: E-commerce as great equalizer “[Our partnership with Alibaba] is going great. We are learning a significant lot of things from Alibaba. It is as if we are a child in a primary school and we are learning every day and we are applying those learnings in our business at the strategic level,” Balci said at Lazada’s fifth anniversary event in Makati on Tuesday.  “What we are doing at the moment, this is one of the learnings that we got from Alibaba, is we focus on our core business and we are creating an ecosystem among ourselves,” he added. Balci said Lazada sent five of its merchants last month to the Alibaba Campus in China “so that they could get the best training from Alibaba sellers, merchants, and trainers.”  Lazada, a one-stop online retailer based in Singapore, was launched in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in 2012 and in Singapore in 2014. Today, with over 2,000 employees, Balci said the company occupies a 91-percent share in the Philippines’ e-commerce category in just five years of existence, selling about 6.3 million items and more than 14,000 brands. “This is also my fifth year in the Philippines and we love doing our job in the Philippines. We started from nothing, and we are trying to bring the e-commerce of the Philippines to the next level,” Balci said. “We have been working really hard in the past five years and the question always is, how is Lazada doing? Our vision for the next five years is to become a technology-driven platform empowering our sellers and brands for our customers. We identify ourselves five pillars of growth: assortment, empowering sellers and brands, customer experience, seller and product transparency, and ecosystem,” he added. Balci reiterated Lazada’s commitment to make the Philippines the next top e-commerce hub in the region and in the world by encouraging more people to sell and shop online. E-commerce, he said, is the “biggest entrepreneurial opportunity” in the Philippines in this day and age as it reaches more consumers without having to invest millions. “Why should someone sell in Lazada? One of the most frequent questions I get is if we are competing with shopping malls. The obvious thing is Lazada does not compete with any of the offline stores. What we do is we offer an additional sales channel to all the businesses in the Philippines so they can reach out anyone in the Philippines,” he said.  “This is the reason why I’m saying that Lazada is the biggest entrepreneurial opportunity. There is no bigger entrepreneurial opportunity in the Philippines other than Lazada. Why? Because you don’t need any investment in order to reach millions of pesos. You don’t even need a laptop. You only need an Android phone to start selling on Lazada… And at the same time Lazada is a level playing field. Even if you are the smallest merchant, even if you are the largest corporation in the Philippines, you get the same rates,” Banci added. By yearend, Lazada is eyeing to expand its innovation by utilizing its brand assets and increase, partnerships by maximizing co-marketing efforts with additional 60 local and international brands, and attracting more brands that see it as a disruptive sales channel. “We want people to buy things easy, affordable without spending a lot of time. And I think e-commerce is the best thing that can provide this to customers in the Philippines and again our birthday wish is a great economy for the Philippines and a larger e-commerce landscape,” Banci said. “I think Lazada is one of the biggest contributors in e-commerce in the Philippines. We have been investing heavily in different parts of the Philippines starting with logistics to marketing, for it to be one of the top e-commerce countries in the world,” he added. As part of its 5th anniversary, Lazada is holding a big sale from March 21to 23 with discounts of up to 90 percent, time-based flash sales, exclusive offers from popular brands, and raffle prizes like tour packages.

In a recent briefing, Lazada Philippines co-founder and CEO Inanc Balci said the company planned to expand its own delivery service, Lazada Express, to cover more areas, particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao.  Lazada currently uses the delivery services of LBC and 2GO for nationwide deliveries. Balci said the company also wants to become more aggressive with its “marketplace” to further boost sales.  The marketplace allows Lazada to sign up local entrepreneurs wanting to sell their products online and feature these on its website. Lazada also plans to boost its infrastructure and marketing efforts, and put up three more distribution centers to enable the company to ship its products faster to its customers.  These centers will complement Lazada’s warehouse in Muntinlupa. These initiatives, according to Balci, will be partly funded by the $250 million in capital recently infused by new investors in the Lazada Group. “Southeast Asia is the most exciting part of the world today. While the rest of the world was having problems, Southeast Asia was flourishing, The Philippines, in particular, has an economy that is doing very well, a large population of 100 million and English is widely spoken,” Balci explained. “There is very little e-commerce penetration so there is still a huge potential.

Under the partnership of Unicef and Lazada Philippines, online shoppers can now donate an “inspired gift” to a Filipino child through the Unicef online shop in Lazada from November 1 to December 31, 2018.  These “inspired gifts” are in the form of backpacks, hygiene kits, and emergency supplies, which will be directly given to a Filipino child once a shopper makes the donation. According to Unicef’s special advocate Daphne Oseña-Paez, it is vital that the organization reaches out to online platforms to help facilitate donations.  “Having online channels for fundraising is very very important,” Oseña-Paez said during the launch of Lazada’s 11.11 Shopping Festival on Tuesday. She noted that ongoing fundraising by Unicef for victims of Typhoon “Ompong” that devastated Northern Luzon in September has so far garnered P700,000 worth of contributions in less than a month. Half of this amount came from online donations.  “So for us having more channels where people can help, and people can see where their help makes a difference, a direct impact, it’s very very important,” she said. “And as the studies and the result show, Filipinos are really willing to help,” she added. During a panel discussion on the state of e-commerce in Southeast Asia, Oseña-Paez cited a 2014 Nielsen Global Survey of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) study that showed Filipinos are the most socially conscious consumers. The study found that eight out of 10 Filipinos are willing to pay extra for goods and services to make a difference in the community that they live in. She also cited a McCann Truth Central study in 2016 which showed that 96 percent of the Filipino youth feel that they have a responsibility to make a positive contribution to their community.  “The awareness is there, the willingness is there, and we have an existing donate button in the Unicef website for years, and we’ve generated funds directly through that,” she said.

There are 57 million Facebook accounts—why shouldn’t the same thing apply to e-commerce?” says Inanc Balci, cofounder and CEO of Lazada Philippines. “So we’re now on a mission to make Philippines a dominant player in the world when it comes to e-commerce penetration.”  Balci cited Taiwan as having the highest percentage of online retail sales at 18 percent; the Philippines, on the other, hand, is only at 1 to 2 percent. “Buying online is as easy as getting an account on Facebook; sometimes easier, because you don’t need an e-mail account for some websites. The Philippines can have a much higher [percentage of e-commerce] penetration than that of Taiwan,” Balci says. Other factors also come into play when it comes to the Philippines’ strong potential in e-commerce, adds Balci. “The middle class is growing very fast; the economy is doing really well among other nations in Asia; there is a very young population; smartphone penetration is higher than any other country in Southeast Asia.”  As a treat to its customers, Lazada held a birthday sale last March 21-23. These kinds of events, says Balci, are also a form of investment for the company when it comes to addressing one of the three main challenges in the local ecommerce industry: general market size. Promos and special deals allow Lazada to attract new customers and further grow the business, says Balci. The other two issues, he adds, are payments and logistics. To address the latter, the company formed its own logistics arm called Lazada Express. “That has, today, 70 percent coverage nationwide, and we are continuing to push it even more,” says Balci. “We are also looking toward improving the payments landscape. There is only about 5 percent credit-card penetration which makes it difficult to transact online, so Lazada was the first to launch nationwide cash on delivery. Not a lot of companies are doing this because it’s a costly way of doing business, but for us to grow, we need to invest.”  Lazada was initially established in the Philippines as an online retailer selling electronic goods. The company then “pivoted” its business strategy in 2014, says Balci, shifting its model to an online marketplace, which was “one of the biggest accelerators” of its growth. “Now our business model is a cross of retail marketplace and cross-border marketplace, which is similar to a local marketplace but the merchants are from other countries in the region,” Balci explains. As Lazada and the country’s e-commerce industry continue to grow, so does competition—something which Balci welcomes with open arms. “It’s always better for the market to have competition to keep you on your toes. We believe that for the market to grow much faster, we need better, healthier competition,” he says."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/70884/lazada-opens-logistics-hub-as-online-shopping-grows","title":"Lazada opens logistics hub as online shopping grows","date":"October 16,2015 - 03:06 AM","snippet":"","body":"THE Philippine unit of Southeast Asian e-commerce firm Lazada has set up a logistics hub in Cebu to cope with the growth of online shopping.

It is Lazada’s second logistics center, after the facility in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. A third hub will be opened in Davao next year to serve clients in Mindanao. “The biggest challenge (of online shopping business) is in logistics. The Philippines has a very complex geography with more than 7,000 islands. There are a lot of hard-to-reach islands and it’s expensive to deliver in the Philippines,” he said during the official blessing and inauguration yesterday of the facility located in Mandaue City.

Initially, Lazada has partnered with cargo forwarder LBC. Other third-party logistics companies are also expected to partner with Lazada. The company’s in-house shipping service, Lazada Express, will also be operating from the new hub. “We are very optimistic about the success of the hub since e-shopping has increased drastically,” said Balci. Online shopping currently contributes one percent to total sales in the country, but Balci said this is expected to increase as more consumers turn to online e-commerce sites for convenience and easier access. He also noted that more and more merchants are setting up online shops as either primary or secondary avenues for revenue. Nearly 10,000 local merchants are using the Lazada platform, he said.

Raised in London, Balci attended Purdue University in the United States and has degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics.  He then worked on mergers and acquisitions for an investment bank in London. It was while he was working for the investment bank that Balci saw the potential of e-commerce, prompting him to join Rocket Internet, co-found Lazada in Southeast Asia and then become CEO of Lazada Philippines two years ago.  At his headquarters in Makati City, Balci heads a pool of more than 300 employees, with home he works closely. An integral part of their job is to think up ways to make online shopping more fun, more convenient, and more risk-free than ever before.  “Once a traditional shopper buys online and has a good experience, there’s no stopping [him or her from going online again],” Balci said in a recent briefing to introduce 12.12. Part of Lazada’s latest efforts to woo shoppers is what it claims to be the biggest sale of the year—the Lazada 12.12 Online Revolution. Coming from the 11.11 online sales promotion in November to usher in the holiday season in the country, Lazada’s 12.12 has Midnight Voucher offers being given away starting 12 a.m. until 7:59 a.m. on Dec. 12.

Also, Redmi bundles and Mi 3 will be on sale on 12.12. Customers who will purchase a Mi 3 or Redmi bundle will get a chance to win a Mi 4 or Redmi Note. But getting traditional shoppers to go online takes more than just offering great deals. In a country where shopping malls are practically part of the fabric of society, online shopping is something quite a number of Filipinos are unaccustomed to. Preventing more Filipinos from fully embracing e-commerce is the perennial trust issue on using credit cards, surprise surcharges, and unfortunately, the unfortunate experience of products not arriving at all. Malls in the Philippines, on the other hand, have positioned themselves to be more than shopping destinations. Malls offer recreation and dining options, for instance, and the air-conditioned facilities are a welcome break from the raging tropical weather outdoors. Balci and his co-founders had to resolve nagging issues related to e-commerce. Thus Lazada, he said, has made shopping quick, effortless, and risk-free to Southeast Asia and in the Philippines. Lazada, for example, accommodates online shoppers without credit cards via its cash-on-delivery payment mode. This is essential since not everyone has a credit card or is comfortable sharing financial details online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “This makes online shopping practically risk-free because they can check the items or try them on—if these are clothes or shoes —while our delivery person waits. If they do not want to buy them, for any reason, they can give them back and not have to pay. It’s all in the comfort of their own home,” Balci said. Accessibility issues Being an archipelago of 7,100 islands, accessibility is always an issue—a significant portion of consumers do not have the time to visit malls or might not have physical access to them. But with a P1,000 purchase, Lazada offers free nationwide delivery to customers anywhere in the Philippines, even as far as Tawi-Tawi. Lazada also offers the flexibility of having the customers return the products within 30 days risk free—provided that the products are in mint condition. In his two years in the Philippines, Balci has steered Lazada to further heights. Lazada says it has more than 40,000 products, reaches 90 percent of the online population of the Philippines, and ranks as the fourth top Facebook brand in the country with a direct audience of close to 2 million. Since March 2012, Lazada has been working hard to revolutionize the meaning of online shopping in a country where shopping in malls is part of the core lifestyle. With the largest online assortment of products ranging from mobiles and laptops to consumer electronics to books and media, health and beauty, home appliances, fashion and accessories, Lazada Philippines offers its wide customer base what they need in one place. Nested in its head office in Makati City with its 12,000-square-meter warehouse in Muntinlupa City, Lazada Philippines has a workforce of more than 300 employees.

Through an open letter on Wednesday, 150 diverse groups advocating for a zero waste and toxics-free society have urged online shopping sites to take steps to cut their packaging footprint as the country grapples with increasing plastic waste and pollution crisis.  “We make this appeal to all online shopping platforms to heed our plea for sustainable e-commerce that will not cause further harm to our ailing environment and climate, and endanger the health of humans and other living organisms,” EcoWaste Coalition Policy Advocacy Officer Patricia Nicdao said. “With the surge in e-shopping, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot help but be concerned about the huge amounts of plastic packaging produced, consumed and disposed of by the multi-billion peso online retail industry,” the groups wrote.  The groups lamented that much of these packaging wastes are going straight to garbage bins, buried in landfills, incinerated in cement kilns, clogged in drainage canals and river systems, or dumped into the world’s oceans harming marine life. “As two of the top e-commerce sites in the country, we appeal to Lazada and Shopee to set a good example in preventing and reducing the generation of packaging waste, particularly by diminishing plastic use, from online retail transactions,” the groups said.  They presented recommendations to the online shopping sites and others to cut down on their plastic use and packaging waste: 1.  Make public their plastic footprint (i.e., types and quantities of plastic packaging materials used annually); 2.  Adopt a plastic packaging waste prevention and reduction policy, including plastic-free packaging choice at checkout, returning used packages with reverse logistics and other schemes, and incentives for reduced packaging; 3.  Transition to ecological and safe options for delivering goods, including appropriate product packaging, to reduce disposable and unnecessary plastic and packaging waste; 4.  Implement time-targeted and measurable phase-out plans for plastic packaging materials;  5.  Communicate such phase-out plans to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers; and to 6.  Create a merchants’ section for those who sustainably package their products. The groups also called on e-commerce sites to offer, partner with, and provide incentives to developers, makers, distributors, dealers and customers of alternatives to single-use plastic bags, sachets, cups, cutlery, beverage and water bottles, straws and even diapers, panty liners and sanitary pads. Aside from providing customers with a plastic-free shopping experience, the groups further urged online shopping platforms to purge their sites of products that pose health and safety risks This includes non-compliant toys and childcare articles, contraband cosmetics containing lead, mercury and other contaminants, banned mercury-containing medical devices, proscribed or recalled products, etc."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/81948/online-retail-lazada-com-to-get-fresh-capital-from-jpmorgan-chase","title":"Online retail Lazada.com to get fresh capital from JPMorgan Chase","date":"01:17 AM September 14, 2012","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—Southeast Asia-centric online retail giant Lazada.com is set to receive an infusion of fresh capital through an investment by JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank’s German investment unit.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—Southeast Asia-centric online retail giant Lazada.com is set to receive an infusion of fresh capital through an investment by JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank’s German investment unit. In a statement released Wednesday evening, Lazada said the additional resources would be used for the company’s continued expansion in Asia, where the company has been recognized as one of the leading players in the e-commerce sector.  “We feel very honored to welcome JPMorgan to our investor group and are particularly excited to be joined by an investor that shares our vision and belief in the huge potential of this populous region replicating online shopping behaviors in other countries,” Lazada regional CEO Maximilian Bittner said. “This will further support our growth as we strive to offer all of our customers fast, convenient and secure online shopping experiences,” he said.  The investment will be made through JPMorgan Asset Management’s branch in Germany. JP Morgan Asset management supervises about $2 trillion in funds. Lazada is owned by German incubator firm Rocket Internet GmbH, often described in the industry as a “serial cloner” because many of its online businesses have striking similarities to other successful websites launched in other countries.  “We are excited to partner with Lazada as it continues to expand its e-commerce presence in Southeast Asia,” said Robert Cousin, the JPMorgan portfolio manager who worked on the deal from New York. The Lazada shopping portal was launched in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam six months ago. The website is patterned closely after United States-based shopping website, Amazon.com. Since its launch, Lazada said it has been able to dislodge most of its established local and international competitors, in terms of the number of monthly visitors and revenues, according to web-ranking site Alexa.com. The company said it has risen to the ranks of the top local B2C (business to consumer) e-commerce sites in all of its markets. “This growth is a testament to the huge potential of this region with a population of more than 600 million people and a growing young middle class which are embracing new online experiences – ranging from e-commerce to social media – at an ever-increasing pace through their mobile phones or other connected devices,” Lazada said. Lazada has 1,000 employees in the region although the company has been reported to have laid off several dozen of its Filipino employees last month due to undisclosed reasons."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/92954/lazada-to-expand-operations-with-40-m-fund-from-swedish-firm","title":"Lazada to expand operations with $40-M fund from Swedish firm","date":"10:38 PM November 13, 2012","snippet":"Swedish investment house Kinnevik is betting big on Southeast Asia’s economic rise through an investment of $40 million in online shopping site Lazada, which is emerging as a leading player in the region’s e-commerce sector.","body":"Swedish investment house Kinnevik is betting big on Southeast Asia’s economic rise through an investment of $40 million in online shopping site Lazada, which is emerging as a leading player in the region’s e-commerce sector. The new investment comes shortly after Lazada announced that it now had the backing of JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong.  “This provides Lazada with an exceptionally well-funded balance sheet to continue its fast growth in Southeast Asia,” said Lazada, an e-commerce site owned by German incubator Rocket Internet. The fresh funds would help the company further expand its already-growing reach and product line-up for its customers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.  “By focusing on providing superior service to our customers we have grown into a trusted household brand and to broaden our assortment is a natural next step for us,” Lazada’s regional CEO Maximilian Bittner said. Lazada recently added fashion to its extensive product offering, which ranges from consumer electronics to household goods, toys and sports equipment.  “Kinnevik has a proven track-record of investing in emerging markets and we are very excited to have such a knowledgeable and experienced investor on board,” Bittner said. “In addition to capital, they will provide us with invaluable strategic insight of operating in such markets. It is also a strong testament to what we have accomplished so far and verifies that we are on the right track to achieve our aggressive strategic goals,” he added. Lazada is largely believed to be patterned after the popular United States online shopping site Amazon.com, which failed to establish a significant foothold in fast-growing emerging markets like the Philippines. In a statement, Kinnevik investments head Henrik Persson said Lazada’s rise to become a recognized name in e-commerce in a relatively short period led to the investment. “We are delighted to invest in Lazada, which has obtained a market leading position,” Persson said. “The company is perfectly positioned to become the major e-commerce player in this region, which counts more than 600 million inhabitants,” he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/303931/house-panel-oks-vat-for-online-goods-services","title":"House panel OKs VAT for online goods, services","date":"05:34 AM July 30, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Netflix and Spotify subscribers as well as Amazon, Lazada and Shopee customers may soon have to pay more for these digital platforms’ products and services should the 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) approved by the House committee on ways and means becomes law after third reading in the House and Senate approval.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Netflix and Spotify subscribers as well as Amazon, Lazada and Shopee customers may soon have to pay more for these digital platforms’ products and services should the 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) approved by the House committee on ways and means becomes law after third reading in the House and Senate approval. “We imposed no new taxes … In general, if you sell, you pay VAT, unless you fall under the exemptions for small businesses,” explained committee chair and Albay Rep.

Small businesses, including those engaged in online selling whose sales are below P3 million will continue to be VAT exempt, Salceda said.

This partnership will be launched in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand in October ahead of Lazada’s “Online Revolution” campaign, the largest online shopping event in the region happening from Nov. 11 to Dec.12.  In Singapore and Vietnam, Citi and Lazada already have an existing partnership deals.  “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems.

To ensure that these products are not accessible to minors, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III on Saturday said “we will move to ban online sales of cigarettes and liquor.”  The Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003 bars cigarette makers from advertising, including on the internet, but there’s no law preventing them from selling in online marketplaces. Presidential Decree No. 1619, issued in 1979, prohibits the sale to minors of “volatile substances that induce intoxication.’’  Amid the quarantine, which limits the movement of people and access to certain goods and services, online sales are booming—and those of cigarettes are no exemption. People below 21 years old are still barred from going outside their home even under general community quarantine (GCQ), which was implemented in Metro Manila on June 1. GCQ was earlier declared in other areas.  Since March 16, minors have been cooped up in their homes as a result of the lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus. The ban on the sale of liquor, imposed by local governments to discourage social drinking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, was lifted only a few weeks ago. A check with e-commerce platform Lazada on Sunday showed popular cigarette brands being sold at big discounts of 15 percent to 55 percent. For instance, the price of a ream of mentholated Marlboro containing 10 packs of 20 sticks each was slashed 42 percent to P1,050 from P1,800. Liquors are also being sold on Lazada, although the website asks potential buyers to first confirm whether they are “at least 18 years old to enter” the page of the specific product category.  Some of the alcoholic drinks are also being offered at discounted prices. PMFTC Inc., a merger of Philip Morris International Inc. and Lucio Tan’s Fortune Tobacco, said it was allowing authorized resellers to sell cigarettes online. But Dave Gomez, communications director at PMFTC, told the Inquirer on Sunday that the company was implementing a so-called age-gating to ensure that none of its products were sold to minors. PMFTC’s trade and distribution agreements with resellers contain provisions requiring the latter to not sell to consumers below 18 years old, according to Gomez. The resellers are responsible to double-check the ages of buyers upon delivery, he said. “We’re very strict with that online sellers observe age verification.” Thus, he said, resellers were required to ask buyers to show proof through any government-issued ID. Gomez added that PMFTC would cancel agreements with resellers that did not follow age-gating. Asked to comment on Dominguez’s plan to ban online sales, he replied: “We understand the concern and agree that cigarettes should not be sold to minors, even online. Minors should not smoke, period.” “For online commerce, resellers of cigarettes should strictly observe youth-access prevention by having age-gating on their sites and require proof of age upon delivery. This is our policy,” he added. Gomez acknowledged that PMFTC brands, like any other consumer products, were seeing a surge in e-commerce sales due to the pandemic. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It was because of this online sales boom that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) moved to strictly implement registration and, eventually, tax collection among businesses in the digital space. The government was also working on a mechanism to collect value-added tax (VAT) from global digital platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Last month, Dominguez said that “as more and more transactions move online, so must our revenue measures.” He said the government would be “focusing on efforts on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what other Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are doing.” While the quarantine boosted online sales, it stopped operations of tobacco and alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the early months of the pandemic due to a liquor ban and restricted deliveries of nonessential products. When the supply of tax-paid cigarettes dwindled, trade of fake and illicit sticks flourished. The Bureau of Customs reported that the Port of Subic confiscated on July 1 three 12-meter containers of smuggled cigarettes, which had been misdeclared as LED lights. The seized cargo contained about 3,100 master cases of cigarettes valued at P93.1 million. A combination of rising illicit trade and the lockdown restrictions on production had resulted in weak “sin” tax revenue to date. As of end-May, the combined take from tobacco and alcohol products fell 39 percent year-on-year to P63.1 billion. This was despite the higher levies slapped on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and alcoholic drinks under Republic Act No. 11346, or the tobacco tax law of 2019 signed by President Duterte last year, as well as RA 11467 signed in January.

Joey Salceda, chair of the House ways and means committee, is pushing the imposition of a tax on digital services—specifically, subscriptions to video and music streaming apps, ads on social media sites and making online sales platforms as withholding tax agents—to offset an estimated P120 billion in forgone revenues once the government cuts corporate income taxes to 25 percent to soothe the pain inflicted by COVID-19 on businesses. Salceda told the Inquirer on Monday that he intended to call these new tax measures as “Netflix tax,” “Facebook ads tax” and “Lazada tax,” respectively.In the case of Netflix tax, Salceda said the current standard digital services tax slapped on subscriptions worldwide was 5 percent, although he noted that Chile imposes a higher 19 percent.  Salceda said the Philippines might as well slap a new 12-percent tax on subscriptions to video and music streaming sites, a market currently worth about P5 billion. At present, whatever subscription fees were being collected by apps like Netflix or Spotify weren’t levied any tax by the Philippine government, Salceda noted.  For Facebook ads tax, Salceda said the idea was to require that digital advertisements be made through a country representative of Facebook and Google so it becomes least problematic. As such, collection of 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax among digital advertisers will augment the current revenue base, he explained.  “The big money is in finding a way to tax the advertising on Facebook and Google,” Salceda said, adding that these two tech giants operate like a duopoly in the country as they dominate the online space here. Citing a model proposed by 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics winner Paul Romer, Salceda said tax on digital advertising woud be “based on how much companies earn from displaying the ads in the tax jurisdiction, because that’s where value is created.” As for the proposed Lazada tax, Salceda noted that only 50 percent of vendors who sell their goods and services via online marketplaces like the Alibaba Group’s Lazada, Amazon and Shopee, among others, pay VAT. Among online sellers, “around half are fully compliant [with VAT payments] since they are large taxpayers and accredited shops,” he said. To capture the unpaid VAT, Salceda said these online platforms would be tapped to also serve as withholding tax agents of their suppliers. With sales of the Philippines’ e-commerce sector estimated to reach about P260 billion this year, VAT collections should reach around P30 billion, Salceda said.

According to a few local digital entrepreneurs, these are just some of e-commerce trends to watch out for in the Philippines, since social distancing will likely become the norm even after lockdown restrictions are eased, given that there is no end yet in sight for the COVID-19 pandemic.  “I’d say that this pandemic would really be the inflection point for e-commerce here in the Philippines,” said Steve Sy, CEO of e-commerce solutions company Great Deals, who spoke on April 30 as one of the experts at the online forum “Stay at Home E-conomy.” The event, streamed live on Facebook and moderated by Inquirer Prime content editor and Inquirer Business section writing editor Dax Lucas, is the first of a series of online discussions, titled “OnLive: Digital Economy Essentials.” “The impact of COVID-19 on us was [to force us] to go digital; cashless payments are on an all-time high because people want [contactless transactions]. I think this has created the opportunity for many companies to realize that e-commerce has arrived,” Sy said.  Another speaker, Lazada Philippines business development head Petrus Paolo Carbonell, confirmed Sy’s observation. “E-commerce in general has currently been seeing significant growth, but the focus, mostly, especially during the first few weeks of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), was essential goods,” Carbonell said. “The trend that we’re seeing here are first-time buyers are on the platform—and they are growing every day.”  He added that because of this new consumer behavior, now would be a good time for “offline” retailers to migrate to online platforms—and an effective way to market their products, continued another resource speaker, and the forum’s host Hiyasmin Neri-Soyao, would be to do live-streaming videos. “You have your promos for certain new products, and live-streaming is a way for you to amplify that,” said Soyao, who is also CEO of live-streaming platform Shoppertainment Live. She also listed the five elements necessary for an effective live stream: the presenter, the product, the promo, the demo and frequency. “Live-streaming can actually help you sell more and engage more with your customers. When they have questions about your products, it’s easier to engage them,” Soyao said. And if you need more help in the sales department, why not try having an influencer promote your products? “At Shoppertainment Live, we actually have an ‘army’ of influencers whom we’ve trademarked as Influensales hosts, or influencers who also know how to sell,” Soyao said. “They understand the product, the brand and the message of what they are selling, and can entertain people as well. So if you can do that, you can be an Influensales.”  That’s one way e-commerce players can stay ahead of competition: Aside from products, offer an array of content in your online store, Carbonell said. Lazada, for one, has also been hosting live-streaming sessions on their platform. “People are starting to consume more content online,” Carbonell added. “And we see this trend extending even beyond the ECQ.” Sy identified another upcoming trend that would differentiate the more diligent e-commerce entrepreneurs from the rest of the pack: quick commerce. With more consumers turning to online stores, the brand that’s able to fulfill others in the quickest possible time—say, 30 minutes, just like with fast-food delivery—would have an edge over other merchants. This would also translate to demand for more motorcycle drivers as delivery personnel—another business opportunity—and for “micro” fulfillment centers. “We [in Great Deals] can see more of these micro fulfillment centers coming up, so [businesses] can deliver faster to people in their communities,” said Sy, whose company Great Deals provides brands both big and small the full suite of e-commerce-enabling services: from digital content, to web design, analytics and chat support, to warehousing and fulfillment. But any entrepreneur looking to pivot to e-commerce needs a crucial tool: digital software. The forum’s fourth speaker, Multisys Technologies Corporation CEO and founder David Almirol Jr., highlighted, especially, the need for seamless technology. “You don’t want a ‘Frankenstein’ system. You want to deal with the right tech partner,” Almirol said. “And that’s all about how fast integration can be done. Look for someone who can do it in a seamless way.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/294216/sun-life-moves-to-help-covid-19-front-liners","title":"Sun Life moves to help COVID-19 front-liners","date":"04:07 AM April 06, 2020","snippet":"Insurer Sun Life of Canada is donating digital life insu­rance with up to P75 million worth of coverage to local doctors, nur­ses and other medical support staff, the front-liners in the global war against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.","body":"Insurer Sun Life of Canada is donating digital life insu­rance with up to P75 million worth of coverage to local doctors, nur­ses and other medical support staff, the front-liners in the global war against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay. Let’s help make it work for our still struggling entrepreneurs, and let’s make sure our kids are prepared as well to be smart consumers. mtan@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

OMB flags sale of ‘pirated’ software, movies on shopping sites","date":"08:04 PM September 03, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Optical Media Board (OMB) on Thursday flagged the sale of thousands of counterfeit software, games and pirated movies on online shopping platforms.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Optical Media Board (OMB) on Thursday flagged the sale of thousands of counterfeit software, games and pirated movies on online shopping platforms. During a Senate hearing on the proposed Internet Transactions Act, OMB chair Atty. Anselmo Adriano said the emergence of the e-commerce market has paved the way for a “new upsurge of intellectual property piracy.”  “E-commerce sites and social media platforms became huge enablers for pirates and counterfeits,” he said. “The nature of e-commerce platforms make it easy for pirates and counterfeiters to hide in private dedicated marketplaces or move between different territories to avoid capture,” he added.  Adriano presented slides that showed thousands of counterfeit software listings, including Adobe and Microsoft Office products as well as software games, being sold for “very cheap” prices on Lazada and Shopee, two of the most popular online shopping sites in the country. “These are selling various items that are found for the Adobe software that is being sold, 1,607 items found for Adobe,” he said as he flashed a screenshot of the listings.  Moving onto another slide, the OMB official showed senators an item for a “cracked” Abobe Photoshop software which is being sold for as low as P18. “[We also saw listings for] Auto Cad, which you would probably know is very expensive software. We found 92 items being sold on the internet for very, very cheap prices. One is being sold for as low as P40,” he also said. In addition to this, Adriano said they also discovered around 900,000 OMB-regulated products, like media devices, for sale online without prior license or permits from the board. “For 2019, we were able to confiscate approximately 40,000 pieces of USBs, SD cards, and internal hard disk drives from various sellers…valued at over P20 million,” he noted. Lazada Philippines CEO Raymond Alimurung told the Senate committee that the company has an “intellectual property portal” that allows legitimate brand owners to flag counterfeit items and notify Lazada.  “We will react very quickly,” Alimurung said. “Now it is possibly of course that they (brand owners) are not doing it or that they are not doing it fast enough,” he added. He also stressed that Lazada is doing its best to address problems of unauthorized sale of such products on its platform. He added that Lazada works closely with regulators like the OMB and even the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. “When we receive a notice, we’ll act very quickly,” he said. “We also respond to customer complaints so I think it’s important to note that it is not for the lack of doing a lot of things that those (counterfeit items) are there,” he added. “It’s just that we just have to continue to develop a better mousetrap as these guys try to develop better mice,” Alimurung further said. As for Shopee, Atty. Jaimmie Hans-Segovia said the e-commerce site also has a mechanism to address counterfeit items. “We have a procedure for taking down these counterfeit items where legitimate intellectual property rights owners can notify Shopee and request that listing of what they believe are counterfeit products be taken down and we act on this,” she said.

Two years ago, she passed away, leaving my grandfather Basilio and second cousin Vikki Torres to continue her modest business, which supported the livelihoods of a handful of people.","body":"After she retired as a public school teacher in San Pablo, my late grandmother Rosita started selling tamarind candies—Rosing’s Champoy—and to her dying days took pride in her entrepreneurship that has led to her products—which have since expanded to include peanut brittle—being sold in different parts of the country, including in SM supermarkets. Two years ago, she passed away, leaving my grandfather Basilio and second cousin Vikki Torres to continue her modest business, which supported the livelihoods of a handful of people. The pandemic brought their small-scale business to a halt: The pasalubong centers and the restaurants that ordered from them shut down, and with international travel held in abeyance, they couldn’t count on their balikbayan customers either.  Such was the case for months until they decided to sell the products online. “This is where things are headed,” Ate Vikki told me. “We should at least try our luck.” And so last month, with the help of other relatives and a consultant, they opened their Lazada store, in time for the “11.11 sale.” My relatives are among the many Filipinos turning to the online economy to rescue their businesses—or keep themselves afloat by starting new ones.  Thankfully, it is easy to open an online store. While it took a lot of hard work (and paperwork) for my Lola to be able to sell her candies in SM, it took only days to set up the business’ presence in Lazada. It is similarly easy to do the same in Shopee, which is why many businesses often have parallel stores on both platforms. In terms of capital, it’s likewise easier: Unlike a physical store in a mall, for example, that will require months of rental advance and deposits, not to mention the cost of actually building the store, an online store will only take some elementary skills in layout, photography, and web development.  Finally, in terms of profit, the minimal commission and transaction fees allow sellers to offer products at a price point competitive against other sources. All of the above are liberating for small and medium enterprises, giving them a lifeline during the pandemic and likely beyond, with the online economy seemingly poised to become only more and more dominant. On the other hand, it is also easy to see how the online economy can exclude as much as it includes. We may have iconoclastic feelings against big corporations like SM, but will Shopee and Lazada be any different should they continue their growth? Empowering to SMEs the online economy may be—but what of the riders and workers who bear much of the effort, but are no less contractual and vulnerable as mall (non-)employees? The challenge, then, for our country and society is to make sure that everyone benefits from the online economy—from the entrepreneurs to the consumers and the people in between, especially the riders to whom we have outsourced the need to go out of our homes, with them bearing the risk for minimal pay. Of course, the onus is on the online sellers themselves to act on this equity considerations, but the government, too, has a role, not least of which is to ensure and facilitate internet access throughout the country, given how it’s become fundamental not just to our social lives but also to economic participation. Another challenge is to make the online economy environment-friendly. Alas, today all our individual packages come with layer upon layer of bubble wrap, and while this may be demand-driven (e.g., customers’ view that the more packaging, the better), can we not come up with solutions to reduce the materials needed? Can we not apply the principles “reduce, reuse, recycle”—in that order? Proven measures include grouping packages to minimize packaging, Amazon-style; using alternative packaging materials (e.g., EcoNest Philippines’ cassava bags and other products); and scaling up recycling practices and capabilities. Surely there are more ways, and I’m sure our environmental scientists and online sellers themselves have much to say in this important conversation.  Meanwhile, I would like to end this piece by calling on Shopee, Lazada, and other online platforms to pursue, support, and encourage plastic-free options within their ecosystems; for consumers to clamor for it, and for all of us—scientists, citizens, entrepreneurs, and government agencies—to work together to ensure that the online economy is inclusive, sustainable, and friendly to the environment. —————— glasco@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Starting June 5, 2020, Maxus Philippines’ roster of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) will also be offered in Lazada. Here’s the news from Maxus: For Maxus Philippines, being available in the Lazada online store means being able to make its vehicles accessible to the four million daily—or 120 million monthly—site visitors, including a nationwide social media reach of 29 million Facebook and 78,000 Twitter followers. Maxus vehicles also become available for online purchase/reservation anytime, virtually expanding the dealerships’ effective reach round-the-clock, all year round. Lazada also offers the utmost convenience, safety, and security in online purchases, which is ideal under the current general community quarantine guidelines that encourage contactless transactions, minimizing the risk of further spreading the coronavirus.  This month of June, as Maxus Philippines celebrates its 1st year in the country, Lazada shoppers can view details and pertinent specifications of the Maxus T60 pickup, V80 utility and passenger vans, and the G10 MPV and G10 with Assist package at the LazMall Store. Lazada shoppers on the lookout for the ideal LCV will find that the Maxus brand, which originated in the United Kingdom, has had a successful 124-year history, becoming one of Europe’s most recognized commercial vehicle brands, and a leader in the design, production and distribution of international commercial vehicles, with distributorships in Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Africa. And as a testament to their adaptability and versatility, Maxus vehicles fit every need in these extraordinary times, in this “new normal” of motoring lifestyle where space, comfort, fuel efficiency, safety, and power is needed now more than ever. The Maxus T60 can be a crucial tool to keep key supply chains moving. For the agricultural, industrial, medical, utilities and construction sectors, the Maxus T60 pickup, in either 4×2 or 4×4 variants, provides the space, power, and adaptability to keep people and goods moving efficiently and continuously. The upsized dimensions of the T60 translate to bigger and heavier capabilities, in terms of payload capacity, towing power, and water wading depth, and in real world applications this means that the T60 can accommodate the varying needs of Filipino pickup owners, be they in the city or in the countryside. The Maxus T60 is powered by the Euro4-rated 2.8-liter Turbo Diesel engine with Variable Geometry Turbocharger and intercooler mated to a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, generating maximum power of 150PS@3,400RPM and maximum torque of 360Nm@1,600-2,800RPM–more than enough for Filipino motorists to maximize their hauling potentials. The Maxus V80 vans offer both space and flexibility that adapt well to the public health requirements of the “new normal” in motoring. The V80 Comfort’s 13-seater passenger capacity can be re-adjusted to comply with physical distancing requirements inside vehicles. The V80 Flex cargo van, on the other hand, offers a roomy cargo space of 6.9 cubic meters and flexible interiors to allow for proper physical distancing among the driver and cargo handlers, while at the same time the van’s 1.1-ton maximum loading capacity allows for sufficient cargo to maximize business operations. As an ambulance, the Maxus V80 Flex gives enough space for necessary equipment, and the elbow room for emergency medical personnel to perform life-saving procedures on the patient en route to the hospital. Loading and unloading cargo or patients is done more efficiently and safely with the V80’s rear dual swing-out doors. The V80 is powered by a 2.5-liter Turbo-Diesel engine with a power output of 136 Ps and 330Nm of torque, and comes in 6-speed manual transmission. Safety features include front airbags for both the driver and front passenger, Anti-lock Brake System with EBD and 4–wheel disc brake. The Maxus G10 is the flagship model of Maxus Philippines. Like the V80 vans, this 9-seater multi-purpose vehicle’s spacious interior and comfort amenities can be adapted well to comply with public health guidelines without compromising passenger comfort and ride safety. The four captain seats at the rear ensure that these passengers maintain their physical distance; while the power seat for the driver and front passenger with adjustable seating still provide spacious room. The G10 with Assist package is ideal for elderly and persons with walking difficulties, and also for recovering patients who need assistance getting into and out of the vehicle, as it comes with the programmable swivel lifting seat at the 2nd row, conveniently beside the sliding door. This seat swivels to face the sidewalk, slides out and can be lowered down to street level so that the passenger can easily take the seat, or disembark. Caregivers or patient assistants can still maintain proper physical distancing while helping the patient get out of or onto the G10, as the programmable swivel lifting seat is easy to operate via seat switch, remote control or even through mobile phone. The Maxus G10 is powered by a Euro4 1.9-liter Turbo-Diesel engine mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission that produces 150 Ps of power and torque of 350 Nm, making it powerful yet fuel efficient. Making online purchases for their chosen Maxus vehicles is easy for Lazada shoppers. Just follow these 4 easy steps: All processes are safe, as codes are dealership generated, unique, and secured under the Lazada Seller Platform. Starting June 5, Lazada and Maxus Philippines will offer a reservation voucher of P5,000 for the Maxus T60, G10 and G10 with Assist package, and, V80 Comfort and Flex variants.

Local cult faves will get up to 70 percent off so to be smart about it, I’m already making a list and planning my shopping spree. Allow me to list down the products I will be adding in my cart. And all are approved by #TeamPreenPH. Obsessed~ Okay, my team and I reviewed and talked about this new line of lipsticks—and obviously we can’t get enough. I’m here to cop the sets because I want to complete all nine shades plus the cutest jelly pouch in cherry. I try my best to lessen my waste and be more sustainable. One of the steps I took was to switch from shampoo in plastic bottles to shampoo bars with reusable containers. There’s a lot of local brands coming up with their own recipes and I’m pretty excited for Beach Born’s deep conditioning formula! I’m all for dewy skin that looks bouncy and fresh and this Happy Skin highlighter pen is easy and fuss-free. Just swipe on the high points of your face and blend, plus points because it’s compact and can be stashed in my sling bag. One of the many reasons why I keep copping matte liquid is because I don’t have to retouch as often. And the latest one I’ve been eyeing is the Bold Matte Liquid Lipstick from local brand M&Co., specifically in the color Pirate Queen because I’m still into the ’90s look. And since it promises to be kiss proof and smudge proof then I know I won’t ever have to worry. I know it’s not new, but I’ve only recently started “baking” to make sure my concealer doesn’t budge by end of day. This sheer translucent powder from Ellana has great reviews and I can’t wait to try it. Plus it’s fragrance-free, paraben-free, and cruelty-free. I love to collect face masks that come in tubs because I believe they are more sustainable (though I still use sheet masks from time to time). This in particular is known for its moisturizing and brightening benefits—plus it promises to shrink my pores. Oh yes! For days when I don’t feel like wearing makeup, but can’t be caught with a pale face—go for this easy-to-use and long-wearing lip and cheek tint. It gives you a natural flush without looking too made up!  My friends rave about this cooling cream that they love to use post-workout (or strenuous activity like traveling). It gives off a relaxing smell and cooling effect to soothe your muscles. I love slathering this to recover! The first 200 readers will get 25 percent off when you use the “PREENxLazada” voucher code from Aug. 27 to 28. Maximum discount is at P300 with a minimum spend of P500. Happy shopping!

However, they struggle to establish a stronghold in terms of actual selling activity as international players are still the preferred choice for most Filipinos.  It comes as a surprise that only a few international players dominate the country’s e-marketplace traffic activity. Based on Kuala Lumpur-based iPrice Group’s Map of eCommerce in the Philippines during the second quarter of 2018, there were more local active players.  However, international players fueled market activity. In fact, the share of foreign players in the overall traffic accounted for 93 percent of the overall e-marketplace activity. Local players, on the other hand, only led in social media activity as they accounted for 75 percent of e-commerce activity from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter platforms. Foreign players  There were only eight foreign players engaged in e-commerce traffic in the Philippines: Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, eBay, Sephora, Sophie Paris, My Sale and Melissa Philippines. Of these eight players, Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and eBay were the top four most visited e-marketplaces in the country. Of the four, Lazada had a dominant 68-percent market share, at least triple the size of its closest competitor, Shopee. This trend is unique to the Philippine market because in its regional counterparts Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, foreign players have less than half of the overall e-marketplace traffic activity with 45, 20 and 47 percent, respectively. For Indonesia and Singapore, local players Tokopedia and Qoo10 were the most visited e-marketplaces.  The reason behind the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was traced to the Filipinos’ online shopping preference that is mainly based on brand familiarity. In fact, according to a Kantar Worldpanel survey, 84 percent of Filipinos (out of 3,000 household surveyed) preferred to buy from established companies despite the alternatives available in the market. This specific Filipino consumer behavior affected the local e-commerce players as majority of them have just started operating in the e-marketplace. Another factor that influenced the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was that majority of big local brick-and-mortar companies such as SM and Ayala malls were amplifying their online presence with e-marketplace partnerships with the more established players such as Lazada and Zalora instead of creating their own e-marketplaces. Meanwhile, the government’s project—road map of e-commerce—is mostly tied with international e-marketplaces wherein local brick-and-mortal companies and brands as well as MSMEs are encouraged to sell. More pressure While this will result in more customers and more jobs especially for MSMEs, it is putting pressure on the local players. The most visited local e-marketplace in the country is BeautyMNL, placing fifth overall with less than a million traffic. Meanwhile, Kimstore, a tech marketplace, placed ninth. The general e-marketplaces—Galleon, O Shopping and Takatack (which were previously in Q1 2018’s top e-commerce) all fell a notch, placing seventh, eighth and 11th, respectively. The only local e-commerce that accelerated in terms of ranking was Argomall as it jumped two notches to sixth in the overall e-commerce ranking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Interestingly, the majority of local players experienced inconsistency in traffic as there were occasions of leaps and slips. The e-marketplaces that saw increased traffic were Seek the Unique, Apartment 8 Clothing, Zeus, Straight Forward Clothing, Great Value Plus, Bayan Mall, TV Shop, Mall Hallo Hallo and CesaPH, which on the average rose in ranking by about seven notches. E-marketplaces that slipped in traffic were Adobomall, Watch Portal, Goods, Mommy Mundo, Bigmk, Abubot, which on the average declined in ranking by about eight notches. Despite the low market penetration and inconsistency in traffic of local players, the majority of local players found their market in social media. Overall, the local players dominated Instagram and Twitter as they attracted 70 and 51 percent, respectively, of the e-marketplace social media followers. Local marketplace The local fashion and beauty e-marketplaces: Apartment 8 Clothing, Sunnies Studios, BeautyMNL, Kimstore and CesaPH topped Instagram placing first, second, fifth, seventh and ninth, respectively. Meanwhile, social media activity for Facebook was taken over by international players as their share of social media followers in this platform accounted for 77 percent. Filipino consumers are among the most active on social media, spending an average of four hours a day. As such, Filipino consumers are highly exposed to brands leveraging their products in social media. Clearly, the popularity of social media is a huge opportunity marketplace for e-commerce and independent merchants alike.—CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1358333/drug-syndicates-going-online-pdea-agent-tells-lawmakers","title":"Drug syndicates going online, PDEA agent tells lawmakers","date":"05:35 PM November 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—Online selling platforms and transport network services (TNVS) “are being exploited” by drug syndicates for their illegal trade, according to an official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Monday (Nov. 9).","body":"MANILA, Philippines—Online selling platforms and transport network services (TNVS) “are being exploited” by drug syndicates for their illegal trade, according to an official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Monday (Nov. 9). “This pandemic may have caused these drug personalities to elevate and take advantage of online platforms,” said PDEA agent Aida Ferolino at a House hearing on the sale of drugs online.  Ferolino told lawmakers that the shift in drug transactions from face-to-face to digital means “is a huge challenge to PDEA and other law enforcement agencies.” “We all know that drug syndicates would always do anything to succeed in their illegal drug activities and under the new normal,” she said.  Ferolino said even before the pandemic, arrests had been made already of drug traders “who facilitated drug transactions through online platforms or e-commerce platforms.” The PDEA, she said, had conducted buy-bust operations that led to the arrests. The suspects posted drug paraphernalia on an e-commerce platform, which prompted the PDEA to conduct buy-bust missions, she said. She added that the PDEA had conducted three such missions.  Ferolino said online shopping platform Lazada had also turned over to them 3.6 kilos of marijuana. “They also use TNVS to transport their illegal drug activities. We have arrested two drug personalities who use a transport service to deliver their packages,” she said. Rep. Wes Gatchalian (Valenzuela City), chair of the House committee on trade and industry, said online platforms should “exercise due diligence with regards to its merchants.” These online traders, he said, should “not pass off the responsibility to law enforcement agencies to run after people who are behind these online illegal activities.” Gatchalian said the PDEA confiscated last Sept. 18 these illegal items from online platforms—P12,000 in marijuana, 12 ecstasy tablets worth P40,000, a capsule of “Fly High” party drug worth P2,500 and 11 bottles of liquid ecstasy worth P426,000. Citing information from arrested suspects obtained by the PDEA, Gatchalian said some drug paraphernalia, like water pipes and glass tooters, had been brought from the country’s two leading online shopping sites.  He said the PDEA had already requested the administrators of these shopping sites to take down all listings of drug paraphernalia. At the hearing, Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said the department had received a total of 14,869 complaints involving online transactions from Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2020. Castelo said this was way higher than the 2,457 complaints that the DTI received in 2019. The official said the complaints were related to violations of the Price Act, like overpricing, profiteering, or lack of price tag. “Many people are being defrauded by false and deceiving advertisements, poor product quality and unconscionable sales acts and practices,” said Gatchalian in reaction to the DTI data. “What is surprising is that a majority of these complaints came out of sales facilitated through these major platforms,” Gatchalian said. He said, “this is happening precisely because there are currently no regulations that will compel these platforms to ensure the safety of our consumers.” “Right now, many platforms are self-regulating, but the problem is that when these self-regulations fail, the consumers have nowhere to turn to,” he said. “Many are oftentimes left hanging, or are put through such a long process that many of them just choose to abandon their claims,” he added. The lawmaker renewed his call for the immediate passage of his House Bill No. 6122, which seeks to regulate the internet economy. Under the bill, the platforms will be held liable for vendors’ wrongdoing on their platforms if no measure had been taken to prevent the sale of illegal products. The measure has been approved by the House panel and is set to be passed on second reading."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/79686/online-firm-said-to-lay-off-filipino-employees","title":"Online firm said to lay off Filipino employees","date":"01:56 AM September 01, 2012","snippet":"Online retailer Lazada.com.ph has cut a significant part of its workforce less than six months after it started operations.","body":"Online retailer Lazada.com.ph has cut a significant part of its workforce less than six months after it started operations. A source familiar with the matter said that 60 workers were given notices on Friday that their employment with the company would end in two weeks.  The source did not specify the reasons for the termination. Employees affected were in various management and rank-and-file positions.  Another source who refused to be identified said affected workers would be given a month’s salary as separation pay. Lazada, which was described by Singaporean start-up industry publication SGentrepreurs.com as a “clone” of United States-based Amazon.com, was launched in Southeast Asia last March.  Lazada, owned by German incubator firm Rocket Internet GmbH, had as much as 260 employees when it started out earlier this year. But reports say layoffs at Lazada and its local sister firms have been going on for months. Rocket Internet also has Lazada websites in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Its sister firm Zalora, which sells clothes online, has operations in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. A Lazada spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the news when contacted by the Inquirer for comment. Rocket Internet has been criticized in the past as a company that makes money setting up clones of online businesses that have succeeded in other countries. The company has also received flak for its aggressive hire-and-fire practices."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1403613/fda-monitoring-illegal-sale-of-covid-19-test-kits","title":"FDA monitoring illegal sale of Covid-19 test kits","date":"05:40 AM March 06, 2021","snippet":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now engaged in “exhaustive monitoring” of online selling platforms to track the illegal sale of FDA-certified Covid-19 test kits.","body":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now engaged in “exhaustive monitoring” of online selling platforms to track the illegal sale of FDA-certified Covid-19 test kits. In an advisory issued on March 4, the regulatory body said: “The FDA strongly reminds all concerned stakeholders and the general public that online selling of all types of FDA-certified Covid-19 test kits (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR, antibody, antigen-based) is strictly prohibited.”  It reminded the public that these Covid-19 test kits with FDA special certification “are strictly for medical professional use and not intended for personal use.” FDA Director General Eric Domingo ordered regional field offices and regulatory enforcement units to “conduct exhaustive monitoring” of Lazada and Shopee to determine if Covid-19 test kits were being peddled on these online selling platforms.  The FDA also said it would “implement immediate regulatory and enforcement actions as warranted” against violators of Republic Act No. 9711, or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009. Since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the government has gone after the illegal sale of Covid-19 test kits, which are supposed to be administered by a medical professional in screening for the new coronavirus.  In May 2020, the National Bureau of Investigation arrested a former actress and her mother for the illegal sale of Covid-19 rapid test kits worth P78,000.The FDA has, however, issued as of February special certifications for a total of 380 Covid-19 test kits that are allowed for commercial use but under the supervision of a medical professional.

While many of us can only dream of changing the world, Inanc Balci is already doing it. At 26, he co-founded South East Asia’s online retail tiger Lazada and now, at age 28, he sits as the Chief Executive Officer for Lazada Philippines.  On being a young CEO Balci, a Turkish raised in London, attended Purdue University in the US with a double-degree in Industrial Engineering and Economics.  He then worked on mergers and acquisitions for an investment bank in London. While working for the investment bank, Balci saw the eminent potential in e-commerce which led him to join Rocket Internet and eventually co-found Lazada in Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, Balci heads a pool of more than 300 employees, all of which he works very closely with. With an unabashed outlook, agile wit, and a laser-sharp eye for details, Balci perfectly fits the bill to lead a rapidly-growing online company.  Online shopping in PH In a country where shopping malls are practically part of the fabric of the society, online shopping is something quite a number of Filipinos are unaccustomed to—there comes the perennial trust issue on using credit cards, the surprise surcharges, and unfortunately, the products not arriving at all. The malls in the Philippines, on the other hand, have creatively articulated themselves to be not just shopping destinations but also as a means of recreation (i.e. be it the cinemas, the gaming zones, the restaurants, or as simple as the airconditioning they offer as a break from the raging tropical weather outdoors)—all of these were the issues that Balci had to dispel— and dispel he and his co-founders did. Lazada has made shopping quick, effortless, and risk-free in South East Asia and in the Philippines—the same principle that Balci is harping on to the Filipinos. First, Lazada accommodates all those shoppers without credit cards via its cash-on-delivery payment mode. This is essential given that not everyone has a credit card or is keen on sharing their credit card details to someone—or anyone for that matter. This makes online shopping risk-free for everyone. Being an archipelago of 7,100 islands, accessibility is always an issue—a significant portion of consumers doesn’t have time or access to visit the malls but with a minimum of P1,000 purchase, Lazada offers free nationwide delivery, to customers anywhere in the Philippines, just log-in, shop, and the products will be delivered at the customer’s doorstep. Lastly, Lazada offers the flexibility of having the customers return the products within 30 days for free— provided that the products are in mint condition. In a span of two years of being in the Philippines, Balci has steered Lazada to further heights and now with more than 40,000 SKUs, reaching 90 percent of the online population of the Philippines, and ranking as the 4th top Facebook brand in the country with a direct audience close to two million. What the dot-com bubble holds for Lazada is still yet to be revealed, but one thing is for certain, Inanc Balci, the 28 year-old co-founder and CEO, is definitely changing the way Filipinos buy.

Joey Salceda as a “curse on our country” as he opposed the latter’s proposal to tax digital services. Salceda, who also chairs the House ways and means committee, earlier filed a measure pushing for the taxation of digital services offered by Netflix, Spotify, and Lazada, among others, which he said would yield an estimated P29.1 billion annually in incremental revenues.  Salceda said the new tax measures may be referred to as “Netflix tax” for video and music streaming sites, “Facebook ads tax” for digital advertisements, and “Lazada tax” for online marketplaces. “(N)ow we’re gonna done that for taxes? Why not tax oxygen. My friend Joey Salceda, whom I so admired, has become a curse on our country,” Locsin, a former congressman, said on Twitter.   The foreign affairs chief proposed taxing digital services used by business processing outsourcing (BPO) companies or by Philippine gaming offshore operators (POGOs). “(Inter-Agency Task Force), local governments, here’s a great suggestion; nothing stupid like taxing the internet. Why not just POGOs and BPO use of it?” Locsin said in a separate tweet.  “Stick to the money makers that can’t pass their added costs to the public. Money should stay in the pockets of those who earn it honestly. Tax digital services to BPOs and POGOs, tax a lot. Or maybe they are already taxed but DOF doesn’t know it,” he added.  “KILL BILL…” Locsin said in another tweet, alluding to the measure filed by Salceda.  Salceda said his proposal does not impose “new taxes” but would just ensure that digital companies “pay their fair share.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Assuming you’re a company that sets up in the Philippines, and you do video-streaming or music-streaming services, you will definitely pay taxes. But companies like Netflix and Spofify don’t. That’s obviously not fair,” the lawmaker said in an earlier statement. “Simply put, these are not new taxes. These are tax administration measures that we hope will capture the value more fairly, para pantay naman sa lahat ng negosyo sa Pilipinas.

Officials from both the public and private sectors agree on this and are urging entrepreneurs to try their luck in e-commerce. Joey Concepcion, presidential adviser on entrepreneurship, said that going digital is the way to go for the Philippines, which is lagging behind its Southeast Asian neighbors. “Many of the people here will find it difficult to enter shopping centers. But they’re on Facebook. Platforms like Lazada and Shopee also teach you how to market your product. They help you to promote,” he said in an interview during the Mentor Me on Wheels Caravan at SM City Cebu last Monday. Concepcion, who is also the founder of Go Negosyo, added that with digitalization becoming more mainstream, access to both market and money will become easier. The more the Philippines grows into the digital market, he said the more the economy will become open. The presence of e-commerce platforms should also be welcomed by smaller businesses as they will not have to spend more renting physical spaces and hiring employees. “But there are challenges. They (small entrepreneurs) have to understand how to use smartphones,” he said. While most people are adept at using smartphones for social media, Concepcion said the level of aptitude towards digitalization for micro and small businesses is still low. Several MSMEs trooped to the Activity Center of SM City Cebu last Monday to take advantage of the Mentor Me on Wheels caravan. Around 30 mentors, who are successful businessmen themselves, were available for quick one-on-one consultations where they can ask for advice and questions about how they run their businesses. But while advice from mentors are welcome, Concepcion said business owners themselves should continue to learn, study, and look at their business models to improve. “Everybody in this place has a reason to succeed. But in the end, you have to want it more than the others. And that is the way to success,” he added. Meanwhile, e-commerce platform Lazada is also encouraging MSMEs to try uploading their products on their website and mobile app. Carlos Barrera, chief operating officer of Lazada Philippines, said they do not charge business owners or ask for commission when they upload their products on the site. “We charge nothing. And you dont have to set up a big business. You can just upload a few products and try out. I assure you, just with a few pictures, you can start to see that customers are buying from you; without having to pay rent or hire employees,” he said. In order to attract customers, Barrera advised that business owners should make sure they upload good quality photos as e-commerce is “very visual.” For the Philippines, going digital is also imperative as it is already “unstoppable” and happening in other countries, he added. According to Barrera, e-commerce only comprises 2 percent of the entire market in the Philippines. In other countries, he said the market share of e-commerce is up to 20 percent. Even if the Philippines is still starting out in the e-commerce industry, Barrera said they see it becoming much bigger in the coming years. “We don’t want to get commission (from sellers) because we believe a lot in the market. Philippines has so much potential and there’s a lot of small entrepreneurs. Our objective is to grow with them,” he said."}]}
