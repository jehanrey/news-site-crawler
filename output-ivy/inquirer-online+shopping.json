And if you think back, you may realize that you have been leaving the supermarket with a bigger haul and adding to your online cart more often than you used to. These are just some of the changes in consumption behavior and preferences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which still has the country firmly in its grip more than seven months since quarantine controls were imposed.  Marketing research firm Nielsen, in a webinar hosted by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, noted that the contagion had influenced changes in Filipinos’ consumption patterns—not only of what they buy but also where they buy. Nielsen identified six threshold levels, which offered early signals of spending patterns—proactive health-minded buying, reactive health management, pantry preparation, quarantined living preparation, restricted living and living a new normal.  Nielsen reported that during the height of the pandemic in the second quarter—when the government started imposing stricter quarantines and local lockdowns—about 67 percent of Filipinos cut down on their visits to malls while 17 percent increased their online shopping activities. There was also a spike in the purchase of alcohol (96 percent), disinfectant air freshener (97 percent) and liquid hand wash (76 percent). Eventually, the same pattern was observed in food items such as canned tuna, corned meat and instant noodles. While Filipinos’ preference for “survival items” may be slowly easing, Nielsen associate director John Yamsuan said there was one thing that may stick even after this pandemic or during the final threshold level wherein we enter the new normal—our use of e-commerce. “We saw this transition from bricks to clicks, or Filipinos being more open to e-commerce,” he said. “It will definitely go forward and not just during the pandemic. We know from data that this is going to be part of the consumers moving on to the new normal.” According to Yamsuan, one of the factors for this may be the Philippines’ imposition of one of the longest quarantine periods, which forced a lot of Filipinos to stay home.  “If the source of the change is deep-seated in a consumer or individual, it definitely will be carried forward as we move on to the future. This is something that we can expect, to some extent even in businesses,” he said.  Beginning March this year, Nielsen saw about 1.5 million new online shoppers in the Philippines, most of whom belonged to the working class and are males. Compared to last year, however, there were also more first-time online buyers from the nonworking segment. “There is a shift in purchase channels,” Yamsuan said. “The Philippines has been registering a steady growth in e-commerce year-on-year. Digitalization is going to be part of the new normal.” Nielsen said online shopping also became an instrument for a lot of Filipinos to cope with the anxiety brought about by the pandemic. For a lot of consumers, it provided “a sense of security,” “a means to relax and distract oneself,” and still have the feeling “of being in control.” More than the emotional and mental benefits, the research firm stressed the convenience it brought to a lot of people. Aside from avoiding the nuisance of traffic, finding a parking space, and the long queues at the cashier, online shopping offers various payment options, cheaper and hard-to-find items, and an emerging number of legitimate sellers. But this doesn’t mean that we’ll see the exodus of brick-and-mortar stores. “From our studies, we see physical stores slowly recovering, coming out from the more lenient quarantine degrees that the government is imposing, but we’ve seen that even with their recovery, e-commerce is still growing. It tells us that consumers are still going back to physical stores. It’s not a case of one replacing another,” he said. “It’s not going to happen, at least not in the very near future. The demand for physical stores may slow down because of the current protocols but we don’t think physical channels will be replaced by e-commerce,” he added.

Ultimately, the executive has one piece of advice for industry players. “Invest in innovation and technology. But these two should be anchored to something, and that’s consumers. If we are able to anchor the needs and wants of consumers, our initiatives for digitalization will definitely be guided,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392778/fire-guts-las-pinas-warehouse-storing-packages-from-online-shopping","title":"Fire guts Las Piñas warehouse storing packages from online shopping","date":"01:12 PM February 06, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — A fire gutted a warehouse in Barangay Talon Singko, Las Piñas City on Saturday, according to the Las Piñas-Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).","body":"MANILA, Philippines — A fire gutted a warehouse in Barangay Talon Singko, Las Piñas City on Saturday, according to the Las Piñas-Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).

Online shopping has become popular due to its convenience, accessibility and speed. With the continued success of e-commerce, many now question the existence of traditional stores. Does online selling signify the death of actual shopping? Options in selling  Clothes, appliances, gadgets—these are only some of the items that sell well online. Can you imagine, however, buying a car completely online? Or purchasing an expensive piece of jewelry without seeing it first? According to the consumer psychologist Phillip Graves, people tend to feel safer buying products that are predictable and familiar online (Braff, 2014). When customers first try out a brand, many opt to visit retail stores. Shop employees help a lot in explaining items to them. This provides the assurance most people need before purchasing.   Luxury products also undergo deep scrutiny. The value of such items depends on their effects on the senses. In cases like these, buyers usually prefer experiencing the item first before confirming to buy.  In addition, older people are known to stick with the traditional mode of shopping. This is also the case when buyers are not comfortable with gadgets or prefer human interaction. Shopping, after all, is a social activity for many people. Considering these ideas, one can see that online and traditional shopping actually go hand-in-hand. The two are mere channels through which retailers communicate with people. Markets, products and situations determine which method suits a business best. Introducing the omnichannel So which platform should your business adopt? Should you base your choice on market analysis or budget limits? To save you the decision, why don’t you let clients choose? Marketing analysts now promote the idea of “omnichannel.” It is, simply put, a method of offering multiple buying options (Newman, 2014). By giving clients different ways of shopping—through the internet, in-store or even by phone—a company can offer a personalized experience.  A business with an omni-channel works like this: buyers can choose which media they wish to learn about a company’s products. They can also switch from one channel to another any time they wish. For example, someone buying shoes might visit a website first to choose his or her desired style. The buyer then might want to visit a retail outlet to try out the product. Finally, he or she considers the promos available online or in-store to determine where to make the purchase. It might seem complicated, but buyers always appreciate being informed. Offering multiple ways of getting the product means more support in establishing a brand. Designing a brand experience So considering both online and traditional selling, what makes a brand stick with users? Do beautiful shop interiors or eye-catching websites guarantee the success of the business? Reality tells us no. There have been many businesses that went bust despite heavy investments in shop and website design. The truth of the matter is that a business has to consider client experience before, during and after shopping. Whether using mobile apps, websites, retail outlets or a combination of these to sell, the business must be consistent. As the goal is to attract customers and keep them coming, the brand must be developed enough to tell a story. Using any platform, a business should clearly show its core values and unique features. People should be able to easily understand what the brand is about, what it upholds, and what it promises to deliver. This will then become their basis in trying out a brand and sticking with it. Thus, the success of attracting customers doesn’t really rely on which platform is used to sell. More often than not, it depends on the experience being offered by the brand. (Sources: Braff, D.

Asked at “Ask a Friend, Ask Efren” free service at www.personalfinance.ph, SMS, Viber, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook","body":"Question: In this age of online shopping, do I really get a better deal by browsing the Internet rather than just physically visiting stores? Asked at “Ask a Friend, Ask Efren” free service at www.personalfinance.ph, SMS, Viber, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Answer: One of the main benefits of online shopping is supposedly the lower prices brought on by transparent pricing among competitors and in depth product/service disclosures.  Sidebar, the Consumer Act of the Philippines has a provision that requires the display of only one tag price, the all-important suggested retail price or SRP. But where bidding is legally allowed, something akin to price discovery is present. According to Investopedia, “Price discovery is the overall process, whether explicit or inferred, of setting the spot price or the proper price of an asset, security, commodity, or currency … Simply put, it is where a buyer and a seller agree on a price and a transaction occurs.” There are also the buyers’ comments that can attest to the appropriateness of pricing and quality of the product or service. It pays to look at these comments to get a better handle on what you are pining for. But do not just be on the receiving end. Make your own comments to help future buyers. Some Apps even remind buyers to make such comments.  On a lighter note, I have discovered that online shopping is a great replacement for a broken doorbell. Whereas there was no enthusiasm before with seeing who was at the gate, now delivery services heralding the arrival of packages send people in our household rushing to the gate to see whose package arrived. But you need to be careful because online sellers track your browsing behavior and will send ads your way where­ver page you are on the internet. Subliminal advertising is not as sublime as it used to be.  Online sellers have also mastered the art of holiday spending creation. For one, sellers take advantage of the nth day of the same numbered month to launch sales discount promotions. As an occasional online shopper (i.e. shopping whenever there are occasions), I have noticed that some of the items I am following steadily go up in price over days and months and then drop to their original level during the said sales discount promotions. In behavioral economics, too many choices lead to analy­sis paralysis. But online sellers have a solution for that too and it is called “Add to cart” or ATC. It makes perfect sense for you to first park in your cart the choices you have narrowed down for further weeding out later on. However, the ATC also brings you one step closer to the checkout page. And when you are aimlessly browsing online selling platforms, you will soon find yourself suffering from the ATC disorder, of having too long a list of items in your shopping cart. More importantly, please note that prices online are at SRP. Particularly for home appliances, you can get the real lower price if you were to just haul yourself to the physical store, with consideration given to health safety protocols, and pay for the item in cash, in person. There may be delivery charges, which are sometimes waived with online shopping. Still, such charges will not offset the savings you will get from paying the cash price. After all, SRP is just what it is, only a suggestion. So, while online shopping does bring some benefits, keep your eyes wide open as you may just end up being an online shopping junkie.

It was a hard lesson learned here by a mother whose savings of P90,000 got whittled down to only P4,000—after her twin daughters went on a 10-day online shopping spree.  “I’ll just consider myself ‘robbed’ and will receive all those [items they] ordered upon arrival,’’ said Maricel Colonia, a local radio broadcaster, who agreed to recount the shock of her life to the Inquirer on Friday. Without her knowledge, Colonia said, her 10-year-old daughters started purchasing items online on March 29 and had logged a total of 30 transactions by April 7.  The charges on Colonia’s debit card were mostly for kiddie products priced in Philippine pesos, US dollars and British pounds. Colonia said she had no inkling about the girls’ online shopping activities until she received an email from PayPal, the US-based online payment system, informing her about several dollar transactions.  “I double-checked since I thought my account may have been hacked,” she said. Upon arriving home on Thursday, she said, she felt an urge to check on her daughters’ tablet, which they earlier got as a gift from an aunt. There she saw the series of transactions the girls had made on Amazon and eBay—for toys and dolls, including merchandise of the animated cartoon series “Miraculous Ladybug.” Among the costliest items they bought were a Japanese costume for P7,500 and a doll for $147.90. Colonia said the twins were able to set up another PayPal account, using her email address. They apparently got her debit card details when they got their hands on her wallet and were able to set themselves up for a buying spree without the help of any other grownup.  All the orders they made were addressed to the office of the Baganian Broadcasting Corp. in Pagadian City, where Colonia works. “It is very likely [that they did it] on their own, exploring the technology available at their fingertips,” the mother said. Colonia said she had since uninstalled the shopping apps on the twin girls’ tablet, but the orders could no longer be canceled."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316821/digital-payments-for-online-shopping-overtake-cash","title":"Digital payments for online shopping overtake cash","date":"04:00 AM February 01, 2021","snippet":"One of the country’s leading financial technology companies said noncash and digital transactions were the preferred means of payment for online shopping amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"One of the country’s leading financial technology companies said noncash and digital transactions were the preferred means of payment for online shopping amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

He was citing data from internal and external sources such as a report from Google, Temasek, Bain & Co. and Euromonitor.  “In 2020 alone, we processed over P95 billion worth of online shopping transactions across all of our platforms, which only shows that consumer preference for cashless payments and online shopping is overwhelmingly present,” Vea said in a statement. Speaking during the launch of the updated Department of Trade and Industry e-commerce roadmap for 2022, Vea said fintech players were poised to play an even bigger role as more business activity pivots online.  Vea acknowledged the global health crisis played a role in accelerating the push for e-commerce. “Consumers are now used to ordering online or via their phones and paying via cashless, and many businesses have accelerated their migration to digital, so there’s no turning back now when it comes to digital payments and e-commerce in the Philippines,” he said.

The online platform would cater to the country’s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that use the internet to sell their products amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  “I challenge the DTI to come up, in house, with an online shopping platform. The idea is that the seller must be an MSME and the product being sold must be made or grown in the Philippines. A transactional shopping platform and not a mere ‘portal’ listing MSMEs and their products,” said Pimentel in a statement. Pimentel, who chairs the Senate Committee on Trade, said that the new online platform will be an alternative to Lazada or Shopee as this will also help the MSMEs recover from the economic effects of the pandemic.  He added that the DTI should also utilize Filipino talent in creating and programming the online shopping app specifically designed for MSMEs. “Ilabas ang galing ng Pilipino hindi lang sa negosyo. Ilabas na rin ang galing ng Pilipino sa computer programming. (Let us unleash the Filipino talent not only on business but also in computer programming.),” said Pimentel. “  There’s no other way but to go digital. We should turn these COVID-19 adversities into opportunities for our fellowmen and small businesses to restart, recover, and grow. If we help them now, we are also helping the Philippine economy,” Pimentel raised the proposal in DTI’s budget hearing after Secretary Ramon Lopez said that some 90,000 MSMEs remain closed after Luzon was placed under strict lockdown in March."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/195931/more-filipinos-choosing-to-shop-online-study-says","title":"More Filipinos choosing to shop online, study says","date":"10:51 PM July 26, 2015","snippet":"For 19-YEAR-OLD student Kyla, shopping online lets her shop even when she is too busy to go to an actual mall.

For a gamer like Raffy, 20, shopping online for games is one way to relieve stress from school work. Like Kyla and Raffy, more Filipinos are turning to the Internet for shopping, according to a recent study released by MasterCard.  Airline tickets The 2014 study, which covered the Philippines and 13 other Asia Pacific countries, showed that about three in every five (59 percent) of the online population in the Philippines access the Internet to shop, up from 40 percent in 2013.  “The study points to the importance of online shopping to the Philippine market,” MasterCard said in a statement. MasterCard’s study found that Filipinos turn to the Internet to purchase the following: Airline tickets (38.4 percent), home appliances and electronic products (35.1 percent), clothing and accessories (31 percent), hotels (29.9 percent) and computer software (29.4 percent).  Meanwhile, sites of apps stores (50.1 percent), music downloads (42.6 percent) and home appliances/electronic products (38.2 percent) draw the most web traffic, the study also showed. Why do Filipinos go online to shop? Ease and convenience are the most cited reasons. “Most of the Filipino respondents are satisfied with online shopping, describing it as easy (73.3 percent), convenient (71.9 percent), or fun (64.4 percent), and expressing greater likelihood to purchase in the next six months (79.2 percent). All these figures are improvements from the results of the 2013 study (61.4 percent, 63 percent, 58.2 percent, and 68.2 percent), respectively,” the statement said. Mobile phones  The study also found more Filipinos using their mobile phones to purchase items— from 21.4 percent in 2012 to 34 percent in 2014, with 94.2 percent of participants able to access the Internet via smart phones, MasterCard noted, adding that those who purchased via mobile phones did so because they were able to do it “on the go.” Availability of apps that facilitate mobile shopping has also made it more convenient. “Among mobile shoppers, the top categories for purchases are phone apps (24.7 percent), music downloads (22.7 percent) and clothing and accessories (20.7 percent),” the study said. Security However, online shoppers have a number of considerations before going ahead and making an online purchase, among them the security of the payment facility (89.7 percent) and the speed of transactions (88.5 percent). “Before making a purchase, four-fifths consider online reviews,” MasterCard said. Ethical considerations also come into play, with more than seven in 10 purchasing products “for ethical reasons.” “Adherence to fair trade principles (77.4 percent), environment-friendliness (76.4 percent), and whether part of the proceeds will go to a good cause (60.8 percent) are the top three ethical considerations in making a purchase,” the study noted. The 2014 study is part of the Online Shopping Survey that MasterCard commissions annually. The survey was conducted in 14 Asia Pacific countries with a minimum of 500 respondents per country.

Even if the government fully relaxes the lockdown imposed throughout Metro Manila, subsequent personal distancing protocols likely to be implemented will reduce consumer traffic. This, in turn, is likely to result in a slower absorption of retail space all over Metro Manila.  Colliers projects vacancy rising to 12 percent in 2020 from 9.8 percent in 2019. In our opinion, the reduced mobility, observance of physical distancing and aversion towards the use of physical currency present opportunities for mall operators and retailers as these are likely to form part of the new normal in Philippine retail. For a consumption-driven economy like the Philippines, we are optimistic that mall operators and retailers may still tap pent-up demand. Stakeholders in the retail sector should be proactive especially with the projected rebound in economic output, recovery in overseas Filipino workers’ (OFW) remittances, and the potential impact of social amelioration programs on consumer demand.  By expanding online strategies and partnering with apps to facilitate seamless delivery, retailers should be able to offset any softer retail demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of a Colliers Philippines survey, women have a higher daily internet usage than men. Close to 60 percent of the female respondents spend seven hours or more online while only 45 percent of males allot the same amount of time. Respondents of the survey would usually allot around 3 to 3.5 hours daily on online shopping.  The survey also showed that the daily internet usage and time spent on online shopping increases with age. Those 51 years old and older spent more than 10 hours a day online, with online shopping reaching as much as half that. Younger respondents (21 to 30 years old) spent on average three to six hours a day online with two hours of that on online shopping alone. This supports one of our recommendations that retailers should increasingly target older shoppers and senior citizens. There should be a seamless online shopping experience, from adding items to cart to checking out using credit cards. Close to 80 percent of respondents encountered advertisements for products and goods online via social media. Retailers could take advantage of this by further strengthening their social media presence to expand the reach of their products. Based on the results of our survey, among the most popular e-commerce platforms include Lazada, Shopee, Instagram, retailers’ online stores, Zalora, Facebook Marketplace, and Amazon. Colliers believes that mall operators and retailers should strengthen their online presence by either utilizing existing e-commerce websites of their mall operators or setting up their own platforms to market their products.  But while we see opportunities amid the uncertainties, the central bank-forecasted drop in economic output in 2020 is likely to drag down consumer confidence which may impact retail space absorption in Metro Manila. This is likely to be compounded by the $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion (P153 billion to P306 billion) drop in OFW remittances and rise in unemployment projected by various government agencies and officials. Remittances, for instance, fuel private consumption, which cover about 10 percent of the country’s economy. There are several economic indicators that already point to some recovery. OFW remittances rose in June 2020, a reversal from three straight months of decline. Meanwhile, unemployment rate is starting to ease from a record-high 17.7 percent in April. These factors should help restore Filipino consumers’ purchasing power and benefit retailers and mall operators. The social distancing measures have been compelling consumers to rely heavily on deliveries. Mall operators and retailers should consider firming up partnerships with delivery companies that have modern warehouses and efficient logistics systems to maximize their shift from brick-and-mortar to online selling. The Colliers survey noted that more than half of the respondents that chose online shopping preferred e-commerce due to convenience. The survey conducted by Colliers Philippines shows tremendous opportunities for retailers that are agile enough to pivot to the “new normal” in Metro Manila retail. The lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 has forced malls to close, with only the stores supplying essential items such as groceries, medicines, and food for delivery open during stricter lockdowns. Colliers believes that social distancing is likely be part of the new normal even if the lockdown is further eased. Hence, a significant number of physical retail shops are likely to remain closed for additional time. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, brick-and-mortar retailers are trying to tap the demand by expanding their online presence. We recommend that retailers, especially higher-end brands, be more innovative to stay at the top of consumers’ minds. This may be in the form of home deliveries or personal shoppers. Selected retailers and operators have started tapping alternative platforms to reach out to customers during the quarantine period. Several mall operators have launched their respective Viber communities. Ayala and SM have also launched their personal shopping services. Mall operators should continue highlighting sanitation and property management procedures within their establishments. Developers should also line up marketing efforts to recapture pent up demand once the pandemic wanes and consumer confidence recovers. At Colliers, we always recommend that developers highlight projects that are within integrated communities. In our opinion, the pandemic has further emphasized the need to be in an integrated community where unit owners can easily access essential goods and services. Developers have been responding to this need by highlighting the presence of groceries and supermarkets that offer a wide array of merchandise, from F&B to basic house supplies to medicines. We already see this in the market, with brands such as MerryMart offering an expansive line of merchandise. We encourage developers and retailers to continue highlighting the integrated features of their residential projects, including the presence of groceries and hypermarkets within the community, as this is likely to be among the major considerations of unit owners post-lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/311588/shopping-will-never-be-the-same-again","title":"Shopping will never be the same again","date":"05:02 AM November 13, 2020","snippet":"","body":" Take a quick look at your kitchen cabinets and pantries and you will likely see increased space devoted to disinfectants, health-based products and food items with a longer shelf life.

Compared to last year, however, there were also more first-time online buyers from the nonworking segment. “There is a shift in purchase channels,” Yamsuan said. “The Philippines has been registering a steady growth in e-commerce year-on-year. Digitalization is going to be part of the new normal.” Nielsen said online shopping also became an instrument for a lot of Filipinos to cope with the anxiety brought about by the pandemic. For a lot of consumers, it provided “a sense of security,” “a means to relax and distract oneself,” and still have the feeling “of being in control.” More than the emotional and mental benefits, the research firm stressed the convenience it brought to a lot of people. Aside from avoiding the nuisance of traffic, finding a parking space, and the long queues at the cashier, online shopping offers various payment options, cheaper and hard-to-find items, and an emerging number of legitimate sellers. But this doesn’t mean that we’ll see the exodus of brick-and-mortar stores. “From our studies, we see physical stores slowly recovering, coming out from the more lenient quarantine degrees that the government is imposing, but we’ve seen that even with their recovery, e-commerce is still growing. It tells us that consumers are still going back to physical stores. It’s not a case of one replacing another,” he said. “It’s not going to happen, at least not in the very near future. The demand for physical stores may slow down because of the current protocols but we don’t think physical channels will be replaced by e-commerce,” he added.

Online shopping has become popular due to its convenience, accessibility and speed. With the continued success of e-commerce, many now question the existence of traditional stores. Does online selling signify the death of actual shopping? Options in selling  Clothes, appliances, gadgets—these are only some of the items that sell well online. Can you imagine, however, buying a car completely online? Or purchasing an expensive piece of jewelry without seeing it first? According to the consumer psychologist Phillip Graves, people tend to feel safer buying products that are predictable and familiar online (Braff, 2014). When customers first try out a brand, many opt to visit retail stores. Shop employees help a lot in explaining items to them. This provides the assurance most people need before purchasing.   Luxury products also undergo deep scrutiny. The value of such items depends on their effects on the senses. In cases like these, buyers usually prefer experiencing the item first before confirming to buy.  In addition, older people are known to stick with the traditional mode of shopping. This is also the case when buyers are not comfortable with gadgets or prefer human interaction. Shopping, after all, is a social activity for many people. Considering these ideas, one can see that online and traditional shopping actually go hand-in-hand. The two are mere channels through which retailers communicate with people. Markets, products and situations determine which method suits a business best. Introducing the omnichannel So which platform should your business adopt? Should you base your choice on market analysis or budget limits? To save you the decision, why don’t you let clients choose? Marketing analysts now promote the idea of “omnichannel.” It is, simply put, a method of offering multiple buying options (Newman, 2014). By giving clients different ways of shopping—through the internet, in-store or even by phone—a company can offer a personalized experience.  A business with an omni-channel works like this: buyers can choose which media they wish to learn about a company’s products. They can also switch from one channel to another any time they wish. For example, someone buying shoes might visit a website first to choose his or her desired style. The buyer then might want to visit a retail outlet to try out the product. Finally, he or she considers the promos available online or in-store to determine where to make the purchase. It might seem complicated, but buyers always appreciate being informed. Offering multiple ways of getting the product means more support in establishing a brand. Designing a brand experience So considering both online and traditional selling, what makes a brand stick with users? Do beautiful shop interiors or eye-catching websites guarantee the success of the business? Reality tells us no. There have been many businesses that went bust despite heavy investments in shop and website design. The truth of the matter is that a business has to consider client experience before, during and after shopping. Whether using mobile apps, websites, retail outlets or a combination of these to sell, the business must be consistent. As the goal is to attract customers and keep them coming, the brand must be developed enough to tell a story. Using any platform, a business should clearly show its core values and unique features. People should be able to easily understand what the brand is about, what it upholds, and what it promises to deliver. This will then become their basis in trying out a brand and sticking with it. Thus, the success of attracting customers doesn’t really rely on which platform is used to sell. More often than not, it depends on the experience being offered by the brand. (Sources: Braff, D.

Asked at “Ask a Friend, Ask Efren” free service at www.personalfinance.ph, SMS, Viber, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook","body":"Question: In this age of online shopping, do I really get a better deal by browsing the Internet rather than just physically visiting stores? Asked at “Ask a Friend, Ask Efren” free service at www.personalfinance.ph, SMS, Viber, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Answer: One of the main benefits of online shopping is supposedly the lower prices brought on by transparent pricing among competitors and in depth product/service disclosures.  Sidebar, the Consumer Act of the Philippines has a provision that requires the display of only one tag price, the all-important suggested retail price or SRP. But where bidding is legally allowed, something akin to price discovery is present. According to Investopedia, “Price discovery is the overall process, whether explicit or inferred, of setting the spot price or the proper price of an asset, security, commodity, or currency … Simply put, it is where a buyer and a seller agree on a price and a transaction occurs.” There are also the buyers’ comments that can attest to the appropriateness of pricing and quality of the product or service. It pays to look at these comments to get a better handle on what you are pining for. But do not just be on the receiving end. Make your own comments to help future buyers. Some Apps even remind buyers to make such comments.  On a lighter note, I have discovered that online shopping is a great replacement for a broken doorbell. Whereas there was no enthusiasm before with seeing who was at the gate, now delivery services heralding the arrival of packages send people in our household rushing to the gate to see whose package arrived. But you need to be careful because online sellers track your browsing behavior and will send ads your way where­ver page you are on the internet. Subliminal advertising is not as sublime as it used to be.  Online sellers have also mastered the art of holiday spending creation. For one, sellers take advantage of the nth day of the same numbered month to launch sales discount promotions. As an occasional online shopper (i.e. shopping whenever there are occasions), I have noticed that some of the items I am following steadily go up in price over days and months and then drop to their original level during the said sales discount promotions. In behavioral economics, too many choices lead to analy­sis paralysis. But online sellers have a solution for that too and it is called “Add to cart” or ATC. It makes perfect sense for you to first park in your cart the choices you have narrowed down for further weeding out later on. However, the ATC also brings you one step closer to the checkout page. And when you are aimlessly browsing online selling platforms, you will soon find yourself suffering from the ATC disorder, of having too long a list of items in your shopping cart. More importantly, please note that prices online are at SRP. Particularly for home appliances, you can get the real lower price if you were to just haul yourself to the physical store, with consideration given to health safety protocols, and pay for the item in cash, in person. There may be delivery charges, which are sometimes waived with online shopping. Still, such charges will not offset the savings you will get from paying the cash price. After all, SRP is just what it is, only a suggestion. So, while online shopping does bring some benefits, keep your eyes wide open as you may just end up being an online shopping junkie.

It was a hard lesson learned here by a mother whose savings of P90,000 got whittled down to only P4,000—after her twin daughters went on a 10-day online shopping spree.  “I’ll just consider myself ‘robbed’ and will receive all those [items they] ordered upon arrival,’’ said Maricel Colonia, a local radio broadcaster, who agreed to recount the shock of her life to the Inquirer on Friday. Without her knowledge, Colonia said, her 10-year-old daughters started purchasing items online on March 29 and had logged a total of 30 transactions by April 7.  The charges on Colonia’s debit card were mostly for kiddie products priced in Philippine pesos, US dollars and British pounds. Colonia said she had no inkling about the girls’ online shopping activities until she received an email from PayPal, the US-based online payment system, informing her about several dollar transactions.  “I double-checked since I thought my account may have been hacked,” she said. Upon arriving home on Thursday, she said, she felt an urge to check on her daughters’ tablet, which they earlier got as a gift from an aunt. There she saw the series of transactions the girls had made on Amazon and eBay—for toys and dolls, including merchandise of the animated cartoon series “Miraculous Ladybug.” Among the costliest items they bought were a Japanese costume for P7,500 and a doll for $147.90. Colonia said the twins were able to set up another PayPal account, using her email address. They apparently got her debit card details when they got their hands on her wallet and were able to set themselves up for a buying spree without the help of any other grownup.  All the orders they made were addressed to the office of the Baganian Broadcasting Corp. in Pagadian City, where Colonia works. “It is very likely [that they did it] on their own, exploring the technology available at their fingertips,” the mother said. Colonia said she had since uninstalled the shopping apps on the twin girls’ tablet, but the orders could no longer be canceled."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316821/digital-payments-for-online-shopping-overtake-cash","title":"Digital payments for online shopping overtake cash","date":"04:00 AM February 01, 2021","snippet":"One of the country’s leading financial technology companies said noncash and digital transactions were the preferred means of payment for online shopping amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"One of the country’s leading financial technology companies said noncash and digital transactions were the preferred means of payment for online shopping amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

He was citing data from internal and external sources such as a report from Google, Temasek, Bain & Co. and Euromonitor.  “In 2020 alone, we processed over P95 billion worth of online shopping transactions across all of our platforms, which only shows that consumer preference for cashless payments and online shopping is overwhelmingly present,” Vea said in a statement. Speaking during the launch of the updated Department of Trade and Industry e-commerce roadmap for 2022, Vea said fintech players were poised to play an even bigger role as more business activity pivots online.  Vea acknowledged the global health crisis played a role in accelerating the push for e-commerce. “Consumers are now used to ordering online or via their phones and paying via cashless, and many businesses have accelerated their migration to digital, so there’s no turning back now when it comes to digital payments and e-commerce in the Philippines,” he said.

The online platform would cater to the country’s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that use the internet to sell their products amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  “I challenge the DTI to come up, in house, with an online shopping platform. The idea is that the seller must be an MSME and the product being sold must be made or grown in the Philippines. A transactional shopping platform and not a mere ‘portal’ listing MSMEs and their products,” said Pimentel in a statement. Pimentel, who chairs the Senate Committee on Trade, said that the new online platform will be an alternative to Lazada or Shopee as this will also help the MSMEs recover from the economic effects of the pandemic.  He added that the DTI should also utilize Filipino talent in creating and programming the online shopping app specifically designed for MSMEs. “Ilabas ang galing ng Pilipino hindi lang sa negosyo. Ilabas na rin ang galing ng Pilipino sa computer programming. (Let us unleash the Filipino talent not only on business but also in computer programming.),” said Pimentel. “  There’s no other way but to go digital.

For a gamer like Raffy, 20, shopping online for games is one way to relieve stress from school work. Like Kyla and Raffy, more Filipinos are turning to the Internet for shopping, according to a recent study released by MasterCard.  Airline tickets The 2014 study, which covered the Philippines and 13 other Asia Pacific countries, showed that about three in every five (59 percent) of the online population in the Philippines access the Internet to shop, up from 40 percent in 2013.  “The study points to the importance of online shopping to the Philippine market,” MasterCard said in a statement. MasterCard’s study found that Filipinos turn to the Internet to purchase the following: Airline tickets (38.4 percent), home appliances and electronic products (35.1 percent), clothing and accessories (31 percent), hotels (29.9 percent) and computer software (29.4 percent).  Meanwhile, sites of apps stores (50.1 percent), music downloads (42.6 percent) and home appliances/electronic products (38.2 percent) draw the most web traffic, the study also showed. Why do Filipinos go online to shop? Ease and convenience are the most cited reasons. “Most of the Filipino respondents are satisfied with online shopping, describing it as easy (73.3 percent), convenient (71.9 percent), or fun (64.4 percent), and expressing greater likelihood to purchase in the next six months (79.2 percent). All these figures are improvements from the results of the 2013 study (61.4 percent, 63 percent, 58.2 percent, and 68.2 percent), respectively,” the statement said. Mobile phones  The study also found more Filipinos using their mobile phones to purchase items— from 21.4 percent in 2012 to 34 percent in 2014, with 94.2 percent of participants able to access the Internet via smart phones, MasterCard noted, adding that those who purchased via mobile phones did so because they were able to do it “on the go.” Availability of apps that facilitate mobile shopping has also made it more convenient. “Among mobile shoppers, the top categories for purchases are phone apps (24.7 percent), music downloads (22.7 percent) and clothing and accessories (20.7 percent),” the study said. Security However, online shoppers have a number of considerations before going ahead and making an online purchase, among them the security of the payment facility (89.7 percent) and the speed of transactions (88.5 percent). “Before making a purchase, four-fifths consider online reviews,” MasterCard said. Ethical considerations also come into play, with more than seven in 10 purchasing products “for ethical reasons.” “Adherence to fair trade principles (77.4 percent), environment-friendliness (76.4 percent), and whether part of the proceeds will go to a good cause (60.8 percent) are the top three ethical considerations in making a purchase,” the study noted. The 2014 study is part of the Online Shopping Survey that MasterCard commissions annually. The survey was conducted in 14 Asia Pacific countries with a minimum of 500 respondents per country.

Even if the government fully relaxes the lockdown imposed throughout Metro Manila, subsequent personal distancing protocols likely to be implemented will reduce consumer traffic. This, in turn, is likely to result in a slower absorption of retail space all over Metro Manila.  Colliers projects vacancy rising to 12 percent in 2020 from 9.8 percent in 2019. In our opinion, the reduced mobility, observance of physical distancing and aversion towards the use of physical currency present opportunities for mall operators and retailers as these are likely to form part of the new normal in Philippine retail. For a consumption-driven economy like the Philippines, we are optimistic that mall operators and retailers may still tap pent-up demand. Stakeholders in the retail sector should be proactive especially with the projected rebound in economic output, recovery in overseas Filipino workers’ (OFW) remittances, and the potential impact of social amelioration programs on consumer demand.  By expanding online strategies and partnering with apps to facilitate seamless delivery, retailers should be able to offset any softer retail demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of a Colliers Philippines survey, women have a higher daily internet usage than men. Close to 60 percent of the female respondents spend seven hours or more online while only 45 percent of males allot the same amount of time. Respondents of the survey would usually allot around 3 to 3.5 hours daily on online shopping.  The survey also showed that the daily internet usage and time spent on online shopping increases with age. Those 51 years old and older spent more than 10 hours a day online, with online shopping reaching as much as half that. Younger respondents (21 to 30 years old) spent on average three to six hours a day online with two hours of that on online shopping alone. This supports one of our recommendations that retailers should increasingly target older shoppers and senior citizens. There should be a seamless online shopping experience, from adding items to cart to checking out using credit cards. Close to 80 percent of respondents encountered advertisements for products and goods online via social media. Retailers could take advantage of this by further strengthening their social media presence to expand the reach of their products. Based on the results of our survey, among the most popular e-commerce platforms include Lazada, Shopee, Instagram, retailers’ online stores, Zalora, Facebook Marketplace, and Amazon. Colliers believes that mall operators and retailers should strengthen their online presence by either utilizing existing e-commerce websites of their mall operators or setting up their own platforms to market their products.  But while we see opportunities amid the uncertainties, the central bank-forecasted drop in economic output in 2020 is likely to drag down consumer confidence which may impact retail space absorption in Metro Manila. This is likely to be compounded by the $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion (P153 billion to P306 billion) drop in OFW remittances and rise in unemployment projected by various government agencies and officials. Remittances, for instance, fuel private consumption, which cover about 10 percent of the country’s economy. There are several economic indicators that already point to some recovery. OFW remittances rose in June 2020, a reversal from three straight months of decline. Meanwhile, unemployment rate is starting to ease from a record-high 17.7 percent in April. These factors should help restore Filipino consumers’ purchasing power and benefit retailers and mall operators. The social distancing measures have been compelling consumers to rely heavily on deliveries. Mall operators and retailers should consider firming up partnerships with delivery companies that have modern warehouses and efficient logistics systems to maximize their shift from brick-and-mortar to online selling. The Colliers survey noted that more than half of the respondents that chose online shopping preferred e-commerce due to convenience. The survey conducted by Colliers Philippines shows tremendous opportunities for retailers that are agile enough to pivot to the “new normal” in Metro Manila retail. The lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 has forced malls to close, with only the stores supplying essential items such as groceries, medicines, and food for delivery open during stricter lockdowns. Colliers believes that social distancing is likely be part of the new normal even if the lockdown is further eased. Hence, a significant number of physical retail shops are likely to remain closed for additional time. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, brick-and-mortar retailers are trying to tap the demand by expanding their online presence. We recommend that retailers, especially higher-end brands, be more innovative to stay at the top of consumers’ minds. This may be in the form of home deliveries or personal shoppers. Selected retailers and operators have started tapping alternative platforms to reach out to customers during the quarantine period. Several mall operators have launched their respective Viber communities. Ayala and SM have also launched their personal shopping services. Mall operators should continue highlighting sanitation and property management procedures within their establishments. Developers should also line up marketing efforts to recapture pent up demand once the pandemic wanes and consumer confidence recovers. At Colliers, we always recommend that developers highlight projects that are within integrated communities. In our opinion, the pandemic has further emphasized the need to be in an integrated community where unit owners can easily access essential goods and services. Developers have been responding to this need by highlighting the presence of groceries and supermarkets that offer a wide array of merchandise, from F&B to basic house supplies to medicines. We already see this in the market, with brands such as MerryMart offering an expansive line of merchandise. We encourage developers and retailers to continue highlighting the integrated features of their residential projects, including the presence of groceries and hypermarkets within the community, as this is likely to be among the major considerations of unit owners post-lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/298487/puregold-expands-online-shopping-services-store-network","title":"Puregold expands online shopping services, store network","date":"05:26 AM May 28, 2020","snippet":"Banking on COVID-19 pandemic-resilient demand for essential consumer goods, retailer Puregold Price Club Inc. is expanding its online grocery shopping capability while building more physical stores this year using about P3.4 billion in fresh capital outlay.","body":"Banking on COVID-19 pandemic-resilient demand for essential consumer goods, retailer Puregold Price Club Inc. is expanding its online grocery shopping capability while building more physical stores this year using about P3.4 billion in fresh capital outlay. Online grocery shopping using the Puregold mobile app will be made available in 100 Pure­gold stores by the end of 2020 from the current 40 stores, the company disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Tuesday.  “We expect changes in consumer shopping behavior due to the COVID-19 situation,” Puregold said, explaining the need to expand its grocery shopping services. Due to social distancing needs amid the COVID-19 pandemic, some experts expect consumers to lessen their trips to grocery stores but buy in bigger volume moving forward. Online shopping has likewise surged during the two-month lockdown of Luzon and other key regions.  But Puregold will nonetheless continue its brick-and-mortar expansion. This 2020, it is set to open a total of 25 new Puregold stores and has opened two S&R membership shopping warehouses—one in New Manila, Quezon City, and another in Circuit Makati. “This will provide our shoppers better convenience especially now that tra­vel is limited due to quarantine,” the disclosure said. Of the total capital outlays for this year, about P1 billion will be spent to open the 25 new Puregold stores while P1.6 billion was spent for the opening of two new S&R hubs.  About P200 million was earmarked to open 10 new quick-service restaurant (QSR) outlets while P600 million was budgeted for maintenance outlays. These outlays will be “fun­ded by internally generated cash and short term untapped bank credit lines if necessary,” the disclosure said. As of end-2019, Puregold group had a total of 436 stores nationwide. These included 380 Puregold stores, 18 S&R membership stores and 38 S&R New York Style QSR with a total net selling area of about 565,000 square meters. Unlike in previous years, Puregold did not offer any gui­dance on sales growth or margins for this year given the volatile environment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, Puregold booked a consolidated core net income of P6.75 billion, up 16 percent from the previous year. Consolida­­­ted net margin stood at 4.4 percent for the year.  Consolidated net sales last year rose by 9.5 percent to P154.49 billion, 77 percent of which was contributed by the Puregold network and 23 percent came from S&R membership warehouse clubs and S&R New York Style Pizza stores. Excluding the impact of newly opened stores, Pure­gold stores registered same store sales growth (SSSG) of 4.6 percent in 2019, which the company said was stronger than expected. S&R registered 8.3 percent in SSSG during the same period. “Our 2019 SSSG was driven by higher consumer spending fueled both by minimum wage inflation in 2018 and easing inflation in 2019,” the company said.

A new startup, created by four young Filipino women passionate about improving the online shopping industry, seeks to make e-commerce that much more secure through CheckMade, an “independent third-party verification body” that affirms the legitimacy of online merchants, and evaluates their positive attributes.  Celine Montalla, who came up with the idea, wanted to address the issue of online fraud to provide consumers protection and peace of mind, while boosting the credibility of online sellers who provide good deals. CheckMade’s verification process initially requires sellers to submit pertinent documents that would prove their validity. If they pass, the sellers are awarded CheckMade “badges,” which they can display on their online stores, be it in a marketplace or their own website. These badges are meant to signify to buyers that they run a legitimate business.  Along with Montalla, who is deputy managing director of a top 1,000 Philippine holding company, CheckMade is run by three other 20-something women who believe in the huge potential of the Philippines’ e-commerce industry: Montalla’s sister Ciara, public relations associate for the Foundation for the Support of the United Nations; Julia Pineda, court attorney at the Supreme Court of the Philippines; and Jana Aguilar, who is currently taking up Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, with a focus on databases and data mining, at Boston University.Montalla says she came up with CheckMade after she herself figured in a case of online fraud. She says she had bought a huge amount of face masks from an acquaintance, and upon receiving the order, was surprised to find that what was sold to her looked completely different from the items she was expecting.“And we’re not just talking about a few thousand pesos,” Montalla says. To see if they actually had a viable business model, the group conducted a survey in May, which revealed that “online consumers want a service that verifies the legitimacy of sellers, and ensures the safety and security of their online transactions.”  The survey’s findings, Ciara adds, also showed that almost 74 percent of Filipino online consumers prefer to interact with brands that had certifications or accreditations of legitimacy. “Both sellers and consumers believe that proof of legitimacy and accreditation from a third-party platform would increase trust, improve a brand’s reputation, and distinguish sellers in an overcrowded marketplace,” Ciara adds. To do this, CheckMade created different badges to both verify sellers and to display the level of sophistication of their business. The initial badge, or the pawn (everything is chess-inspired), is given to sellers for free, as long as they can provide CheckMade with basic information: government-issued ID, mobile number and email address. They are also automatically included in CheckMade’s seller directory. To “level up,” sellers can purchase “accessories” for their badges, as long as they submit other pertinent business documents, such as registration with the Department of Trade and Industry. These accessories serve to “enhance” the badges, Montalla explains, which help sellers who are able to acquire them differentiate themselves from the sea of online merchants. Each accessory costs $2, or roughly P100. As an online seller’s business becomes more sophisticated, Montalla says he or she will eventually earn ranked badges, such as the rook and, eventually, the king, which indicate higher levels of legitimacy and consistent track record. Eventually, CheckMade will also offer specialty badges, which serve as recognition of their excellence in other standards, such as customer protection (bishop), product management (knight), and customer satisfaction (queen).  Still in its infancy stage, CheckMade’s potential has already been recognized by the international e-commerce industry, as it was recently chosen as one of the top three finalists of the Alibaba GET (Global E-commerce Talent) Global Challenge. The team went up against 11 other startups from the Philippines for the national round, and will be competing in the upcoming World Finals against startups from other countries (China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Mexico, Colombia, African Region, Uzbekistan, France and Morocco, Serbia and Russia). As they scale the business, Montalla says they want to do more than just protect buyers and legitimize online sellers—they also want to create a “CheckMade culture,” wherein both sides “speak the CheckMade” language, and are conscious about making e-commerce a seamless and safe experience for everyone. “We believe our team can perform a meaningful role in the digital transformation of businesses during this new normal,” she adds. —Annelle Tayao-Juego"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/295091/agrinurture-opens-online-store","title":"Agrinurture opens online store","date":"05:10 AM April 19, 2020","snippet":"Publicly listed Agri­Nurture Inc.

(ANI) had long thought about establishing an online presence to complement its agro-commercial operations, and it took the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine to suddenly move the schedule forward. ANI has thus joined the growing list of online merchants with the recent launch of its online delivery app (http://aniexpress.1ani.com.ph/), to help Metro Manila residents order basic commodities and fresh produce while avoiding long supermarket queues.  “Our online ordering and delivery app helps bring ANI’s fresh produce from the farm to your homes at competitive prices. We prepared a selection of the most sought-after vegetables and fruits and made them available in 5-kilogram packs,” said ANI president and CEO Antonio Tiu. The special “baskets” include Local Fruits Package, Imported Fruits Package, Highland Vegetable Mix and Lowland Vegetable Mix at a starting price of P500 per box if picked up at drop off points or with a minimal delivery fee of appro­ximately P200 anywhere in Metro Manila through third party delivery service providers.  “Aside from the convenience of online shopping and within 48 hours initial delivery service, our fruits and vegetables are guaran­teed fresher and cheaper than supermarkets because we get them straight from our contract farmers,” Tiu said. By using ANI Express’ online shopping app, he said consu­mers can help local farmers who are also considered front-liners in the fight against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  “Like most of us, farmers are also gravely affected by the pandemic. We can help them not just by giving donations but by patro­nizing their products,” he added. Tiu told the Inquirer that the platform was initially intended to cater to institutional buyers, but with Filipinos kept in their homes, ANI deemed it fit to serve households directly, farm to plate with just one click. “This platform seeks to eventually connect to online lending to farmers,” Tiu added. The ANI Express app is avai­lable via Google Play and Apple App Store, via Facebook or Instagram and is also downloadable at http://aniexpress.1ani.com.ph/. The online shopping app is part of 1ani.com.ph ecosystem, ANI’s electronic platform inten­ded to link consumers directly to farmers and growers. The app also links affiliate farmers directly to local and foreign institutional buyers thereby eliminating middlemen and improving farmer profitability."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/298741/s-korea-sees-online-shopping-grow-190-since-2015","title":"S. Korea sees online shopping grow 190% since 2015","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SEJONG – The online shopping market has become a core factor for the nation’s gross domestic product in recent years, as it makes up a core portion of household consumption.","body":"SEJONG – The online shopping market has become a core factor for the nation’s gross domestic product in recent years, as it makes up a core portion of household consumption. Data from Statistics Korea showed that the monthly turnover of retailers operating online retail operations came to 12.58 trillion won ($10.16 billion) in March. It posted growth of 191.8 percent over five years, from 4.31 trillion won in March 2015.  The monthly turnover has continued to surge — to 5.22 trillion won in March 2016, 7.74 trillion won in March 2017, 9.37 trillion won in March 2018, and 11.25 trillion won in March 2019. The comparison of 2019 and 2020 figures indicates that online shopping transactions are robust despite the sagging index in the nation’s total household consumption in the wake of COVID-19.  By segment, products of agricultural, livestock and fisheries posted the highest on-year growth (91.8 percent) in March this year, as households hesitated to visit restaurants amid the spreading epidemic. Its February growth peaked at 102.8 percent, compared to a year earlier. Data suggested that the smartphone shopping percentage has further grown in particular. The proportion of mobile shopping of total online sales has increased by 25.6 percentage points — from 41.7 percent in March 2015 to 67.3 percent in March 2020.  The monthly turnover exceeded the mark of 10 trillion won in October 2018 for the first time in history after topping 8 trillion won in September 2017. The marked growth of online shopping transactions has been backed by systematic parcel delivery services, which send products to consumers across the country in one to three days. Almost every kind of product — from drinking water, food and cosmetics to clothing, home appliances and furniture — is available online. A growing proportion of consumers were found to have purchased goods offered by department stores and large discount chains via the internet. “Data shows changing consumption trends like diversification of food retail services or preference for convenience food,” said an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Recently, local specialties including fresh agricultural products in rural districts nationwide are drawing popularity online.  The official said that local farmers from nine provinces deliver consumers soy-sauce-marinated crab, leaf mustard kimchi, groundsel-flavored macaroons and makgeolli. “Urbanites are attracted to homemade food or liquor products from microbusinesses in rural areas on the back of direct deals online,” he said. “The consumption trend is positive in terms of elevating the income level of farming, forestry and fishery households.” A noteworthy point since 2018 is that a growing number of people in their 60s have joined the fray of online shopping. A retail services analyst said seniors are the main buyers of goods with high price tags. “They purchase products such as luxury fashion items, couches and high-end air conditioners or TVs.” Meanwhile, pessimists claim that a major internet portal holds an oligopolistic status by providing settlement platforms to agricultural or industrial goods producers. A cybermall operator said the sales disparity between large and smaller online retailers is widening. “Brokerage service charges for consumers’ credit card payments are also a burden for micromall operators.” Retailers, nonetheless, welcome the rapid growth in online sales. A beef tripe seller at a traditional market in Incheon said she could sell her products that have become well known on TV not only to locals, but also to consumers across the country. She sells products via both her own online retailer and a platform offered by an internet portal operator.

Suddenly there were buyers for wet markets, Viber groups for tips on where to get various produce, Facebook food groups where vendors could continue to sell their products, online and delivery options for some supermarkets, and of course the rider apps that extended their services to include ordering from restaurants. One creative solution that emerged was Timplado.ph. This is an online deli with curated food products.  I came across it only recently but I love how the website works, possibly because of its clean layout and easy interface, making it a pleasant experience even for someone who is not keen on online shopping. Visit the website timplado.ph, you just add to your cart, check out, choose your delivery options, confirm payment, and they will then deliver within the day if you order by their stated deadline or the following day if you miss the deadline.  Take note that this is a site for something extra, not for items that you can get at your regular grocery store. For instance, they have 20 kinds of longganisa.  Truth be told, browsing through their catalog felt like a lesson in Filipino food, as they have Ilocos, Cebu, Alaminos, Calumpit, Lucban, Tuguegarao, Vigan, Imus, and chicken longganisa, with subvarieties from some provinces. Now I am thinking of creating a longganisa basket with one variety of each for my Christmas giveaways. They also have eight kinds of ramen kits. Ramen is something that many people missed most during the lockdown because it’s not something that you can just recreate at home. Good ramen takes hours and skill to achieve. I remember that when finally allowed out, the first treat that many of my friends went for was ramen. With timplado.ph, you can now enjoy ramen at home. They have shoyu, miso, tantanmen and tonkotsu ramen kits, among others.  Then they also have Filipino breakfast favorites: tapa and tocino. Tapa options include the classic tapa but also Binabad or Cabanatuan pork tapa. For tocino, they have both pork and chicken. The site’s creator, Paolo dela Fuente, used to run a restaurant in BF called Pito and Mita. So now they are also offering some ready-to-heat-to-eat items such as eggplant lasagna, Korean BBQ beef strips and parmesan-­crusted baked fish. For a real splurge (read: cholesterol warning), they have these specialties: sisig from Everybody’s Cafe (you won’t have to go all the way to Pampanga anymore), pork belly crisps by Pito and Mita (think chicharon but in the form of chips), chori-burger patties (a real treat for 90s kids who miss Bun On the Run), and “thick cut, smokey, natural bacon” by Big Ben’s Kitchen. So this is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic. We now have options like this and best of all, we can enjoy treats like Everybody’s Cafe sisig or ramen even at home.

Through an open letter on Wednesday, 150 diverse groups advocating for a zero waste and toxics-free society have urged online shopping sites to take steps to cut their packaging footprint as the country grapples with increasing plastic waste and pollution crisis.  “We make this appeal to all online shopping platforms to heed our plea for sustainable e-commerce that will not cause further harm to our ailing environment and climate, and endanger the health of humans and other living organisms,” EcoWaste Coalition Policy Advocacy Officer Patricia Nicdao said. “With the surge in e-shopping, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot help but be concerned about the huge amounts of plastic packaging produced, consumed and disposed of by the multi-billion peso online retail industry,” the groups wrote.  The groups lamented that much of these packaging wastes are going straight to garbage bins, buried in landfills, incinerated in cement kilns, clogged in drainage canals and river systems, or dumped into the world’s oceans harming marine life. “As two of the top e-commerce sites in the country, we appeal to Lazada and Shopee to set a good example in preventing and reducing the generation of packaging waste, particularly by diminishing plastic use, from online retail transactions,” the groups said.  They presented recommendations to the online shopping sites and others to cut down on their plastic use and packaging waste: 1.  Make public their plastic footprint (i.e., types and quantities of plastic packaging materials used annually); 2.  Adopt a plastic packaging waste prevention and reduction policy, including plastic-free packaging choice at checkout, returning used packages with reverse logistics and other schemes, and incentives for reduced packaging; 3.  Transition to ecological and safe options for delivering goods, including appropriate product packaging, to reduce disposable and unnecessary plastic and packaging waste; 4.  Implement time-targeted and measurable phase-out plans for plastic packaging materials;  5.  Communicate such phase-out plans to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers; and to 6.  Create a merchants’ section for those who sustainably package their products. The groups also called on e-commerce sites to offer, partner with, and provide incentives to developers, makers, distributors, dealers and customers of alternatives to single-use plastic bags, sachets, cups, cutlery, beverage and water bottles, straws and even diapers, panty liners and sanitary pads. Aside from providing customers with a plastic-free shopping experience, the groups further urged online shopping platforms to purge their sites of products that pose health and safety risks This includes non-compliant toys and childcare articles, contraband cosmetics containing lead, mercury and other contaminants, banned mercury-containing medical devices, proscribed or recalled products, etc."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/284576/filipinos-spending-on-online-sales-rising","title":"Filipinos’ spending on online sales rising","date":"03:49 AM December 02, 2019","snippet":"More Filipinos are transacting online and data indicate that spending on online sales will rise.","body":"More Filipinos are transacting online and data indicate that spending on online sales will rise. Data collected as of Nov. 22, 2019, from Google Trends showed that between 2016 and 2019, search interest on Singles’ Day (Nov. 11) has grown by 97 percent. Hence, it came as no surprise that the average basket size of each consumer this year was 10 percent more than last year’s.  iPrice Group, a Malaysian-based information aggregator platform, gathered and analyzed data from more than 100 online merchants and more than 35 million products in the Philippines to reveal the amount spent during Singles’ Day and the product categories Filipinos splurged on the most.iPrice noted five interesting Insights from its Singles’ Day analysis. First, Filipino consumers spent an average of P1,217 last Nov. 11. This was P628 more than the average household expenditure a day, as per the latest statistics from the Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA). That was more than a thousand pesos on just consumer products alone in one day. The average basket size this year also grew by 10 percent as more Filipinos started to shift to online shopping.  The second point was that Filipinos still spend the most on sports and outdoor items and electronics. Filipinos splurged more on these items than any other category for two years in a row now. This year, the average amount a Filipino spent was P1,585 on sports & outdoor items and P1,352 on electronics. This could be due to the growing number of emerging gyms and outdoor amenities in the country. Surprisingly, Filipinos spent more on sports bags and fitness-related food supplements than gaming items and gadgets Third, automotive and kids and toys categories had the highest surge. Interestingly enough, iPrice said automotive items had an 83-percent growth in purchases compared to last year amounting to P1,124 from P615. Most of the amount was spent on car and motorcycle accessories, which makes sense because the Philippines has such a high number of vehicle owners. Kids and toys, on the other hand, grew by 52 percent, or to P1,071 from P705.  Much of this growth was attributed to the purchase of gifts and baby gear items under this category. Overall, both categories contributed the most to the growth of the average basket size this year Fourth, home and living and fashion items increased while health and beauty items slightly decreased. Both home and living and fashion items had 25 percent more purchases than last year. Filipinos spent P1,177 on home and living items and P1,122 on fashion items during Singles’ Day alone. However, health and beauty items had a 7-percent decrease in purchases.

Data from the country’s supermarket chains showed that their online orders and sales surged by 50-60 percent on-year since Jun 1, when the country reported its first death from an outbreak of MERS. Online sales of South Korea’s No. 1 discount store E-Mart have rocketed 63.1 percent from June 1-11, compared to the same period in 2014.  According to E-Mart, its total food sales rose 77.4 percent. In detail, home meal replacement products saw the biggest boost, up 90.1 percent, while fresh food and processed food sales increased 83 percent and 69.9 percent, respectively. Homeplus, Tesco’s Korean unit, reported a 48.1 percent increase in online sales and a 37.5 percent rise in terms of order value. Lotte Mart saw its online sales grow 26.8 percent compared with a 10 percent sales slump at its brick-and-mortar branches.  “Because of the impact of the MERS crisis, the online grocery shopping trend is spreading much faster than expected,” a Lotte Mart official said. With the shift reverberating across the industry, supermarket chains are reinforcing their delivery services to handle the surge in volume. “We will continuously increase manpower and equipment to meet growing demand from customers,” he said. Lotte Mart added 150 employees for packaging and delivery service since the first week of June while adding 100 more delivery vehicles per day to its fleet. E-Mart gave notice to its online customers about a possible delivery delay on its website, saying its cut-off time for next-day delivery might be made earlier due to the unprecedented surge in online demand.

Our commitment is to provide convenience and accessibility to our customers through innovation,” said Jorge Mendiola, president at SM Retail Inc., which is a unit of the Sy-led conglomerate SM Investments Corp. “We remain cognizant of the evolution of shopping trends throughout the years. We hope that with this new e-commerce site, we will be able to reach out to more of our customers by bringing more attractive brands online and provide them a more exciting and diverse shopping experience with SM,” Mendiola added.  The new online shopping site showcases men’s, women’s and children’s accessories, apparel, bags and shoes as well as luggage and gift ideas. The SM Store offers door-to-door deliveries to most parts of the Philippines through its logistics partners.  Another option for shoppers is to pick up their purchases at SM North Edsa 24 hours after they have placed their orders online. The SM Store is further enhancing this option in due course through possible pick-up points in all Metro Manila and Luzon SM stores after two working days. In Visayas and Mindanao, the SM Store will eventually extend the pick-up arrangements in their branches in Mandurriao, Bacolod, Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos.

The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

For instance, travel firm Nam Ho Group is planning to launch virtual tours of travel destinations as well as an online store selling popular overseas snacks and produce.  And, given the uptick in online shopping, it has also seconded 16 of its passenger vans to provide home delivery services. Its vehicles are helping to deliver orders made through e-commerce sites Lazada and Shopee. Tintin Singapore, which sells comic-related memorabilia, is closing its Chinatown store at the end of this month after negotiations with its landlord fell through.  It has been spending more on digital advertising to attract local sales at its e-store and physical shop. It is hunting for a new location, but, in the meantime, the shop is offering discounts of 30 per cent and free delivery within Singapore.  “At this moment, the mode is plain survival,” a spokesman said. With the discount, the company hopes to “generate enough cash flow to make sure our team’s salary will not be affected much”. Results so far “have uplifted us a bit but, in the longer run, a better framework is needed to ensure our existence”, he added. Tourists, mostly from Indonesia, Australia, Hong Kong, India and the United States, made up 85 per cent of the shop’s customers before Covid-19 hit. “We suffered huge losses,” the spokesman said. Chinatown Heritage Centre launched its e-shop on June 29 after its team attended a United Overseas Bank workshop advising small and medium-sized enterprises on how to go online.  Its director Margaret Zhang said: “By creating the e-shop and going online, more people will have access to our merchandise, including those who have not visited or those who are unable to visit our shophouse museum, as we are temporarily closed during the Covid-19 period.” The centre used to get 70 percent of its revenue from tourists and the other 30 per cent from local student tours. It is progressively uploading all its merchandise to its e-shop, which will be a permanent offering. Ms Zhang is encouraged by the local and overseas sales orders so far. “We hope that the e-store will generate a new revenue stream for (the centre) in the near future.” Nam Ho director Marshall Ooi said the firm is “in the final stages of rolling out its virtual tour (which) allows individuals to explore new travel destinations from the comfort of their homes”. Its pre-Covid-19 annual revenue for Singapore was more than $55 million, split about evenly between inbound and outbound travel. “Nam Ho’s business in Singapore was growing in the beginning of the year until the news on Covid-19 broke out,” Mr Ooi said, adding that revenue has since declined sharply and nearly been wiped out. With the easing of international trade curbs, the firm has recently started working with overseas factories and suppliers to import their produce, which it plans to sell online.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Monday said that while the DOH understood the public’s excitement about Christmas shopping and being able to do other holiday rituals, it was concerned over a possible surge in infections as people gathered in shopping malls and commercial districts.  “Let us remember that the virus is still here. Even if you are wearing your mask and face shield, but would go to a crowded place, you could still get infected. The risk is there and it is very high,” Vergeire said. Vergeire issued the reminder after shoppers were shown on the network news crowding the streets of Divisoria in Manila during the weekend to beat the holiday rush. She asked the public to find alternative ways by which they could welcome the holidays.  “We advise everyone to opt for online activities such as online Masses, make video calls with friends and relatives, and if possible just shop online. In these ways, we reduce the possibility or chance of us being infected or infecting others with COVID-19,” she said. On Monday, the DOH recorded 1,799 additional infections, pushing the national tally to 420,614.  Cavite reported the most number of cases, 154, followed by Rizal (114), Quezon City (99), Bulacan (76) and Laguna (67). The DOH said 135 more patients had recovered from COVID-19, raising the total number of survivors to 386,604. But the death toll rose to 8,173 as 50 more patients succumbed to the severe respiratory disease. The recoveries and deaths left the country with 25,837 active cases, or 6.1 percent of the total, of which 83.5 percent were mild, 7.8 percent asymptomatic, 0.26 percent moderate, 2.9 percent severe, and 5.5 percent critical. For the first time since June, the daily positivity rate, or the number of people who tested positive for the virus, dropped to below 5 percent. Of the 19,178 tests done on Monday noon, 853 came back positive, or a positivity rate of 4.4 percent. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier set a benchmark positivity rate of less than 5 percent.  Vergeire said the DOH had observed new cases continuing to plateau to fewer than 2,000 in the last few weeks. But she acknowledged that some areas such as Davao were still being monitored to ensure the local health system could cope with the increase in infections. The health official said that based on the latest information, the WHO-led Solidarity Trials on Vaccines would still proceed as scheduled in December. The world health body, however, still has not provided the list of the candidate vaccines that will be used in the trial, which will be participated in by 4,000 Filipinos. In response to Vice President Leni Robredo’s suggestion that vaccine recipients be named already, Vergeire said the DOH couldn’t do that just yet as it was still finalizing plans for the procurement of the vaccine. “Until we can have a final list of the vaccines that we are going to procure, we can’t identify yet who are those who will be vaccinated,” she said. With regard to making an advance payment for the purchase of the vaccine, Vergeire said President Rodrigo Duterte had approved the prepayment to Pfizer. The American pharmaceutical company, which is scheduled to apply in the United States for an emergency use authorization this week, earlier said its vaccine was 95 percent effective against COVID-19. Due to the confidentiality disclosure agreement it has with Pfizer, the government cannot disclose yet how many doses it will purchase and for how much.

Lockdowns have increased online consumer activity, similar to the SARS episode in 2003, which was a turning point for China’s e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com,” Maybank Kim Eng analysts Lee Ju Ye and Chua Hak Bin said in an April 20 report titled “Consumer Behavior During a Pandemic.”  Citing Google’s COVID-19 community mobility reports, usage of retail and recreation facilities such as restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas plunged 82 percent in the Philippines from Feb. 29 to April 11, compared to the baseline period covering Jan. 3 to Feb. 6. Also, Filipinos frequented groceries and pharmacies less often, as mobility dropped to 60 percent during the same period.  Mobility to workplaces declined 67 percent; via transit stations and public transport hubs such as bus and train stations, down 86 percent; and in parks and beaches, 59 percent. “Based on data compiled by Google’s COVID-19 community mobile reports, the Philippines and Malaysia—among the first countries to impose lockdowns—are showing the steepest declines in people movements,” Maybank said.  Maybank noted that food delivery services had a low penetration rate in Asean—for instance, only 5.5 percent in the Philippines last year, but “with the ban on dine-in services, more food merchants are signing up with delivery platforms such as GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.” The Philippine government had allowed these food delivery services to continue amid the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon and other parts of the country, which started in mid-March and would end by April 30. The newfound habit of ordering food online or through mobile apps was expected to spill over to a wider array of goods and services offered on the internet, Maybank said. “Asean’s e-commerce penetration is relatively low, but will likely rise significantly due to COVID-19. Online sales account for 4 percent in Indonesia and the Philippines, 4.4 percent in Thailand, 4.7 percent in Malaysia and 9 percent in Singapore, based on data from Euromonitor. This is well below the 30-percent rate in South Korea and China, and 13 percent in the US,” it said. On the flip side, Maybank said that “the ‘sharing economy’ tech players, after enjoying several years of generous venture capital funding, will be the worst hit.”  “Bookings on Airbnb have plunged by over 90 percent in some markets, and online searches for ‘Airbnb,’ ‘Booking.com’ and ‘AirAsia’ have fallen to record lows across Asean. Co-working space is another major casualty, as tenants halt payments and break leases. Ride hailing platforms face a plunge in ridership, but drivers are shifting to other types of work such as food delivery and logistics. Grab and Gojek are burning cash to provide financial support to drivers in order to maintain their fleet for the ensuing recovery,” it noted. On a lighter note, while most Filipinos stayed at home during the ongoing lockdown, consumers mostly searched for food and entertainment as well as details of the government’s social amelioration program on Google. From March 18 to April 16, the top Google searches in the Philippines included “Dalgona coffee,” “SAC (social amelioration card) form,” “Dalgona Milo,” “Netflix mobile plan,” “Vindale research” (paid surveys at home), “grocery store,” “Goldilocks Bakeshop,” “Minecraft,” and “recipe,” Maybank noted. Searches for “masks” and “thermometers” also climbed across Asean since the pandemic started during the last week of January.

More and more Filipinos are beginning to shop online, according to the results of MasterCard’s Online Shopping Behavior Study 2012 in 14 Asia Pacific countries. The survey also shows that the country’s e-commerce potential is expected to grow even more with the emergence of enabling technologies.  Dominating the Philippine e-commerce landscape are local deals and promo websites, although the most visited website is eBay (12.5%). It is followed by Sulit (10.1%), Metrodeal (7.2%), Cebu Pacific (6.0%), Ensogo (5.5%), and Amazon (5.1%). The preference for local sites is due to fear of hidden charges, concerns about security and speed of delivery, and the availability of most of the items in local sites. Music download sites (43.9%) are the most visited in the Philippines, followed by personal, education or professional development portals (40.3%), and computer software websites (33.9%). Meanwhile, app stores registered the highest amount of online spend, pegged at US$297, along with supermarkets ($245), and airlines ($195).  The study also reveals the rise in the category of ethical spending, with 78.6% of respondents buying certain items because they are environment-friendly, up from 75.2% in 2011. In addition, 62.5% bought the product because a percentage of sale is donated to a good cause, up from 54.6% in 2011. In general, the Filipino online shopper is cautious in making online purchases, with most of the respondents (89%) citing security as a top concern, closely followed by speed of transaction (88.5%), convenience of payment methods (88.5%) in their transactions. Other factors considered important by 80% of the respondents are price/values, return or exchange policy, website reputation, online review, customer service, low delivery charges, and use of various payment methods.  Most respondents (79.5%) also plan their online purchases, up from 74% from 2011. This points to an online shopping behavior that is less impulsive, except when it involved coupon/deal sites (triggering 28.8% of purchases), and airline tickets (25.1%). To mitigate any perceived risks associated with e-commerce, 81% of the respondents read online reviews. Moreover, majority of the shoppers (77%) tend to go to the online shopping sites they have used before. In terms of gender, women tend to have more positive views, higher involvement, and openness about online shopping than men, who are more concerned about security issues. Interestingly, the men are most likely to shop from and spend on foreign websites. With respondents that cover the country’s 18 to 64 year-old population, the study shows that 40.4% of Filipinos access the Internet to shop. For the past three months, 64% of them purchased online, up from 2011’s 61%, and significantly higher than 2010’s 38%. While Filipinos currently rank lower than their neighbors in the propensity to conduct online transactions, the country’s index of 71 has an upward trajectory, rising by 7 points from 2011’s 64, and 14 from 2010’s 57. The same is true for their online shopping satisfaction rating, which is at 86.1%, increasing from 82.6% in 2010 and 84.4% in 2011. Such a pattern differs from the fluctuating or plateauing trends among the top scorers like China, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore. Mobile commerce is a key area of growth, with the number of Filipinos with in-mobile Internet access rising to 78.5% from 74.6% in 2011, and the number of mobile-online shoppers doubling in the last 12 months: 21.4% in 2012 (versus 11% in 2011). The expansion of this market will be facilitated by the availability of more apps (36.1%), which presumably assuage security concerns, and come with the promise of being able to shop on the go (32.5%), and convenience (27.8%).  In general, the report is bullish on the prospects of e-commerce advancing in the Philippines, as long as merchants, and credit card and payment solution companies more effectively promote the security of online transactions, ensure that there are no hidden charges, and strictly adhere to delivery timelines. Other suggestions to improve the Filipino online shopping experience include minimizing the delivery fees, protecting consumers from unscrupulous websites, and facilitating the ease of transactions."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/187897/selling-goods-online-trust-is-key","title":"Selling goods online? Trust is key","date":"03:33 AM March 06, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines–Online shoppers in the Asia-Pacific region (Apac) are reluctant to buy directly from the websites of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) online retailers, according to the results of a research study into global consumer behavior around cross-border e-commerce commissioned by FedEx Express.","body":"MANILA, Philippines–Online shoppers in the Asia-Pacific region (Apac) are reluctant to buy directly from the websites of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) online retailers, according to the results of a research study into global consumer behavior around cross-border e-commerce commissioned by FedEx Express. Conducted by independent research firm Forrester Consulting, the study showed that 57 percent of Apac respondents ranked buying directly from SME online retailers as their least-preferred business type for cross-border shopping, ranking it below multi-brand online marketplaces, brand or manufacturer websites and bricks-and-mortar retailers.  Of the Apac respondents who expressed misgivings about buying direct from SME online retailers, 46 percent said their reluctance stemmed from the difficulty in verifying the seller’s reputation or trustworthiness-compared to a global average of just 21 percent who harbored this reservation. The study completed in September 2014 is based on the responses of 9,006 global online shoppers in 17 countries and regions, including Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea in Asia Pacific.  The results of the study complement other current data reflecting the e-commerce landscape in the Philippines, as growth in this sector has surged with 40.4 percent of Filipinos now accessing the Internet for their shopping needs. However, Filipino shoppers remain cautious when purchasing online, with 89 percent citing security concerns, 88.5 percent for speed of transactions, and 88.5 percent for payment methods.  In addition, there is still a preference for local websites. “In some respects, the study reveals a trust deficit among Apac consumers when it comes to buying goods from the websites of SME online retailers outside their home market,” said Dr. Karen Reddington, president, FedEx Express, Asia Pacific.  “They are more nervous than their counterparts in other regions about buying from retailers they may not be familiar with, or those based in distant markets.  Nevertheless, the study also reveals the considerable opportunity for SMEs in the online retail space, and suggests ways for them to win the trust that is so important to online shoppers in this region.” The study suggests that doubts about using SME online retailers’ websites haven’t dampened Apac consumers’ appetites for all cross-border online purchases. In fact, Apac consumers spend an average of almost $350 per year on such purchases, compared to a global average of $300. Consumers in certain Apac markets spend even more: 26 percent of mainland China respondents reported spending more than $1,000 per year, for example.  Through its exhaustive analysis of global trends in online shopping behavior when purchasing goods from overseas, the study arrived at five key recommendations for SME online retailers. These are: 1. SMEs should pay attention to their international traffic and business.  A large number of merchants surveyed reported that their international business had started unintentionally, through overseas customers finding them through web searches and online advertisements.  Monitoring this traffic can help to inform future business strategy. 2. SMEs should research how other merchants successfully market their goods. Explore what has made other SME sites successful including their logistics offerings and how the purchase process works. 3. SMEs should decide whether to go broad or narrow.  Whether to attempt to serve many markets or focus on a few key ones is likely to be dictated by whether the products on sale have broad appeal and logistics considerations that may make it easier to serve some markets than others.  SMEs that decide to focus on a small number of key markets may decide to invest more in services such as website translations, web advertising and broader payment offerings. 4. SMEs should focus on limited geographies at first.  This enables them to “test the water” with less risk.  Each country will have its specific requirements and complexities.  Being able to meet customer expectations in the initial markets helps to ensure success as SMEs expand their reach. 5. SMEs should identify the right resources.  The company’s international strategy and type of business will determine what the company needs from its selling and logistics resources-with particular emphasis on services and offerings that will matter to customers in the company’s target markets.  For example, companies that offer return services to their customers need logistics providers that can handle international returns smoothly and efficiently. “Access to overseas markets is no longer the preserve of large corporations – more and more SMEs are selling overseas,” said Dr. Reddington.  “Increasingly, promoting e-commerce is a way to promote the interests of SMEs, which are the driving force of many economies in the region. The study’s findings will help service providers like FedEx to tailor our service offerings so that they are an even better fit with what our SME customers need. In addition, national governments also have a role to play in ensuring a favorable environment for e-commerce to thrive. Ultimately, this benefits not only SMEs but consumers and national economies too.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/307958/merrymart-rolls-out-branches-dedicated-to-online-purchases","title":"MerryMart rolls out branches dedicated to online purchases","date":"01:59 PM September 23, 2020","snippet":"Newly listed grocery operator MerryMart Consumer Corp. is set to roll out a string of “invisible” branches that cater only to online buyers, thus locally pioneering the “dark grocery” concept that some retailers have embraced elsewhere in the world to complement offline operations during this coronavirus pandemic.","body":"Newly listed grocery operator MerryMart Consumer Corp. is set to roll out a string of “invisible” branches that cater only to online buyers, thus locally pioneering the “dark grocery” concept that some retailers have embraced elsewhere in the world to complement offline operations during this coronavirus pandemic. Through wholly-owned subsidiary MerryMart Grocery Centers Inc., the retailer led by young business magnate Edgar Sia II teamed up with FoodPanda Philippines to deploy “dark grocery” stores in the Philippines with the aim of becoming the first 15-minute grocery delivery service in the country.  The first two of these dark grocery stores are set to start operations in Makati City and Manila City this October. “This concept is a real game-changer in the online grocery space. Imagine being able to buy exactly what you need, when you need it, and for it to arrive at your doorstep in a very short span of time. We are glad to join forces with the global delivery platform FoodPanda to power this ‘dark grocery’ store concept as they are the leaders in the online food delivery space,” Sia, MerryMart chair, said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Wednesday.  “These dark grocery stores will generally be located in select hidden locations and are exclusively intended for online deliveries. We see this initiative to complement the expansion of the brick-and-mortar MerryMart branches which will serve both delivery and walk-in customers,” added Sia. The grocery delivery service with FoodPanda covers convenience grocery goods, personal care essentials and other fast-moving consumer goods.  As these branches do not cater to walk-in consumers, they can be rolled out at a faster pace because there’s no need to beautify the sites.  In other markets, these unmarked stores can be converted to full-pledged stores in case there’s strong demand in its vicinity.  During this pandemic, however, quarantine protocols across the globe have created greater demand for e-commerce options, even as stores selling essential items remain open. MerryMart now has a total of 11 operational branches and targets to end of the year with 25 locations."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283780/p2fb-marie-kondos-newly-launched-online-homeware-store-sparks-controversy","title":"Marie Kondo’s newly-launched online homeware store sparks controversy","date":"10:34 PM November 20, 2019","snippet":"Five years after her bestselling “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up”, the decluttering guru has launched a new e-commerce shop based on her KonMari method for minimalist living.","body":"Five years after her bestselling “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up”, the decluttering guru has launched a new e-commerce shop based on her KonMari method for minimalist living. The online shop, available through her KonMari website, presents a selection of approximately 150 homeware and fashion items, ranging in price from $8 to $300.  Kondo explained that the listed products are an expression of the decluttering philosophy laid out in her bestseller, with each of them chosen for their ability to “spark joy” in her daily life. “My tidying method isn’t about getting rid of things — it’s about heightening your sensitivity to what brings you joy. Once you’ve completed your tidying, there is room to welcome meaningful objects, people and experiences into your life,” she wrote in a note on her site.  Among the lifestyle items on sale are a linen kimono robe listed at $115, a brass mirror for $150, as well as a Japanese donabe pot costing $180. The e-commerce shop was met with criticism on social media, where users called out Kondo for promoting consumerism after having encouraged people to get rid of unnecessary things in her bestselling book and Netflix hit show, “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo”.  “I’m not sure what at #mariekondo’s new store sparks more joy — her $75 cotton towel or the $12 ‘Shiatsu Stick,'” one wondered on Twitter.   In a recent sit-down with Fast Company, Kondo defended her KonMari online store, claiming that the catalog of items responds to the numerous queries from fans about the products she uses in her everyday life. “I’m not saying the fewer things you have, the better. The emphasis is more on whether you are savoring the love you have for your belongings and taking the time to care for them. If you have a huge house with ample storage, it’s perfectly natural to have a lot of things,” she added. This is not Kondo’s first foray into retail. The tidying guru has previously attached her name to sets of organizing boxes that have been sold out since they were released last summer. As the Guardian pointed out, the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten has also recently announced a new commercial partnership with Kondo. IB/JB RELATED STORIES: Netflix’s US subscriber growth slowing as competition looms Chill your Netflix habit, climate experts say Freebies are the key hook in new ‘streaming wars’"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1166445/pdea-suspects-courier-and-online-shopping-site-being-used-to-sell-drugs","title":"PDEA suspects drug trade in online shopping sites, app-based couriers","date":"11:02 AM September 19, 2019","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) suspects that online shopping sites and app-based delivery services are possibly being used to sell and distribute illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia.

The two were arrested in two separate operations on Thursday in Pasig City and Quezon City, respectively.

And Facebook knows that Christmas season can make Filipinos become fierce shoppers, even online.","body":"The Philippines is known to hold the longest Christmas celebration in the world. And Facebook knows that Christmas season can make Filipinos become fierce shoppers, even online. “Filipinos think about Christmas as early as September and seeing products online on Facebook or Instagram is just as powerful as window-shopping – it helps make products and brands top of mind for when consumers need to start deciding on a purpose,” said Facebook Philippines’ Country Director John Rubio.  Citing data from Facebook 2018 Holiday Study, Rubio noted that shopping via mobile phones makes people well-informed shoppers of products since they are able to research about an item they want to buy as well as compare prices across brands, and thus get the best deals available. The study, which analyzed the shopping habits of 1,504 people from ages 18 and above in the Philippines, revealed that even when people go to a physical store to shop, they still use their mobile devices to do some research.  Particularly, 64 percent of the respondents admitted they still use their smartphones even when they are already in the actual shop to research on a product before finalizing their purchase; 72 percent compare product prices while 66 percent read reviews and compare items with other brands. More specifically, the study showed that in-store shopping mobile activities include: comparing prices (72 percent); comparing products (66 percent); reading product reviews (66 percent); reviewing shopping lists (59 percent); and taking photos (56 percent).  Informed purchase The study also found that three in five Filipino shoppers say that using their mobile phones for holiday shopping helps them in making informed buying decisions. “So Filipino shoppers are ‘hacking’ holiday shopping,” Rubio said. “Mobile-first shoppers does things like researching online, uses that information to then communicate to retailers and find shops and then order as well and buy online.” Rubio also said Filipino consumers are starting to turn to their mobile phones for easier shopping especially this Christmas season. Based on the Facebook 2018 Holiday Study, 50 percent of the respondents prefer purchasing products online because it’s more convenient than going to stores.  Mobile phone and millennials Rubio noted that shoppers use Facebook and Instagram to find gift ideas for their loved ones this Christmas with 94 percent of the shoppers even saying that Facebook influences their holiday shopping. “People are discovering the products and services that they want to give during Christmas. It happens primarily on mobile,” Rubio asserted. According to the research, the kind of videos that shoppers find useful during holiday shopping include: tips on how to make the most out of shopping/store visit (61 percent), product demonstrations (48 percent), and those that show the kind of person that would benefit most from receiving a product as a gift (42 percent). In 2018, Facebook recorded an 18 percent increase in mobile-first shoppers in the Philippines – 70 percent of which are millennials. “It’s a trend that’s being driven by the younger generation who are more used to interacting with the world through their mobile phone,” Rubio pointed out. Content-driven campaigns Since consumers usually discover and purchase products and services through their mobile phones, Rubio encouraged businesses to target their consumers through content-driven campaigns. Rubio advised businesses to utilize videos since they attract consumers as they browse through their Facebook or Instagram. Rubio said Filipino shoppers will spend an average amount of P17,000 during Christmas, and 40 percent of mobile-first shoppers will spend more than that. “Basically, mobile-first shopping is driving not only more research and bargain-hunting behavior, inventory-behavior but it also ends up making them spend more,” Rubio said. /kga"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/134946/surging-online-economy","title":"Surging online economy","date":"04:07 AM November 02, 2020","snippet":"A recent regional survey of online shopping behavior shows interesting trends that can help private companies and even the government, specifically its tax-collection agencies, plan strategies.","body":"A recent regional survey of online shopping behavior shows interesting trends that can help private companies and even the government, specifically its tax-collection agencies, plan strategies. The buying habits not only of Filipinos, but practically also of everyone else across the globe, have been altered greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic. For Philippine companies and entrepreneurs wanting to see what lies ahead and how digitalization is shaping up, the findings of a regional survey conducted by the iPrice Group, a Kuala Lumpur-based company that operates a search website in seven countries across Southeast Asia and compares and catalogs more than 500 million products, should prove insightful. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, for its part, can use the data to draw up its program on how to effectively target online businesses that need to pay taxes.  The rise of internet selling is evident in the number of Filipinos who have opted for this path, peddling a variety of stuff from food to household items and cheap products sourced mainly from China. From June to September this year, the BIR said it registered 7,262 web-based businesses. Last Sept. 30 was the deadline set by the BIR for all online sellers to register their businesses for taxation purposes. The regional survey covered consumers in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. Dubbed “Map of E-Commerce” report, it showed the Philippines’ online economy fast catching up with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Forced to stay home during the survey period covering the second quarter of 2020 when the Duterte administration imposed the most stringent lockdown in the region, Filipinos, according to the survey, had the highest increase in the use of shopping apps, at 53 percent, in Southeast Asia. The Philippines also had the highest increase in spending, at 57 percent, among the countries covered.  Another interesting finding is that fashion retail sites appear to be falling out of favor among consumers. In the Philippines, fashion sites’ web traffic declined by 30 percent compared to last year’s level. Fashion online sites have taken the biggest hit regionwide as clothing and apparel become less of a priority while people stay home because of the pandemic. On the other hand, electronics sites (those selling mobile phones and audio and video gadgets) experienced a 59-percent jump in web traffic. An earlier study by the same group showed that the number of Filipinos searching for Wi-Fi adapters soared 518 percent, ostensibly as they prepare to spend more of their time online.  In the region, sports and outdoor products are the most ordered, growing by 34 percent during the second quarter. The survey also showed an upsurge in the total sessions in shopping apps in the Philippines, reaching 4.9 billion from April to June this year. It had been expected that online businesses in countries that underwent strict physical distancing measures would experience growth in mobile app usage, but the Philippines’ growth was particularly noteworthy as it indicated that the country was catching up with its regional peers. Before this, Filipino consumers were known to patronize brick-and-mortar stores as reflected in the big number of shopping malls in the country. However, digital adaptation was forced, and apparently sped up, by the strict lockdown measures imposed by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19. The only sad part in the findings is that multinational companies are gaining more web traffic while local companies lose out. In the Philippines, these foreign selling platforms cornered 97 percent of the market, leaving just 3 percent to homegrown sites. Vietnam and Indonesia are the only two countries in the survey where local companies have a bigger share in web traffic than the multinational companies they compete with for consumers. This can, however, be turned into an opportunity for homegrown Filipino talent to find creative ways to grab market share from the foreign websites. Local sellers just need to find more compelling ways, and offer more compelling products, to pique the interest of local consumers. The dreaded pandemic has inadvertently given the internet economy in the Philippines a big push. It is now up to the government to lay a safe groundwork for e-commerce, for telecommunication companies to provide fast, affordable, and reliable services, for online sellers to abide by the rules and regulations, and for consumers to exercise prudence and awareness in transacting online.

A Facebook-commissioned study, which surveyed 1,501 adult respondents in the Philippines, showed that there was 7 percent decline in the number of people who did their 2017 and 2018 holiday shopping in malls.  Facebook Philippines Country Director John Rubio said that possibly part of the reason people don’t go to malls anymore is hellish traffic in Metro Manila. Another reason, he said, was the convenience of shopping from the comforts of home online.  Rubio, in a forum on Thursday, Oct. 10, said people who still go to malls still rely on their mobile phones to browse for gift suggestions. The Facebook 2019 Holiday study found that 73 percent of shoppers use their phones while they are browsing for gifts in stores or in malls. This is 10 percent higher than that recorded last year, it noted.  Of the number, 69 percent compare prices, 61 percent compare products, and 60 percent read product reviews. Growing market Rubio also noted that the number of people shopping digitally for the holiday season “has grown significantly from one year to the other,” where spikes in online consumer activity usually occurring in November and December. He said, however, that majority of Christmas shoppers “take action early” and buy or prepare gifts as early as October. Singles Day (November 11), 12/12, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are among the most popular online shopping dates, the study said.  “Almost close to one out of two people will have a digital shopping experience in one of the shopping days,” Rubio said. The study also found that holiday shopping season extends up to January primarily because people take advantage of additional holiday sales. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they still shop in January because of bargains, while 43 percent said they want to buy new things for the New Year. Avoiding traffic Some 3 out of 10 persons said they shop in January as malls are “less busy” and there is “less traffic.” Thirty percent of respondents also said they use gift cards they received during the holiday season to purchase new things. Online videos also help people decide what to buy for the holidays, the study found. Respondents said during the holiday season, they like watching videos that feature families (67%). Others prefer videos that get them in a holiday mood (58%) or give them holiday gift ideas (58%). The Facebook Philippines official encouraged small-to-medium businesses in the country to tap free resources to help them bring their products online. “I think businesses need to have a clear digital strategy because I think it’s now an actual channel of business,” he said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); He added that holiday statistics show that “the trajectory is more and more digital or e-commerce.” “I think businesses need to get prepared and it needs to be a core part of their strategy. It needs to be ingrained in everything they do already and plan for,” Rubio said. Personal level For those planning to go online selling, it might be helpful to note that according to the Facebook study, nine of out of ten people are more likely to make a purchase if they are able to contact businesses on instant messaging services. This drives the importance of being able to engage customers on a more personal level, Rubio said. The study said that people usually message a business during the holiday season to find out more details about a product (66%), to purchase a product (58%), to track an order (58%), to find shopping details (56%), and to find store information (47%). Facebook Philippines has ongoing programs that provide free seminars and workshops to help local entrepreneurship thrive. On Tuesday, the social media firm conducted its “Festive Bootcamp in Manila” where 200 Manila-based small-to-medium businesses attended seminars and workshops about running a business on Facebook easier. This helped participants to brush up on digital knowhow and learn about new tools and templates to save time and effort, especially during the holiday season, which is the busiest time of the year. “With festive boost, we want to provide small and medium-sized businesses access to market insights and tools that can help them plan for an extended holiday season for their customers,” Rubio said.

Thankfully, she’s hooked, not on drugs, but on stuff that could be just as costly: online shopping. The habit allows her to purchase anything anywhere, anytime.","body":"Trixie (not her real name) is an addict. Thankfully, she’s hooked, not on drugs, but on stuff that could be just as costly: online shopping. The habit allows her to purchase anything anywhere, anytime. “I’m online all the time, even when I’m in a mall. Even when I’m out, I sometimes shop online,” said this freelance writer.  “But I wouldn’t say I’m addicted,” she said. Giggling, she backtracked: “[One of my friends] will probably say I am,” she said, adding that she buys at least one item online every week.   Trixie gives a face to recent studies conducted by international research agencies that found one technological phenomenon common across all countries: more people now spend most of their days and nights online, thanks largely to the rise of smartphones.  The online shopping trend is driven by the universal need for convenience, according to a study by Euromonitor International, which showed that people are willing to spend more for online services to save time. Lawyer Nadine Juanengo confirmed this. “I started shopping online around three years ago when I was living alone and reviewing for the bar,” she said. “I didn’t have a lot of time to go to the mall but I needed some personal stuff so I resorted to buying online.”  Dana Errazo, 29, who leads a busy career in corporate communications, and accounting staff Kris Barrios-Siongco, said as much.  “Traffic and crowds are an issue [for me] when going to malls. Safety is also another aspect I worry about, especially when commuting,” Siongco added. Unique items The thrill of finding unique items also drive people to shop online. The choices are unlimited since, aside from major websites, there are also smaller entrepreneurs who take advantage of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. When it comes to fashion items, majority of online shoppers are women, according to fashion website Zalora, citing their core customer demographic as being 70 percent female, aged 25 to 35, and are middle- to high-income earners, said Zalora creative director Fiona Araneta. Another popular website, Lazada, offers a wider category of items, from fashion to health and beauty, to appliances and gadgets. Based on its consumer data, Lazada’s clients are predominantly male. In the past six months, the site has received almost 60 million page views, 81 percent of which were by consumers aged 19 to 40 years old. The convenience however comes at a price, among them the rigid exchange policy of some online shops and the sometimes long wait. “I hate the wait!” said Trixie. “Here in the Philippines, returns and exchanges can be stressful to the point that I’d rather lose weight to fit into a wrongly sized garment than have it exchanged. Independent sellers here aren’t as customer service-oriented compared to the States.” Identity theft There are also two major risks shoppers face when making online purchases: identity theft and scams or bogus sellers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Trixie recounted how her debit card was once “hacked” at a local gas station. “Since I keep only about P3,000 at a time, it was a blessing when someone attempted to buy appliances online at Anson’s and the transactions wouldn’t go through. My bank immediately flagged the activity and I just had to cancel the card and get a new one,” she said. Fortunately, Filipinos are a prudent bunch, attested Giancarlo Bonsel, general manager of buy-and-sell website OLX.ph. “In the Philippines, institutionalized trust is lower compared to [other countries],” said Bonsel. “What I’ve come to learn is that Filipinos are quite reluctant to trust people they don’t know.” What this means, he added, is that buyers seem to make it a point to investigate first whether or not a store or seller is credible enough before finalizing their purchases, at least when it comes to smaller or independent online stores. Despite the risks, figures on online retail traffic and revenue now rival those of “offline” establishments which, in the Philippines, are mostly the huge malls. Research by Kantar Retail, an international integrated retail solutions company, shows that total revenue from local e-commerce is expected to reach at least P145 billion by 2020, 1.8 percent (around P2.6 million) of which will come from retail sales. Top sellers Araneta said Zalora gets 20 million visits every month, with approximately 600,000 new visits daily. Their top-selling products for women are dresses, tops, ballet flats and nude lipsticks. The men mostly buy white sneakers and other sports shoes, white T-shirts and polo shirts. Bonsel said OLX.ph, which also sells brand-new items despite being mainly a classifieds website, receives at least eight million visits monthly on both its mobile and desktop platforms. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Despite these numbers, both online and brick-and-mortar stores said they do not consider each other as competition. They actually complement each other’s services, since many physical establishments have themselves invested in an e-commerce component, while some retailers which started out online now make use of mall spaces or bazaars to further reach out to their customers. Added Rowena Tomeldan, Ayala Malls group head: “Online shopping has not affected customer traffic in malls, because malls have evolved through the years and have gone beyond shopping. Malls have become one-stop centers [for] dining, entertainment and other services. Malls are also where families and friends get together.” Good news, then, for people like Trixie, who will always find ways to get her shopping fix—be it online or offline. Ironically, though, it’s not the purchase she enjoys most. “I guess it’s the thrill of the search,” she said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/203422/black-friday-online-shopping-rivals-stores-us-survey","title":"Black Friday online shopping rivals stores–US survey","date":"08:13 AM November 30, 2015","snippet":"Washington — As many Americans bought online as they did in physical stores during the Thanksgiving weekend shopping splurge, the National Retail Federation said Sunday, highlighting a growing trend away from the traditional Black Friday consumer assault.","body":"Washington — As many Americans bought online as they did in physical stores during the Thanksgiving weekend shopping splurge, the National Retail Federation said Sunday, highlighting a growing trend away from the traditional Black Friday consumer assault. The closely watched survey said that about 151 million people shopped either in stores and/or online over the long weekend in the United States, when many consumers look to take advantage of promotions.  That used to mean queuing up in the bracing cold late Thursday night after Thanksgiving into early Friday morning and — in some cases — literally fighting for the best offers. But the 2015 figures underline how American consumers are changing to get their holiday shopping fix — nearly 102 million shopped in stores and more than 103 million shopped online this year.  “We recognize the experience is much different than it used to be as just as many people want that unique, exclusive online deal as they do that in-store promotion,” NRF president and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement. “It is clear that the age-old holiday tradition of heading out to stores with family and friends is now equally matched in the new tradition of looking online for holiday savings opportunities.”  The NRF found that 133.7 million people shopped during the holiday last year. Accurate comparisons cannot be made between this year and last because the poll by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the NRF used a different methodology than in 2014. A separate NRF survey found that more than 121 million shoppers, or about 49.5 percent of consumers, plan to shop online on so-called Cyber Monday, which takes place on November 30 this year. That was down slightly from the 126.9 million who planned to participate last year. The average spending per person over the weekend reached $229.60.  The NRF said last year that consumers spent an average $380.95, but again, that was using different methodology. People under the age of 35 were most likely to spend over the weekend."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1291291/quarantine-life-offsets-gains-in-drive-vs-plastic-waste","title":"Quarantine life offsets gains in drive vs plastic waste","date":"05:38 AM June 14, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The past few months have been extra frustrating for Marko Yambao, who, under normal circumstances, consciously keeps his carbon footprint low and his activities environment-friendly.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The past few months have been extra frustrating for Marko Yambao, who, under normal circumstances, consciously keeps his carbon footprint low and his activities environment-friendly. With the community quarantine due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) compelling him and millions of other Filipinos to stay home, the 27-year-old content producer found himself relying on online shopping and deliveries for his needs. This, however, came with the deluge of single-use plastics which he had long sought to avoid.  “Online deliveries overdo their packaging all the time,” he lamented. “There’s just so many layers of plastic: three layers, at the very least. Even unboxing a package can get tiring.” Yambao is not alone. As lockdown measures continue to limit movement and access to goods and services, consumers have turned to deliveries for both essential and nonessential purchases. And even as restrictions begin to ease, disposable plastics appear poised to dominate life under the shadow of the coronavirus.  To think that not too long ago, the Philippines was making some headway in the arduous shift from single-use plastics. The clamor for swift action was warranted: According to a 2015 report by the international group Ocean Conservancy, the country generates 2.7 million metric tons of plastic garbage yearly, and is the world’s third biggest marine plastic polluter. Some policy actions to cut back on the use of plastics — from proposed legislation to actual ordinances — had been laid on the table. But COVID-19 effectively turned the tide, forcing the battle against plastic pollution off the front burner.  “The pandemic has definitely caused a lot of disruptions in our progress moving away from plastics,” said Marian Ledesma, Greenpeace Philippines zero waste and sustainable food campaigner. “The increase of deliveries for food and online shopping introduced another way for society to produce waste. Cities and provinces coming out with ordinances against plastic use had to backtrack.” Pre-pandemic, the Philippines had already been contending with overwhelming plastic waste. A five-year trash audit by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives revealed in 2019 that Filipinos were throwing away 48 million plastic shopping bags, 45 million thin-film bags and 163 million plastic sachets every day. While numbers are still to be validated, overall waste generation during the lockdown is seen to have dropped because of the massive slowdown of economic activity, said Crispian Lao, vice chair of the National Solid Waste Management Commission. Still, with the majority restricted to their homes, household waste is expected to balloon even if people are not ordering takeaways and deliveries daily, Lao said. According to the commission’s solid waste status report in 2014, the biggest chunk of municipal solid wastes comes from households (56.7 percent), followed by commercial sources, such as general merchandise stores and restaurants.  Beyond takeouts and deliveries, plastic has surfaced as a go-to material for the safety of the general public. In hospitals and healthcare facilities, front-line medical workers are clad in personal protective equipment often made of plastic. The use of disposable masks and gloves has exploded exponentially even among ordinary citizens, causing shortages. As the economy reawakens, plastic has also become commonplace in certain vital areas. Separators made of plastic sheets are now installed in supermarkets, pharmacies and similar establishments. Some public utility vehicles have also been retrofitted to include these. While the use of plastic in the context of public health cannot be avoided, the challenge lies in managing the discards and ensuring that these do not end up in the streets, waterways and oceans. “The difficult thing is if it is infectious medical waste, it is very hard to say that we are going to replace them with reusables, because right now, there is no way we can compromise the health of the people in need of these tools,” said Anna Oposa, cofounder of the marine conservation group Save Philippine Seas. “But there is also waste that we have more control over, such as e-commerce packaging,” Oposa said. Another setback stemming from the pandemic is the freeze in measures geared to minimize plastic waste. For example, Quezon City implemented its ordinance banning plastic bags in January but has since decided to step back. “In the interest of health and safety, the use of plastic bags was temporarily allowed … to lessen the risk of virus transmission and protect both the front-liners and the buying public,” said Andrea Villaroman, head of Quezon City’s environmental protection and waste management department. In a memorandum issued in May, the city government encouraged residents to reuse plastic bags as lining for their garbage bin instead of immediately disposing of them. It also encouraged food establishments to adopt a “by-request” protocol for single-use cutlery and condiment sachets for takeaway food and deliveries. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Due to the virus, the department is also mulling the deferment of the ban on single-use plastic/disposable material, which was scheduled for implementation in July. “As gathered from businesses themselves, full compliance with the [ordinance] would require proper transition and adjustment through procurement of reusable dining materials and washing and disinfection equipment,” Villaroman said, adding: “The city government recognizes that the pandemic caused significant financial loss for businesses and that requiring full compliance with the ordinance by July 2020 would be untimely.” Even and especially as COVID-19 continues to rage, environmentalists urge the government, private businesses and ordinary consumers to still keep their eyes on the plastic waste problem. “As we are transitioning to this new normal, governments and businesses should proceed according to science,” Ledesma said. “And what science tells us is good practices in hygiene and sanitation are still the key actions to protect public health.” At the House of Representatives, the proposed “Better Normal for the Workplace, Communities and Public Spaces Act of 2020” seeks the strict monitoring of the implementation of Republic Act No. 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, in relation to the proper disposal and management of waste relating to the “new normal.” House Bill No. 6864, recommended to substitute for the earlier “New Normal” bill, proposes that the government regulate the manufacture, importation, use and recycling of single-use plastics; conduct research on and develop alternatives to single-use plastic packaging; and provide incentives to plastic industries that will shift to other manufacturing activities. “The use of plastics right now may be solving another [problem], but we need to really recognize that this will create a longer problem in the future,” said Dr. Deo Florence Onda, marine scientist at the University of the Philippines’ Marine Science Institute and founding member of Plastics Research Network Philippines. Environmentalists say that with the Philippines still adjusting to the new reality, ordinary citizens should consciously reduce their plastic use, reusing what they consume and recycling what they can. Reusables, such as cloth bags and personal water tumblers, should still be part of people’s lives moving forward. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Bringing your own is better because you know where that came from,” Oposa said. “If you bring your own, you know that it was touched by your own hands.” Ledesma said businesses should also rethink and offer alternative delivery systems and allow customers to have a say in their purchases. “With online shopping and delivery now the norm, it’s made the excessive amount of plastic sort of an acceptable price to pay for our convenience,” she said. “Deliveries make purchases and ordering so easy that it sort of feeds into needless consumption. It can create bad habits that eventually become lifestyles.” And Yambao? He has realized that getting back to his old practices won’t happen anytime soon. But at the very least, he’ll reach out to the online shops to hold back on that added layer of plastic, he said.

An official of the DOF on Friday said the government wanted these businesses to be registered so that they would be included in the formal economy before they are compelled to pay the right taxes.  The BIR is one of the revenue-generating agencies under the DOF. Its June 1 Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 60-2020 setting a July 31 deadline for all online sellers to register and pay their taxes triggered protests from small internet entrepreneurs and several lawmakers who said the agency was burdening rather than helping people who were trying to cope with the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.  But Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said “the goal of this project is not to go after online merchants for unreported sales or unpaid taxes.” “We just want to encourage those who are engaged in online businesses to register with the BIR,” Tionko, head of the DOF’s revenue operations group, said on Friday.  “Online transactions have increased for quite some time now, especially during the community quarantine period. That’s why we want to take this opportunity to remind them to register their businesses,” Tionko said. She did not say whether the tax payments would be postponed. Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner Arnel Guballa on Thursday said both individual and corporate taxpayers who sell goods online needed to register and settle their tax obligations. Officials defended the BIR’s move as a means to raise more revenue to fund efforts to contain the pandemic. Several senators, however, said that instead of cracking the whip against these small businessmen, the BIR should focus on large tax evaders, particularly Philippine offshore gaming operators, who owe the government tens of billions of pesos in taxes.  The DOF explained that the BIR order also is part of the government’s efforts to establish a tax collection for digital transactions. Last month, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the DOF was studying a bill that had been filed by Albay Rep. Joey Salceda to impose taxes on video and music streaming, online shopping sites, as well as advertisements on social media. Dominguez said the DOF was “very carefully” looking into parts of the “digital economy” that should be taxed. He said Salceda’s bill was aimed at ways to include digital purchases into the value-added tax (VAT) base and how profits made by digital companies could be absorbed into the corporate tax system. “We are studying how best these goals can be achieved, considering the transnational nature of most of these transactions,” Dominguez said. He said the bill would not create new taxes or increase current tax rates as Salceda only wanted to expand the revenue base. “Ultimately, having a clear and efficient tax regime for the digital economy will be critical, as more and more taxable transactions shift from traditional means of doing business to more virtual avenues, a trend accelerated by COVID-19,” Dominguez said in May. “Taxation in the digital economy is being seriously considered not just in the Philippines but in other countries as well,” he said. He cited Indonesia, which is taking steps to bring the digital economy into its tax base, and Singapore and Malaysia, which had already covered some digital services in their sales tax bases. Dominguez noted that the United States had protested against these new digital taxes, saying they were meant to target its homegrown tech giants. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); He said some countries had started to impose digital service taxes even before they could agree on how to “reallocate income taxation rights on cross-border digital transactions.” “Once an international agreement is reached, we will immediately study and propose tax reforms to capture income tax on cross-border digital transactions,” he said. The Philippines for the moment is focusing on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what is being done by its partners nation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to Dominguez. The DOF and the BIR are crafting regulations and designing a system to effectively collect VAT on digital transactions, he said. Online businesses were targeted for taxation as early as 2013 when then BIR Commissioner Kim Henares issued RMC 55-2013 requiring registration and tax payments from “online business transactions, including online retailing through virtual shopping malls, online marketplaces, webstores and similar websites” or “online stores.” These online stores included business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, and business-to-business transactions. As such, online shopping or retailing, intermediary services, advertisements and classified ads, as well as auctions were taxable, according to the BIR. Henares said that like other business establishments, persons who conduct online transactions and their “permutations” were obligated to register, secure authority to print invoices or receipts and register books of accounts. These businesses should also withhold the required taxes, including on their employees’ compensation, file tax returns and submit other tax compliance reports. The BIR warned that those engaged in internet commerce who failed to comply with tax laws, rules and regulations would be penalized under existing laws, including the Tax Code. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As the economy faltered, the BIR’s tax take from January to April dropped 20.5 percent year-on-year to P559.3 billion. Collections slid 61.6 percent to P90.5 billion just for the month of April. Historically, the BIR’s collection surges in April, as filing and tax payments are mandated by the Tax Code to be done by April 15. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BIR moved the deadline for submitting income tax returns three times before finally settling on June 14, as the government prolonged the quarantine which was imposed in mid-March."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/202388/china-singles-splurge-13b-on-biggest-online-shopping-spree","title":"China ‘singles’ splurge $13B on biggest online shopping spree","date":"08:55 AM November 12, 2015","snippet":"BEIJING, China — Chinese Internet users spent billions of dollars in the planet’s biggest online shopping splurge Wednesday, as “Singles Day” hit new heights, despite slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.","body":"BEIJING, China — Chinese Internet users spent billions of dollars in the planet’s biggest online shopping splurge Wednesday, as “Singles Day” hit new heights, despite slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy. The cumulative national bill for the day-long commercial orgy dwarfed Americans’ online spending over the five-day frenzy from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday last year.  Singles Day is not a traditional Chinese festival, but e-commerce giant Alibaba has been pushing November 11 — a date heavy on ones, the loneliest number — since 2009 as it looks to tap the country’s huge, and expanding, army of Internet shoppers. It was first marketed as an “anti-Valentine’s Day”, featuring hefty discounts to lure singletons and price-sensitive buyers.  But with sales hitting new highs year after year, it has become a massive — and highly lucrative — business opportunity embraced by the nation’s digital retailers. Competition for a slice of China’s 668 million Internet users is turning increasingly fierce, and Alibaba kicked off this year’s mammoth event with a television spectacular at Beijing’s Water Cube Olympic swimming venue.  James Bond actor Daniel Craig and Hollywood star Kevin Spacey — in his role as President Frank Underwood from the Netflix series “House of Cards” — were just two of the galaxy of foreign and domestic stars involved. The company’s efforts paid off in spades. A little over 12 hours after the promotion’s midnight start, sales had already outstripped last year’s $9.3 billion gangbusters effort. By around 10 p.m., shoppers had splashed out almost $13 billion, according to a company blog. The figures were “very solid evidence for the power of Chinese consumers”, chief executive officer Daniel Zhang was quoted as saying, adding that when the company started the event “we never dreamed it could be such a huge shopping day”. In comparison, desktop sales for the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday in the United States last year stood at $6.56 billion, according to Internet analytics firm comScore.  Another of China’s main online retailers, JD.com, said it had completed over 20 million transactions by around 5 pm. About an hour and a half later, one day orders had passed the combined total of the five previous Singles Days, it wrote on Twitter. Milking it Putting all of those purchases into customers’ hands is a huge task. Alibaba said its logistical arm and its partners would use more than 1.7 million personnel, 400,000 vehicles, 5,000 warehouses and 200 planes to handle deliveries. Buying on that scale has had a ripple effect outside of China. Australian company Bellamy’s had to apologize to customers Down Under after supermarket shelves there were stripped bare of milk powder, a shortage, the company said on Facebook, that was due to Chinese demand. Writing on Twitter, JD.com said orders for imported milk were up 500 percent on 2014. Singles Day has received vocal support from the government at a time when China’s economic expansion is slowing and Beijing is trying to transform its growth model into a more sustainable one driven by consumption. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s office phoned Alibaba chairman Jack Ma hours ahead of the promotion, “congratulating and encouraging the creation and achievement of the 11.11 event”, said a post on a social media account of Tmall, the group’s business-to-consumer arm. The mega-spending spree came as the government announced industrial output growth had fallen to 5.6 percent in October, a six-month low, highlighting the need for the transition to consumer spending. The figure is the latest indicator that China’s expansion is slowing after years of breakneck growth. But Chinese Internet users were more interested in their new acquisitions than government policy — although many lamented that they had spent far too much money.

Indeed, it’s Christmas season in the capital and harried and stressed out drivers and commuters are out in full force to buy gifts for the lucky ones on their Christmas list.  But not Ygy Arcilla, a human resources executive and young mother. She has achieved the same shopping feat in her eveningwear at home, tapping away at her mobile phone. Arcilla joins a growing number of urban warriors who have embraced online shopping as a way of beating the horrendous traffic in Metro Manila, where stories of multihour commutes or drives are not unusual.  “We try to avoid malls as much as we can. We only go there if it’s absolutely necessary,” she told the Inquirer, noting that the comfort away from congested roads far outweighed the risk of online fraud. “Time is gold.” Arcilla’s buying habits are helping fuel the Philippines’ fast-growing e-commerce sector, where revenues are expected to hit $1.2 billion in 2017 and breach $2.6 billion by 2022, according to research firm Statista Inc.Online retailers have adjusted to the domestic market, where millions still do not have a bank account or own a credit card.  All manner of payments are accepted: credit and debit cards, cash on delivery and even mobile wallet services. Goods are typically delivered within a few days. This bevy of options lures consumers like Arcilla, who started to seriously shop online in 2015, when she bought baby supplies and clothes for her newborn son. She hasn’t looked back since. “Trust your instincts. Best thing to do is read the seller reviews. Luckily for me, I haven’t had any bad experience with my items,” Arcilla said on how to avoid online scammers.Traffic is a perennial and growing issue in urban areas such as Metro Manila, home to about 12 million people, or over 10 percent of the country’s total population. Transportation regulators have been battling the problem but with little success. Relief could come by 2020 and far beyond, when new expressways and railway projects are opened. This situation makes the Philippines fertile ground for e-commerce, as consumers transition from older buying habits into more convenient options, enabled by increasing wealth, rising smartphone sales and deeper internet penetration.  The potential for growth is large, with e-commerce penetration in the Philippines estimated at 39 percent by United Kingdom-based consult We Are Social, based on a survey early this year.The country’s largest business groups, with an eye toward the future, are jumping in. PayMaya, a nonbanking financial service app backed by telco giant PLDT Inc., saw a six-fold increase in the payments it processed for online merchants in November. As Christmas shopping peaks this weekend, growth is expected to accelerate, said Paolo Azzola, PayMaya chief operating offer and managing director.“E-commerce has made Filipinos more efficient. Online shopping is all about saving a lot of time and energy for consumers to allow them to be more productive and attend to more urgent matters,” Azzola said. PLDT’s rival, Globe Telecom, owned by Ayala Corp., saw the entry of Chinese tycoon Jack Ma’s Ant Financial into its fintech unit in August. Mall developers, which still define the retail experience for most Filipinos, are seeing both potential competition and a new area of opportunity in e-commerce. Henry Sy’s SM Prime Holdings, which owns the country’s biggest shopping mall franchise, last year partnered with online department store Lazada while Gokongwei-led Robinsons Retail Holdings Inc. is taking more online orders for its supermarkets via delivery service Honestbee.Earlier this month, Robinsons Retail bought a 20-percent stake in the operator of online wellness shop BeautyMNL. The Ayala group, whose property unit developed the Makati financial district in Metro Manila, also acquired in September a 49-percent stake in online apparel retailer Zalora Philippines.“The worsening traffic situation is one of the drivers [of e-commerce],” Zalora Philippines cofounder and chief executive officer Paulo Campos III said in an interview.But he noted that changing shopping habits had spread beyond urban areas. Zalora has been increasing its footprint in parts of Visayas and Mindanao, where buyers lack access to the wide selection of goods found in larger cities. “We are really seeing the growth being the fastest in those places, more so than in Metro Manila,” Campos said. Should malls be worried about becoming obsolete? For online shopping aficionado Arcilla, that would take some more time. “It’s tried and tested. If your house is walking distance from a nearby mall, then good for you. You get exercise, and the feel of ‘true shopping’—plus spending time with family and friends while doing it is a bonus,” she said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1358333/drug-syndicates-going-online-pdea-agent-tells-lawmakers","title":"Drug syndicates going online, PDEA agent tells lawmakers","date":"05:35 PM November 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—Online selling platforms and transport network services (TNVS) “are being exploited” by drug syndicates for their illegal trade, according to an official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Monday (Nov. 9).","body":"MANILA, Philippines—Online selling platforms and transport network services (TNVS) “are being exploited” by drug syndicates for their illegal trade, according to an official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Monday (Nov. 9). “This pandemic may have caused these drug personalities to elevate and take advantage of online platforms,” said PDEA agent Aida Ferolino at a House hearing on the sale of drugs online.  Ferolino told lawmakers that the shift in drug transactions from face-to-face to digital means “is a huge challenge to PDEA and other law enforcement agencies.” “We all know that drug syndicates would always do anything to succeed in their illegal drug activities and under the new normal,” she said.  Ferolino said even before the pandemic, arrests had been made already of drug traders “who facilitated drug transactions through online platforms or e-commerce platforms.” The PDEA, she said, had conducted buy-bust operations that led to the arrests. The suspects posted drug paraphernalia on an e-commerce platform, which prompted the PDEA to conduct buy-bust missions, she said. She added that the PDEA had conducted three such missions.  Ferolino said online shopping platform Lazada had also turned over to them 3.6 kilos of marijuana. “They also use TNVS to transport their illegal drug activities. We have arrested two drug personalities who use a transport service to deliver their packages,” she said. Rep. Wes Gatchalian (Valenzuela City), chair of the House committee on trade and industry, said online platforms should “exercise due diligence with regards to its merchants.” These online traders, he said, should “not pass off the responsibility to law enforcement agencies to run after people who are behind these online illegal activities.” Gatchalian said the PDEA confiscated last Sept. 18 these illegal items from online platforms—P12,000 in marijuana, 12 ecstasy tablets worth P40,000, a capsule of “Fly High” party drug worth P2,500 and 11 bottles of liquid ecstasy worth P426,000. Citing information from arrested suspects obtained by the PDEA, Gatchalian said some drug paraphernalia, like water pipes and glass tooters, had been brought from the country’s two leading online shopping sites.  He said the PDEA had already requested the administrators of these shopping sites to take down all listings of drug paraphernalia. At the hearing, Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said the department had received a total of 14,869 complaints involving online transactions from Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2020. Castelo said this was way higher than the 2,457 complaints that the DTI received in 2019. The official said the complaints were related to violations of the Price Act, like overpricing, profiteering, or lack of price tag. “Many people are being defrauded by false and deceiving advertisements, poor product quality and unconscionable sales acts and practices,” said Gatchalian in reaction to the DTI data. “What is surprising is that a majority of these complaints came out of sales facilitated through these major platforms,” Gatchalian said. He said, “this is happening precisely because there are currently no regulations that will compel these platforms to ensure the safety of our consumers.” “Right now, many platforms are self-regulating, but the problem is that when these self-regulations fail, the consumers have nowhere to turn to,” he said. “Many are oftentimes left hanging, or are put through such a long process that many of them just choose to abandon their claims,” he added. The lawmaker renewed his call for the immediate passage of his House Bill No. 6122, which seeks to regulate the internet economy. Under the bill, the platforms will be held liable for vendors’ wrongdoing on their platforms if no measure had been taken to prevent the sale of illegal products. The measure has been approved by the House panel and is set to be passed on second reading."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/250317/filipinos-open-bank-accounts-online-shopping-payments-boom","title":"More Filipinos open bank accounts as online shopping, payments boom","date":"01:14 PM May 06, 2018","snippet":"A third of Filipinos now hold bank accounts – allowing them to save money or make and receive payments, wages or financial assistance – thanks to a growing demand among consumers for digital payment services, the central bank said on Sunday.","body":"A third of Filipinos now hold bank accounts – allowing them to save money or make and receive payments, wages or financial assistance – thanks to a growing demand among consumers for digital payment services, the central bank said on Sunday. In a press statement, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas quoted the World Bank’s 2017 Global Findex study that showed 34.5 percent of Filipinos aged 15 and above now have direct access to the formal financial system, up from 31.3 percent in 2014.  “While gains are modest, the Philippines made remarkable strides in indicators pertaining to digital payments,” the BSP said. It noted that the share of adults who used the internet to pay bills or make online purchases grew by 6.3 percentage points to 9.9 percent in 2017. Those who made or received digital payments in the past year rose by 5.6 percentage points to 25.1 percent in 2017.  “The prospects look bright as the Philippines takes deliberate measures towards digitization,” it said. “Formal accounts” refer to those held in financial institutions such as banks, cooperatives or microfinance institutions and can be an electronic money account, as well.  Formal account penetration in the country improved by 3.2 percentage points between 2014 and 2017, translating to more than 3.7 million Filipino adults who opened accounts during the period. The 2017 Global Findex also highlighted key challenges to disadvantaged segments such as farmers and small businesses. Those who borrowed to start, operate or expand a farm or business declined to 4.2 percent in 2017 from 13.6 percent in 2014. One in five adults received payments for the sale of agricultural goods, slightly unchanged from 2014 to 2017. Compared with its Asean peers, the Philippines ranked in the middle with Singapore (97.9 percent) and Cambodia (21.7 percent) at opposite ends of the spectrum. The country’s level of account ownership fell short of the average for East Asia and the Pacific (70.6 percent) and lower middle income countries (57.8 percent). The results of the 2017 Global Findex will be augmented by the upcoming release of BSP’s own financial inclusion survey. The local survey will provide a more in depth look at the state of financial inclusion in the country to complement the topline country indicators of Global Findex. The BSP is focusing its financial inclusion work to sectors that previously neglected sectors such as agriculture and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The approach goes involves creating a financing ecosystem that supports value chains and addresses fundamental issues in the financial infrastructure in terms of guarantees, crop insurance, movable collateral registry, and credit information system, among others. /cbb"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/318407/ing-pay-is-your-new-online-payment-partner-and-more","title":"ING Pay is your new online payment partner — and more","date":"11:54 AM February 26, 2021","snippet":"This pandemic has sped up digitalization in a lot of ways.

Sales at retail stores the day after the Thanksgiving holiday fell 10 percent to $10.4 billion this year, down from $11.6 billion in 2014, according to research firm ShopperTrak. And sales on Thanksgiving dropped by the same percentage, to $1.8 billion.  A big reason for the decline is increased online shopping, as Americans hunt down deals on their smartphones, tablets and computers. And many retailers are offering bargains long before Thanksgiving, limiting the impact of Black Friday specials. Online sales jumped 14.3 percent on Friday compared with last year, according to Adobe, which tracked activity on 4,500 retail websites. Email promotions drove 25 percent more sales compared with 2014, the company said.  READ: No crowds but online surge on Britain’s ‘Black Friday’ Store retailers saw fewer customer visits on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, compared with last year, according to Kevin Kearns, ShopperTrak’s chief revenue officer.  “Shoppers are researching products ahead of time, targeting their store visits, and arriving in-store with the intention of making a purchase,” Kearns said. The drop in Thanksgiving Day visits may also reflect a “social backlash” against stores opening on that day, Kearns said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/670679/bir-files-tax-evasion-raps-v-2-online-shopping-sites","title":"BIR files tax evasion raps vs 2 online shopping sites","date":"05:05 PM February 05, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on Thursday filed tax evasion complaints before the Department of Justice against two online shopping sites—Ensogo and CashCash Pinoy.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on Thursday filed tax evasion complaints before the Department of Justice against two online shopping sites—Ensogo and CashCash Pinoy. BIR said Ensogo’s tax liability is P36.14 million while CashCash Pinoy’s liability is P132.51 million both inclusive of surcharge and interest.  In two separate complaints, BIR accused Ensogo, Inc. and its president, Krit Srivorakul and treasurer Xelynne De Lara of willful failure to remit tax and deliberate failure to pay tax in violation of Sections 251 and 255 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997. “Ensogo and its responsible corporate officers were charged for their failure to remit taxes withheld and for failure to pay the corresponding and withholding tax on compensation and value added tax for the period October 31, 2011 to October 31, 2014 in the total amount of P36. 14 million, inclusive of surcharge, interest and compromise penalty,” the BIR said in its complaint.  Ensogo provides marketing services to its merchants, who are engaged in the leisure, catering and entertainment industries. It’s website sells selection of products, services and travel discounts to customers in the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. “Investigators discovered that Ensogo electronically filed its withholding tax and VAT returns but deliberately, willfully and continuously failed to remit taxes withheld and or pay the corresponding withholding taxes and VAT due thereon, whether electronically or manually resulting to considerable revenue losses for the government,” the BIR said adding that despite demand letters, Ensogo failed to settle their liabilities.  “Despite repeated demands by the BIR for Ensogo to pay its liabilities through the issuance and service of the said letters and warrants, the respondent failed and contributed to refuse to pay the taxes due to the government,” the complaint said. On the other hand, Moonline Inc. which is engaged in the sale of products and services through the website CashCash Pinoy said the company and its officers-president Frederic Elie Levy and treasurer Bernadette Levy underdeclared the correct taxable income by 23 percent or P9.31 million in 2011, by 240 percent or P111.09 million the following year and by 181 percent or P129.88 million in 2013. “One of its customers/ withholding agents, BDO Unibank Inc. disclosed that it remitted to the BIR creditable taxes in the amounts of P48.98 million in 2011, P155. 18 million in 2012 and P199.89 million in 2013 for payments made to Moonline,” the complaint said. Their complaint said Moonline declared in its income tax returns for taxable years 2011, 2012 and 2013 gross income amounting to only P39.78 million, P46.26 million and P71.89 million respectively but investigation showed it received total income payments amounting to P49.09 million in 2011, P157.35 million in 2012 and P201.77 million in 2013, thus, substantially underdeclaring its correct taxable income. “As a consequence of its acts and omissions, Moonline was likewise sued for an aggregate income tax liability amounting to P132.51 million, inclusive of surcharges and interests, broken down into P5.76 million in 2011, P62.02 million in 2012 and P64.73 million in 2013,” the BIR said.

When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay. Let’s help make it work for our still struggling entrepreneurs, and let’s make sure our kids are prepared as well to be smart consumers. mtan@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

In a statement, the Philippine Payments Management Inc. (PPMI) also urged clients to trust only legitimate channels when dealing with financial institutions online, including official websites and verified social media accounts.  “Consumers have a role in educating themselves about using digital payments, and ensuring that they secure their accounts,” PPMI chair Justo Ortiz said on Tuesday (May 26). “A lot of information is available online, such as in [the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’] social media platform for financial education advocacy, Pisolit.” The group said that while the COVID-19 pandemic has increased usage of digital payments, there has been an observed increase in attempts at scams and financial crimes.  “Given the surge on e-payments usage, we remind both our bankers and users to be on full alert for online scams and financial crimes, which have increased during the [enhanced community quarantine],” he said. PPMI — a self-governing body that helps oversee the payments industry and ensure the implementation of the National Retail Payments System with the BSP — also called on banks and e-money issuers to enhance and increase their capacity to accommodate the surge in e-payments and protect consumers through continuous system upgrades and enhanced online security measures against cyberthreats.  The group said it expects digital payments to increase in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as such, banks and e-money issuers must continue building awareness, customer service quality and trust on digital payments among customers. “We continue to partner with the BSP, our banks and e-money issuers in creating a more conducive environment for digital transactions especially as the government continues to ease restrictions and while adjusting to the new normal,” Ortiz said. “We support the call of BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno to our kababayans to shift to the easy, safe, secure and convenient e-payments for your transactions even after COVID-19.” At the same time, the group called on its member firms to continue helping consumers transition to online and mobile banking during and after the pandemic. “With the restrictions in movement due to different levels of quarantine, banking services must continually be made available to consumers through means that will be safe for the customers and the providers as well,” Ortiz said. The group noted the exponential increase in the adoption of digital or electronic payments in recent years, with the number of Instapay transactions from March until April rising to 15.6 million, which was 3.9 million or 34.5 percent higher than figures during pre-ECQ months in January to February of 11.6 million. The value of Instapay transactions in March and April reached P96.4 billion, higher by 27.4 percent or P20.8 billion versus the previous two months of this year pre-ECQ. On the other hand, PESONet transaction value during the same period was higher by P57.4 billion or 21.5 percent compared to the combined figures from January and February.

A lot of people view online shopping as an easy alternative to traditional methods, especially since the traffic in Metro Manila during the holiday season has always been horrendous. However, there have been several cases where items purchased through the internet, even through legitimate and commercialized websites or applications, were allegedly starkly different from what was advertised.  Just recently, a Facebook user posted a photo of stones placed inside the packaging of power banks, in a supposed attempt to trick customers.

Traditional retailers with physical stores need new ways to keep up with fast evolving e-tailers to satisfy their empowered customers who demand satisfaction at all touch points.  Around the world, the retail industry and consumer habits are changing faster than anyone could predict. In emerging markets, particularly in Asia, the number of online users is equally large. The concentration of Generation Y and millenniums in Asia, the cultural emphasis on maintaining regular contact with friends and family, and the influx of mobile technologies and devices have contributed to this increasing online shopping habit. Despite being home to four of the 15 largest shopping malls in the world, the emergence of online shopping stores in the Philippines has steadily changed the way Filipinos shop.  In fact, a majority of, if not all, the local retail giants have already established their online shopping presence.  Also, there are some notable standalone Philippine-based online stores like www.zalora.com.ph, www.lazada.com.ph and www.juanstore.com.  Buying pre-owned items online has also become popular with homegrown online shopping portals like www.sulit.com.ph and www.ayos.com.ph.  Omni-channel retailing   The digital experience is influencing major changes in the store and online. To be a winner in this race, retailers need to become smarter by transforming into an omni-channel retailing, concentrated more on a seamless approach to customer experience through all available shopping channels. Big Data can allow traditional retailers to deliver better shopping experience to their customers across all possible channels—in-store, online and on-the-go with mobile devices.  The key is using data and analytics to better understand the behavior and preferences of shoppers to close the sale. Most consumers interact with brands or businesses with which they already have strong connection—a personal connection. Still a personal journey  One of the ways to make the customer journey personal is through a personalized seamless customer experience whether online or in-store. If you know your customer in one channel, you need to know him or her in other channels as well. This means that your customer experience initiatives should not be devised as an isolated standalone program. They have to be thoughtfully integrated with other customer-facing initiatives.  An IBM study of 26,000 global consumers released in January at the 2013 National Retail Federation convention in the United States revealed that consumers were diversifying the way they shop for and acquire goods. They are becoming increasingly open to buying both online and in-store depending on their needs at time of purchase. While more than 80 percent of shoppers chose the store to make their last non-grocery purchase, only half are committed to returning there next time they buy. Significantly, nearly a quarter of these online shoppers intended to buy their item in the store, but ultimately purchased online—primarily due to price and convenience. Retailers must connect their store and online presence to capture the sale to show roomers. Today, online-only retailers account for one-third of show roomer purchases. Younger, male and affluent shoppers are most likely to showroom. Retailers must better connect their online and physical stores, blending benefits into both at various points in the shopping cycle—from research to purchase—to build brand loyalty and repeat sales. In the store, retailers must infuse digital experiences, enable store associates with the technology to save the sale and embrace consumer-owned technology. Online, retailers must optimize their websites for various devices—from iOS, Android to Windows platforms. The empowered customer expects seamless experience off and online. Link online, physical store Smarter retailers would use analytics solutions to provide the fact-based insight that they need to treat each consumer as an individual, meeting their growing expectation for personalization at all touch points. Analytics can also be used to identify why show roomers are shifting purchases online so retailers can act and adjust accordingly. With these unique capabilities in place, retailers would be able to see improved conversion rates and reduction in cart abandonment, leading to revenue growth and stronger profits.

ABS-CBN however said in a statement that the incidents involving ABS-CBN Store (store.abs-cbn.com) and the UAAP Store (uaapstore.com) were isolated and did not affect its other digital properties. The websites were shut down at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  “Personal information and credit card details of our customers may have been exposed.  As of this time, there are 213 customers who may have been affected,” ABS-CBN said in its statement. ABS-CBN, which said it was cooperating with the National Privacy Commission, added that an investigation was underway.  The issue was earlier reported by Willem de Groot, an Amsterdam, Netherlands-based security consultant and researcher. In a September 18, 2018 post on his personal blog, De Groot said criminals have been running the payment skimmer on ABS-CBN’s online store since at least August 16 this year. He said the method, which defeats the security of encrypted connections, allows the perpetrators to intercept the personal and credit card data of customers during the checkout process.  He added that the stolen data was sent to a server registered in Irkutsk, Russia after which these would be presumably sold on the black market. Other big companies that have fallen victim to credit card theft include British Airways and Ticketmaster, he said. ABS-CBN on Wednesday asked its customers to exercise added caution in the meantime. “We have started reaching out to all our affected customers. We also advise our customers not to give out additional personal and financial information to anyone who may be claiming to be an ABS-CBN representative,” ABS-CBN said. It said customers can send their queries to ABS-CBNStore@abs-cbn.com. “We assure our customers that their privacy and the security of their personal data are important to us and we will take measures to prevent this incident from happening again,” ABS-CBN said. /kga"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/16152/filipinos-top-in-online-shopping-research-but-lag-in-purchases","title":"Filipinos top in online shopping research, but lag in purchases","date":"10:57 PM September 04, 2012","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—When it comes to learning more about what they need to buy, Filipinos are among the most active in the Asia-Pacific region in using the Internet for product research and snaring online deals.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—When it comes to learning more about what they need to buy, Filipinos are among the most active in the Asia-Pacific region in using the Internet for product research and snaring online deals. This was the key finding of a recent study conducted by market research firm Nielsen on the influence of digital media on shopping habits.  The Nielsen report found that among consumers who engaged in e-commerce activities, 72 percent of online consumers in the Philippines indicated using the Internet for grocery shopping research over the past month. Of this number, 47 percent did so on a daily basis, comparing favorably against the average 39 percent in the Asia-Pacific region.  “With Internet penetration increasing exponentially in the Philippines, and the growing number of consumers who are turning to the Internet to conduct product research and ensure they are getting the best price or deal, this trend provides an apt environment to convert online researchers to make online purchases,” Nielsen Philippine managing director Stuart Jamieson said in a statement. The study also showed that online Filipino consumers were also the most active in Asia-Pacific to search online for deals.  Sixty-one percent of Filipino consumers have, in fact, done online deal searches during the past month, compared to only 39 percent in the Asia-Pacific. The study exposed the Achilles heel of Filipino online consumers, however, showing that when it comes to online purchase conversion, only 34 percent have made purchases online in the past month compared to 62 percent in the Asia-Pacific and 49 percent globally. “The Internet presents an opportunity for retailers and manufacturers to tap into a broader consumer base and increase engagement levels with consumers,” Jamieson said. “However, clear strategies to build online consumers’ trust and ultimately increase purchase conversion rates need to be ascertained.” At the same time, the Nielsen study noted a gradual evolution in the patterns of Filipino consumers’ behavior as far as online product research was concerned. While non-consumer packaged goods (CPG) such as electronics, clothing and travel reported the highest penetration for digital shopping intentions, the level of influence for CPG-related products was observed to be growing. In fact, Filipinos’ intentions to buy food and beverages via online sources more than doubled from 15 percent to 32 percent in two years, it showed. “Connected devices, such as computers, mobile phones and tablets have become a way of life for many, but shoppers are digitally engaged to varying degrees depending on the products they buy,” Jamieson said. “Marketers need to determine which consumers are embracing digital for their grocery shopping needs so they can focus on the right shoppers with the right digital strategies to improve consumers’ online experience.”  The study showed that 52 percent of Filipino respondents said they planned to purchase a computer, game or software via a connected device in the next three to six months—up from 19 percent two years ago—and again compared to 35 percent in Asia-Pacific. Forty-six percent of Filipinos surveyed indicated they would buy a mobile phone online, compared to 33 percent in the region, making technology categories the key driver of online purchase intention for Filipinos within the next three to six months."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/311398/significant-increase-in-consumer-complaints-vs-online-transactions-reported-in-2020","title":"‘Significant’ increase in consumer complaints on online transactions reported in 2020","date":"12:21 PM November 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — There has been a “significant” increase in the number of consumer complaints related to online transactions in 2020 compared to previous years, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported Monday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — There has been a “significant” increase in the number of consumer complaints related to online transactions in 2020 compared to previous years, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported Monday.

The evolution of technology has given us such convenience that it makes us more efficient in our daily jobs, tasks, and other plans that we have for the day. So in this article, we will be providing you some reasons why you should or should not buy or do your groceries online. Doing online shopping has never been so easy. Many online grocers, like Instacart, appear everywhere to provide solutions to people who need assistance, especially for the family’s home essentials.  Different supermarkets now offer online shopping options given the current situation and provide the utmost convenience in the comfort of their own homes. They are called online grocers. Supermarkets or stand-alone stores that have e-commerce platforms that let their customers do their shopping or groceries online. So what advantage does online grocery or shopping provide for their customers? There’s a lot to mention. Because you can do everything online. Grocery shopping is one on the list when you are a home base tech person doing most of your things online. Here are some great benefits of buying your daily household needs online.   As years passed, many inventions and innovations are being discovered to provide us the best convenience we need in life. From technology to lifestyle, and even food. These all make our day-to-day life a lot easier. And that is why doing groceries and shopping online have been a trend for most of us these days.  Providing ease and comfort on the most tiring chore that we all need to do — grocery shopping. Doing grocery online has been a trend. It has been accepted and done by many because it saves people so much time, money, and the effort of searching for the things you need to buy. Not only that, but it also lets you multitask on different things both at work and at home. All you need to do is go through your phone or laptop, choose the things you need to buy, and have those delivered right to your doorstep. That is the most convenient thing you need, especially now that you also need to consider avoiding crowded places to avoid being infected by the ongoing pandemic.  Not only that, it can give you so much convenience when it comes to picking your grocery items section by section. But it also saves you a lot of gas, parking fees, and less time off traffic as you get used to buying things and delivering those right at your doorstep. You will then appreciate the little things that doing your groceries online will be beneficial for you.Saving gas due to the heavy traffic and the hassle of searching for that perfect parking spot will surely make your day worth it. In addition to that, no more long lines of waiting at the counter to pay for your items bought. With just a click of buy now or add to cart button, you will then know how much time, money, effort, gas, and other resources you have saved doing everything online, plus the convenience of having your grocery delivery for free when you reach a certain amount.  One primary concern of online grocers is the freshness of the food that they are ordering online. It is a crucial factor since we all want our food to be fresh the way it is supposed to be. But, worry not! Because most online grocers already took note of that primary concern and have made a way of providing the utmost freshness your food and you deserve. Some of the food you order online is either packed in a special container or stored in freezing storage before delivering or picking them up in-store, like ice cream. It is called flash freezing. Since orders online are being of prioritization to fulfill customer’s expectations, specific processes are of consideration by groceries and supermarkets to maintain the freshness of the food and goods you order. We have tackled most of the considerable advantages when doing groceries online. Let’s now talk about the cons or the disadvantages you should consider before trying it out or directly clicking everything you want online and adding them to your cart. As it’s not always purely beneficial to grocers, here are some things you need to put in mind.   A tiny problem with buying things online is that you don’t get to pick the specific product you want personally. For example, the box of your favorite cereals doesn’t seem to be in perfect shape or condition when delivered—or picking the newest stock that was on display. There are still issues regarding that. Since you are only selecting items virtually, you never get to feel or touch the product before adding it to your cart, especially if you are a traditionalist grocer and want that sensational feeling and smell of the product before buying. Also, when a particular item is out of stock, you can’t decide directly which items to replace or be as a substitute to the item that is not currently available. Online, you can only see and believe that everything will be the same as how you imagine them to be. Even though this is an issue for online buyers, it is still a best practice to always check the groceries that you buy online upon delivery. And if ever a problem occurs, call out immediately to the store and report any unwanted, deformed, expired products delivered. For sure, they will replace or refund it if possible. Although the benefits of online grocery shopping are for the vast majority, it impacts most local grocers since they are small scale businesses. As supermarkets and big groceries get their supply from large scale food producers. Small scale farmers and food growers are having a hard time competing with their prices, as they have to be somehow on the same page as to how big manufacturers position their products. Local grocers can’t afford to compete with big manufacturers as they only deliver a small number of products to local groceries and supermarkets. These stores then feature products with a high inventory level and can suffice buyers’ growing demand online. Another disadvantage of doing your groceries online is that it can be more expensive. Compared to what you usually pay for when in local groceries, prices can differ depending on the demand, quantity, and many factors.  Even location is also a factor. Because you are doing your buying online, if your option is to have a contactless delivery, specific fees can be of addition to the final amount when you check out. You call this the delivery fee. It is a major factor contributing to how much your final bill will be. Another factor that makes your grocery delivered more expensive has a personal shopper. A personal shopper is the one who will do the shopping for you with a corresponding fee as well. The good thing about this is that most online grocery stores offer free delivery when you reach a certain amount or value. And of course, the location of the delivery will be considered. It is an excellent way of giving more to consumers and letting them try and shop at your store once again. Fear not, there are many ways to save money while shopping for groceries online.  Overall, there is no harm in trying new ways where it will benefit you the most. There may be pros and cons, but you as an individual know what gains and risks you will be having at the end of the day. Times are changing, and so are we. We need to adapt to new habits and technologies that are more convenient in a lot of ways. We need to be ready for the outcome and always be of preparation for changes that are continuously happening around us. Doing online grocery nowadays is the best suggestion to considering that we still have the pandemic going on. Safe practice of social distancing and avoiding crowded places is a must to ensure safety for you and your family. As they call it, this’ new normal brought a whole new light on how we do things from before. And we must learn to adapt and appreciate the value it got us. These changes are now being essential to our daily lives, and it provides us the best comfort that would fit our situation currently. And not until this pandemic is over. We have to constantly find new ways how we can live more conveniently and comfortably."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/199369/lazada-updates-mobile-app-for-enhanced-online-shopping-experience","title":"Lazada updates mobile app for enhanced online shopping experience","date":"04:20 PM September 17, 2015","snippet":"Lazada, the Philippines’ one-stop shopping and selling destination recently launched an updated version of its mobile app.","body":"Lazada, the Philippines’ one-stop shopping and selling destination recently launched an updated version of its mobile app. Available to download for free in AppStore (for iOS users) and Google Play Store (for Android users), the updated Lazada Mobile App is part of Lazada’s continuous effort to encourage more Filipinos to shop online.

Shopback, the leading rewards and discovery platform in Asia-Pacific, expects P11.2 billion in transactions this year, which will also mark its highest since the app launched in the Philippines in 2015.  The success of the app reflects how the e-commerce market grew in the hardest of times, as brick and mortar establishments close in the middle of the pandemic. ShopBack partnered with e-commerce merchants and platforms like Shopee and Lazada. Demand already spiked in the first half of the year, as COVID-19 forced those who can afford to stay at home to just order almost anything online instead.  It saw 9.1 million orders in the first half of the year, an increase of more than 330 percent from the 2.1 million orders in the same period in 2019. This volume puts the Philippines in either the top 3 or 4 spot in the market, according to Shopback, which is present in eight other countries—Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, and South Korea.  In terms of value, these transactions are worth P5.6 billion, also an increase of more than 330 percent from the P1.3 billion worth of transactions in 2019. At a press briefing celebrating the company’s 5th anniversary in the Philippines, Shopback country manager Prashant Kala said he expected both volume and transaction to double at the end of the year. He said he hoped the pandemic “ends as soon as possible but this (e-commerce) trend is just going to go up.” Kala said there are two main reasons for the spike in e-commerce amid the spike in coronavirus infections. “One is convenience and second is the ease of finding more and more products that are there online,” he said.  The price of a product online is the same for users of Shopback, according to the company. It is unlike marketing strategy that marks up prices then offers discounts. On average, the app offers a 6 to 10 percent cash back across a wide range of item categories like food, groceries and general merchandise, Shopback said. Next month, the company said it will launch a feature that will allow users to compare the prices of over 10,000 products, choosing the best possible store with the largest cash back possible. It currently has at least 4 million users here in the Philippines. Along with its other markets, Shopback has a total of more than 20 million users. By the tailend of the year, Shopback expects to give at least P12 million to P13 million in cash back per month, which is more than twice the monthly cash back in the same period last year."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316997/baby-products-fitness-equipment-to-get-a-lot-of-love-in-2021","title":"Baby products, fitness equipment to get a lot of love in 2021","date":"05:02 AM February 05, 2021","snippet":"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, consumers everywhere changed their buying behavior.

In the Philippines, we saw the surge in online shopping, with approximately ​30 percent of Filipinos buying grocery essentials online​. At least half of Filipino consumers are expected to sustain their preference for online shopping once the pandemic is over.  The UP Population Institute and the UN Population Fund estimate a 2021 baby boom with approximately 2.56 million babies born this year. To compete in this space, online sellers should focus on ​essential baby and maternity products, such as items for feeding/breastfeeding and newborn care, as opposed to luxury items. On Shopee, pajama sets, bibs, baby wipes, and reusable diapers are some of the bestselling items in the Babies & Kids category, with thousands of sales a month. Baby cribs are among the most popular products on Lazada. Meanwhile, items related to breastfeeding—ice packs, storage bags, supplements like malunggay tea—are bestsellers on Babymama.ph  If there’s one thing the COVID-19 pandemic taught us, it’s to not skimp on safety measures. We foresee the sustained demand for personal protective equipment, such as masks, face shields, and disinfectants. This year, local travel restrictions are expected to ease up with news of vaccinations on the horizon. With tourist favorites like Boracay and Palawan opening up their borders to local tourists with heightened safety precautions, other destinations are expected to follow suit within the year. As confidence in local travel increases, entrepreneurs can expect a modest rise in demand for travel essentials such as beachwear and other travel accessories.  The explosion of new food sellers during the pandemic says it all—people are spending more time in their kitchens. And this newfound love for home cooking will stay, according to coronavirus consumer behavior research​. Searches for “baking” and “cooking,” as well as related terms, have also soared, ​according to Google Trends​. It is wise to look into selling cooking and baking tools, supplies, and equipment. Search Facebook buy-and-sell groups for cooks and bakers to ​find out what people are looking for​. Check out the most popular food items on Facebook and Instagram and figure out what tools and supplies are needed to make them. Demand for home fitness equipment has ​risen​. Not surprising, as gyms around the country are either closed or open on a limited capacity. Top sales on Shopee and Lazada include yoga mats and jump ropes. But other brands selling large equipment and weights have been thriving as well. Businesses such as Play Hard Fitness started offering delivery services of their multistation home gyms during the quarantine, and have even joined major online sales like 12.12. Sellers can also focus on verticals, especially if it is within their interest. For example, if you’re aiming to become a triathlete, sell apparel, gear and supplements that help triathletes train. Another area to capitalize on is people’s need to be outdoors and escape the city after long months of community quarantine. Case in point: Google searches for “biking” and “cycling” have risen.  Even before COVID-19 broke out, many Filipinos were already working from home (WFH). The Philippines is the world’s ​fastest-growing gig-economy market​, and these freelancers tend to work for overseas clients. WFH is here to stay. So think of items that make it easier. Find the best-value monitors, wireless keyboards, ergonomic chairs, standing desks, lamps and more. It’s crucial to meet buyers where they are. Even if a business has its own e-commerce website, it is still necessary to be present in the platforms where buyers are most comfortable browsing, asking questions, and making purchase decisions. It would be wise to stay up-to-date on the most relevant marketing trends for the coming year. With more consumer-to-consumer transactions and social selling taking place, messaging apps are now an important tool in any e-commerce seller’s arsenal. A ​2019 study commissioned by Facebook​ showed that 66 percent of Filipinos who made purchases through messaging platforms planned to spend more on c-commerce shopping in the future. The Philippines is one of the ​biggest adopters​ of c-commerce in Southeast Asia. No surprise there—​97 percent of internet users in the country use chat apps. But you don’t need the stats to tell you that. You’ve probably observed that your buyers like to ask you questions on Messenger or Viber. Filipinos are looking for more flexible options and discounted prices. To meet this demand, you can hold sales more frequently or at a larger scale. Try creative ways to put your products on sale or offer freebies without suffering a loss. Examples include product bundles, tiered pricing and free shipping for a minimum purchase. Raise your hand if you’re now part of an online barter group or have joined an online community for plantitas or other hobbyists. If groups like these allow sales posts, it’s worth pouring marketing time and effort here, as there’s a high potential for group members to be interested in your products. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Or if you’re looking at something you can manage in the long term, consider setting up your own interest group. TikTok ​took the bored, quarantined world by storm​ in 2020, and it’s not going away anytime soon. Of course, make sure first that your target customers are on TikTok. It’s going to take a lot of time and creativity to get your brand noticed on the platform, so there should be a clear potential return on investment here. But can TikTok actually influence buying decisions? According to this list of “​TikTok-Approved Products You Never Knew You Needed In Your Life,​” yes, it can.5. Weird, experimental ads Could 2021 be the year Filipino businesses dare to make surreal, quirky ads like those viral videos from Japan and Thailand? ​RC Cola’s ad​ may have left you scratching your head, but admit it—​it got people talking.​ And based on social media buzz, it looks like after surviving the weird year that was 2020, people are ready for more of these kinds of bizarre marketing campaigns. Before releasing a video designed to get buzz, make sure you’ve planned your marketing funnel. Where do people go after seeing your video? Provide links to relevant website pages, blog posts, or product listings to increase conversion. Filipinos like it when brands ​address issues​ they care about, ​including COVID-19​, in their marketing campaigns. Millennial customers​, in particular, expect brands to speak out. But ​Gen Z​ takes it a step further, and expects brands and their employees to walk their talk by supporting and contributing to social causes. So be careful not to shoot yourself in the foot. Don’t be woke for the sake of being woke—choose an issue that you truly care about and that you’re capable of supporting. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); On Facebook, videos have ​higher engagement​ among Filipinos compared to other types of posts. If you don’t have a YouTube channel yet, you might consider starting one, if your audience is there. But if you’re planning to hit many social networks—TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook—make sure you don’t get overwhelmed. You can plan out your videos so that every shoot covers material that can be shown on each platform. You could have one video on YouTube, and cut it into different segments and lengths for posting on other platforms. That way, you can hit many birds with one stone. —CONTRIBUTED The author is country head of ​Ninja Van Philippines."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/42006/online-shoppers-warned-against-fraud","title":"Online shoppers warned against fraud","date":"01:39 PM May 01, 2015","snippet":"If the deal sounds too good to be true, it just might be.","body":"If the deal sounds too good to be true, it just might be. Amid the growing popularity of online retail, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has reminded consumers to take extra care in transacting internet purchases, citing incidents of fraud, false advertising and suspicious practices in the still largely unregulated industry.  In an advisory issued this week, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima urged the public to proceed with caution when shopping online, citing the DOJ Office of Cybercrime’s (OOC) “mandate to educate the public and ensure that the near limitless potential of cyberspace is safeguarded from malicious individuals, and from the abusive, fraudulent, or harmful corrupt business practices as well.” “As citizens enjoy the convenience and choice in online shopping platforms, fraud and abuses are happening. These include false advertising and sale of counterfeit goods as forms of deceptive sales practices,” De Lima said in a statement.  “Existing laws to protect consumers apply with equal force to the internet,” she added. READ: Selling goods online? Trust is key  In its Advisory Opinion No. 2, the DOJ-OOC cited how “risks, trade malpractices, and operational challenges exist in online shopping in view of the anonymity being offered by the internet.” “Consumers must remain vigilant and proactive in protecting their welfare rights. Like traditional markets, customers should keep in mind the principle of caveat emptor (buyer beware) in their online dealings. It is highly important to be wary of online fraud to avoid the arduous process and inconvenience of recovering any damage,” read the 12-page advisory released Thursday. The DOJ-OOC said these online dangers include “frauds and scams, misleading or deceptive product advertisements, difficulty in returns and replacements, unexpected customs dues, transaction costs, and surcharges, privacy breaches and abuse of user information, including financial details, and chaotic delivery procedures.” For instance, online offers would advertise product packages that, in reality, feature items sold separately, or promote medical products that purportedly have healing or slimming benefits that “are rarely properly tested and can even be harmful.” Other sites deceptively promote gadgets of “a particular standard, quality, grade, style, or model” when the actual available items are of older versions.  Some say their products are new, “but upon confirmation of the order, the supplier replaces the contents of the brand-new packaging with a refurbished or second-hand model, re-seals it, and then ships it to the unsuspecting customer.” Other sites also show fake discounts on their sites or sell outright knock-offs. For the protection of consumers, the DOJ-OOC said consumers should do a background check of sellers, avoid responding to unsolicited emails from strangers, and take extra care in sharing financial information, especially in unsecure websites. “Don’t believe everything you read. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is false!,” read the advisory. READ: More Filipinos now shopping online The DOJ-OOC recommended that shoppers keep their computer’s security software and firewalls updated and to avoid shopping online using public computers as much as possible. It also advised consumers to use strong passwords for online accounts- preferably containing both letters and numbers- and to change these keys regularly.  All records of online transactions- whether correspondence or digital receipts- must also be kept. The justice department also warned of other “red flags” that could indicate fraudulent sellers, including sites that do not show any contact details, or those that require payment by money transfer or direct bank deposit. The DOJ-OOC encouraged the public to report incidents of online fraud to the appropriate government agency, depending on the product involved: food, drug, cosmetics items and health devices are under the Food and Drug Administration, while agricultural products and goods such as fertilizers and feeds are under the Department of Agriculture’s Agribusiness and Marketing Assistance Office. Complaints against sellers registered at the Department of Trade and Industry or the Securities and Exchange Commission may be reported directly to these agencies. General cases of online fraud may also be reported to the DOJ-OOC, the National Bureau of Investigation’s Cybercrime Division or the Philippine National Police’s Anti-Cybercrime Group."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/136335/defeminizing-retail","title":"Defeminizing retail?","date":"04:04 AM December 22, 2020","snippet":"No doubt about it: The whole world is seeing a very different Christmas this year. There is at least one reason to believe that women may be harder hit on a more permanent basis by all the changes.

There is at least one reason to believe that women may be harder hit on a more permanent basis by all the changes. In the Philippines, with Christmas season starting with the onset of the “ber” starting September, it has been some time now that we’ve felt the difference, especially with sparse crowds in erstwhile teeming shopping malls and restaurants. In December itself, parties with food and gifts galore have given way to usually food-less online gatherings featuring online games, prerecorded entertainment numbers, and whatever else creative minds can muster to fill up the time. But I’ve seen two of such parties include food delivered to the doorstep of the online participants, which somehow helps cushion the huge drop in sales of the usual food establishments. Related to this, what I’ve seen to be much busier than usual are the logistics and delivery services catering to online shopping businesses. This year, SM and the like have been replaced by Shopee and Lazada, and these firm’s names are coming close to being “genericized” to refer to shopping in general. In the case of one such delivery company that comes nearly every day to our family compound, we’re told that many additional motorcycle riders have been hired to service the surge in demand. The “11.11” and “12.12” promos that these dominant e-commerce companies have been mounting have succeeded in tickling the shopping itch in household consumers. I could tell how broad their clientele has become from how my grandchildren’s “yayas” are also frequent recipients of their deliveries, thanks to cash-on-delivery arrangements available in these shopping platforms.  Indeed, Lazada Philippines reported selling more than 2 million items within the first hour of Nov. 11, involving more than 70,000 sellers, of which 14,000 were reportedly first-timers. China-based Alibaba, its parent company, reported record sales of over $56 billion worth of goods within the first 30 minutes of Nov. 11, with orders peaking at 538,000 per second! Alibaba has effectively turned Nov. 11 into the Asian counterpart of Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving Thursday, traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year in America. Meanwhile, Singaporean-owned Shopee similarly reported record sales with its own 11.11 promo, with over 200 million items sold in 24 hours on Nov. 11. In the Philippines, the company reports that products in the Home & Living category topped sales, as Filipino shoppers bought over 1.4 million home decoration items such as wallpapers and window curtains during the Nov. 11 sale day. The marked shift to online retail platforms has important implications for the retail trade industry in the Philippines, which, together with wholesale trade, is actually our top source of jobs. This sector accounts for close to 9 million, or more than one-fifth of total jobs in the country. Recent years had seen malls sprouting like mushrooms all through our regions, but it seems that their owners now have to seriously think of how to repurpose their buildings for other uses under the emerging “new normal.” These alternative uses include warehouses for online retail businesses, which the mall moguls themselves see the inevitability of moving into.  An important implication of the shift from store-based to online-based retail is the likely diminished role women will have in this sector of the economy. While women clearly dominate the existing sales staff of department stores, malls, and even supermarkets, we are now seeing the prominence of logistics and delivery firms providing the “last mile” link to the end-consumers. And here, it is men who almost entirely make up this last mile link. I’ve seen many women driving motorcycles, but I have yet to see a female rider delivering our Shopee or Lazada purchases, and while I’m sure there are women riders out there doing it, they appear to be an exceptional and tiny minority. Given the dominant contribution of retail trade to the total employment of Filipinos, this “defeminization” of retail is one issue that we must be prepared to address.  cielito.habito@gmail.com For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Amy Witt might have 20 customers on a good day in her Dallas women’s clothing store, and then none the next.  “It’s a rollercoaster we ride every day,” says Witt, whose store, Velvet Window, reopened May 1 after being closed since March. “We’re doing everything we can to cover expenses and keep the store stocked with inventory.” Many of Witt’s older customers are still shy about going into stores, especially since the virus has resurged in Texas. As she reopened the store in May, Witt told The Associated Press she planned to use services like private shopping hours to encourage reluctant customers to come in. The strategy has helped but sales remain well below Witt’s expectations. She hopes to boost sales by selling at an outdoor market where shoppers can feel more comfortable.  Still, Witt is grateful to be open — there are empty stores in the shopping center where Velvet Window is located. Small retailers, especially those selling non-necessities like apparel, are still struggling months after state and local governments lifted shutdown orders aimed at containing the virus. With the virus far from under control in many areas, however, consumers worried about getting sick are staying home and doing their purchasing online or, if they venture out, going to big stores like Walmart and Target where they can do one-stop shopping.  The weak sales and erratic customer traffic have forced store owners to be creative in hopes of persuading customers to stop in rather than order from a big online retailer. But for some owners, disappointing sales and an uncertain outlook have forced them to close their stores for good and stake the future of their businesses on the internet. Washington was one of the first epicenters of the virus, and one of the first states to shut down its economy. Ambika Singh felt the impact immediately: Her company, Armoire, rents clothing to professional women. Her customers, suddenly stuck at home, no longer needed outfits for the office, dinners and business trips. Singh has permanently closed her two stores in Seattle, knowing they couldn’t be sustained. She’s adapted her online business to meet customers’ rapidly changing needs — they wanted different clothes, like luxury loungewear or more dress shirts to look business-like on videoconferences even as they wore sweatpants Having lost customers due to the weakened economy, Armoire’s revenue is down about 35% from February, which was its best month ever. One of Singh’s biggest challenges now is marketing to new customers as she tries to replace the shoppers who left. “As we’ve lost the physical connection with customers, can we rebuild?” she says.  The internet has been a refuge for many retailers during the pandemic, says Carlos Castelan, managing director of The Navio Group, a retail consultancy based in Minneapolis. He noted that Shopify, a company that hosts e-commerce websites, had a 71% increase in new stores in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. “They’re urgently setting up these e-commerce models to serve their customers,” he says. The most recent retail sales tallies from the government show sales at clothing sellers, which tend to have physical locations, fell nearly 36% from May through July. But online and other non-traditional retailers saw their sales soar 26%. Small retailers have also learned to be more customer-friendly. They’re using, for example, texts to communicate with shoppers and making pickups easier by setting aside dedicated parking spaces so people can grab and go, Castelan says. And stores are letting shoppers know they are trying to keep everyone safe. “The primary driver has been as much about convenience and safety. That’s more the story rather than merchandising,” he says. The internet has been a lifeline for Antonelli’s Cheese Shop. The Austin, Texas, store remained open during the government-ordered shutdown, but many consumers stayed home, sharply reducing store traffic. The shop also sells to restaurants, which stopped ordering as they were forced to close. The shop’s business is still down 20%. Owners John and Kendall Antonelli say they’ve managed to survive by taking the events they normally run on their premises, like cheese tastings, and putting them online. They’ve had as many as 150 people take part in a tasting, with many people ordering cheese in advance and picking it up curbside. More recently, with fewer people sheltering at home, they’ve been more likely to get 50 people, but that is still about double the number of attendees they had pre-pandemic. The Antonellis revamped their website so local customers can order a la carte instead of pre-selected packages — that’s more expensive for the store, but it keeps people happy and shopping. The Antonellis have learned that several cheese shops in other cities have gone out of business, so they know they too could be at risk. “We are potentially considered one of the success stories — and what I mean by that is we’re still operating,” Kendall Antonelli says. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Business has been slow since Mallory Shelter’s Washington, D.C., jewelry store reopened in June. Shelter, whose store bears her name, responded to the pandemic and shutdown by pouring her marketing efforts into her website. It now accounts for 75% of her revenue, up from 8% before the virus struck, but her overall revenue is down by half. She also has changed her product mix, focusing more on custom items that can have a more personal meaning for buyers. A big question is whether her in-store business will recover in time for the holiday season that starts three months from now. “This is the month when I’m preparing for the holidays. But that looks really hard when you don’t know if you’re going to be open, if there’s going to be another wave of the virus or what people’s spending will be like,” Shelter says."},{"url":"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/272031/glydel-mercado-brainiacs-online-shopping","title":"Glydel Mercado warns buyers about ‘scam’ online shopping site","date":"07:42 PM April 28, 2018","snippet":"A fuming Glydel Mercado took to Facebook over a problematic online shopping transaction, which according to her was a “big scam.”","body":"A fuming Glydel Mercado took to Facebook over a problematic online shopping transaction, which according to her was a “big scam.” She identified the online buying site’s name as “Brainiacs.”  According to the actress, she bought a projector – using her credit card – last January, but it has not been delivered until now. “I keep updating them thru my email and even gave me a tracking number but they keep sending an automated answer and I messaged them again last week and now they’re not answering my messages.

Inanc Balci, co-founder and chief executive officer of Lazada Philippines, said the Cebu hub will serve customers in the Visayas. It is Lazada’s second logistics center, after the facility in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. A third hub will be opened in Davao next year to serve clients in Mindanao. “The biggest challenge (of online shopping business) is in logistics. The Philippines has a very complex geography with more than 7,000 islands. There are a lot of hard-to-reach islands and it’s expensive to deliver in the Philippines,” he said during the official blessing and inauguration yesterday of the facility located in Mandaue City. Balci said having a logistics hub in Cebu will expedite the delivery of their services. Lazada has 20 motorcycles and trucks for its delivery services. Initially, Lazada has partnered with cargo forwarder LBC. Other third-party logistics companies are also expected to partner with Lazada. The company’s in-house shipping service, Lazada Express, will also be operating from the new hub. “We are very optimistic about the success of the hub since e-shopping has increased drastically,” said Balci. Online shopping currently contributes one percent to total sales in the country, but Balci said this is expected to increase as more consumers turn to online e-commerce sites for convenience and easier access. He also noted that more and more merchants are setting up online shops as either primary or secondary avenues for revenue. Nearly 10,000 local merchants are using the Lazada platform, he said. Of these, only a few are based in Cebu. Lazada boasts of being the only e-commerce company that accepts cash on delivery.

Some of our dealers do that too… the important thing is to check if the product being sold is licensed or not,”Joven Ong, president of the Firecrackers Association of the Philippines, said in an interview.  Ong said dealers have partnered with online shopping stores for the distribution of their products. Lea Alapide, president of Philippine Pyrotechnic Manufacturers and Dealers Association Inc. (PPMDAI), said that pyrotechnic devices have been available online since last year, adding that dealers have turned to online shopping platforms to boost sales.  Alapide said online purchases also gave buyers the comfort of getting products delivered at their doorsteps, saving them the time to travel to this town. Known as the fireworks capital of the country, Bocaue is home to more than 70 stores and dealers licensed to distribute or sell pyrotechnic products.  “Online selling is the trend now. If everything can be purchased from online shops, why can’t we offer our products in these platforms?”Alapide said. Some pyrotechnic devices that can be bought online are “luces” (sparklers), such as roman candles and fountains, which cost between P30 and P150 per box. Also offered online are aerial fireworks sold between P250 to P1,500 per box. The Philippine National Police says it allows online selling of pyrotechnics, as this does not violate Republic Act No. 7183 or the fireworks law. Lt. Col. Lorenzo Kim Cobre, acting chief of the PNP’s Explosive Management Division of the Firearms and Explosives Office, said online companies were allowed to transport a maximum of 1 ton of pyrotechnic products. But fireworks manufacturers cautioned against online shopping for “bangers”or firecrackers such as “kuwitis,” “five star” and “sawa,”as well as unlicensed products that may explode when mishandled.  In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order No. 28 limiting the use of firecrackers to fireworks displays, citing as basis the prevalence of firecracker-related injuries every year. Two more cases of fireworks-related injuries were reported to the Department of Health, two days before Christmas.—With a report from Tina G.

If you spend most of your time at work or with your family, online shopping is probably your best friend. Luckily, there are IG accounts and sites that sell thrifted clothes. But why would you choose this option? First, since these are preloved items, the price is relatively cheaper. Second, vintage clothes just have so much more charm than new clothes, in my opinion. I personally enjoy shopping at these sites, here’s a list of the ones I visit frequently.  Denuo is one of my sites to check out vintage and reclaimed items. I say items because they don’t just sell clothes. They also have accessories like bags and even stuff for your home like vases and decor. They are in the middle of updating their site so not all of their sections are filled but they usually have a lot of unique pieces. They are also very thorough when it comes to listing down all of the details of each piece.  If your style is more feminine, check out this account on Instagram. There is a mix of flowy dresses, tops, and skirts. The most dominant pieces of clothing, however, are blazers and other outerwear. The styles and designs of the blazers she find is so different from what you see in stores now. They have interesting cuts, colors, and patterns. Her next collection will be up on Sunday, so watch out for that.  Scave posts a variety of clothes from track pants to co-ord sets, and jackets. What makes this account different, is the way the pieces are presented. Each piece of clothing is presented with a full styled outfit against a plain backdrop. That way, you get to see how the clothes look like when worn. There are also additional detail shots.  There is just something about vintage jewelry that puts a smile on my face. The designs and materials used have a certain level of charm that I just adore. Personally, I wouldn’t even know where to start looking for these pieces, but I found an account on Instagram that offers just that. Look through their collection of ‘80s clip-on earrings, Japanese earrings, and necklaces.  For more eclectic options, visit Wildflower Finds on Instagram. Every time a new collection is posted, I want to buy pretty much everything. I especially appreciate the heavily printed pieces. I live for them. Another special thing they have? Vintage Filipiniana clothes.  Have you ever wanted to go thrift shopping in Japan? It is a dream but not everyone has access. Mellon Collie makes that easier for those living in the Philippines. It is “an assortment of vintage finds from Japan, personally hand-picked from various shops in Nagoya,” where the seller lives “and locally distributed in [the] Philippines for your convenience.” These range from shoes, outerwear, tops, and dresses.
