Passengers of GrabCar, GrabCar+, and GrabHeli now have the option to pay with their credit or debit cards through GrabPay. \"Now that we’ve established the brand, we want to be able to reach out to the credit card users and make the app accessible to virtually anyone with a smartphone,\" Khriztina Lim, country head of Marketing for GrabTaxi Philippines, told reporters on the sidelines of a launch in Pasay City. To register, GrabTaxi passengers need to enter their credit or debit card details in the payment section of the settings, wait for approval, and when they book rides, they will be able to select the newest payment option.  GrabPay will be rolled out to all GrabCar, GrabCar+ and GrabHeli partner vehicles starting Tuesday. GrabTaxi partners with PhilJets GrabTaxi also formally introduced on Tuesday its exclusive partnership with PhilJets for its pre-booking chopper service GrabHeli. GrabHeli, a pre-booking helicopter service, is the ride-hailing app's latest innovation, which is in its beta stage and will be tested for 3 months. PhilJets, meanwhile, is providing helicopters and jets charter, not only in the Philippines but throughout the entire ASEAN region. \"We're very happy to partner with GrabTaxi Philippines. In the 2 years they’ve been in the country, they’ve proven that they’re a formidable company to be associated with and this partnership promises a ride to remember,\" PhilJets Group CEO Thierry Tea said during the media launch. \"GrabTaxi has been in the Philippines for a few years now and we’re launching GrabHeli as a way to thank the passengers who have always supported us and stood as witnesses to our growth,\" Tea said. For P3,888 ($82.57) per person, passengers registered with GrabPay can fly around Manila in an aerial tour of Makati City, Bonifacio Global City, and Pasay City.  GrabCar promo codes will be given to GrabHeli passengers to take them to or from PhilJets’ helipad at the Manila Domestic Airport.  \"Through our partnership with PhilJets, we’ve made it possible to just buy a minimum of one seat on a helicopter and you’re good to go with GrabHeli,\" GrabTaxi Philippines’ Lim said.

Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said Grab, as the \"surviving\" company after buying Uber, has no right to charge consumers higher fares. \"There should be no room for predatory pricing by a firm allowed to engage in public service. Being the surviving entity does not authorize Grab to grab more profits,\" Poe said in a statement. She added that the government should find a middle ground, saying regulatory agencies should both protect the riding public from exorbitant fees and Grab drivers from low income despite hard work. \"I am hopeful that through dialogue and open channels of communication, all the stakeholders can strike a balance that will not hurt the pocket of Grab's riders but will not leave Grab's drivers empty-handed either.... 'Yung tamang presyo at serbisyo na masaya ang lahat (The right price and service so everyone is happy),\" she said. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, for his part, said government regulators, such as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), should probe the cost structure of ride-hailing services. \"Dito papasok ang close monitoring ng LTFRB and PCC sa anti-competitive practices (This is where the LTFRB and the PCC's close monitoring of anti-competitive practices comes in).... They should also establish benchmarks that are internationally accepted to detect potential abuses of a monopoly,\" Gatchalian said. He called on the LTFRB to require Grab to provide a breakdown of charges in its receipts for transparency. \"Dapat i-review ng LTFRB ang lahat ng fees at charges na pinapatong sa commuters.

Grab's newest service, GrabShare, aims to do something about that","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Long, winding lines at the MRT station; suffocatingly packed buses and vans; the numbingly slow crawl of EDSA traffic — this is just a glimpse into a day in the life of a Metro Manila commuter. To say the traffic situation in the Philippines is bad would be an understatement. According to a Ford survey published in several major news sites, 30% of Filipinos consider commuting the worst part of their day. And it’s largely because of the current state of available public transportation options: crowded, uncomfortable, and inconvenient.   But as much as Filipinos hate it, there’s no avoiding it. Everyone still needs to go to work, visit their families, have dinner and drinks with friends. So what’s a commuter to do?  Companies are now coming up with new ride-sharing options that aim to change the way Filipinos look at getting from point A to point B.  A new way to commute In a media launch help last February 16 at The Brewery in BGC, Grab introduced GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial ride-sharing service in the Philippines. With GrabShare, commuters can expect to share their ride with only 1 other passenger for up to 30% cheaper fares than GrabCar (Sedan). GrabShare allows a maximum of only one additional detour per ride, to make sure that the passengers’ time and money are not wasted. The new service will introduce cheaper fares for passengers and more income for drivers by allowing them to complete two bookings in one trip.  GrabShare works by using a \"matching algorithm\" to help passengers get to their destinations in the shortest time possible. The algorithm factors in the closest available drivers, travel time, overlap of trip routes, detour distance, and current traffic conditions before sequencing pick-ups and drop-offs so commuters can experience the most efficient and practical rides.  Grab claims that Filipinos who are used to sharing seats in cramped vehicles now have a more comfortable and convenient option for getting around. Perks for both passengers and drivers GrabShare was first launched in Singapore in December 2016, and was considered a huge success. In 2 months, 2 million GrabShare rides were completed, covering a total distance of about 20 million kilometers. Since more passengers have been choosing GrabShare, Grab has improved their passenger matching rate by 15%, and with it, increases Grab drivers’ monthly incomes by 10%.  So in addition to providing Filipinos with a better option for ride-sharing, GrabShare also helps their drivers increase their potential earnings. While the traffic situation in Metro Manila still leaves much to be desired, at least now Filipinos are not limited to their usual commuting options. And ride-sharing doesn’t necessarily have to be associated with sweaty lines and cramped seating arrangements anymore. As people and technology evolve, so can the future of our commute. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/metro-manila-adventure-better-everyday-video","title":"What's your Metro Manila adventure?","date":"Jan 28, 2019 11:32 AM PHT","snippet":"Here's how Grab's working to make each in-city adventure better than the next","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Metro Manila is just the place for new experiences.

In a regional launch in Singapore on Thursday, January 28, GrabTaxi rebranded itself as Grab to reflect its new range of services. Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012. (READ: GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli) The new Grab encompasses all its services: taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycles (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch), and last mile delivery (GrabExpress), under one umbrella brand.  \"We've grown over the years – and we're now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers,\" Grab Group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said during the regional launch. Dominance in Southeast Asia Since its establishment in 2012, Grab has evolved from a taxi-booking application to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company. Grab now has over 200,000 drivers and more than 11 million mobile downloads. (READ: Could this be GrabBike's last ride in the Philippines?) The company's data show that in mid-2015, it experienced 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region. These figures are encouraging as Grab aims to move far ahead of other ride-hailing companies like Uber. (READ: Uber plans APEC region expansion despite rough ride) \"We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,\" Tan said. Grab's CEO said his company will \"grow from the current 28 cities across 6 Southeast Asian countries,\" but did not specify where. \"What I can say is we are focusing all our energy in providing better transport services in the region,\" Tan said. Grab's regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, \"Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.\" Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.  On a 'friendlier' road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab's rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a \"more open and collaborative working environment\" with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. \"We're not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It's not all about profit,\" Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to \"provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,\" Goh added. According to Goh, Grab's end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-suspend-carpool-service-coronavirus-starting-march-13-2020","title":"Coronavirus prompts suspension of GrabShare starting March 13","date":"Mar 12, 2020 1:32 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines says GrabShare will resume once the 'public health situation de-escalates'","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines announced that the carpool service GrabShare will be suspended starting Friday, March 13, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases spiked. \"Grab will be suspending its GrabShare services in Metro Manila and Cebu starting March 13, 12 noon, and will resume as soon as the public health situation de-escalates,\" Grab said in a statement sent to reporters on Thursday, March 12.

Part 1: Notes of caution on Duterte’s preferred constitutional overhaul Is a no-election scenario possible in May 2019?  This no-el scenario comes from the House of Representatives itself. It is the foundation of House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) Number 9, which was passed last January 16. It is in the report of subcommittee 1 of the committee on constitutional amendments that the no-election scenario of May 2019 is assumed.    On the other hand, the direct declaration that there will be no election for May 2019 comes mainly from public pronouncements by members of the Lower House led by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez. The initial game plan is to have a new federal constitution approved during the barangay elections in May 2018. However, this timetable expired even before it started because the Senate did not want to cha-cha if Congress, convened as a constituent assembly, is to vote jointly and not separately.  What are the implications of a no-election scenario in May 2019? There are many, but I list only two of the most important. First, this power grab is damaging to democracy since Filipino voters will be deprived for one legislative term their fundamental democratic right to vote their representatives in the legislative branch, voting being the most important political exercise that helps qualify a political system as minimally democratic. Legislators, on the other hand, will undermine their electoral mandate from the public as they are going to occupy office beyond the terms they were voted for. Both the mandate-deprived Lower House and the Senate will also find their institutions even weaker than they are now vis-à-vis the already powerful Philippine president, who enjoys a robust electoral mandate that is still good for the next half of his term.  Second, it is injurious to the charter change campaign itself, because it would be exposed as primarily a power grab of self-interested, shameless, and power-hungry legislators, who exploit charter change both as a smokescreen and as an excuse to extend themselves in power.   Changing rules to allow re-election Suspending elections involves a shameless power grab of changing the rules to avoid elections. However, the question, “If we were to change the Constitution, would incumbent elective officials who have otherwise reached their term limits be allowed to run in the next elections as if they were running for their first terms?” involves a more sophisticated power grab of changing the rules to allow for re-election.   Suspension of elections is about a garapal (brazen) power grab; changing the rules to allow for re-election is a more suwabe (sleek) power grab. But this latter power grab can be more dangerous than the former. This is because, come year 2022, this question will involve the incumbent president himself.  On this re-election question, not only the report of the committee on constitutional amendments of HCR 9 gets implicated but also the proposed federal constitutions of representatives Eugene de Vera and Aurelio Gonzales Jr (Resolution of Both Houses Number 8) and of the PDP-Laban. Because they introduce a new constitution without a provision banning the incumbent president, they must all answer the question whether their new constitution allows the incumbent president of the old constitution – who is barred from running again under the old constitution – to run under the new constitution.  One of the Senate's resource persons in a previous hearing complained that critics keep on seeing “monsters when there are none,” arguing that there is no term extension for the current president in the PDP-Laban constitution. What he fails to see is the monster he is riding on. Anytime a new constitution is introduced in a presidential democracy with existing term limits, the question of term extension of the incumbent president becomes a central concern.  This is not based on the “fear of the new” but on knowledge of previous constitutional episodes involving elected strongmen who tried to skirt terms limits of their democracies by coming up with a new constitution. Alberto Fujimori did it in Peru in 1993 with his new constitution that ended the single-term limit for president of the 1979 Constitution. Hugo Chavez did it in Venezuela in 1999 with his new constitution that ended the 10-year waiting period for a president to run again under the 1961 Constitution. Ferdinand Marcos tried to do it in 1971-1972 to override the 8-consecutive-year term limit rule of the 1935 Constitution through a constitutional convention to write a new constitution. But Marcos failed, forcing him to fall back on plan B, which was to declare martial law and terminate Philippine democracy altogether. Changing constitutions is a classic strategy of autocratic leaders elected in democracies but who later undermined their own democracies.  This concern on presidential re-election becomes even more serious because the institutional design of the transitory provisions of both HCR no. 9 and RBH no. 8 gives the incumbent president mind-boggling powers, such that the president becomes a one-man hyper executive-legislative package. The powers of the president are almost revolutionary.  For example, the report of subcommittee 1 of the committee on constitutional amendments of HCR 9 says: “The incumbent President shall exercise all the powers and functions of the head of state and head of government under this Federal Constitution until the election of the next President and Prime Minister in May 2022. He shall appoint the new Cabinet from among the Members of Parliament. He shall have supervision and direction over the interim Prime Minister and Cabinet.”  With all these immense powers, and since the new constitution does not bar him to run, he would therefore be in a perfect position to run in 2022, giving him an unbelievable head start over any opposition in the next presidential elections.  Hence, on this issue, the institutional challenge to protect your democracy is to ban the incumbent president – who is covered by the constitutional ban on re-election under the 1987 Constitution – from running as president under the new proposed federal constitutions. Since federalism is being sold by most Filipino proponents as supposedly fulfilling the need for sweeping institutional changes to improve our democracy, I challenge all the proponents of federalism from the PDP-Laban to members of the House of Representatives and of the consultative committee formed by President Duterte to put their institutional design where their mouth is: write down a provision banning the incumbent president to allay the valid fears of many Filipinos that this shift to federalism is part of the same script of the current president and his key allies to remain in power beyond his constitutionally mandated term limit under the 1987 Constitution.  The statement of President Duterte that he will step down in 2022 even if a federal constitution is passed is as good as his campaign promise to ride a jet ski to the Spratlys, a promise which he now teases his own supporters for believing. To make sure that in 2022 he does not tease the country for believing him in 2018 that he will step down once his term ends under the 1987 Constitution and not run again for president, institutionalize his promise to step down by constitutionally barring him to run in your proposed federal constitutions.

(Grab PH) after finding deficiencies in complying with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA) for three personal data processing systems, which may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.\" The systems: Grab earlier installed passenger verification via selfie as a security measure. If a passenger is unable to take a selfie, their identity may be verified by adding a credit/debit card. On January 13, Grab rolled out in-car audio and video recording as a measure to assist in incident prevention and dispute resolution. The pilot program was meant to run for 2 to 6 weeks with over 180 GrabCar vehicles, half of which are equipped with in-car cameras and half with audio-recording systems. According to Grab, passengers who booked cars involved in this pilot test would be notified in advance through GrabChat, and could opt to cancel the booking without penalty. The audio and video recordings would be encrypted and stored in Grab's database for 7 days and 10 hours, respectively, only accessible by authorized Grab representatives in the event of an incident needing investigation.   Early reactions: On January 12, Grab user Ana Sanchez posted on Facebook that the GrabCar she was riding was equipped with audio recording, even without her explicit consent. She only noticed the sign 5 minutes into the ride.  \"I did not stop the car midway, I just kept [quiet], in general, throughout the ride because I was uncomfortable at the thought of being recorded,\" she told Rappler. Sanchez reported her experience to the NPC for further investigation. According to Grab, no recording happened in this case since the pilot program started on January 13, and that the driver made the mistake of putting up the notice ahead of the pilot.  On January 14, the NPC announced that it had called on Grab to address the privacy concerns relating to the launch of their in-car audio and video recording systems. It issued a Notice of Deficiencies to Grab on January 31 after it \"found several deficiencies\" in the 3 systems. The deficiencies:  The NPC said on Wednesday that Grab \"did not sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by these systems on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.\" \"Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account” in its Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), the NPC said. The NPC notice also said that \"the video recording system will also enable Grab employees to monitor the situation live from the Grab Office and take photos of what is happening inside the vehicle, once the driver prompts the office through an emergency button.\" The NPC noted that the public was not informed about the collection and release mechanisms of the 3 systems – that these would be released upon request to police authorities in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint – through Grab's privacy notice and privacy policy. The NPC noted that Grab \"also failed to mention its legal basis in processing the collected data.\" \"The documents submitted to the NPC were also found to be insufficient to establish whether the company’s data processing was proportional to its intended purpose; whether the benefits of the processing outweigh the risks involved; nor whether the processing was the best among considered alternatives to achieve the underlying purpose,\" it said. Moreover, the NPC found that the option to withdraw consent was not sufficiently communicated to passengers through GrabChat. \"It was also unclear if and hor data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,\" the NPC added. What happens next: Grab is required to comply with remedial measures within 15 days, as directed by the NPC. The suspension of the systems would be in place until the company addresses the deficiencies. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grabplatform-opens-grab-to-developers","title":"GrabPlatform opens Grab to third-party app developers","date":"Jul 10, 2018 5:41 PM PHT","snippet":"The suite of APIs known as GrabPlatform gives Grab’s partners access to the platform’s user base and services","body":"SINGAPORE – Grab, at a media event held in their headquarters in Singapore on July 10, said it was opening its platform to micro-entrepreneur partners. Called GrabPlatform, this suite of APIs (Application Programming Interface) allows partners to tap into Grab’s user base as their market. On top of this, it gives them access to components of Grab’s services including transport, logistics, payments, user authentication, messaging, insights, and mapping. “Combining Grab’s assets with the specialised expertise of our partners will enable both Grab and our partners to grow most efficiently and quickly to serve more Southeast Asian customers daily,” Anthony Tan, Group CEO and Co-founder of Grab said. Partners have 3 options on how they wish to integrate their services into the platform. The first is to build into GrabPlatform – directly integrating the services into the Grab app. Second, they can \"empower\" their apps with GrabPlatform, enabling partners to link Grab’s services with theirs. This is similar to how Lazada and Shopee allow products bought from their site to be delivered via GrabExpress. Lastly, they can engage prospective customers through GrabPlatform by advertising their products and services in the app's news feed, as well as adding promotions for GrabRewards. With regards to selecting their partners, Grab said that they are first and foremost looking for those who provide everyday services that the platform’s users need. They are also working to ensure no two partners will offer the same service under the platform. Finally, they said that partners should provide income opportunities for the 100 million micro-entrepreneurs already part of Grab’s network. In the same event, Grab launched GrabFresh, an in-app service that lets users shop for and have their groceries delivered right to their homes. The service is a product of GrabPlatform involving the partnership between Grab and popular online grocery platform, HappyFresh. GrabFresh is currently only available in select countries but the Philippines will have a similar service in partnership with a local counterpart. (READ: GrabFood now on soft launch in the Philippines) Meanwhile Jerald Singh, Grab's head of product, assured users that their personal information is safe because the partners will be forced to abide by Grab’s pre-existing standards and guidelines on data privacy when they integrate into their ecosystem. “Any time we build a platform, this is the first thing we consider,” he added. GrabPlatform has already launched in countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Grab said it should be rolling out in the Philippines sometime next year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-2-pesos-per-minute-charge-remains-suspended","title":"Grab's P2-per-minute charge remains suspended","date":"Jun 26, 2018 12:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines says it would comply with the LTFRB order but hopes that the suspension would be lifted soon","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Tuesday, June 26, that the controversial P2-per-minute travel charge of Grab Philippines remains suspended. During the 3rd hearing on the issue on Tuesday, LTFRB said that the charge will remain suspended pending the resolution of questions on its legal basis. \"The decision on the suspension and the resolution will be resolved as one,\" LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III told Grab Philippines. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge, which the LTFRB was not informed about, was suspended in April. The ride-hailing company appealed the suspension, saying that the order is \"contrary to the law\" and would \"cause irreparable damage\" to riders and drivers. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said.  Grab Philippines said it would comply with LTFRB's order but hopes that the suspension would be lifted soon. \"We hope to get some resolution very soon, matagal nang naghihintay ang mga drivers para dito (the drivers have been waiting for this for some time). At least, they can perform better and serve the public better,\" Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales told reporters in a media interview. \"The impact is not really with Grab but with the drivers. We have to also take other factors – oil price hike, inflation – which contributes to the drivers earning less. The P2 per minute charge is the equalizing factor,\" Gonzales added. Grab also said that some drivers stopped driving for the ride-hailing company, citing lesser income to sustain their families. Gonzales said that only around 30,000 drivers are available for over 600,000 bookings daily, and called on the LTFRB to accept new transportation vehicle network services (TNVS) drivers. (READ: Brian Cu: Grab driver cancellations down by 50%) The next hearing on the alleged illegal charge is set on July 25.

The LTFRB regulated ride-hailing company's surge pricing to at most two times the fare in December 2016. On April 11, the LTFRB lowered Grab's surge pricing cap to 1.5 times the fare since consumers were left with only Grab as their option for ride-hailing services, given the latter's acquisition of Uber. The LTFRB earlier ordered the ride-hailing company to suspend its P2-per-minute travel duration charges, but it appealed the order Friday morning.  Grab's travel duration charge is the subject of an LTFRB hearing, after PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused the company of illegally charging its customers of P2-per-minute for their rides.  (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?)

But to do this, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will have to lift its moratorium on applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said that his company has already lobbied the LTFRB to lift its application suspensions for TNVS, a transport category for application-based four-wheeled vehicles. The lifting of LTFRB's moratorium is needed before Grab can expand its GrabCar services to Davao, Iloilo, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. (READ: GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion) \"As much as we would like to expand to all these cities, there is still a franchise suspension by LTFRB,\" Cu said on the sidelines of an event in Taguig City on Thursday, February 16. Grab currently has its GrabCar service in Metro Manila, Cebu, and Bacolod. \"We have lobbied [to the LTFRB]. Just very recently. So right now, nothing is happening yet. I think they are waiting for the omnibus franchise policy. Right now, it is just a memorandum circular,\" Cu said. It was in July 2016 when LTFRB suspended applications for TNVS due to the surge of applicants and the review of their fare scheme. Still double-digit growth Cu said when it comes to profit, Grab Philippines \"expects double-digit revenue growth in 2016.\" This is despite the \"stunted expansion\" due to the LTFRB moratorium. \"In 2016, demand was still strong. Up to now, we are still continuing to see demand. We believe we solve a present need that is why we are working with the legislation,\" Grab Philippines' country head said. Grab on Thursday, February 16, announced the regional launch of GrabShare, the company's first on-demand commercial carpooling service, with its introduction in the Philippines and Malaysia. In exchange for sharing their ride, passengers enjoy cheaper fares and a maximum of only one additional detour. Meanwhile, drivers earn more by completing two bookings in one trip. To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh had earlier said her company was taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab's rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh had said they are leaning towards a \"more open and collaborative working environment\" with regulators. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/grabhitch-nebeng-motor-searah","title":"Grab luncurkan GrabHitch, layanan nebeng pengguna motor","date":"Oct 20, 2016 11:52 AM PHT","snippet":"Dengan GrabHitch, Anda bisa 'nebeng' pengguna motor yang searah dan menghasilkan uang","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Perusahaan pengembang aplikasi pemesanan kendaraan secara online, Grab, meluncurkan fitur baru yang diberi nama GrabHitch, pada Rabu, 19 Oktober. Fitur GrabHitch, atau \"Nebeng”, merupakan layanan berbagi kendaraan roda dua untuk masyarakat di wilayah Jakarta dan sekitarnya. \"Kami melihat ada peluang untuk mengurangi jumlah kendaraan pribadi yang melintas di Jakarta, makanya kami keluarkan layanan GrabHitch, yakni orang lain dapat nebeng dengan seseorang yang memiliki rute pergi atau pulang yang sama,\" kata Managing Director Grab Indonesia Ridzki Kramadibrata saat peluncuran GrabHitch di Jakarta, Rabu.  Caranya? Menurut Ridzki, masyarakat yang akan menggunakan GrabHitch hanya perlu mengisi rute dan jadwal perjalanan dalam aplikasi Grab, untuk kemudian dicocokan dengan jadwal pengemudi, yang akan pergi ke arah sama. \"Pengemudi yang memiliki tujuan sama dengan Anda akan menjemput, sehingga yang digunakan hanya satu motor. Ini akan mengurangi jumlah pemakaian kendaraan pribadi,\" ujarnya. Berapa tarifnya? Ridzki menyebutkan layanan khusus untuk jarak jauh tersebut akan membuat biaya perjalanan harian penggunanya menjadi lebih efisien karena pada 15 kilometer pertama dikenakan sebesar Rp20.000 dan tarif dasar kilometer selanjutnya hanya sebesar Rp1.000. Apa bedanya dengan GrabBike? \"Yang uniknya lagi, GrabHitch dapat dipesan sejak tujuh hari sebelum perjalanan. Jadi Grabhitch ini memang berbeda dengan produk kami sebelumnya, GrabBike,\" ungkapnya. Sedangkan GrabBike adalah layanan antar jemput penumpang dengan pengendara layaknya ojek online pada umumnya. Siapa target pengguna GrabHitch? Menurut Ridzki, berdasarkan data Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) Provinsi DKI Jakarta pada 2014, sebanyak 56,83% dari 1,38 juta orang melakukan perjalanan sehari-hari dengan kendaraan roda dua pribadi dari wilayah pinggiran ibu kota, di antaranya Bekasi, Depok, dan Tanggerang.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said in a statement on Friday, March 4, that it supports the Department of Transportation and Communications’ (DOTC) position prohibiting the use of motorcycles or bikes as a mode for public transport. In a letter reply to Grab Philippines by the DOTC dated February 26, it said that motorcycles and bikes are not considered as public transport due to safety reasons.  \"It is not also line with the Department’s policy of shifting to higher capacity public transport system especially in dense urban areas,” DOTC’s reply read. DOTC said in the letter that although Grab Philippines presented the safety and security features they are adopting in relation to their request, bike riders are still the most vulnerable road users on national streets. Fatality rate LTFRB cited a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority’s (MMDA) Metro Manila Accident Recording and Analysis System database, stating that motorcycles have the highest fatality accident rate in Metro Manila from January to November 2015.  Out of the 696 road fatalities recorded in that period, 236 were due to motorcycle accidents, LTFRB said.  It was just in November 2015 when Grab decided to pilot its motorcycle service called GrabBike in Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. Just two months after, GrabBike faced resistance from the government. (WATCH: Road-testing the GrabBike) Last January 27, LTFRB ordered GrabBike to cease operations until the regulator has promulgated guidelines to authorize the service. \"Our main objective is to provide the commuters safe, reliable and convenient transport system; recognizing motorcycles as ‘for hire service’ or a form of public transport doesn’t fit into the policy framework of the Department,\" LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said. LTFRB said the agency and DOTC have been introducing ways to solve congestion by reducing vehicles on the road.  One solution LTFRB said it has been doing is the launching of premier point-to-point bus services that can be availed by all commuters. \"The Board remains firm in exercising our authority to regulate land-based public transportation, we will not tolerate transport operators to provide transport service using motorcycles or bikes until we have set the proper guidelines and regulations,\" Ginez said. To date, there is no department order that covers the operation of a motorcycle or bike services through the use of an Internet-based technology platform to facilitate a pre-arranged transportation for passengers. On Wednesday, March 2, GrabBike driver Mon Carlo Gaya was apprehended by LTFRB when he accepted a booking reserved by the LTFRB chairman. Ginez said this confirms that despite a cease order, GrabBike continues to provide the bike service. The LTFRB has impounded the motorcycle of Gaya, while he faces a fine amounting to P6,000. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-considering-united-states-initial-public-offering-2021","title":"Southeast Asia's Grab considering US IPO this year, sources say","date":"Jan 18, 2021 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab's initial public offering plans have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, sources tell Reuters","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs), 3 sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Grab's IPO could raise at least $2 billion, one of the sources said, which would likely make it the largest overseas share offering by a Southeast Asian company. \"The market is good and the business is doing better than before. This should work well for public markets,\" he said. The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO. Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region's most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion. The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab's total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. Moody's said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency \"expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses, and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next 2 to 3 years.\" One of the sources said he expects Grab's IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board. Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed. Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for an $18-billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month. As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders. Grab caught global attention when Uber sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly 5-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab. It now operates in 397 cities across 8 Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab's food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company's biggest segment last year. \"It's quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,\" said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming, and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/philippine-competition-commission-orders-grab-refund-riders","title":"Antitrust body orders Grab to refund P5M to riders","date":"Nov 18, 2019 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The new disgorgement mechanism will require Grab to refund any excess fares to riders through their GrabPay accounts","body":"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) ordered Grab Philippines to refund an amount of P5.05 million to its riders for breaches in its pricing commitments. In a press conference on Monday, November 18, the PCC said that, during the period of February to May 2019, Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from before its merger with Uber. This means that the increase of Grab fares from before its acquisition of Uber to its current operations exceeded by more than 22%, under its old set of voluntary pricing commitments to the PCC. This violation incurred a P5.05-million penalty. The PCC amended its conditions so that Grab will refund the penalty to its riders instead of paying it to the antitrust authority. In the new round of monitoring, a 22.5% allowable fare deviation has been imposed on Grab. Riders can check if Grab is breaching its pricing commitments by comparing what they were paying before March 2018 to the fares they are paying now, checking if the increase is more than 22.5%. Should Grab breach this deviation, the company will have to pay P2 million to the PCC as well as refund any penalties to riders within 30 days. According to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, riders will directly be given a rebate through their individual GrabPay accounts.  For the current P5.05-million penalty, Grab can file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days, and the PCC will be allowed 30 days to submit a final resolution. After this period, Grab is required to refund the amount to its riders within 60 days. This measure is in line with a newly-approved disgorgement mechanism that will take effect on the second year of PCC's monitoring of Grab operations, to prevent the company from having a \"virtual monopoly\" on the ride-hailing market. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion reiterated that only the recipient of the penalty payment has changed, not the formula for computing the penalties. In a statement, Grab said it \"looked forward\" to paying the passengers who took Grab rides during February to May 2019. Further, the company maintained it complies with the fare matrix imposed by the Land Transportation Regulatory and Franchising Board (LTFRB). Grab will announce the payment mechanics to the riders at least 5 days prior to paying. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-offer-bounty-gerardo-junjie-maquidato-model-driver","title":"Grab offers P100,000 bounty for killer of model driver","date":"Oct 30, 2017 10:56 AM PHT","snippet":"This comes after Grab Philippines head Brian Cu talked to the family of slain Grab driver Gerardo 'Junjie' Maquidato","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines is offering P100,000 to anyone who captures the killers of one of their model drivers Gerardo “Junjie” Maquidato, the transport network company announced on Monday, October 30.

Its Indonesian investment will focus on building a next-generation electric vehicle transport network and rolling out e-healthcare services to improve access to doctors and medical services across the archipelago.

A few years after launching their transport services in the Philippines, they saw an even bigger opportunity to improve people’s lives. From “GrabTaxi”, they went with just “Grab” to complement their renewed ambition –  to be an everyday, everything app.  Today, whether you’re referring to how you’ll get home or where you’ll get food (Mag ga-grab lang ako), the word “Grab” has become synonymous with convenience. RJ Cabaluna, Grab Philippines’ country marketing head, said that he’d describe 2019 as a year that GrabFood and GrabPay have grown so much.  GrabFood just celebrated their 1st anniversary last November yet with the milestones that they’ve achieved, having been recognized by a global market research firm as the most used food delivery platform in the Philippines, it’s as if they’ve been in the playing field long enough to know what makes every Pinoy tick.  This inspired GrabFood Philippines Head EJ dela Vega and his team to amp up their efforts to provide more economic opportunities for Filipinos. Now, they’re in more than 37 areas in the Philippines including Laguna, Pampanga, Metro Cebu, Bacolod, and Iloilo. This means that Grab currently has more than 10,000 merchant-partners that range from luxury restaurants, fast-food chains, down to mom-and-pop stores and Makati’s famous Jolly Jeeps.  24 Chicken, one of the recognized breakthrough merchants at Grab’s first Golden Lunchbox Awards credits GrabFood for their increased revenue. “When GrabFood was introduced to us, our sales doubled or sometimes even tripled. From 1 branch, we now have around 10 branches in two years because of GrabFood. We weren’t expecting an influx of customers but with Grab, we now serve more customers than before,” said Jeff Uy and Jeff Sy, owners of 24 Chicken.  2019 is also the year Grab launched Grab for Good, a social impact program that aims to empower MSMEs and promote financial inclusion.  In a report they released last September,  9 million people in Southeast Asia are now using the platform to earn an income and grow their businesses. Alicia Laqi, owner of Sisig sa Rada, one of the Jolly Jeeps in Makati, said that GrabFood has helped her increase her revenue by allowing her to reach more people. “While the queue for my food already reaches far beyond a normal line, my revenues rose sharply because of the addition of GrabFood. It helped complement my already popular small stall and allowed me to earn more without adding a new branch,” she said.  Aside from providing jobs and helping microentrepreneurs expand their businesses, they’ve also started offering loans to driver-partners and MSMEs to help them grow their businesses or get them through emergency expenses.  Another innovation GrabFood is also proud of is the launch of GrabKitchen. GrabKitchen offers customers an on-demand delivery and in-store dining experience through a self-order kiosk. They offer users in a particular city a variety of food selections in one kitchen.  They opened a branch in Glorietta 2 and partnered with the following merchants: Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean, and CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice.  GrabKitchen helps MSMEs reach more clients without incurring additional costs. While cloud kitchens are usually delivery-only in nature, Grab Philippines added the dine-in experience knowing that Filipinos love to eat together and share their food. Grab Philippines is also making waves through GrabPay. Now that customers can pay for their GrabFood deliveries, shopping items and groceries, bills and utilities, and more using the platform’s cashless payment method - the GrabPay wallet, more Filipinos are now ditching cash for a hassle-free transaction. For Jonathan Bates, head of GrabPay, this is their way of helping reduce the number of unbanked Filipinos or those who don’t have their own bank accounts.  Building on the idea of Grab being no longer just about transport, Bates, says that their goal in 2020 is to bring the convenience of cashless to as many Filipinos as possible. Thanks to their partnership with SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) and other partners, it has begun. Today, GrabPay can now be used to pay for GrabFood deliveries from over 10,000 restaurant partners, more than 5000  shopping, grocery and food outlets nationwide such as SM Stores, Starbucks and more, and pay for bills and utilities. Bates plans to make this platform available in cities outside the metro and eventually make Grab a 100% cashless app.  While Grab Philippines’ ambition has evolved, their passion to make an impact on communities remains the same.  With their expansion, Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president, recognizes the important role they play in addressing socio-economic challenges. May it be about championing financial literacy, giving safer transportation or offering additional income streams, he vows to help more Filipinos both living inside and outside Metro Manila thrive this 2020. For Cu, everyone can grow with Grab.   Cu and the rest of the executives of Grab Philippines are dedicated towards creating an impact by leveling the playing field and improving the quality of life for everyone. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltrfrb-approves-grab-petition-riders-reimbursement-per-minute-charge","title":"LTFRB OKs Grab's petition: Riders will not be reimbursed of P2/min charge","date":"Sep 4, 2018 5:09 PM PHT","snippet":"But the P10-million fine against Grab still stands","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Riders of ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines will no longer be reimbursed of the P2-per-minute travel charges from their previous trips.

The regulatory board said, however, that the P10 million fine still stands, for charging its riders P2 per minute on top of its government approved rates.

The PCC imposed a P16.15 million fine on Grab, P14.15 million of the amount to be refunded to its passengers. The antitrust body released the order on Friday, December 13, based on the audit report of independent monitoring trustee Smith & Williamson. The firm was tasked to monitor Grab’s pricing commitments until August 10.

The P14.15 million will be disbursed to the riders' GrabPay wallets no later than February 10, 2020. Meanwhile, the P2 million administrative penalty will be paid to the PCC. Grab said on Wednesday that the deviations from Grab's voluntary commitments was caused by the lack of transport network vehicle services to supply the growing demand of the riding public.  Grab was fined for every quarter in the initial undertaking of its commitments: P11.3 million in the first quarter, P7.1 million in the second quarter, and P5.05 million in the third quarter.  The third and fourth quarter fines were ordered to be refunded to qualified Grab riders through their GrabPay accounts.

There are some that will get below a peso, there are others who will get over a hundred pesos,\" Cu said Grab Philippines said that there were 3.2 million riders from February to May 2019, the time period covered by the penalties. Miguel Aguila, lead legal counsel of Grab Philippnines, said that the amount each rider will get will be \"proportionate\" to the amount that they spent during that time period.  \"If you are a rider [who] spent P1,000, you should get 10 times more than a rider who just paid for P100.

Do you double-check if you’ve placed the right pick-up pin as a response? This is the sharing economy at play. Like Grab drivers, Grab passengers play a part in what is called a shared economy. Shared economy, shared responsibilities A shared economy is defined as a peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services – usually owners rent out properties like their cars or houses that they don’t often use. #GrabResponsibly espouses the concept of shared economy. For Grab, the passangers, drivers and Grab itself each have their own responsibilities. To observe this, Grab drafted a manual of do’s and don’ts to guide both partner-drivers and passengers on the proper behavior and etiquette that will help ensure a smooth experience every Grab ride. We all have to deal with traffic and booking struggles, but doing your part can ensure a significantly smoother ride for you and other passengers. Here’s a few ways you can help lessen commuting woes, according to Grab’s manual of do’s and don’ts: When booking ● Overloading is illegal. Go for the 6-seater option if there are more than 4 riders. ● No surprises — let the driver know if you’re bringing a furry friend. Bring your pets in a kennel or cage, and prepare for the worst-case scenario by having rags and poop bags ready. It’s still up to the driver, however, if they will allow you to ride with your pet or not. ● Refrain from cancelling – especially if it's because of reasons like pinning the wrong pick-up dress. Did you know that if your cancelled bookings exceed the successful ones, your account may get suspended? While in transit ● There’s a smoking ban, so don’t whip out cigarettes inside the car. ● All forms of sexual harassment towards drivers and passengers are punishable by law. Consensual acts such as flirting, PDA, and sexual intercourse are also strictly banned while inside the vehicle. ● Did you know that you can call 911 using the app? Click the sidebar, then choose the Emergency tab. You also have the option to add 3 emergency contacts, who can be set to receive auto-alerts from Grab. Upon dropping off ● Remember to rate your driver. This will help Grab know how else they can improve the quality of your ride. Grab takes your feedback very seriously. ● Don’t ask the driver to go beyond the pinned drop-off point. For instance, avoid asking to be dropped off at the basement of the building instead of the lobby. ● Take your trash with you, and don’t forget to check all your stuff! After the trip ends, Grab and its drivers aren’t responsible for the items you leave behind. Remember, you don’t own the car you booked — you’re sharing it with other people. All you need to do is practice basic social etiquette!

This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

Perusahaan taksi online Grab mengumumkan secara resmi melalui situsnya bahwa mereka telah menjalin kolaborasi dengan maskapai penerbangan Singapore Airlines.  Kerjasama tersebut dalam bentuk bertukar poin. GrabRewards poin, misalnya, dapat ditukar menjadi KrisFlyer. Artinya, pelanggan Grab kini dapat memanfaatkan poinnya untuk terbang bersama Singapore Airlines. GrabRewards poin juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk mendapatkan diskon pembelian tiket pesawat dan untuk upgrades kelas kursi. Di sisi lain, pelanggan Singapore Airlines dapat memesan taksi daring melalui aplikasi mobile phone SingaporeAir. Bahkan, pelanggan Singapore Airlines dapat memesan taksi Grab dari  jauh hari.

Yang terpenting juga penumpang yang turun di bandara dapat merasa aman karena dipastikan akan mendapat kendaraan yang nyaman ketika tiba. Layanan yang mengawinkan layanan Singapore Airlines dan taksi Grab direncanakan juga hadir di Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Filipina, dan Indonesia. Apa pendapat saya? Semoga terlaksana. Meski mengagumi ide-ide dari start-up taksi daring, jujur saja di Indonesia saya lebih banyak berpergian dengan kendaraan pribadi. Bahkan, di kota-kota lain, saya dijemput oleh mobil-mobil Grup Lorena. Namun, dari cerita teman-teman, di beberapa bandara, saya dengar sebagian penumpang harus naik taksi resmi dari bandara. Harganya, kata mereka, relatif lebih mahal. Lebih mahal dari taksi konvensional dan jauh lebih mahal dari taksi daring.  Bagaimana dengan taksi konvensional? Wah, dilarang mengangkut penumpang dari dalam bandara. Nah ketika taksi konvensional saja tak boleh, apalagi taksi daring?   Anda mau naik taksi daring? Ya, jalan dulu sampai luar pagar bandara. Kalau hujan? Ya, itu deritamu. Tapi, setelah saya pikir-pikir. Seberapa lama taksi “resmi” bandara bisa bertahan? Mungkinkah mampu menghadang gempuran zaman?

The move sparked online outrage on social media, as well as reactions from senators, who said the commuting public stood to suffer from the \"cruel\" suspension. With the LTFRB's order, commuters using ride-hailing apps are now turning to Uber's main competitor, Grab, whose operations continue despite also being tangled in the regulation issue with the LTFRB. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) But why was Grab not suspended?  Grab's accreditation expired last July and has not been renewed, but Grab has so far complied with the LTFRB's orders to stop accepting and accrediting new drivers – the rule that Uber supposedly violated. Grab also immediately submitted to the LTFRB its masterlist of peer drivers when the government board wanted to set a June 30 cutoff for drivers whose permits would be considered. Uber dilly-dallied, on the the other hand.  Rappler takes a look back at previous orders the LTFRB issued, and how the two TNCs responded to the orders.   July 21, 2016 – Moratorium on processing new driver applications The LTFRB releases Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other TNCs. The order stops the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles. But Grab and Uber would later admit they continued to accept new drivers despite this order, citing strong passenger demand. \"Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers... we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],\" Grab country head Brian Cu would later say.     July 11, 2017, order For defying its order to stop accepting new drivers, the LTFRB imposes a fine of P5 million each on Uber and Grab. Both companies comply with the order.   The LTFRB also orders both companies to remove all drivers with expired or no permits. Grab stops activating new drivers only on July 17, while Uber stops on July 18.   July 26, 2017 order  The LTFRB orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered in their systems after June 30, 2017.  It also orders both companies to provide a master list of all their drivers as of June 30, 2017. At the time of the issuance of the order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says they have only received Grab's list. Uber communications head Cat Avelino says they will submit theirs on July 27.   August 1, 2017 show-cause order On August 1, the LTFRB issues a show-cause order to Uber, after it finds the TNC has continued to accept new drivers into its system despite being ordered to stop doing so last July 26. The board says Uber may lose its accreditation because of its action. Uber's accreditation expires in August, while Grab's expired last July 3 but hasn't been renewed. Uber, however, denies the findings of the LTFRB, saying it has already suspended activations since July 19.    August 14, 2017 suspension order Nearly two weeks after it issued a show-cause order, the LTFRB suspends Uber's operations for one month.  The board cites Uber's post on its Twitter account last August 1, where the company said that applications for vehicles were \"being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.\" \"The Respondent's official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,\" the LTFRB says. Uber posted a clarification on its Twitter account on August 2, saying it was also unable to accept applications for new vehicles. In its order, the LTFRB says Uber has accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27. The suspension order takes effect on Tuesday, August 15. Uber also releases a statement on its suspension of operations starting 6 am. (READ: Uber apologizes to LTFRB for 'misunderstanding') The order affects some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living.  Some 52,000 Grab vehicles remain operational. Since the suspension In the aftermath of the suspension, Uber requested that the penalty be changed to a fine. The LTFRB will hear Uber's new request on August 23. On August 17, the LTFRB allowed Uber drivers to transfer to Grab and U-Hop for the meantime. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/grab-philippines-community-announcement","title":"A message from Grab Philippines","date":"Jul 22, 2017 8:00 AM PHT","snippet":"'No final decision has been made and this means that there will be no apprehensions, and Grab will not deactivate any units without PAs'","body":" [Editor's Note: The following is an announcement from Grab PH] To our Ka-Grab Community, Although discussions are far from over, we would like to thank you for the efforts you have put in, not only during these trying times but also since the beginning, when you entrusted your livelihood to us.

A. Barata. In response to the order of government, Grab's Indonesian unit said it was already working with a local Indonesian partner. \"Grab is now trying to ensure that our partner can and will follow every requirement from the government,\" said Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director of Grab Indonesia.  There was no immediate comment from Uber. Ride-hailing apps are being blamed by taxi drivers for dwindling their income. Thousands of taxi drivers gathered in Jakarta to express their anger on Tuesday, a protest that escalated quickly and turned violent.  Once incident involved protesters attempting to rip off the jacket of an ojek or motorcycle driver, while another involved taxi drivers taking an ojek driver's helmet and tossing it. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by Uber, one of the world's most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Free ride A day after the protests, Blue Bird taxi company provided free service for 24 hours in an attempt to restore its image following violent protests involving some of its drivers. \"The meter runs but I don't have to pay,\" Stuart Burney from Australia said in Jakarta after taking Blue Bird taxi on Wednesday, March 23. \"Taking a free ride offered by the taxi company is pretty good.\" Burney was one of the lucky ones since many people found it difficult to hail or order a Blue Bird cab on Wednesday. Netizens also complained about the supposed lack of taxis on Twitter, saying there was no point of it being free. Some Jakartans also expressed fear of taking a Blue Bird. \"I am afraid to take Blue Bird taxis even if it offers us a free ride, after seeing drivers attack ojek riders on TV,\" Daboe, a commuter in Jakarta, said to Rappler. New apps like Go-Jek have also allowed commuters to hail rides with motorcycles. She also worried that ojek riders might be vengeful towards taxis.

Instead of their jackets that showed off their companies, they wore their own shirts instead. \"I don't want to wear my Grab jacket today,\" Igun, a rider working for Grab Taxi said. \"The taxi drivers attacked my co-workers,\" he added.

LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said the board would start clamping down on these drivers because they are considered to be illegally operating under the public service law. The LTFRB on Wednesday, March 2, summoned MyTaxi.PH – the transportation network company offering GrabTaxi and GrabCar – to explain why its accreditation should not be cancelled after it continued offering the GrabBike service on its app-based platform. The legal counsels of MyTaxi.PH, however, said that they could not answer questions on the operations of GrabBike because it is being operated by a different company. In its show cause order dated February 23, the LTFRB said that Grab once again offered its motorcycle-hailing service even after it announced in early February that it would be temporarily suspending operations. This was in compliance with an LTFRB order issued on January 27, ordering the suspension of GrabBike operations because it was not part of the business model approved and accredited by the board. Illegal operations During the Wednesday hearing, Ginez used his phone to book a GrabBike ride to prove that the service was still ongoing. On the Grab app, the GrabBike service is offered for free. To get a free ride, passengers need to key in a promo code. The driver, identified as Mon Carlo Gaya, was apprehended by LTFRB officials and questioned by Ginez. Gaya said that Grab informed its drivers about the suspension of operations, but was later told it would be resumed with passengers riding for free. GrabBike drivers, meanwhile, would be paid P40 for each trip. Ginez informed Gaya that he was operating illegally. The driver was issued an inspection report summons, requiring him to explain before the board why a fine of P6,000 should not be imposed on him. His motorcycle will also be impounded. While the GrabBike service was being offered to passengers for free, Ginez said that its operations are covered by the public service law. \"It's still covered by the public service law because you are transporting a passenger with compensation.... Compensation under the public service law is treated as any economic benefit to the entity which provides the service,\" Ginez said. He said that the company is still benefiting by increasing patronage of the service. Different entities Meanwhile, the lawyers of MyTaxi.PH maintained that it could not explain GrabBike's operations because it falls under a different company. In a February 3 hearing of the House committee on transportation, Grab said that the motorcycle-hailing service was operated by Grab Bike Incorporated. But it still uses the same app where other Grab services like GrabTaxi and GrabCar can be booked. The LTFRB's cease and desist letter, as well as its show cause order, was addressed to MyTaxi.PH. \"We're not representing GrabBike Inc.... We were directed to show cause and yet we were obliged to answer for GrabBike, which is not connected to MyTaxi.Ph,\" legal counsel Jerome Leynes said. Leynes pointed out that operations of GrabTaxi and GrabCar will stand to suffer if their accreditation is cancelled due to the actions of an entirely different entity. But Ginez dismissed this, saying it was merely \"their allegation\" that the two companies are not connected. \"But it shows otherwise because they use the same system. And what we accredited was the model, the system itself,\" he added. The LTFRB decided to amend its show cause order and its cease and desist order to also cover Grab Bike Incorporated. It also expanded the coverage of the orders to include stopping the operations of the recently-introduced free service, Grab Jeep. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/understanding-land-grabbing-rights","title":"Understanding land grabbing, land rights in the 21st century","date":"Aug 30, 2015 6:53 PM PHT","snippet":"How and why did land grabbing persist in the Philippines in the past years? A special double edition of the Focus Policy Review answers this question","body":" Policy analysts that contributed to the paper pointed out the strong social justice component of the 1987 Constitution, which acknowledged the rights of farmers and peasants to land, of fisherfolk to traditional fishing ground, and of indigenous peoples (IPs) to ancestral lands. In overview, it further discussed the legal instrument which could have provided the needed substance of the Constitution’s social justice component – the passage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). It highlighted that CARP should have helped fulfill the Filipino farmers’ right to land but it has turned into an arena for struggle, taking 27 years for the law to be fully implemented. It emphasized the intention of CARP as a law crafted according to the ideals and interests of landless tillers and agrarian reform advocates. However, it ended up plugged with provisions upholding landed elite interests dominating Philippine Congress.  It elaborated that farmers and fishers do not just have to contend with an agrarian reform program that has not been completed almost three decades now. Complicating the situation not only of those who work on lands that have been targeted for agrarian reform coverage but even those who have been issued CLOAs (Certificate of Land Ownership Award) and titles, is the phenomenon called land grabbing.  The CARP’s 27 years of neglect in implementation made it one of the longest running agrarian reform programs under a democratic form of government. The topics it covered The policy paper zoomed in on the following topics written by different analysts:  It also presented a section that deals with the “International Human Rights Instruments and Legal Tools for Global Governance of Land, Forests, Fisheries, and Natural Resources.” About focus on the global south Focus on the Global South was established in 1995 to challenge neoliberalism, militarism and corporate-driven globalization while strengthening just and equitable alternatives.  We work in solidarity with the Global South – the great majority of humanity that is marginalized and dispossessed by globalization – believing that progressive social change and Global South solidarity are imperative if the needs and aspirations of oppressed peoples, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are to be met.

It possess a history of bringing together diverse actors – from government to social movements to share and deepen analysis of emerging power patterns and new experiences of social transformation as the basis for broad collective mobilization for democratic change.  Focus was at the forefront of the struggles that brought forth the World Social Forum, derailed the World Trade Organization, and prompted alternative visions through its deglobalization paradigm. - Rappler.com  A copy of “Understanding Land Grabbing, Land Rights in the 21st Century” is made available by Focus in its publications at www.focusweb.org."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/grab-taxi-app-review","title":"GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes","date":"Aug 27, 2013 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"We put the taxi-finding app to the test in the mean streets of Metro Manila","body":"MANILA, Philippines - I was both pleased and annoyed. It was 9:30 in the morning and, from my bedroom, I could hear the familiar sound of knuckles on our iron front gate. A second later, the voice of our house assistant rang through the house as she called out my name. The cab I requested via GrabTaxi had arrived — more than 30 minutes early.  GrabTaxi, a new smartphone application that seeks to help commuters find cabs and cab drivers find passengers, was launched recently. I decided to take the app out for spin in the streets of Metro Manila.  READ: Need a cab? There's an app for that! According to CEO and founder Anthony Tan, aside from helping people find a cab, GrabTaxi is also supposed to eliminate the all-too familiar commuter predicament of cab drivers turning down passengers, haggling over the fare and — of course — the constant worrying over the safety of the cab and its driver.  Through the app [available on both Android and iOS], passengers’ taxi bookings are blasted out to drivers within a 3 kilometer radius. Through smartphones used as dispatch tools, the taxis in the area are alerted of your request and can bid for the job. Once matched, both the driver and the passenger are given direct contacts to each other for better communication.  I used GrabTaxi twice in the course of two days: first in the evening, and the second instance in the next morning.  Here’s how it went: The app My first booking was on a Wednesday evening. I was coming from a cocktail party in one of the establishments along Bonifacio High Street in Taguig City. It had been a long night and the party just happened to revolve around different types of alcoholic beverages. Suffice to say I was intoxicated, dazed and a bit drowsy.  I opened the GrabTaxi app and it immediately determined my location with a dot on the map. In the first box, I indicated my exact location. In the second box I put in my home address. Within seconds, the app identified more than 10 cabs within a 3 kilometer radius of where I was. A few seconds later, a notice came up indicating a cab was already on its way to fetch me.  All the driver’s details were displayed on the screen: his name, mobile number, the car’s license plate number and a countdown of how many minutes it would take him to get where I was standing. If I looked closer, I would have actually seen him inch closer and closer to where I was standing on the map. For a first-time user, it was such a treat to stare at a moving taxi icon on the screen. I had a feeling the novelty was not going to wear off anytime soon. Punctuality It was 11:15pm. Based on the GPS tracking, my cab was less than a kilometer away. The app indicated that it would take him 5 minutes to arrive. A few seconds later, it said 4 minutes. It started to count down and then went back to 5 minutes. On the GPS, I could see he had gotten stuck somewhere in the Market! Market! area. 15 minutes later, at 11:30pm, Felipe Capion of Ultimax Transport pulled over in front of the curb where I was standing.  My second GrabTaxi driver the next morning was a little bit too excited. He was Jophel Calipayan of 24/7 Taxi Service. I had expected him to arrive at 10am, but at 9:30am he was already parked in front of our house, ready to go. Our destination was Taguig [again]. On the road We were headed to the South on a weekday morning. Taking EDSA was not an option. I asked Jophel to take C5 road instead. He agreed with my plan after asking for directions on how to get out of our village. At this point, the meter was still at P0. It was only after I sat down and closed the door that the driver started the meter with a P40 flat rate.  The cab was clean, had no suspicious stains on the upholstery and smelled of pine air freshener bought from the gas station. On both cabs, attached to the windshield was a mobile phone mount; in it sat a Cloud smartphone which was running the GrabTaxi app. On the window of the right passenger seat was a printed, laminated brochure from GrabTaxi explaining how to download and use the application.  (Download Grab Taxi app for Android and iOS) In the course of our journey along C5 that morning, my driver was in the perfect mood. He had an album of the Bee Gees playing in the background. As Robin Gibb sang, asking the perennial question of how to mend a broken heart, my driver used his turn signals properly, giving way to pedestrians and following traffic lights. My only gripe was that he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. We spent the next 30 minutes talking about the app and how it has made finding passengers easier for him.  Felipe, on the other hand [from the night before], was not a chatty cabbie. However, being as it was close to midnight, I understood. I asked him why it took him 15 minutes to get to me. He said there was a slight vehicular accident around the mall area that stalled him a bit. After clicking in his seatbelt and punching a button on the meter to get it started, we were off into the night.  However, I was in no mood to declare to the rest of the world where I was, and found no reason to suspect my driver was taking me somewhere else.  I arrived home some 20 minutes later. I paid the meter charge along with the additional P70 fee, and gave him a little extra considering the time.  Feedback Both my experiences were very successful. In the course of my morning ride with Jophen, though, he told me of an instance of double-booking: he arrived at the passenger’s home only to find out that another taxi, also affiliated with GrabTaxi, arrived earlier than him and picked the passenger up leaving him wondering what happened.  For most concerns, GrabTaxi has several lines of communication to receive passengers’ feedback. At the end of your journey, there’s an option in the app for you to send your feedback. Or at your own time, you can send them a tweet [@GrabTaxiPH], a message on Facebook [Facebook.com/GrabTaxiPH], or an e-mail [passenger.mnl@grabtaxi.com]. GrabTaxi is an app long overdue. In a place as chaotic, crowded and unpredictable like Metro Manila, it’s a concrete step towards creating a more organized, systematic and efficient way of riding public transportation — even if it is an air-conditioned cab. One can only hope that more fleets in the city [and, perhaps, the rest of the country] will recognize the benefits of using the application, for both passengers and drivers.

The announcements were made during a media event on Thursday, July 5. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars travelling through the major roads – the highly congested roads – and move them into higher-capacity vehicles like shuttles or buses,” said Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines. The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows their passengers to seamlessly select and take different modes of transport to reach their destination. For instance, a Grab user can first take an on-demand shuttle, then hop on to a public bus, then finally take a GrabCar to the destination all in the same app. Ideally, this should decrease costs for passengers, help increase the income of Grab’s driver partners, and decrease congestion in roads but, Cu admits that there are huge challenges to achieving this vision. Unlike in Singapore where Grab is allowed to run shuttles, Cu said that until they have regulations in place that allow them to implement this system, it’s difficult to move forward with their plans. Despite the lack of a timeline for a potential rollout of this system, Cu said they were reaching out to regulators and operators to build their multimodal transport system. “We're in talks right now with a few P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as the mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transport, either via car or trike,” Cu added. Expanding GrabPay Meanwhile, Grab discussed plans of expanding the use of GrabPay beyond the services they offer. Grab’s country marketing head, Cindy Toh, said users can pay bills, buy load, and conduct other common transactions with GrabPay and earn rewards by doing so. She believes that by incentivizing the feature, it can convince people to adopt it, even in a cash-dominated market such as the Philippines. For Grab drivers, they can build credit histories with Grab so that they can qualify for financial services such as loans and insurance solutions. Apart from this, the ride-hailing service officially unveiled GrabFood, their food-delivery service on soft launch and Grab Daily, an in-app feed that lets users read lifestyle news, play games, or check restaurant recommendations.

But when done in bad taste, it can do more harm than good.  Netizens on Tuesday, July 23, hit Grab Philippines for its tweet riding on the rumored breakup between celebrities Gerald Anderson and Bea Alonzo, implying that it was okay to cheat.  On Sunday, Alonzo, Gerald's girlfriend of several years, made cryptic posts on Instagram, alluding to betrayal.  While she didn't say who she was posting about, eagle-eyed fans noticed Bea had liked the Instagram post about Gerald spending time with another celebrity, Julia Barretto.

After gaining backlash on social media, Grab Philippines deleted its tweet, but the internet kept receipts. Twitter user Allex called out the ride-hailing service, saying the tweet was “distasteful.” Meanwhile, ride-hailing app Angkas tweeted, \"Bakit kasi sabay-sabay ha?

Grab said it began a fare subsidy scheme last Monday, June 18, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the company's P2-per-minute travel charge. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab said its drivers should ideally be earning at least P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. \"Based on our computations, a TNVS (transport network vehicle service) driver needs to make at least P330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family's needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs,\" said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. \"Since [the] P2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That's why we decided to step in.\" The subsidy will be provided to drivers for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. Grab gave this example to illustrate how the subsidy would work: \"If a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance, and fare is computed at P120 only, Grab will return to the driver the P210 difference to make sure he made P330 for that one-hour trip.\" The ride-hailing company reiterated on Tuesday that there continues to be a vehicle shortage on its platform, with only 33,000 cars available for 600,000 to 800,000 passenger bookings a day. \"With guaranteed earnings, we hope that this subsidy will also urge our partners to be more confident that they will make money for any trip they get and continue providing quality service to the riding public,\" Cu said. He added that the subsidy is different from incentives which are \"only a bonus for drivers who hit a certain number of rides.\" The subsidy will be in place, according to Cu, \"as long as it's needed\" and the company still has funds for it. Grab has been criticized for alleged overcharging and \"deteriorating\" service, after it acquired Uber last March. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), which is reviewing the Grab-Uber deal, said that Grab has taken control of 93% of the local ride-hailing market, leaving commuters on the losing end. The LTFRB has since accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies, but the PCC does not expect these firms to challenge Grab's dominance anytime soon \"because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base.\" Grab maintains that it does not charge illegal fares, but launched a \"100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience\" in response to complaints of poor service. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/road-testing-grabbike","title":"Road-testing the GrabBike","date":"Jan 28, 2016 8:30 PM PHT","snippet":"But the LTFRB warns GrabBike it can face cancellation of its accreditation if it continues its operations without accreditation","body":"Tired of endless Metro Manila traffic jams?

The LTFRB directed the company to explain why the company is offering a service that has not been given a go-signal by the government. Will this be GrabBike's last ride? Chrisee dela Paz reports. - Rappler.com With commuters getting tired of Metro Manila’s traffic jam, more and more people are using GrabTaxi’s new motorcycle service called GrabBike.  Since November last year, GrabBike has been on beta testing, servicing Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. I’ve tried out GrabBike to find out the pros and cons of riding one. I book a ride in Tordesillas Street in Makati City going to Bonifacio Global City. In less than 5 minutes, I was able to get GrabBike driver Noel Barredo to accept my request. As a rule, Grab Bike drivers offer the passenger a disposable face mask and shower cap before wearing helmet The base fare for off-peak hours is 40 for the first 2 kilometers, with an additional P10 per kilometer for the first 2 to 7 kilometers. GrabBike was first offered in Jakarta, Indonesia in May 2015. Following its huge success in Jakarta, Grab Bike is now pilot testing in Metro Manila where there are now hundreds of  units. GrabBike provides a new source of income to Filipinos like Noel, who used to work for a shipping company. NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: The demand for GrabBike is high and the income is just right for our needs. It’s actually better than the minimum. I just resigned from my previous job and this is now my full time work.   Despite the heat, Noel says he logs around 12 hours a day, transporting an average of 10 passengers.  NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: Yesterday I booked my highest number of trips so far. I had 10 rides. I earned around P800, which is the highest so far. Although the ability to zigzag through traffic jams is their edge over four-wheeled vehicles, passenger safety remains Grab Bike’s priority. Noel asked several times during the ride if he was going too fast, or if I am fine with his driving. After all, they still have to abide by traffic rules. And unlike riding a car, there’s no airconditioning while you’re on a Grab Bike. Expect to be sweaty because of the heat. In less than 15 minutes, we get to my destination in BGC, to the tune of 80 pesos. The ride is fast, cheap, but a bit sweaty.

They were the only players with double-digit rebounding figures for both teams.   And they didn't stop there.  The pairing of Sutton and Taulava merited another beautiful display of dominance in the paint for the second straight game.   If on their first game against Rain or Shine the duo eked out a combined 44 points, they slightly improved on that number against Barako with a total of 46 points.  Taulava scattered 22 markers while Sutton top-scored with 24 to go with 6 thefts.  \"If you look at it, our import is really right for our system,\" Pumaren pointed Sutton out as one of their biggest advantages.  \"Our advantage now after the series last conference is we don't need a high-scoring caliber of an import.

But he was unable to finish the game after an inadvertent elbow by Sutton with 6:17 to play left Wise bleeding with a cut under his left eye.  Jeric Fortuna put up another steady and reliable performance of 13 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. Fellow rookie Carlo Lastimosa finished with 10 points.  Barako, who dropped to 1-2 after two consecutive losses, barely threatened Air21 but came close at 76-71 with 2:44 left in the third after a Leo Najorda (10 points) three-pointer.  But the Express caught fire and went on a 16-3 run bridging the third and fourth cantos. They scored at will from every area of the hardwood, whether it was a Mark Cardona (16 points) triple, an Eric Camson (8 points) putback, or some points from the stripe, Air21 delivered on their promise to treat every game with the urgency of a playoff match.  And they intend to stay the course and pack even more steam heading into what would be a big test for them on Tuesday against Barangay Ginebra.  \"Now I guess everybody knows their roles,\" Pumaren said. \"This is a good takeoff point for our game on Tuesday, which is a big game for us.\" Scores Air21 101- Sutton 24, Taulava 22, Yeo 17, Cardona 16, Ramos 8, Camson 8, Villanueva 3, Atkins 3, Borboran 0, Jaime 0, Poligrates 0, Burtscher 0.

Cu explained that after the acquisition, Grab was funding the current operations of Uber, thus, operations cannot be totally independent. \"Considering that Uber has exited the region on March 25 and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber's departure,\" Cu said. Grab has been shouldering the cost of the Uber app extension from March 25 to its earlier scheduled shutdown on April 8, the original period of transition.  Cu added that the Uber app shutdown will be moved to midnight of April 15, which means extra costs for Grab.  The country head of Grab reiterated that the Uber app can still be accessed but \"it has limited functionality and little or no support.\" The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it was concerned that there would be a deluge of customer complaints. \"The current solution does not benefit the riding public. It's a risk for the riding public. If a road crash happens, who has the accountability?\" he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, as keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely will cost them \"expensively.\" Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC's order. However, both companies will be given a chance to explain their sides before this order will be implemented.  Many Uber patrons slammed the deal between the two companies, arguing that Grab has \"monopolized\" the ride-hailing service until the LTFRB approves 4 new ride-hailing apps. But Cu said that fares will remain as is, as they \"cannot unilaterally\" increase the fares. Although fares right now may not increase given the acquisition, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition to increase fares due to the tax reform law.– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-considering-secondary-singapore-listing","title":"Grab considering secondary Singapore listing after US SPAC merger – sources","date":"Apr 16, 2021 3:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, 3 sources say","body":"Grab Holdings, Southeast Asia's ride-hailing to delivery giant, is considering a secondary listing in its home market of Singapore after completing a Nasdaq listing via a $40 billion SPAC merger, 3 sources familiar with the matter said. Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, the people said, potentially offering its customers, drivers and merchant partners easier access to trade its shares. Grab, a household name across Southeast Asia, is in the early stages of considering a secondary listing in the city-state, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. The potential Singapore listing plans come after Grab this week agreed to a $40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), making this the world's biggest SPAC deal. Grab, which began as a ride-hailing business in 2012, now operates in 8 countries and more than 400 cities and has expanded into food and grocery deliveries, as well as digital payments. Last year, it won a digital banking license in Singapore. It wasn't clear how much Grab might aim to raise in any secondary listing, with financial terms and timetable still in the early stages of consideration, the sources said. The company with the top valuation on the Singapore bourse is bank DBS Group Ltd, currently worth about S$74 billion ($55.4 billion) by capitalization. Grab and SGX declined to comment on the listing plans. One of the sources said that while Grab has sufficient cash reserves and could end up raising only a small amount on SGX, a listing would mark a big win for the exchange. SGX has mainly only seen large IPOs from real estate investment trusts. Hindered by a small base of retail investors in the city-state, it has struggled with low liquidity and valuations, forcing a spate of delistings and also discouraging big-ticket listings from regional high-growth companies. The Hong Kong bourse, however, has benefited from diplomatic and political tensions between the United States and China that have led many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. Global fund managers have also been swapping China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong. SGX has taken many steps to try to bulk up its stock market in recent years, and under Chief Executive Loh Boon Chye, who was appointed six years ago, it has acquired firms to transform itself into a multi-asset exchange. Currently, there are 28 companies with a secondary listing on SGX, including Malaysia's IHH Healthcare and Top Glove Corp and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings. Last year, AMTD International became the first NYSE-listed firm to list on SGX. It also became the first to take advantage of a dual-class share structure in Singapore. For Grab, as part of the SPAC merger, it's raising $4 billion from global investors including BlackRock, Temasek Holdings, Fidelity International, Malaysia's Permodalan Nasional Bhd and some of Indonesia's richest family groups. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-cashless-payments-feature","title":"Grab shifts to cashless payments with new feature","date":"Oct 28, 2020 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines is also open to venturing into the motorcycle taxi business again 'if given a chance'","body":"Grab Philippines on Wednesday, October 28, announced that it has started rolling out a new feature to strengthen its adoption of cashless payments.

Previously, users could only top up with select drivers. Now, the update will fully integrate the feature into the platform. All users will have the update by mid-November, according to Grab. The move is seen to minimize cash transactions – a requirement set by transport regulators given the pandemic. Under the initial run, users will be able to top up with their drivers in the following services: Grab Philippines head of transport and shared services Ronald Roda said the feature will be expanded to other services in the coming months. Users who have yet to set up the ride-hailing firm's virtual wallet GrabPay will be asked to do so.

We have 70,000 two-wheel drivers which would make it easy for us to convert if needed,\" he added. In mid-2016, Grab used to offer motorcycle hailing services, but this was discontinued as the antiquated law banned two-wheelers from being hired. In 2019, Angkas motorcycle drivers were allowed to offer rides under the Department of Transportation-led pilot study.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber's ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced \"competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.\" Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – \"to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.\" The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission's clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal \"within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.\" In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly.

In a media briefing on Tuesday, May 8, Grab Philippines marketing head Cindy Toh said there are ongoing discussions to roll out the feature in a few months. \"Grab is eyeing to impose a cancellation fee – our target [is] that this will be done within the [next] 100 days,\" Toh said. According to Toh, riders are more likely to cancel their bookings than drivers. Data showed that passengers cancel 12% of their rides, while drivers cancel 8% of their bookings. Imposing a cancellation fee is seen as a solution – a feature that Uber used to have. But Grab has yet to determine how much the fee will be, and how to roll out the feature for trips paid with cash. \"For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,\" Toh said. She added that Grab will soon issue new receipts which will indicate the fare breakdown of every trip. \"On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers ang travel mo (your travel was). That is already a work in progress,\" Toh said. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab of charging an additional P2 per minute on top of its government-approved scheme.

In a text message, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III confirmed to Rappler on Thursday, April 19, that the board issued an order to \"suspend the imposition of P2-per-minute charge\" on Wednesday, April 18. “[The order was] issued yesterday [and is valid] until further order,” Delgra said.  LTFRB maintains that it did not approve the additional charges, consistent with its December 27, 2016 order that regulated the fares of ride-hailing companies.  \"We already have said that it's a settled issue. Meron bang approval? Wala. And if fact, they have admitted that the public was not informed. Kung may approval 'yan sa Board, malalaman 'yan sa publiko na ito na ang bagong fare structure ng Grab,\" Delgra said in a media interview on Thursday. (We already said that it’s a settled issue. Was there approval? None. And in fact, they have admitted that the public was not informed. If it got the approval of the board, the public would be informed of Grab's new fare structure.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab Philippines of charging an additional P2-per-minute travel charge on top of its government-approved scheme. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in supposed overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. The lawmaker's allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges.  Nograles thanked the LTFRB for the suspension order. \"We thank the LTFRB for the suspension of the P2/minute charges that were clearly not approved by the Board and were kept secret from the operators, drivers, and riders,\" he said in a statement sent to Rappler. \"I hope that refund for these hidden charges will be ordered soon, as well and that the drivers are spared from paying this refund as they played no part in reprogramming the Grab algorithm to include these secret charges.\" Nograles added. Grab Philippines on Wednesday admitted that its riders were not informed when the additional charges were rolled out mid-2017, but maintained that this is legal. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu had said that travel charge \"went to the drivers\" and \"was reinvested by way of incentives or promos for passengers.\" The LTFRB will conduct its next hearing on the alleged illegal charges on May 29. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-illegal-charge-higher-fare","title":"Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?","date":"Apr 11, 2018 7:50 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Since mid-2017, Grab has been charging its riders an extra P2 per minute per ride, without approval from the LTFRB","body":"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Amid allegations of charging illegal fares, Grab Philippines maintained that it has always been \"transparent\" about its fare scheme. In a statement on Wednesday, April 11, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said that the P2-per-minute charge was initiated \"when Grab reviewed its pricing structure in June 2017,\" and \"was integrated to the existing per kilometer charges and is not added to the upfront fares.\" \"Per minute charges remain part and parcel [of] Grab's fare structure today, and we have continuously been transparent about this truth,\" Gonzales added. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), however, said the last fare schedule it had approved for Grab, in December 2016, was not in reference to any \"time travel rate.\"  A congressman says Grab therefore owes its riders a refund.  Why does Grab have to explain? Grab made the statement in response to the claim of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it was illegally charging its customers on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies' fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer travel. The order also put a cap on surge pricing to only twice as much as the normal fare. What does the law say? According to Commonwealth Act Number 146, fares that are \"just and reasonable\" are approved \"only upon reasonable notice to the public services and other parties concerned, giving them a reasonable opportunity to be heard and the burden of the proof to show that the proposed rates or regulations are just and reasonable shall be upon the public service proposing the same.\" It didn't happen in Grab's case. In an earlier interview with Rappler, the transport service network said no hearings were conducted prior to its implementing the charge of P2-per-minute in every ride. The LTFRB was only \"made aware\" of it, said Grab PH head Brian Cu.  On Wednesday, Gonzales said, \"[W]e corresponded with the LTFRB to present these changes and was given the opportunity to present in full our business model, supply and demand models, and pricing structure during one of the Technical Working Group meetings in late July 2017.\" In a statement, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that the now-amended December 2016 order \"was the last issued by board and still stands.\" In that order, \"there is no mention of time travel rate.\" Should Grab's accreditation be cancelled? According to Gonzales, the P2-per-minute charge was conceptualized to assure Grab drivers that they \"would have a greater chance of making ends meet\" despite heavy traffic congestion in the metro.  \"At the end of the day, Grab seeks to always ensure a balance in fare to benefit both our passengers and drivers. We owe it to our riding public to remain truthful and transparent,\" he said. But Nograles said that Grab owed its riders a refund. \"They are liable for a refund. With Uber now being absorbed by Grab, we're looking at the potential of 2.8 million rides per week and all of them charging P2 per minute. This is the problem when there is a monopoly,\" he told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday, April 10. On Thursday, April 12, the LTFRB issued a show-cause order against Grab, asking them to explain why its transportation network company accreditation should not be suspended or cancelled over the allegations. By April 16, patrons of ride-hailing services will be left with only Grab as their choice, as LTFRB ordered Uber to close down. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/uber-grab-philippines-commuters-impact","title":"As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?","date":"Mar 26, 2018 7:50 PM PHT","snippet":"'Obviously, it is not good. From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,' warns an economist","body":"MANILA, Philippines – An economist warned that Filipino commuters could face higher fares and fewer incentives, after California-based Uber decided to sell its entire Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. Ending stiff competition between the ride-hailing behemoths, Uber on Monday, March 26, sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. \"Obviously, it is not good. From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,\" Fernando Aldaba, dean and professor of economics at the Ateneo de Manila University and a senior fellow of Eagle Watch, told Rappler. \"Without competition, prices may go up and quality of service might deteriorate,\" Aldaba added. Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8 – or two weeks from now. (READ: Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks) Pola del Monte, a 28-year-old editor in Quezon City, said this gives her no choice but to rely on Grab for ride-hailing services. \"I'm an Uber loyalist – largely by force of habit, but also because I prefer its sleeker interface, have had too many pleasant riding experiences, plus I find their customer service impeccable. I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,\" she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. \"Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won't be able to compare prices now. We won't know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,\" she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. \"If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,\" Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  \"If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,\" PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan's statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. \"As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,\" the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a \"dynamic surcharge\" would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. \"With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,\" the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/grab-star-wars-choose-side","title":"The First Order vs The Resistance: Which side are you on?","date":"Dec 1, 2017 7:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s your chance to pick a side before things take a turn for the worse in Star Wars: The Last Jedi","body":" MANILA, Philippines – This December, the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order is expected to take a turn for the worse in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When Starkiller Base, the First Order’s headquarters, was destroyed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it may have taken a toll on their resources but not at all on their strength and numbers. And they’re more than ready to launch yet another attack. The Resistance also have no choice but to fight back to save the galaxy’s freedom and democracy. Now that Luke Skywalker is back, he’s here to train Rey, the only chance that the Resistance has against the First Order, to prepare her for a face-off with one of the order’s leaders, Kylo Ren. And because there is really no room for peace, and a war is inevitable, everyone is forced to pick a side. If you were living in this galaxy far, far away, (but you’re not really an avid Star Wars fan) how will you know which side you’ll take? Here’s a quick guide: First Order Background: The First Order is a political and military faction organized following the fall of the Galactic Empire. It’s composed of former Imperial military members and sympathizers who resided in unknown parts of the galaxy to carefully plan for their return to power. The Order is patterned after the fascist ideals of the Empire but taking only its strengths and eliminating its weaknesses. They have an alliance with Knights of Ren. Leaders: Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, Captain Phasma, Kylo Ren Members: Stormtroopers, Flametroopers, Snowtroopers Mission: Get their revenge against the Resistance for destroying the Starkiller Base and ultimately, take over the Republic as the Galactic Empire once did before it was overthrown by the government. The Resistance Background: The Resistance, as the name suggests, is a military resistance movement that was formed to fight against the First Order. It was when the Galactic Senate didn’t see the Order as a threat to the Republic that General Leia organized this militant group. And when the First Order fired the Starkiller Base’s superweapon that destroyed the Hosnian System, it was the Resistance who launched a counterattack. The Galactic Senate is now their ally. Leaders: General Leia Organa, Admiral Statura, Admiral Ackbar, Major Brance, Major Ematt  Members: Poe Dameron, Rey, Finn, Doctor Kalonia, Snap Wexley, Jess Pava, Ello Asty, Nien Nunb, Vober Dand, Goss Toowers, Bollie Prindel, Kaydel Ko, Pamich Nerro, Korr Sella, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB-8 Mission: To save innocent lives and maintain peace, freedom, and democracy by preventing the First Order from overthrowing the government and claiming the Republic. Now, that you know more about the two opposing sides, it’s time to pledge your allegiance using Grab. This December, Grab is urging you to choose a side – the First Order or the Resistance – and to battle it out to win special prizes including a Sphero Droid and Lego Set, The Last Jedi premiums, tickets to the private movie screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi,  or a grand prize of an all-inclusive trip for two to the world’s largest privately-owned Star Wars memorabilia museum, Rancho Obi-Wan in San Francisco, California, USA. All you have to do is click on your chosen side from the pop-up window that will appear when you launch your Grab app (see the car icons change into A-Wings or TIE Silencers once you activate the Star Wars theme!). Use the promo code THELASTJEDI to qualify. Top five riders from Resistance and First Order sides will have to battle it out for a chance to win the grand prize: a Rancho Obi-wan trip. Every ride also earns you GrabRewards points that you can use to redeem Star Wars premiums.

Its pronouncements on the app-based riding services have confused more than clarify, raised questions more than answer them, and agitated more than serve thousands of already harried urban commuters. The mess began when the LTFRB threatened to apprehend all Grab and Uber drivers by July 26, 2017, if they remained without permits or provisional authorities. It also ordered the two companies to pay the fine of P5 million each, which they eventually did. This came a year after the agency did the correct thing, which was to suspend the issuance of such permits after these transport network vehicle services (TNVs) deployed drivers beyond the number they were allowed. The LTFRB promised at the time to draft new regulations, which it has so far failed to do. Worse, it lost the companies’ accreditation papers. Now it's saying perhaps these drivers should have minimum working hours. Or that government should tax them.  The revived crackdown smacks of bad faith on one hand – are well-entrenched taxi operators in control of LTFRB? – and incompetence on the other, given the agency’s short-sighted and wish-washy approach to a modern-world management problem. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) To be sure, app-enabled transport services are not beyond criticism or abuse. In America, Europe, and Asia, governments and established taxi operators have risen up in arms over the way technology has allowed public-interest companies to escape regulation and basic standards.  The disruption at some point prompted some governments to recommend banning Uber, an idea that’s akin to controlling news distribution online.  Yet, it cannot be denied that Uber and Grab serve commuter needs; they're efficient and can be tracked – both in how much they're paid or where they travel. In the Philippines, they fill a void left by a perennially weak mass transport system. So why fix what isn't broken? Technology should serve to motivate us to do things better. Taxi operators, for example, can band together for their own app or 3rd-party channels. Instead of spanking tech-savvy drivers, the LTFRB should help drivers and companies upgrade skills and use technology to improve services, strengthen safety for commuters, and connect with each other to discuss welfare issues, such as better pay and insurance. The data collected over the years by Grab and Uber can also help government better understand consumer behavior – as well as the unaddressed weaknesses of the transport industry. Singapore has started doing this.

What exactly are the requirements for these permits?","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Regulatory Franchising Board (LTFRB) recently raised issues against Grab and Uber drivers over franchising permit violations. What does the LTFRB need from these transportation giants? It all started in July 2016, when the LTFRB, through Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008, suspended the acceptance of new applications for transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) permits of transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Grab. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the government review of the fare scheme. On July 23, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) released a statement on its Facebook page and cited issues of \"accountability of TNCs to passengers and operators alike, and the problem of fare surging scheme.\" \"Equally important issues for compliance is to make sure that TNCs and TNVS contribute their fair share of taxes to the government, and for TNVS to have the required garages to avoid illegal parking on streets to prevent traffic congestion,\" the DOTr said. TNVS permits are legal papers given to accredited TNCs. These are the qualifications for aspiring TNVS applicants prior to the moratorium: LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise valid for one to two years. (READ: LTFRB fines Grab, Uber P5M each for permit violations) The requirements for a CPC permit are as follows: New Certificate of Public Convenience by Kimiko Sy on Scribd  A CPC permit usually takes more time to process. While waiting for the CPC permit, LTFRB gives out a PA permit which is processed just for 7 to 10 days. Here is the cost for filing permits: Filing for a motion to get a PA permit requires a motion for extension of provisional authority to be executed by a lawyer, OR/CR from LTO Registration, receiving copy of the application for CPC, government-issued ID, special power of attorney (for a representative), and the receipt of the payment for motion. No more permits Since the suspension last year, LTFRB has not processed a single application for TNVS permits. However, Grab and Uber have admitted that 80% of their drivers are driving without either a provisional authority (PA) permits or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Those whose status have been held following last year's suspension order can continue to file for PA permits until their CPCs are released.  The LTFRB’s latest estimate is that of the 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers,15,400 at most have adequate papers to operate. Discussions of Grab and Uber’s suspensions raised numerous complaints from commuters, especially those taking metered taxis. (READ: #CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes) The suspension dilemma is also heavily reflected on 50,000 Grab and Uber drivers operating around the country. “Hindi ko naman po alam na kailangan naming kumuha ng ganoon sa LTFRB kasi hindi malinaw ang instructions nila sa amin, ang hirap po kasi lahat kami mawawalan ng trabaho,” said Grab driver Dodie Cabatu. (I didn't know that we had to get [those forms] from the LTFRB because their instructions weren’t clear to us. It’s hard because a lot of us will lose our jobs [because of this]).” Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. Pending the LTFRB decision on the MRs, the TNCs' undocumented drivers can continue their services. The LTFRB has also ordered the Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the TNCs after June 30 this year. – with reports from Hannah Mallorca/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-uber-riders-minority-ltfrb","title":"Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB","date":"Jul 26, 2017 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'Sila lang ho 'yung maingay sa social media, [but] definitely government will not budge, we will not be allowed or influenced because of social media,' LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they're just noisier on social media.

What I support is a more comprehensive campaign calling for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until Wednesday, July 26, 2017. Responding to this, Grab and Uber drivers united and launched an online campaign calling on the LTFRB to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers.  I, however, think that saving Grab and Uber alone will not really solve our traffic woes in Metro Manila.  Let me start by sharing my experience with a taxi driver – whose name unfortunately escaped my memory – almost two years ago. Unfair boundary system  He told me that taxi drivers like him work 24 hours a day just so they could reach their boundary and earn enough to support his family for two days.  “Paano 'nyo nakakaya (How do you do it)?” I asked.  “'Ayun Ma’am, lumalaklak ako ng Cobra at kape. Minsan sinasamahan ko pa ng Red bull. Ganoon talaga eh,” he answered with a smile. (Ma'am, I drink Cobra and coffee. Sometimes, I would also take strong energy drinks like Red Bull. That's just how it is.) He said he would spend the following day in bed, gathering his strength for the next cycle on the road. The next day, he would start work at 5 am, weathering the traffic, unforgivable flooding and rain, and fatigue, and clock out exactly 24 hours later. He said this as a matter fact, without the slightest hint of complaint or regret. That is how he is able to put food on the table. How could he complain about it? Since then, I’ve made it my mission to ask every taxi driver I get to meet if this is how they lived. Majority of the taxi drivers – from the youngest to the 72-year-old driver I met – affirmed this.  The only ones who control their time and sleeping habit are those who are rich enough to own a cab. And that’s just a speck of the total taxi driver population in the Philippines.  The plight of bus drivers and conductors who would cram their vehicles with standing passengers during rush hour is no different. They are also limited by the boundary system that defines our public transportation system. This is the reality of many taxi and bus drivers in the country: the public transportation system is plainly inhumane to them.  False dichotomy How does this relate to the \"We want Uber and Grab\" campaign?  The current narrative surrounding the campaign creates a false dichotomy between the ride-sharing apps and traditional public utility vehicles. It is as if to favor one thing, you should be against the other.  But that misses the whole point.  It is true that Grab and Uber have served as an answered prayer for many commuters in Metro Manila,  However, Grab and Uber alone cannot solve traffic. In fact, they only add more franchises and cars on the road, benefitting only a certain portion of the commuter population that could afford its pricing rate on a daily basis. And how they leave more carbon footprint is a totally different matter.  What the country needs is better public transportation which essentially means fewer and more efficient modes of transportation – emphasis on train systems and buses – that have the capacity to transport more commuters.  Because of the false dichotomy, we forget that there are good and bad drivers regardless if they drive a cab or a Grab or Uber car. We’ve read it on social media, in news reports.  There are kind and honorable taxi drivers like Gener Jarito and Jhun Ochavo as there are rude drivers with the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).   Because of the false dichotomy, we also miss the fact the LTFRB is not only being inconsistent with its regulation of franchises. It has also failed to fix the boundary system in taxis and buses, and has fallen short in delivering its mandate to provide a decent means of livelihood for regular public utility vehicle drivers.  What is clear and sure is that it is wrong for the government to cut the lifeline of a temporary and functional solution such as Grab and Uber without providing a long-term solution to traffic for the public.  Proposal What should the government do then?  We are on the cusp of technological disruptions. Airbnb has redefined accommodation. Social media has empowered citizen journalism. Amazon has taken the retail industry on a whole new level. As early as now, we should be asking ourselves: In this age of technological disruptions, how do we make sure everybody gains from them? Right now, with the discussion on public transportation in the Philippines, the onus largely weighs on the government to make sure this gets addressed.  This is why I agree with Grab when it said that “we must level it up by improving the quality of service of other modes of public transport, and bring them at par with TNVS not by back-pedaling on the standards in place we have today.” In fact, the government might just be able to hit two birds with one stone. By learning how to adapt these advancements to benefit our taxi drivers, the government might be able to finally solve the problem surrounding the outdated taxi and bus boundary system that benefits no one but the franchise holders. While doing so, the government should definitely expedite its plan on improving, building, and expanding our train and bus systems. Let us step back and go beyond Uber and Grab. Let us pressure the government to provide an efficient public transportation that we deserve.  Because, honestly, with an efficient train system and better public transportation in general, discussions like these would be irrelevant and everyone would be happy. – Rappler.com   Raisa Serafica is a community manager and social media producer for MovePH, Rappler's civic-engagement arm "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-reply-criticism-uber-grab","title":"LTFRB tells Grab, Uber: 'We will not succumb to pressure'","date":"Jul 17, 2017 4:57 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada warns Uber and Grab against continued operation without permits","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) fired back on Monday, July 17, as an online petition for it to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers gained ground.  The petition demands that LTFRB lift its July 21, 2016, order that closes its doors to new driver applicants for Transport Network Companies (TNCs).   The petition of Grab and Uber drivers has so far garnered 50,000 signatures as the LTFRB decision sparked online outrage from users of the embattled transport network vehicle services (TNVS) providers. \"The board gave both the opportunity to comply to show their good faith. In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced, it will not succumb to pressure,\" LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada said on Monday. According to Grab head Brian Cu, the order might as well have been to close down their business as they need to continuously replenish their pool of drivers to accommodate \"public demand.\" Uber and Grab have allowed their drivers to continue plying the streets and kept on accepting new drivers even though they had expired permits or none at all, prompting the LTFRB to slap them with a P5-million fine each for negligence. \"The TNCs have a duty to explain to their peer operators [why they accredited] them without [permits] issued by the board and that they take full responsibility for putting them at risk of operating illegally,\" Lizada said. To give them breathing space, the LTFRB has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until July 26, 2017. Lizada warned that if they will still refuse to follow their orders beyond that date, their accreditation will be put at risk. \"In the event that both TNCs will continue to defy the order, the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law, considering that both accreditations are under review,\" Lizada said. Grab's accreditation expired last July 3, while Uber's is set to expire in August. While Grab's time is up, the LTFRB allowed them to operate. The LTFRB is now waiting for the full list of accredited drivers and the compliance of both TNCs before passing their judgment. During their show-cause hearing on July 11, Uber and Grab admitted that around 80% of their drivers are not properly documented, but only because the \"majority\" of those with expired permits asking for renewal are just waiting for LTFRB's nod. While laws remain bare in the regulation of application-based transport services, the LTFRB is currently planning a technical working group to better craft policies, as the Philippines is the first country to regulate such services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/pacers-bulls-grab-playoff-spots","title":"Pacers, Bulls grab playoff spots, Heat come up short","date":"Apr 13, 2017 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Paul George's 32 points and 11 rebounds helps Pacers secure the seventh seed while the Bulls earned the eighth seed","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA - Paul George delivered 32 points and 11 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers punched their ticket to the NBA postseason Wednesday, April 12 (Thursday Manila time) with a 104-86 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Jeff Teague added 19 points and 7 assists before twisting his left ankle and leaving the game in the fourth quarter as the Pacers grabbed the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference on the final day of the 2016-17 regular season. Indiana will open the postseason against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference to the Boston Celtics after the Cavs' defeat by the Toronto Raptors 98-83. \"I'm excited about the opportunity,\" said George, who made 12 of 21 field goal attempts against the Hawks. \"I guess that's because we're doing everything right. \"When our back is against the wall, we figure things out,\" he added. \"It just showed the character of this team, that we knew all along that we should have been a playoff team. We just had to figure out how to play the right way.\"  Boston beat the Milwaukee Bucks 112-94 to help relegate Cleveland to the second seed and solidify home court advantage through the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Golden State Warriors are the top seed in the Western Conference and will host game one of a best-of-seven series Sunday against the Portland Trail Blazers.  Having clinched the No. 5 spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs with a Tuesday night victory against Charlotte, Atlanta sat guard Kent Bazemore, guard Tim Hardaway, forward Paul Millsap and guard Dennis Schroder against Indiana. Atlanta will begin the playoffs against the fourth-seeded Washington Wizards. The other missing playoff component heading into Wednesday's final games was who would get the fourth seed in the West. Both the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers won on Wednesday, but the Clippers claimed home court advantage in their first round series based on their head-to-head tiebreaker over the Jazz. Indiana steadily pulled away Wednesday to qualify for the playoffs for a second consecutive season and the 22nd time in the past 28 seasons. Myles Turner added 18 points and eight rebounds for Indiana, which finished the regular season with five consecutive wins. The Hawks were led by Ersan Ilyasova's 15 points. Jose Calderon added 12 and Taurean Prince scored 11. The Pacers got a 14-point third quarter from Teague and made 11 of 17 field goal attempts during a crucial scoring run as they stretched a seven-point halftime lead to an 84-68 lead at the end of the third quarter. Bulls clinch Elsewhere, Jimmy Butler scored a team-high 25 points and the Chicago Bulls clinched a playoff berth with a 112-73 victory over the hapless Brooklyn Nets. \"We all did our job to get us into the playoffs,\" Butler said. \"Now it's about winning some games. We've just got to stick together and focus on ourselves.\"  Rookie forward Paul Zipser added a career-high 21 points off the bench. Chicago claimed the eighth and final seed in the East and will meet the mighty Celtics in the first round. Guard Archie Goodwin scored 20 points to lead the Nets. Brooklyn dropped to 20-62 on the season and finished with the worst record in the NBA and the fourth-most losses in franchise history. Chicago shot 43 percent from the field and 47 percent from beyond the arc. The Bulls finished the regular season with an impressive 25-16 record at home. But it's a different picture when they go on the road, where they have just 16 wins and 25 losses. However, that doesn't worry veteran Dwyane Wade, who is just happy to be in another playoff. \"As a player, 14 years, I think I've been in 12 playoffs,\" Wade said. \"This is what I play for. This is what I enjoy. You always want to play your best when the lights are the brightest.\"  Meanwhile in Miami, Goran Dragic scored 28 points and the Miami Heat fell short of reaching the playoffs despite a 110-102 victory over the Washington Wizards. Miami (41-41) became the first team in league history to finish .500 or above after being at least 12 games below .500. Miami reversed an 11-30 record the first half of the season with a 30-11 finish. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/grab-indonesia-master-plan-2020","title":"Grab Indonesia paparkan master plan hingga tahun 2020","date":"Feb 2, 2017 6:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab akan menginvestasikan dana sebesar USD 700 juta untuk jangka waktu empat tahun ke depan di Indonesia","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia - Perusahaan multi-layanan asal Singapura, Grab, memaparkan master plan untuk tahun 2020 lewat event bertajuk Grab 4 Indonesia 2020 di Grand Hyatt, Plaza Indonesia, Jakarta, Kamis, 2 Februari. Dalam mendukung program master plan yang berjudul Grab 4 Indonesia 2020 tersebut, Grab akan menginvestasikan dana sebesar USD 700 juta untuk jangka waktu empat tahun ke depan di Indonesia guna mendukungnya menjadi negara dengan ekonomi digital terbesar se-Asia Tenggara di tahun 2020. Dalam pidatonya, Anthony Tan, Co-Founder Grab, menyatakan bahwa proyek ini akan terbagi dalam tiga pilar, yaitu penciptaan lapangan kerja serta peningkatan SDM, investasi dalam technopreneurship dan perluasan akses pembayaran mobile. Untuk meningkatkan lapangan kerja dan SDM, Grab akan membuka Research and Development Center di Indonesia dan siap merekrut 150 engineer dalam dua tahun ke depan. Langkah ini juga disertai pemberian kesempatan bagi mereka untuk mengikuti pelatihan riset dan pengembangan di Singapura, Beijing dan Seattle. Sementara dalam hal investasi, Grab akan meluncurkan pendanaan kepada technopreneur yang berdampak untuk kepentingan sosial. Pendanaan ini akan mencapai USD 100 juta bagi start-up yang memiliki komitmen sosial yang tinggi. Pendanaan ini akan berfokus pada industri layanan teknologi di kota-kota kecil yang belum merasakan manfaatnya dari teknologi digital. Sedangkan, untuk memperluas akses terhadap pembayaran mobile, Grab sedang mengembangkan platform pembayaran e-money bersama dengan Lippo Group dan Nobu Bank untuk memungkinkan masyarakat Indonesia menikmati layanan Grab melalui pembayaran dari berbagai mitra retail Lippo.

Setiap perusahaan tentu saja tidak ingin menerima respons bernada negatif seperti itu, terlebih jika iklan tersebut merupakan bagian dari kampanye yang mengedepankan rasa aman pengguna.    Iklan yang merupakan bagian dari kampanye #PilihAman milik perusahaan layanan pemesanan transportasi asal Malaysia ini menampilkan seorang remaja perempuan bernama Dinda yang sedang berjalan. Tiba-tiba sebagian tubuh Dinda terbalut luka dan darah seperti baru saja mengalami kecelakaan. Ia terlihat seperti zombie. Banyak tukang ojek yang mencoba memanggilnya, tapi Dinda memilih membuka aplikasi Grab dan memesan ojek melalui GrabBike. Dan anehnya, tubuhnya kembali normal saat ia menaiki ojek yang dipesan dari aplikasi tersebut. Alur cerita dan voice-over dari iklan ini seolah memperingatkan bahwa jika Dinda memilih ojek lain maka ia akan mengalami kecelakaan. Dengan memilih GrabBike, ia bisa aman. Tapi apakah memang aman? Banyak orang mempermasalahkan iklan ini karena dua hal. Pertama, mereka berpendapat bahwa iklan ini sebaiknya tidak perlu menampilkan gambar yang mengerikan seperti itu. Kedua, klaim Grab yang mengatakan bahwa layanannya lebih aman dibanding layanan ojek lain juga masih dipertanyakan kebenarannya.  Grab sendiri sebenarnya tidak luput dari riwayat kecelakaan. Tahun lalu, pengemudi GrabBike yang tengah membonceng seorang penumpang mengalami kecelakaan. Saya sendiri pernah mengalami kecelakaan kecil saat menggunakan layanan GranBike – untungnya hanya berupa luka lecet.  Meski begitu, saya tidak melaporkannya karena sadar bahwa itu tidak sepenuhnya kesalahan pengemudi. Saya yakin pasti kejadian seperti ini juga banyak dialami penumpang lain. Iklan Grab diakhiri dengan pernyataan bahwa seluruh pengemudi GrabBike lulus pelatihan keselamatan berkendara. Pelatihan ini sendiri menyaratkan pengemudi untuk memiliki dokumen seperti SIM. Motor yang mereka gunakan juga harus menjalani pemeriksaan teratur. Layanan pemesanan ojek online lain juga sebeneranya sudah memberlakukan prosedur serupa. Bagaimanapun, kecelakaan masih saja sering terjadi. Layanan sejenis seperti GoRide dan UberMotor juga tidak luput dari insiden tidak mengenakkan ini. Tidak ada data yang cukup untuk menyimpulkan apakah prosedur keselamatan berkendara bisa menjadi jaminan mutlak bahwa motor yang digunakan bisa menjadi pilihan yang aman. Kita bahkan tidak tahu berapa banyak ojek tradisional yang mengalami kecelakaan, karena mereka tidak terdaftar secara resmi. Menurut data dari Korps Lalu Lintas (Korlantas) Polri, 27.000 orang meninggal di jalan karena kecelakaan pada 2015. Sebagian besar kecelakaan tersebut melibatkan kendaraan bermotor roda dua. Jadi, bisa disimpulkan bahwa terlepas ojek mana yang kita gunakan, mode transportasi yang satu ini memang berisiko kecelakaan tinggi. Iklan yang ‘tidak punya perasaan’ Iklan #PilihAman juga mendapat kecaman karena dinilai menggunakan “rasa takut” sebagai alat untuk menarik perhatian konsumen kepada layanan Grab. Ini bukan kali pertama Grab mengalami isu terkait iklan yang mereka tayangkan. Pada 2015, iklan Grab “Love boobs?” yang ditujukan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran terhadap kanker payudara, juga mendapat kritik pedas dari masyarakat. Video iklan #PilihAman di YouTube sempat berubah menjadi private dan kini telah dipangkas durasinya menjadi jauh lebih pendek.  Berikut adalah penjelasan dari Marketing Director Grab Indonesia, Mediko Azwar: \"Kampanye iklan ‘Pilih Aman’ Grab bertujuan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran tentang bagaimana standar keselamatan berkendara bisa ditingkatkan di Indonesia. Kami berharap video iklan ‘Pilih Aman’ bisa menstimulasi pemikiran – guna mendorong orang untuk lebih peduli terhadap tingkat keamanan dan pelayanan ojek yang mereka kendarai sehari-hari. Video tersebut mendapat reaksi yang beragam dan kami berterima kasih kepada semua orang yang telah membagikan umpan balik mereka. Kami paham video tersebut menimbulkan ketidaknyamaman dan dipandang mengerikan bagi sebagian orang. Kami berharap bahwa mereka yang telah menyaksikan video ‘Pilih Aman’ akan mengerti bahwa niat kami bukanlah menakut-nakuti, tapi menggambarkan konsekuensi yang mungkin terjadi jika kita mengkompromikan standar keselamatan. […] Kami telah mengganti versi asli dari video iklan tersebut. Kami berharap masyarakat akan fokus pada pesan inti yakni untuk meningkatkan keselamatan berkendara bagi seluruh rakyat Indonesia.\" —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-raises-750m-investors","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab raises $750M from investors","date":"Sep 20, 2016 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raises the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion","body":"SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing startup Grab said Tuesday, September 20, it has raised $750 million from investors to expand in burgeoning Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, as it aims to build its lead over US-based rival Uber in the region. The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raised the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion, it said in a statement. Competition between Uber and local startups has grown fierce in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and a rising middle class. Grab is considered the leading ride-hailing platform in the region, operating in nearly twice as many cities as Uber, with the startup claiming up to 1.5 million bookings a day. Singapore state investment agency Temasek Holdings was an early investor in the firm.  Grab said participants in the recent round of fundraising included both new and existing investors which it did not name, but reports last month said China's Didi Chuxing was among those planning to back the firm. The two companies are already partners in an alliance that also includes India's Ola and US-based Lyft Inc, allowing users to book rides while traveling to a country covered by any of the 4 apps. Grab chief executive and co-founder Anthony Tan said the latest investment was \"the largest in the history of Southeast Asia consumer technology\". \"We are particularly excited about the growth opportunity in Indonesia, where we see an almost US$15 billion market for ride-hailing services alone,\" he said. The move follows Uber's decision to sell its business in China to Didi Chuxing last month, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. Grab operates in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Its core product platform includes private cars, motorbikes and taxi-hailing services which are rapidly gaining popularity in the region.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/opposition-trudeau-grabbing-jostling-mps","title":"Opposition in Ottawa assails Trudeau for grabbing, jostling MPs","date":"May 20, 2016 11:15 AM PHT","snippet":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's contrition fails to satisfy opposition MPs, who has accused him of 'arrogance and blatant disrespect'","body":"OTTAWA, Canada – Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced a heap of criticism Thursday, May 19, after he elbowed an opposition MP and manhandled another in parliament the previous day. Trudeau apologized a 3rd time in two days in the Commons for his actions, and said he would accept any sanctions imposed on him by a parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the incident. \"I regret my behavior yesterday,\" he said. \"It should absolutely not have happened.\" \"I am prepared to accept the decision of the committee and to respect the will of this house,\" he added. But his contrition failed to satisfy opposition MPs, who accused him of \"arrogance and blatant disrespect.\" Trudeau had crossed the floor of the House late Wednesday, May 18, pushed through a crowd of Conservative and New Democratic Party (NDP) MPs and grabbed opposition Tory whip Gord Brown by the arm, dragging him toward his seat. As Trudeau reached for the whip, parliamentary video showed he elbowed NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Green Party leader Elizabeth May said that a subsequent heated exchange between Trudeau and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as the fracas was unfolding, had come close to fisticuffs. \"Things are very bad in the House. Nearly a physical altercation between Mulcair and Trudeau,\" she said in a Twitter message. Tensions had been rising in parliament over a deadline to pass legislation on assisted dying. The Supreme Court struck down a prohibition against doctor-assisted suicide and gave Ottawa until June 6 to draft new legislation that would permit consenting adults with serious health problems to end their lives. \"Time is running out,\" Elizabeth May noted. Opposition parties sought to scuttle a key vote on the bill using delay tactics, including obstructing the whip, which led the government to threaten the use of its majority to push through the legislation. Tory leader Rona Ambrose blamed the kerfuffle on the Liberal government's attempts to cut off debate on the bill, effectively \"putting a straitjacket on parliament.\" \"The government doesn't want an opposition anymore,\" she said. \"They just want an audience, which led to last night's events.\" Ambrose accused Trudeau, a boxer in his spare time, and prime minister only since November, of gross misconduct. \"I watched him as he grabbed the official opposition whip by the arm,\" she said in parliament. \"I also watched him as he yelled something so out of line that I will not repeat it in the House. I watched him as he collided with the member who was clearly shaken by his behavior and left this House,\" she said. \"He was out of line. He had no business on this side of the House. He had no business anywhere but in his own seat. Everything he did from the moment he rose from his seat was unnecessary, and it was unsettling.\" – Michel Comte, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/grab-jalin-kerjasama-lippo-group","title":"Grab jalin kerjasama dengan Lippo Group","date":"Mar 22, 2016 10:25 AM PHT","snippet":"Lippo Group merupakan salah satu investor awal dari Grab","body":"  JAKARTA, Indonesia — Aplikasi booking transportasi asal Malaysia, Grab mengumumkan bahwa mereka telah melakukan kerja sama strategis dengan Lippo Group, pada Senin, 21 Maret.  Salah satu konglomerat di Indonesia ini dikenal sebagai pemilik sejumlah ritel, mal, dan rumah sakit ternama yang tersebar di kota-kota besar di Tanah Air.

We urge passengers to rate our drivers and give proper feedback in our app so that we may be able to take corrective actions, if any,' says Grab in a statement","body":" MANILA, Philippines - Amid passengers’ complaints of “abusive and choosy” drivers, GrabPH on Thursday, September 10, issued an apology saying the company is already looking at ways to improve its services. “GrabTaxi has always been committed to providing a better option for public transportation. We would like to apologize to commuters as not everyone was able to get a ride home via our service during the downpour last Tuesday, 8 September 2015,” Grab said in its Facebook page.  Passengers’ complaints on Grab were amplified Tuesday when thousands of passengers were forced to walk home due to traffic bottlenecks caused by torrential rains.  Former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) \"traffic czar\" Yves Gonzalez called Grab’s attention saying that while GrabTaxi markets itself as an alternative from abusive taxi drivers, the app instead is being used by drivers to exploit commuters. (READ: Are Grab drivers abusing commuters’ rights?) “Many of our drivers were affected and got stranded, like the rest of Metro Manila, and were not able to accept bookings as they were caught in the gridlock. The flooded road conditions also meant that they would have risked passenger safety and their cars breaking down,” Grab explained.  Acknowledging that there’s still room to “improve our passengers’ experience,” Grab said it will take the following steps to increase the number of bookings accepted. GrabTaxi is a mobile application, founded in Malaysia in 2011, that allows users to book taxis. GrabCar is the app's alternative form of service which uses cars through licensed partners, in case there are no available taxis during rush hour. ‘Institutionalizing bribery’ One of the causes of passengers’ frustration with the app is its optional “tip” feature, where drivers, according to netizens, wait for big tips before accepting passengers.  “The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered. A tip in the current system is plainly a bribe to the driver for him to accept a trip,” Gonzalez earlier told Rappler. Grab said the purpose of fixed pricing model is to make sure passengers won’t be given unreasonable fares due to unforeseen circumstances on the road.  “In the event that these happen, the tip function allows us to balance out high demand during low supply situations without forcing passengers to pay a surge. There have been varying viewpoints on the value of this feature, and we commit to reviewing it to better suit the market,” Grab said. On complaints about abusive drivers, Grab said: “We will not hesitate to investigate and deregister errant drivers. We urge passengers to rate our drivers and give proper feedback in our app so that we may be able to take corrective actions, if any.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has already asked Grab to explain complaints against its choosy drivers.

As a team, Purefoods shot 56% from the floor against Meralco, who was also outrebounded 53-35.   “We were fortunate that [Cliff] Hodge (ankle) didn’t play tonight - he’s always a big impact player. We were fortunate he didn’t play tonight,” said Cone.   With Hodge out, Meralco head coach Norman Black needed extra help from the rest of his locals to aid their import Josh Davis, who finished with 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 4 steals. Unfortunately for the Bolts, only Gary David answered the call with 27 points, albeit on 11-of-29 shooting.   Jared Dillinger put up 10 points and 8 rebounds.   The star of the evening was Bowles, who missed only 9 of his 25 shot attempts and was feasting on Davis’ defense all evening.   “Denzel got into a rhythm very, very early in the game - a nice, beautiful shooting rhythm,” said Cone, who also mentioned that having a twice-to-beat seed, though now very possible, was not the team’s goal to begin the conference.   “We’re very happy with a best of three,” he said, referring to the kind of series that will be played by the 3-6 seeds. “That was our immediate goal. Anything beyond that is a bonus.”   A three-pointer by Mark Barroca midway through the fourth extended the conference's defending champions' lead to 91-79, but five quick points from Davis - on an and-one play and fastbreak score - gave Meralco a puncher’s chance at a comeback.   The Bolts’ defense tightened up over the next few possessions to stay in the game, but missed jumpers from Mike Cortez, Reynel Hugnatan, and David, a number of which were wide-open, kept Purefoods ahead by two possessions.   With under 40 seconds left, Bowles had to hoist up a tough jumper a little under the 3-point line late in the shot clock, but converted it anyway to provide the finishing dagger for the game.   “We gotta improve on that. We get a little bit too Denzel-dependent,” said Cone. “He needs to be the bonus and our bread and butter needs to be our execution.”   “Guys are going to have to step up and really rely more on their execution and that’s something we’ll work on in practice,” he later added   The Bolts, who are 1-4 in their last five games after starting the conference 5-0, have a remaining match against the Blackwater Elite on Wednesday, March 25.   The defeat dropped them to fifth in the standings right behind the 6-4 NLEX Road Warriors, who own the head-to-head tiebreaker against Meralco.   Scores:   PUREFOODS (96) - Bowles 37, Simon 15, Yap 15, Mallari 7, Barroca 7, Maliksi 5, Reavis 4, Pingris 4, Devance 2, Taha 0, Melton 0,   MERALCO (85) - Davis 31, David 27, Dillinger 10, Anthony 7, Cortez 4, Hugnatan 4, Macapagal 2, Reyes 0, Wilson 0, Ildefonso 0, Caram 0, Ferriols 0.   Quarters: 29-21, 50-45, 78-67, 96-85   – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/vettel-grabs-pole-in-rainy-malaysia","title":"Vettel grabs pole in rainy Malaysia","date":"Mar 23, 2013 2:58 PM PHT","snippet":"World champ Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session.","body":"SEPANG, Malaysia -- Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix Saturday, March 23, in the dying seconds of a dramatic qualifying session which was thrown into chaos by rain. In his final run on a drying track, Vettel stormed across the line in a time of 1min 49.674sec, pipping Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa (1:50.587) and Fernando Alonso (1:50.727) with Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton fourth. Red Bull's Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg of Mercedes will start Sunday's race from fifth and sixth. Kimi Raikkonen, last week's winner in Australia, timed seventh but was hit with a three-place grid penalty for impeding Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button will occupy the fourth row alongside Force India's Adrian Sutil, with McLaren's new recruit Sergio Perez -- second for Sauber in last year's rain-interrupted race -- starting ninth and Raikkonen 10th. 'Interesting qualifying session' \"It turned into an interesting qualifying session,\" said Vettel. \"It was quite tricky because some parts of the track were still wet and others were dry, but still all in all a very good session for us. \"We managed to save some tyres, which could be crucial tomorrow.\" Malaysia's ever-present tropical showers had disrupted Friday practice, and clouds were again looming ominously as qualifying got under way. With track temperatures at a sizzling 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit), Sutil set the pace in Q1 with the Red Bulls of Vettel and Webber trailing in 15th and ninth respectively. Rosberg was leading Q2 when the rain set in, effectively bringing the session to an early halt as the cars returned to the pits -- but not before Paul di Resta had twice lost control of his Force India. Overtaking system disabled With the cloudburst quickly easing, the cars switched to intermediate wet-dry tyres for the final qualifying shoot-out and officials disabled the DRS overtaking system in the slippery conditions. Hamilton ran wide on the slick track but soon recovered to post the fastest time, before he was quickly usurped by Rosberg and then Vettel at the top of the standings after six minutes. With two minutes left, Webber raced through to time quickest, a lead which lasted just seconds as Hamilton crossed behind him in a time of 1min 51.699sec, a lap which seemed to have secured his first pole position for Mercedes. But with the chequered flag waving, Alonso bolted over the line with a new fastest time, followed immediately by Vettel who claimed his 38th pole position -- and boosted his bid to win a fourth straight world championship. Vettel will hope to improve on last week's showing in Australia, when he also started in pole position but dropped back to finish third behind Raikkonen and Alonso. \"I think if you start in the front you always want to finish there as well. I think it will be a long race,\" said the German. Teams will be bracing themselves for more rain on Sunday, after last year's long storm delay in a race which was eventually won by Alonso.

It was the young German's 37th career pole and sets up the world champion Red Bull team as favourites heading into the season-opening race at Melbourne's Albert Park street circuit later Sunday. Hamilton, who has switched to Mercedes from McLaren, had looked set to nab the pole when he lowered the best lap time by 3.3secs to 1:28.087 but Vettel, under the hammer, produced a sizzling final lap to trump the Briton. Webber, bidding to join Jack Brabham and Alan Jones as home winners of the Australian GP, finished second quickest with 1:27.827. Felipe Massa was fourth ahead of his Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso, while German Nico Rosberg was sixth in his Mercedes. Rosberg was quickest in Q2 from Vettel, while Massa and McLaren's Jenson Button scraped into the final stages of qualifying with flying last laps to beat the cut. Button was 11th but switched back to intermediate tyres and got to fourth fastest, while Massa improved from 12th fastest to grab fifth. The six drivers cut after Q2 were Nico Hulkenberg (Sauber), Adrian Sutil (Force India), Jean-Eric Vergne (Toro Rosso), Daniel Ricciardo (Toro Rosso), Sergio Perez (McLaren) and Valtteri Bottas (Williams).

Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber's regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal \"is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab's rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data\" stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab's board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the \"partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.\" The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls \"profound change\" in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a \"once-in-a-century challenge.\" \"I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,\" he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing \"various services involving movement of people around the world.\" Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber's Southeast Asian business earlier this year.

Leo Gonzales, public affairs manager of Grab Philippines, said the company is open to investing heavily in PUV modernization in various cities, including those outside of Metro Manila. \"It can be in the form of modernized jeepneys, it can be buses, almost anything, for as long as we are able to participate in this important part of developing our transportation,\" Gonzales told reporters in Cebu on Thursday, December 21. He said Grab has already approached the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to raise the idea. Gonzales added that Grab's investment would not be limited to Metro Manila but would also include other areas where it operates, such as Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Iloilo, Pampanga, and Baguio. \"We have not yet gone that far into how exactly we will go about it but we want to come in as a company that will probably be able to work with local operators,\" he said. Financial details of Grab's investment plan in the PUV modernization program have not been determined yet as Gonzales said the first step would be to study existing routes and determine new routes that would be created. The company has already partnered with transport researchers to assess existing routes and possible routes, starting with Bacolod, Iloilo, and Pampanga. In Cebu, Grab is open to talking with the City Integrated Transport Cooperative (Citrasco), the biggest transport group in the province, to map out a possible partnership or investment. \"We are open to talking to anyone. Now is the time for transportation operators and movers to really work together,\" Gonzales said. Grab, he added, envisions a single network that would offer all modes of transportation – jeepney, bus, taxi, motorcycle, car, tricycle, and even bicycle. \"If we comply with all the requirements, I am sure that the government will consider us and any other eligible player to take part in the PUV modernization program,\" Gonzales said. According to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Central Visayas, Cebu now has a total of 574,819 registered vehicles and motorcycles to date. This means that from January to December this year, 167,889 vehicles and motorcycles were added to the existing 406,930 registered vehicles, said LTO Central Visayas Director Alita Pulga.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has gone from being behind the scenes tending to the task of managing website addresses to being center stage in a play for power on the Internet. \"Governments want to exert control over the sweeping trans-national power of the Internet that is effecting their policies, politics, social fabric and/or their economic conditions,\" ICANN chief executive Fadi Chehade told the Agence France-Presse just days before the group gathers in Los Angeles beginning Sunday to tackle an array of hot issues. \"The other groups are large corporations concerned about security issues,\" he continued while discussing forces striving for influence over the organization. \"Therefore, they are stepping in with force to figure out how to reduce potential harm to customers and to their businesses.\" Governance of the Internet will be a high-profile topic at the ICANN 51 meeting that will continue through October 16 in Los Angeles. The World Economic Forum recently unveiled a project aimed at connecting governments, businesses, academia, technicians and civil society worldwide to brainstorm the best ways to govern the Internet. WEF launched its NETmundial Initiative in a bid to build on the outcome of a large conference in Brazil in April that called for a transparent, multi-stakeholder approach to running the Web. \"Anyone who wants to come in and build a coalition of stakeholders and address issues, more power to them,\" Chehade said of the crowd-sourcing move. \"The way we put it in ICANN is getting the free will of the people to bottom-up coalesce, work together and come up with solutions.\" Participants at the conference in Brazil balked at a push by some countries, including China and Russia, for governments to move into a leading role in overseeing the Internet, amid fears of the impact this could have on the unity of the Web and on online dissent and freedom of expression. Chehade told AFP that the WEF will be involved in a more action-oriented initiative to be announced shortly. \"We don't need more dialogue, we need more solutions,\" Chehade said. Solutions 'not forthcoming' The ICANN 51 agenda that includes tackling whether identities of those running websites should be public or whether privacy should be safeguarded and operators true names revealed only with proper court orders. ICANN runs a Whois.icann.org service where contact information can be found regarding registered operators of specific websites but not necessarily people behind business names. \"It was designed by engineers as a technical tool to contact servers,\" Chehade said of Whois. \"Now, it is becoming a directory of a billion websites; it was not designed for that.\" ICANN has mapped a path to evolve Whois into a true global website directory, complete with privacy safeguards for website operators, according to the chief executive. Chehade felt that ICANN has a good grip on the technical challenges it faces but \"we have some holes\" in non-technical issues such as privacy, cyber security, intellectual property rights, taxation and more. \"All these non-technical issues that occur in the space of the use of the Internet, rather than the system that runs the Internet, require global frameworks of cooperation to address,\" Chehade said. \"In general, these solutions are not yet forthcoming.\" Pushed too far ICANN is also being pushed beyond its scope, being asked to tackle cyber security and bad behavior by website operators. Essentially, issues beyond protecting and managing the \"root\" of the domain name system are outside ICANN's claimed territory. \"It is happening, and we are resisting it,\" Chehade said. He compared the situation to a customer being treated horribly by a car service opting to take their complaint to the department of motor vehicles that issued the driver a license. What makes it frustrating turning away people with legitimate complaints about websites is there tends to be no where to send them for help, he noted. \"As we move forward, ICANN and others may have roles in an eco-system of cooperation that may involve multiple parties to address bad behavior,\" Chehade said. Critics of ICANN have included France, which branded the US-based body unfit for Internet governance. The eurozone's second-largest economy has been at war with the body, which assigns domain names like '.com' and runs crucial internet infrastructure, over the '.wine' and '.vin' suffixes being rolled out as part of an unprecedented expansion of domains. – Rappler.com Global network with network socket image from Shutterstock"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/vettel-grabs-pole-in-rainy-malaysia-2","title":"Vettel grabs pole in rainy Malaysia","date":"Mar 23, 2013 10:58 PM PHT","snippet":"World champ Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix in a dramatic qualifying session.","body":"SEPANG, Malaysia -- Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix Saturday, March 23, in the dying seconds of a dramatic qualifying session which was thrown into chaos by rain. In his final run on a drying track, Vettel stormed across the line in a time of 1min 49.674sec, pipping Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa (1:50.587) and Fernando Alonso (1:50.727) with Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton fourth. Red Bull's Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg of Mercedes will start Sunday's race from fifth and sixth. Kimi Raikkonen, last week's winner in Australia, timed seventh but was hit with a three-place grid penalty for impeding Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button will occupy the fourth row alongside Force India's Adrian Sutil, with McLaren's new recruit Sergio Perez -- second for Sauber in last year's rain-interrupted race -- starting ninth and Raikkonen 10th. 'Interesting qualifying session' \"It turned into an interesting qualifying session,\" said Vettel. \"It was quite tricky because some parts of the track were still wet and others were dry, but still all in all a very good session for us. \"We managed to save some tyres, which could be crucial tomorrow.\" Malaysia's ever-present tropical showers had disrupted Friday practice, and clouds were again looming ominously as qualifying got under way. With track temperatures at a sizzling 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit), Sutil set the pace in Q1 with the Red Bulls of Vettel and Webber trailing in 15th and ninth respectively. Rosberg was leading Q2 when the rain set in, effectively bringing the session to an early halt as the cars returned to the pits -- but not before Paul di Resta had twice lost control of his Force India. Overtaking system disabled With the cloudburst quickly easing, the cars switched to intermediate wet-dry tyres for the final qualifying shoot-out and officials disabled the DRS overtaking system in the slippery conditions. Hamilton ran wide on the slick track but soon recovered to post the fastest time, before he was quickly usurped by Rosberg and then Vettel at the top of the standings after six minutes. With two minutes left, Webber raced through to time quickest, a lead which lasted just seconds as Hamilton crossed behind him in a time of 1min 51.699sec, a lap which seemed to have secured his first pole position for Mercedes. But with the chequered flag waving, Alonso bolted over the line with a new fastest time, followed immediately by Vettel who claimed his 38th pole position -- and boosted his bid to win a fourth straight world championship. Vettel will hope to improve on last week's showing in Australia, when he also started in pole position but dropped back to finish third behind Raikkonen and Alonso. \"I think if you start in the front you always want to finish there as well. I think it will be a long race,\" said the German. Teams will be bracing themselves for more rain on Sunday, after last year's long storm delay in a race which was eventually won by Alonso.

Ecologists and local authorities have previously touted bottling the water of the world's largest lake as a \"green\" way of profiting from Siberia's natural resources.  But a petition calling on Russian \"patriots\" to demand the removal of an under-construction \"Chinese plant on the shores of our Lake Baikal\" has gathered almost a million signatures.  The water \"will be shipped to China,\" the petition says, warning that the facility will block local access to the lake and \"inflict irreparable damage\" to the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The campaign to shut down the project has spread across social media in recent months without involvement by major environmental NGOs.  The plant was already under construction on the southern tip of the lake, which holds one-fifth of the planet's fresh water.  But on Friday, following the backlash, a Russian court ordered that building work be halted until complaints of violations could be investigated. The company building the plant, previously lauded by the regional government, says it is surprised by the criticism. 'Baikal on tap'  The plant in question, in the village of Kultuk, is built by the Russian AkvaSib company, which had plans to start production later this year. But the financial backing comes from a company called \"Baikal Lake\" based in China's Daqing, according to a statement from the Irkutsk authorities in 2017, when they gave the $21-million project priority status. AkvaSib representative Alexei Azarov said it passed through necessary hearings and got the green light after an environmental assessment.  \"Nobody was against it\" at the time, he told AFP.  Azarov said the facility would not close off village access to the lake, and would provide the locals with 150 jobs, and authorities with tax revenue.  Siberian environmentalist Alexander Kolotov said there were some problems with the plant's location, but that the \"anti-China factor is very clear\" in the current protest.  The case \"hits the bullseye of the fears and stereotypes of modern Russians, that 'China will gulp down our national heritage'.\" It follows similar protests against China cutting down forests across Siberia, which have led some regions to cancel agreements with Chinese companies. Chinese presence in the region exploded after the ruble crashed in 2014 and the Russian government eased tourist visa restrictions. As tourism and business grew, so did local distrust. Last week a state TV report \"Baikal on Tap\" focussed on a Chinese hotel for Chinese tourists officially listed as a private home.  The TV crew unsuccessfully tried to interview the man in charge who did not speak Russian. \"Where is your food permit?\" the presenter shouted as the tourists consumed their lunch, ignoring her.  \"What kind of food is this?\" she asked, opening pots. 'Red rag to a bull' \"For Siberians, there are two things that are like a red rag to a bull and cause an immediate reaction,\" said Svetlana Pavlova, chief editor of Irkutsk-based IRK.ru news website. \"One is the Chinese which 'have taken over everything and leave trash' and the second is encroachment on the lake. And here it so happens that the company building the plant is 99%-owned by Chinese nationals.\" She said the construction boom of often illegal hotels infuriates locals because they themselves cannot get permission to build anything on protected shore.  Locals also don't earn money from Chinese tourists who are serviced by Chinese firms on Baikal, she said. \"There has been a cumulative effect\" which resulted in the anti-plant backlash, Pavlova added. \"People are tired of government inaction.\" Denis Bukalov, a campaigner against the project based in Irkutsk, however said \"it's not not important that it's the Chinese\".  Construction had \"ruined\" the shoreline in Kultuk after the \"illegal\" portioning off of land, according to the campaigner. He said the plant set a dangerous precedent.  \"You can see on the map of registered land ownership that seven parcels of land are set aside for bottling water\" nearby, he said. \"They will turn Baikal into a swamp,\" he told AFP.  Ecologists point out the project has not accounted for its location on wetlands important for birds.  The area is a key feeding ground during migration seasons, with 130 different bird species recorded there.  Some of those have protected status, said biologist Igor Fefelov of Russian Bird Conservation Union. This \"was not even mentioned\" in the plant's environmental assessment, he said. Irkutsk region governor Sergei Levchenko, who backed the plant in 2017, has flipped 180 degrees in the face of growing protest. \"The site is environmentally protected land on all sides,\" he said this week. \"I think this is insurmountable. I don't see the potential for bottling water there.\" Environmentalist Kolotov said the project would likely turn off others from efforts to experiment with green businesses on the lake.  \"It's as if the project was designed especially to discredit the idea of bottling Baikal water,\" he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-adds-restaurants-food-delivery-menu","title":"Grab adds 12 restaurants in its food delivery menu","date":"Jan 8, 2019 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are the international and homegrown food chains now part of GrabFood","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Heads up, foodies!

Since franchises for tricycles are under the supervision of local government units, Grab will be partnering with LGUs to roll out the service.  The Binalonan municipal government in Pangasinan is the first to adopt the premium tricycle service with 24 units. Cu said the fare scheme for GrabTrike Premium depends on the rates approved by the LGU, on top of a P10 booking fee which will go directly to the driver.

In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

Grab officials say the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board was informed about this.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A lawmaker on Tuesday, April 10, accused Grab Philippines of \"illegally\" charging its consumers and said the ride-hailing service should refund its customers P1.8 billion for the last 5 months alone. In an interview with CNN Philippines, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused Grab of illegally charging P2 per minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of P40 and charging P10 to P14 per kilometer. \"Grab charges P2 per minute illegally. They're not allowed to charge P2 per minute. The LTFRB has not allowed them to charge P2 per minute but they have charged P2 per minute to everyone,\" Nograles said. The lawmaker said that based on his calculation, the illegal charges of Grab amounted to P1.8 billion. \"I have calculated that in the past 5 months, they owe P1.8 billion to the riding public,\" Nograles said. Nograles told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday that he arrived at the figure based on the conservative estimate of P1.5 million Grab rides per week, multiplied by the average travel duration of 30 minutes, at a P2-per-minute charge, over 5 months. He said he set his calculation for that period because he only had personal knowledge about the alleged illegal charge 5 months ago.  When Grab Philippines launched its ride-hailing services in 2015, it charged a base fare of P30 and additional P12 per kilometer. There was supposed to be no additional charges per minute. In December 2016, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered a cap on ride-hailing services fares, with Grab maintaining its base fare of P30 and lowering its per kilometer charging to a P10 to P14 range depending on surge pricing. Nograles said that as of 2017, the P2-per-minute charge was \"not approved\" by the LTFRB. The lawmaker said that when he asked the LTFRB about the pricing, he was told: \"Really? Maybe you should talk to Grab.\" \"Alam ba 'yan ng LTFRB o hindi? Kung hindi nila alam, complacency 'yan. If alam nila, graft 'yan (Does the LTFRB know about this? If they don't, then that's complacency. If they do, it's graft),\" Nograles added. Rappler sought a comment from LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada on Nograles' allegation, but she has not yet replied as of posting. Grab repeatedly said in the past that fares will remain as is as it \"cannot unilaterally\" increase the fares.  Although fares right now may not increase given its acquisition of Uber, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition before the LTFRB to increase fares due to the tax reform law. What does LTFRB know? Does LTFRB know about the P2-per-minute charge? LTFRB and Grab have different answers. As far as LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra knows, \"Grab doesn’t charge per travel time.\" Delgra said this in an interview on radio dzRh on Sunday, April 8, when asked about the difference in the fares charged by Grab and Uber.  \"Medyo mataas 'yung Grab kasi nag-o-offer yung Uber ng, aside from the base fare na parehas sila P40 each, 'yung per [kilometer] nila mas mababa 'yung Uber eh, P5.70 per [kilometer] . Pero 'yung Grab P11 to P14 per [kilometer], pero wala sila 'yung travel time. 'Yung Uber naman meron sila travel time, P2 per minute,\" he said on Sunday.  (Grab fares are more expensive than Uber because aside from having the same base fare of P40 each, Uber’s per kilometer charge is cheaper than Grab at P5.70 per kilometer. Grab charges P11 to P14 per kilometer but they don’t have travel time [charges]. Meanwhile, Uber charges travel time at P2 per minute.) Asked about its P2-per-minute charge, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu told Rappler in an interview on Monday, April 9, \"LTFRB is aware.\" Grab spokesman Leo Gonzales, who was with Cu during the brief Rappler interview, said, \"There was a time that we informed LTFRB about this.\" Asked whether the LTFRB held a hearing on the additional charge, Cu said, \"No hearing because at that time, it (fare) wasn’t regulated yet at the start.\" \"The first TNC accreditation doesn't say that pricing will be regulated. It's already in the new ones,\" he added. Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. (READ: Philippines' privacy watchdog summons Grab after deal with Uber) The Philippine Competition Commission had ordered Uber and Grab to operate separately beyond April 8, the date when Uber was supposed to transition its operations to Grab. The LTFRB earlier said it would rather that \"Uber to close down\" by April 8, citing lack of manpower on Uber's backend to handle customer services. Grab Philippines also said operations of the two ride-hailing companies can no longer be separate, as required by PCC for the duration of its review of the deal, as they are currently funding the operations of Uber since the acquisition. The acquisition left thousands of commuters with only Grab as their choice for ride-hailing apps. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grace-de-vera-new-grab-philippines-country-head","title":"Grab Philippines names Grace Vera Cruz as new country head","date":"Oct 15, 2020 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Grace Vera Cruz takes the helm of Grab Philippines on Thursday, October 15","body":"Grab Philippines on Thursday, October 15, said it has named Grace Vera Cruz as its new country head, months after Brian Cu resigned.

He then birdied the 12th and downhill 14th holes ahead of the eagle on 18 in a round that included just 28 putts. \"I played really well today and though it wasn't exactly the start I was looking for in taking the bogey at one, I made two good putts there at five and six and got to under par, and then from there I hit it pretty good and made a few putts,\" said Woods. \"But more than anything, I missed it all on the correct sides. Even the fairways I missed, all were on the correct sides.  \"The shots I missed were on the greens, all had beautiful angles. All in all, I had a lot of control today.\" Fowler capped his round with back-to-back birdies at five and six and while he dropped a shot on seven.

The pair also owns the Japanese restaurant Ryu Ramen.  Their primary competitors are all foreign-owned. Grab and Honestbee are Singapore-based, while Foodpanda is based in Germany.  Users can avail of the service via the app for both iOS and Android, their website, or through their contact center, with the owners believing that there are some customers who still want that person-to-person communication.  The service promises a delivery time of 60 minutes or under, within a 3-kilometer radius. The service also features delivery tracking, including a delivery journal that informs users what stage of preparation their order is.  \"Our primary competency is quality. We want the food to be hot when it's received. We want to provide the closest experience to dining in. And we want to deliver on time,\" said Neil Castillo. \"Trust humans; don't trust animals!\" Castillo joked, poking fun at the two delivery services with animal mascots, Honestbee and Foodpanda.  Currently, Delivery Guy services 35 restaurant brands, covering most of Metro Manila, expecting to ramp up the total number of partner restaurants to 150 by year's end. Service in south Manila, specifically Alabang, will begin in July.  Quality partnerships Neil Castillo said that their strategy for restaurant partnerships leans more toward careful curation rather than having thousands of restaurants on board. \"We want to limit each restaurant type to maybe about 3. For example, 3 brands serving, for example, hotdogs of a certain type, and that's it. We want maximum exposure for all our restaurant partners. That's going to be impossible with 1,000 restaurants, and be able to still market them evenly,\" said Castillo.  Currently, payments are cash-on-delivery with credit card terminals available by July 15.  Pricing is a little bit higher than competition, admitted Castillo. They have P100 off-zone charges for restaurants beyond the 3-kilometer radius, a 10% delivery charge, and a P75 charge for orders below P500. By comparison, GrabFood has a P49 delivery charge within a two-kilometer radius.  Castillo said that this is because they don't want to \"cheapen the service\". They want to have consistent service, consistent employees. To do so, they have fully employed messengers as opposed to the customary network of ad hoc messengers.  The app can be downloaded now. Each download will also contribute P5 to Project Liwanag, a social enterprise providing lighting and electricity to Aeta communities in Tarlac.

Grab is on the cusp of buying Uber's business in some Southeast Asia markets in a deal that would give the California-based smartphone-summoned ride service a stake in its competitor, reported Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. The size of the stake could be around 20% or more than 30%, according to the reports, which cited unnamed sources. Uber did not respond to an AFP request or comment. The US ride share titan faces fierce competition in Asia, not only from Singapore-based Grab but from Ola in India, and Chinese rival Didi Chuxing. Japanese financial titan Softbank has invested billions of dollars in Uber, Didi, Ola and Grab, and is known for seeking synergies between companies in its portfolio. (READ: SoftBank seals deal for large Uber stake) Didi and Uber ended a ferocious battle in the surging Chinese market in 2016 with a tie-up along the lines of the reported deal with Grab. Southeast Asia's top ride-hailing firm Grab launched services in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh late last year as it looked to lock down regional domination against main rival Uber. Grab, which launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia's rapidly expanding market, which is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore investment firm Temasek. While ridesharing giant Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, the US-based company has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe.

We believe education should be accessible to everyone, specifically, tech and digital literacy,” said Andrea Della Mattea, president of Microsoft Asia Pacific. “This encourages ingenuity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, all of which are key to the future.” Grab claims that over 6.6 million workers across the 6 major Southeast Asian countries are going to require reskilling by 2028. Approximately 41% of that number reportedly lack relevant IT skills that new jobs will demand. To narrow the digital skills gap, Grab and Microsoft are combining their resources and ecosystems to fulfill their shared vision to make the economic opportunities in technology accessible for people in Southeast Asia. They aim to train a total of 20,000 people in the region by 2025. There are 3 ways the partnership plans to achieve this. One is by partnering with select universities across the region to train students with technical skills that are in demand by industry. Microsoft will provide the learning materials, curriculum, and certifications, as well as Azure for Education, a platform that provides students access to developer tools for applications; while Grab will facilitate learning experiences such as hackathons and internships. Grab has yet to announce which schools they partnered with. Another way is by providing Grab driver partners access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification program, which has basic courses covering topics such as computer basics, using the Internet, and productivity software. The driver can be awarded a Microsoft certification for free upon completion of the course. These will all be available in the driver’s Grab app. Grab and Microsoft will also help drivers interested in pursuing a career in tech by letting them enroll in a practicum-based curriculum developed by the nonprofit organization Generation: You Employed, or receive certification in Microsoft proprietary courses. Those who will graduate will have opportunities to work for Grab and Microsoft partner companies in technology-related roles. “If the private sector actively creates programs for local communities, technology can be within reach for many, and the learning of new skills can immediately improve the livelihoods for many more people in Southeast Asia,” said Anthony Tan, CEO of Grab. Meanwhile, Grab plans to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs running mom-and-pop shops by digitizing their business and having them integrate the platform’s services so they can reach a bigger market. They also plan to provide them economic access through loans and lending services that can give them the capital they need to scale their business In the Philippines, Grab will start with Jollijeep mobile food stalls by offering them access to GrabFood food delivery and GrabPay cashless payments to help them grow and compete with newer restaurants. The project is expected to kick off within the year and will be expanded to other traditional and home businesses moving forward. The other flagship initiative that was announced is called “Break the Silence”. It looks to champion inclusivity by offering differently-abled people such as those who are deaf and the hearing-impaired an opportunity to earn their own income by becoming a Grab driver partner. At the event, Grab announced they will expand the initiative to Indonesia and Singapore and enhance it in countries where it’s already running – like Thailand and Malaysia. The company currently has over 500 deaf driver partners on the platform and plans to double this number over the coming year. The initiative currently cannot work in the Philippines as the Land Transportation Office does not issue professional driver’s licenses to people who are deaf or have other disabilities. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/ronaldo-fined-mimicking-crotch-grabbing-celebration","title":"WATCH: Ronaldo fined for crotch-grabbing celebration","date":"Mar 22, 2019 12:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Cristiano Ronaldo escapes ban but gets slapped with a 20,000-euro fine for his Champions League celebration","body":"    LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Cristiano Ronaldo was fined 20,000 euros ($22,738) by UEFA on Thursday, March 21 (Friday, March 22, Manila time) for mimicking Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone's crotch-grabbing celebration in Juventus' Champions League last-16 win last week.

Singapore-based Grab in March agreed to buy Uber's food and ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing companies. But Singapore's competition commission found that the deal created a virtual monopoly in the city-state's ride-hailing market, with Grab raising prices after the merger was completed, it said in a statement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticised both companies for going ahead with the \"irreversible\" deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway. \"CCCS's investigations also revealed that the parties had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties,\" the statement said.

Visibly surprised by the information, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III asked Grab representatives during a hearing when the minimum fares were imposed. Grab lawyer Miguel Aguila said they started on June 5, 2017. “Ayusin ’nyo nga ’yung papel ’nyo. Ang gulo,” Delgra told Grab. (Fix your papers. It’s a mess.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles informed the LTFRB in a hearing on Tuesday that Grab Philippines charges \"illegal\" minimum fares, which \"were not declared\" by the ride-hailing company,  Nograles said Grab charges a minimum of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, while the premium cars start at P125. In response to a question, Delgra said during a media interview that the board was not informed of charges separate from the flagdown rate of P40. \"Obviously, [we were] not [informed] insofar as the computation of minimum fare is concerned – compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,\" Delgra said. Delgra said the LTFRB is not yet considering suspending Grab's minimum fares, but the board needs a clarification on the matter. \"We won't necessarily remove this, but we are asking for clarification. We are only following the 4 elements in determining fares,\" he said in Filipino.  Delgra said that the fares depend on the computation of the flagdown rate, the distance traveled, time charges, and the surge pricing. Under the government-approved fares, Grab charges an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer and has a surge cap of twice the distance traveled on top of the flagdown fare. Grab said that it was never the company's intention to \"hide\" the fare from its patrons. \"What you see on the app, that is an upfront fare. If it is a minimum distance, it's a minimum fare, we never tried to hide it from the general public,\" Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said. Illegal charges? Nograles earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker's allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges. \"If they truly subject themselves to the board, then why didn't they apply to the board? Their only formal application for it was January of this year, way after they unilaterally imposed it,\" Nograles said. The lawmaker said Grab's move puts into question the authority of LTFRB as a regulatory agency. LTFRB earlier said they were not consulted either when the P2-per-minute fare was initially charged.  The ride-hailing company' legal counsel argued that the P2-per-minute charge was added to cover the costs of the drivers when picking up the passenger at their pinned location in the Grab app. During the hearing, Delgra asked Grab to submit to the board the company's earnings since the P2-per-minute charge was imposed. For the drivers Winson Esteras, leader of the coalition of transport network vehicle services, said on Tuesday that the P2-per-minute charge helps drivers cope with the costs incurred by longer travel time due to traffic congestion. \"Kung mapapansin 'nyo naman na hindi na talaga kami kumikita.... Pa'no 'yung traffic? 'Yung fare ngayon hindi na aligned sa sinisingil na gas sa amin,\" Esteras said. (If you notice, we're not earning a lot.... How about the traffic?

The measures – which take the country into uncharted legal waters – come after Spain's King Felipe VI on Friday blasted what he said was an \"unacceptable secession attempt\" and said the crisis sparked by the region's banned October 1 independence referendum must be resolved \"through legitimate democratic institutions\". \"We do not want to give up that which we have built together,\" he pleaded.

Rajoy is likely to announce plans to take control of Catalonia's 16,000-strong police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, whose leader Josep Lluis Trapero could face up to 15 years in jail on sedition charges for failing to contain separatist protests ahead of the referendum. Madrid could also seek to force new elections – its preferred solution to Spain's most protracted political crisis since it returned to democracy in 1977 – as early as January. Rajoy is due to hold a press conference early Saturday afternoon to announce his plans, which must pass through the Senate where his conservative Popular Party holds a majority -- a process that would take about a week. Speaking on Friday night at the Princess of Asturias Awards – Spain's answer to the Nobels – King Felipe described Catalonia as \"an essential part of 21st century Spain\". 'Hellish mess' EU leaders, who were at the ceremony to collect a prize for encouraging harmony in Europe, used their acceptance speeches to demand respect for the law in words that offered implicit backing to Madrid. \"Some are sowing discord by deliberately ignoring law,\" European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said at the awards night in the northern city of Oviedo. He added pointedly: \"All too often in the past the prospect of redrawing borders has been presented as a heavenly panacea that has resulted in a hellish mess.\" As tensions continue to run high, independence supporters are set to rally in Barcelona Saturday evening calling for the release of Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, the leaders of two powerful grassroots separatist groups who have been in jail since Monday pending investigation into sedition charges. Puigdemont says he has a mandate to declare independence after the referendum, which his administration says resulted in a 90% Yes vote. But turnout was given as only 43% as many Catalans who back unity stayed away from the banned vote. Accounting for about a fifth of Spain's economic output, Catalonia is evenly split over whether to break away from Spain, according to polls. Supporters say the wealthy region does too much to prop up the rest of the national economy and would thrive if it went its own way, but opponents say Catalonia is stronger as part of Spain and that a split would spell economic and political disaster. Nearly 1,200 companies that have shifted their registered domiciles to other parts of Spain since the referendum, hoping to minimise instability. Madrid this week cut its national growth forecast for next year from 2.6% to 2.3%, saying the standoff was creating uncertainty. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-lost-grab-uber-accreditation-papers","title":"LTFRB lost Grab, Uber accreditation papers","date":"Jul 21, 2017 2:05 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED)The LTRFB board under the Duterte administration has been looking for the documents since it assumed office, says board member Aileen Lizada","body":"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has (LTFRB) lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber, board member Aileen Lizada said on Friday, July 21.

After they are approved, the OED no longer has any reason to keep the documents. They are passed on to the Board already for their signature,” Cabrera said. Former LTFRB board member Ariel Inton, for his part, said the supposed loss of the documents is both unlikely and easy to remedy. Inton said former LTFRB legal counsel Robert Peig worked with the current board during the members' \"first few months\" in office, so they can ask for his help. He added that the LTFRB can ask Grab and Uber for new copies of the accreditation requirements if necessary. Grab's accreditation expired on July 3 while Uber's is set to expire by August. They have been sought for comment regarding the accreditation documents but have not replied as of posting. Lizada spoke up about the supposed missing accreditation papers days after the LTFRB reportedly reached a \"compromise\" with Grab and Uber on the LTFRB's July 11 order that it would begin apprehending their colorum drivers starting July 26. This was achieved in a meeting initiated by several senators. The TNCs have appealed the order.

(READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab) \"This is a classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal. Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system, but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,\" said Karlo Nograles.  Poe and the Nograles brothers filed similar bills, which would require transportation network companies and drivers (TNDs) to “exercise diligence” in ensuring their drivers would comply with all requirements and obligations set by the government. Among the requirements to be able to operate a TNC specified under the measures are as follows:  The bills would also require Uber and Grab to strictly adopt a zero-tolerance policy on the use of drugs and alcohol of its drivers. TNCs would not be allowed to exceed the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity for their cars. All vehicles must not be more than 10 years old and should comply with vehicle emission standards.  Meanwhile, Senator Joel Villanueva also filed Senate Resolution Number 431, calling for a probe into the process LTFRB employs in granting franchises to TNCs.  \"We want to hear all the stakeholders to come up with the best solution to immediately address this problem. At the end of the day, we hope there will be a fair compromise between the government and the [TNC] providers, with the end goal of providing more covenient options to our daily commuters,\" said Villanueva.  Villanueva said fellow senators Juan Edgardo Angara, JV Ejercito, Sherwin Gatchalian, and Juan Miguel Zubiri have expressed support for the investigation he is seeking. – with reports from Camille Elemia/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grabtricycle-rides-mandaluyong","title":"Grab offers free tricycle rides in Mandaluyong","date":"Mar 27, 2017 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Passengers can use the ride-hailing app to book a free tricycle ride in selected areas in Mandaluyong City from March 27 to April 5","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing service Grab is beta-testing a new service using a very Filipino mode of transportation: the tricycle.  From March 27 to April 5, Grab users in Mandaluyong City can avail of free tricycle rides to get around selected areas, using the app to hail and book a ride with just a few taps.  The service is available from 8 am to 5 pm, along the following streets:  To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabTricycle icon on their app, select pick-up and drop-off locations within the specific areas mentioned, and add the promo code GRABTRIKE before booking.

Aturan tersebut tertuang dalam Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan Nomor 32 tahun 2016. Salah satu perusahaan angkutan online, Grab, mengatakan masih mengkaji peraturan baru ini. “Saat ini kami masih merujuk kepada peraturan sebelumnya dalam memastikan mitra koperasi kami memenuhi semua arahan dari pemerintah,” kata Managing Director Grab Indonesia, Ridzki Karmadibrata melalui siaran pers yang diterima Rappler pada Jumat, 22 April 2016. Terkait aturan baru ini, Ridzki mengatakan ada sebagian isi peraturan yang bisa menimbulkan kekhawatiran. Salah satunya pada model bisnis dan kerja sama dengan pihak pengemudi. Permenhub 32 tahun 2016 yang ini akan mulai berlaku enam bulan sejak tanggal diundangkan, yakni 1 April 2016. Berikut isi Permenhub nomor 32 tahun 2016: Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kemenhub Pudji Hartanto menjelaskan beberapa perubahan yang tercantum. Pertama, untuk menyelenggarakan angkutan umum tidak dalam trayek, seperti mobil rental, perusahaannya wajib mempunyai izin yang dikenakan penerimaan negara bukan pajak (PNBP). Perusahaan yang dimaksud juga harus berbentuk badan hukum Indonesia, yaitu BUMN, BUMD, perseroan terbatas atau koperasi. “Persyaratan untuk memperoleh izin adalah memiliki lima kendaraan yang dibuktikan dengan STNK atas nama perusahaan,” kata dia. Alasannya, kendaraan angkutan berbasis aplikasi daring sebagian besar merupakan kendaraan pribadi. Karena itu, STNK-nya juga atas nama pribadi.  Mobil semacam ini harus diubah kepemilikannya menjadi STNK atas nama badan usaha. Aturan tersebut ditetapkan untuk mengantisipasi apabila pemilik tak lagi bergabung dengan perusahaan. “Saat itu ia bisa mengambil kembali kendaraannya, dan mengambil STNK pribadi lagi,” kata dia. Perusahaan juga harus memiliki pool, fasilitas perawatan kendaraan yang dibuktikan dengan dokumen kepemilikan atau perjanjian kerja sama dengan pihak lain. Untuk pengemudi yang dipekerjakan sesuai dengan golongan kendaraan. Syarat-syarat tersebut adalah akta pendirian, bukti pengesahaan sebagai badan hukum, tanda daftar perusahaan (TDP), surat izin tempat usaha (SITU), surat pernyataan kesanggupan sebagai pemegang izin dan pernyataan kesanggupan menyediakan fasilitas pemeliharaan kendaraan.  Dia menambahkan dalam rangka pengawasan, perusahaan penyedia aplikasi harus melaporkan profil perusahaan, memberikan akses pengawasan operasional pelayanan, data perusahaan yang bekerja sama, data kendaraan dan pengemudi, serta layanan pelanggan berupa nomor telepon, email dan alamat perusahaan kepada Direktur Jenderal.  \"Jika terjadi pelanggaran akan diberi sanksi berupa pembekuan sampai dengan pencabutan kartu pengawasan kendaraan bermotor,\" katanya.-dengan laporan dari Antara/Rappler.com BACA JUGA:   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/jason-day-heritage-lead","title":"Jason Day grabs share of Heritage lead","date":"Apr 16, 2016 12:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipino-Australian Day fires a two-under par 69 in challenging, windy conditions to grab a share of the lead halfway through in South Carolina","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA - World number one Jason Day powered through the fatigue lingering from last week's Masters campaign to seize a share of the halfway lead on Friday at the RBC Heritage. The Filipino-Australian Day fired a two-under par 69 in challenging, windy conditions at Harbour Town Golf Links in Hilton Head, South Carolina. He shared the lead on six-under par 136 with Americans Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell, who both posted 68s. The top trio were one stroke in front of another 3 players that included overnight co-leader Luke Donald, who carded a 71, Scotland's Russell Knox (65) and American Patton Kizzire (68). Day, who had bogeyed the last hole on Thursday to drop out of a share of the lead, said gusting winds on Friday made life difficult. \"It would be 20 miles per hour and then suddenly die down,\" Day said. \"Very, very tough day out there. I'm glad I got it in at two-under.\" Day, who teed off on 10, finished with 4 birdies and two bogeys. His bogey at the par-five fifth, his 14th hole of the day, came after he hit out of bounds trying to hit a draw around the dogleg. \"I was just trying to sling a draw around the corner, and got way too far on the inside and got stuck and just plugged it way right,\" Day said. It was a mental mistake, Day said, the kind that can creep in after the kind of tough major championship campaign that he slogged through at Augusta National last week. \"I felt like I went 10 rounds in a championship fight (at the Masters). It just beat us up, physically and mentally. \"I may be a little mentally fatigued but there's no excuse. I've got to focus,\" added Day, who went into the Masters off back-to-back wins at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the WGC Match Play. Former world number one Donald, who shared the first-round lead with South Africa's Branden Grace, bounced back from a double-bogey at his fifth hole of the day, the par-three 14th, picking up two birdies in his last nine holes to post an even par round. \"I didn't quite have it today, especially on the front nine,\" Donald said. \"\"I was searching a little bit in my swing. \"But I really grinded it out pretty well, got some good up-and-downs and played a really solid front 9 coming in.\" Eighty-two players made the halfway cut.

Diego Palomares, a former judge and assemblyman, led the group with orders from Tanay Mayor Rafael Tanjuatco, according to the Georeserve’s statement. The group successfully occupied the area despite protest from the Georeserve. During this time, the latter said the police did nothing.  On the night of March 9, police officers, led by Chief Inspector Bartolome Marigondon, allegedly entered the conservation area to take away the evidence.  Marigondon, however, told Rappler he was not involved in any operations in the area, and police were in the area as part of their regular patrols.  He also denied claims that officers were part of the land grabbing operations, saying they would only step in if it became a matter of peace and order, or if they were ordered to intervene. Fences ‘a clear safety risk’  The Tanay Municipal Government denied these claims and accused the Georeserve and its developer, Blue Star Development and Construction (BSDC), of placing the fence dangerously close to the Marikina-Infanta Highway, a national road.  In their own statement countering the Georeserve’s accusations, the local government said BSDC received letters from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Rizal II District Engineering Office District Engineer Adilbert Rosete about the fencing.  “Why was BSDC so adamant to voluntarily take down a clear safety risk even after two notices of obstruction and prohibited uses (January 29, 2016 and February 11, 2016) sent to it by DPWH Rizal II?” it  asked. “The claim that the fencing is against public interest, particularly farmers, is absolutely illogical and completely unfounded,” said the Georeserve. “It is also not our fences which have barbed wires on them that may be harmful to motorists, and is closest to the road in the said area...Ours are cleanly made and have been sturdy enough to prevent several motorists from falling into nearby cliffs.” Permit concerns  The statement from the Georeserve said it will move to the municipality of Baras, in Rizal, where it said its “conservation works are appreciated” and where “all permits have been appropriately dealt with and renewed.” This move and the Georeserve’s statement saying Tanay’s government does not have jurisdiction over its activities “are totally without basis as the land title of the lot identifies Tanay as its location.” It added that BSDC had been securing its permit from the Tanay government for 15 years.  For now, however, it said conservation activities, visits, and maintenance will “proceed as usual” while the Georeserve and the Tanay municipal government look for a resolution in court. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/lawmakers-grabbike-cease-operations","title":"Lawmakers to GrabBike: Cease 'illegal' operations","date":"Feb 3, 2016 2:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says while it will comply once it receives the order, it also wants to work with transport authorities to craft regulations specifically for the motorcycle service","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Despite an order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), ride-hailing service GrabBike is still continuing its operations because the cease and desist order had been sent to the wrong entity.  In a hearing of the House committee on transportation on Wednesday, February 3, Grab's vice president for public affairs Nina Teng said the LTFRB letter dated January 21 was addressed to MyTaxi.PH, which offers transport network vehicle services (TNVS) GrabTaxi and GrabCar. But the motorcycle ride-hailing service is being operated by a separate company – Grab Bike Incorporated – even though it also uses the same app-based platform.  \"We are still operating GrabBike as we speak. The cease and desist letter was sent to the wrong entity....Once the GrabBike entity receives the cease and desist, we will honor that,\" Teng said. Last week, the LTFRB ordered the suspension of the GrabBike service, saying MyTaxi.PH has not been accredited to offer the use of motorcycles or bikes as part of its business model. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) \"We will have no option but to cancel MYTAXI.PH's accreditation if they continue to offer motorcycle transport service which is not part of its business model and not what the Board had envisioned for TNCs and TNVS,\" LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said in a statement. During the House hearing, Teng said the GrabBike service aims to address a strong demand from commuters for a faster and more efficient form of transport, given Metro Manila's hours-long traffic jams. She said that most GrabBike passengers take the service when they are in a hurry, or if they only need to travel shorter distances, such as transferring from the train station to a bus stop. Teng also said that around 2.6 million motorcycle drivers stand to gain from the employment opportunities provided by the company. But committee chairman Catanduanes Representative Cesar Sarmiento said that with the absence of approval from the LTFRB, GrabBike should cease operations because it is still operating illegally as a public utility vehicle. \"If you are transporting passengers from one point to another, then you are a public utility vehicle. And if you are a public utility vehicle, you must secure an authority coming from the LTFRB. In the absence of an authority from the LTFRB, you are a 'colorum' [vehicle],\" Sarmiento said. While Teng said the company would comply once it receives the cease and desist letter, she also said Grab would like to work with transport authorities to craft regulations specifically for the motorcycle service, similar to what it did  when the transportation department laid out rules for new transport categories covering the ride-hailing services. \"We also want to offer a solution to the government....If you take the case of GrabCar, it wasn't regulated at first. Now it is. When it first began, it really was a service for the people, just like GrabBike,\" Teng said. She added that the GrabBike service, which operates much like the local habal-habal, aims to create a safer, more regulated form of motorcycle-based public transport. \"If you're going to have habal-habal in Metro Manila anyway, and it's unsafe and operating illegally, and there's a solution to make it safer and to regulate it with the government, we're very open to explore that option,\" Teng said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-senator-threatens-pm-abbott","title":"Australian senator threatens to grab PM's testicles","date":"Jul 7, 2015 4:14 PM PHT","snippet":"An independent Australian senator Tuesday, July 7, threatens to physically intimidate Prime Minister Tony Abbott if he does not limit coal-seam gas exploration","body":"SYDNEY, Australia – An independent Australian senator Tuesday, July 7, threatened to physically intimidate Prime Minister Tony Abbott, using illegal rugby tactics including grabbing his testicles, if he does not limit coal-seam gas exploration.

Revealed by The New York Times, The Hemisphere Project is reportedly a cooperative between local and federal drug officials and telecommuncations giant AT&T. According to the report, the US government \"pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country.\" The employees help Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and local detectives, providing them with phone data from 1987 onwards - 26 years of records. The program began in 2007, according to the presentation revealed by the New York Times. Hemisphere covers every call passing through an AT&T switch, whether it was made by an AT&T customer or not. The slides says 4 billion call records get put into the database every day, with some calls getting more than one call record. The New York Times got the slides from Drew Hendricks, a peace activist from Port Hadlock, Washington. According to the New York Times report, Hendricks received the powerpoint presentation, which was unclassified but marked \"Law enforcement sensitive,\" after sending out public information requests to West Coast police agencies. While the Obama administration acknowledged Hemisphere, it was noted that the phone data isn't stored by the government. Rather, AT&T stores the phone data, which is then queried using administrative subpoenas, which are subpoenas issued by a federal agency rather than a judge or grand jury. The report also noted that \"Mark A.

The Safety Center is a centralized access point that contains all of the app's safety features. Through this button, passengers will be able to share their ride details, report safety concerns, ask for emergency assistance, and review safety information.  After reporting a safety issue, the passenger will receive a digital response within 30 minutes, and a resolution period of two to six hours. When immediate action is needed in transit, passengers could also be connected to proper authorities. Grab has already partnered with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group for crime prevention and accident response. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said that the safety center is a continuation of their Safety Everyday Tech Roadmap which was initiated in 2018. It wasn't brought about by any uptick in criminality. Rather, it was a move to strengthen their safety proposition.  \"We went back to our roots and said 'why did we launch Grab?' It was safety, convenience, speed. So convenience we sort of solved, speed we fixed the algorithm, safety... was part of the process, but it wasn't part of the business that we really invested in as much as we did in fixing the algorithms, fixing the speed,\" he said. They decided to put in 'real budget' for safety development. Cu said they have invested at least $20 million on engineering support, feature development, and insurance to improve the app's safety. Aside from this new feature, Cu said they are also looking for more women drivers. This is to increase the likelihood of matching women passengers to women drivers so harassment incidents can be reduced. Cu also clarified that drivers go through gender sensitivity training when they get onboarded.  \"We take safety very seriously, from onboarding partners all the way up to while they're in the app. So it's a bunch of retraining on safe driving, retraining on gender sensitivity, even retraining with partners such as the Highway Patrol Group and even with some health partners as well,\" added country marketing head RJ Cabaluna.

After the acquisition, Grab only accepted Uber drivers on the LTFRB masterlist. The list consists of drivers who can apply for a franchise from the regulatory board. So, out of 19,000 active Uber drivers, Cu said only 11,000 were able to move to Grab. Around 6,000 or majority of the remaining Uber drivers weren't on the masterlist and could not switch. \"We appeal to the LTFRB to allow the displaced 6,000 Uber drivers who are not part of the masterlist to continue driving with their chosen TNC (transport network company) in order to support the demand,\" Cu said. He added that with an average of 12 rides a day, each vehicle will be able to serve an additional 72,000 rides which would \"ease the plight of the riders.\" The LTFRB earlier raised the \"common supply base,\" or the number of allowed franchises under transport network vehicle services (TNVS), to 65,000 units in Metro Manila, 1,500 in Metro Cebu, and 250 in Pampanga.

After the LTFRB ordered Grab to stop the P2-per-minute travel charge, the ride-hailing firm filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the alleged illegal charge goes to the drivers and not to the company. \"[T]he P2-per-minute travel time fare component was legal [based on a 2015 Department of Transportation order], and necessary to protect the livelihood of driver partners while sustaining transport demands of the riding public.

Meanwhile, others said that the app shows how much a rider will have to pay at the end of the trip, which gives commuters the option to not book the ride if they find it expensive.  Higher fares? Grab Philippines head Brian Cu explained on Wednesday, April 18, that fares are \"not higher\" because they \"did not increase fare pricing\" after they acquired Uber. Cu said it appears that fares are higher because Grab absorbed \"100% of the demand\" when Uber left the market but they have yet to absorb all Uber drivers to meet the demand. \"The demand base is fully absorbed. It's easier for the demand to flow than it is for the supply to flow,\" he said. (READ: Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us) According to Cu, about 40% of the Uber drivers from their masterlist had onboarded with Grab since they started the process early April. The country head also said that they will be employing stricter measures to avoid driver cancellations such as changing their incentive scheme for drivers. Cathy Toh, Grab Philippines marketing head, also invited passengers to continue reporting impertinent drivers. She said they had doubled their internal customer service team to address their woes. Grab is the only transport network company currently offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber closed down on April 16.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu made the statement in response to questions in a press briefing on Wednesday. \"Riders were not informed [of the additional P2-per-minute charge]. There were no comms (communication) to the riders,\" Cu said, when asked if Grab riders were informed of the charge through the Grab app or via social media. Cu said that there is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the \"upfront price\" or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip. This includes the computation for the travel duration charge. \"The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors [are charged] and it's fixed,\" he added. The company head maintained that Grab is \"transparent\" in its charges, and reiterated that there was nothing illegal in charging the P2-per-minute charge, contrary to the allegation of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. \"Hindi namin tinatago 'yung fact na nagcharge kami ng P2 per minute since July (We are not hiding the fact that we charged P2 per minute since July). We are well within our rights to charge the P2,\" Cu said. Cu said that their rates are now shown on their website. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) Grab charges a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The travel duration charge is added on top of the base fare and distance charges. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is investigating the alleged \"illegal\" charges. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. 'Fares are legal' Miguel Aguila, Grab's lawyer, maintained that the ride-hailing company's travel duration charge is legal. Aquila cited the Department Order (DO) 2015-11 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), which he said allows Grab to set fares on its own. \"Grab would like to set the record straight. Our fares are legal: 'Fares are set by the TNCs (Transport Network Company) and is subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions in the market,'\" he said. On Tuesday, April 17, Cu, Aguila, and Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua appeared before the LTFRB to explain why Grab's accreditation should not be suspended or revoked amid allegations of  unauthorized charges. Aguila also said that the LTFRB was informed about Grab's pricing scheme through the technical working group (TWG) in July, or a month after Grab started to impose the travel duration charge.  (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Why change fares on your own?) He added that the email correspondences with the LTFRB on Grab's fare pricing scheme also transpired last year. Back to drivers, passengers Cu also said that the P2-per-minute charge did not go to the company, but benefitted both riders and passengers. \"Fares are more fair for both sides and this P2-per-minute did not go to Grab. But it went to the drivers, it was reinvested by way of incentives or promos for passengers,\" he said. Some Grab operators and drivers earlier expressed fears that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Nograles had said that drivers should be spared if a refund is ordered by the regulatory agency. Cu also said that Grab always complies with government regulations. When the LTFRB ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare, it immediately implemented it, he said.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) gave this order on Wednesday, April 11, to Grab, telling the ride-hailing service to lower its surge pricing cap during peak hours from 2.0 to only 1.5 times the normal fare. Surge pricing was capped at twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare. This amends LTFRB's December 2016 order setting the fare structure of Grab.  The order is effective immediately. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the board deemed it reasonable to lower Grab's surge pricing cap since consumers are left with only Grab as their option for ride-hailing services, given the latter's acquisition of Uber. \"The board directs Grab to lower its surge from 2 to 1.5. Why? [The] LTFRB is processing the new TNC players. This is to ensure that the fares will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,\" Lizada said during a hearing on Wednesday. The cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab. Lizada said that the cap would be reviewed after new players have come in. Grab spokersperson Leo Gonzales said they understand the need for the cap to be lowered. \"We understand their justification for this. This is a critical time. As soon as new players come in, the board will have to study again. But , of course, we will comply with further downgrading the cap from 2.0 to 1.5x,\" Gonzales said.

Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,\" Nabua said. No impact on data breach probe The NPC on Tuesday said Uber's merger with Grab would not affect the agency's ongoing probe into a data breach in 2017, which exposed information on drivers and users of Uber. \"This sale does not affect our ongoing investigation into past Uber breaches that involved Filipino users,\" Liboro said. \"This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,\" he added. Back in November 2017, the chief executive officer of California-based Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, announced the firm failed to disclose a massive breach that exposed information on over 57 million users of the application.

Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber's latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. \"Today's acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,\" said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. \"The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.\" Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab's board as part of the deal, said: \"This deal is a testament to Uber's exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.\" Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber's losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-franchise-applications-grab-uber-tnvs","title":"Grab, Uber partners can now drive ‘worry-free’","date":"Mar 5, 2018 8:17 PM PHT","snippet":"With the LTFRB now accepting again franchise applications, Grab and Uber drivers no longer have to worry about getting apprehended on the road for being ‘colorum’","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber partners can now drive worry-free, as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) opened franchise applications on Monday, March 5. The application started at 8 am, with the first applicant completing the entire process within 10 minutes. Juliet Bulaon, a Grab partner, lined up as early as 6:30 am to make sure she would finish first. \"It's a relief. Now that [we have the papers needed], I won't be worrying about our [car getting apprehended] all the time,\" she said in Filipino on Monday. Bulaon is among the 66,750 operators who are expected to apply for their Provisional Authority (PA) as a step to eventually getting their Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) franchise. After 10 working days, Bulaon will return to the LTFRB for a hearing that will determine whether she will be granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). If that is granted, she will get a franchise that will last for two years. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu echoed Bulaon's sentiments, saying many TNVS drivers worry about getting apprehended by traffic enforcers for being \"colorum.\" \"They can now drive without worrying that they will be apprehended for the reasons that they are colorum vehicles – they are not,\" Cu said. Smooth process LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada described the process on Monday as \"very smooth.\" They were able to process about 50 applications within the first hour. \"The applicants have complete documents with them that's why the flow is smooth. There are some minor setbacks (with incomplete documents), but it's manageable,\" Lizada told reporters on Monday. Based on initial talks, LTFRB is set to process 300 applications per day – with Grab and Uber alloted 150 slots each. (READ: LTFRB to accept franchise applications for lease-to-own cars but...) But Lizada said they were able to finish all 300 applications before 2 pm, so the regulatory board will increase the number of applications they can accommodate in succeeding days. Transport Network Companies (TNC) Grab and Uber have set up assistance centers near LTFRB to ensure that applicants have all the requirements needed. Easier booking As the LTFRB opened up franchise applications, the TNCs think that booking for services will now be easier. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines' public policy head, said more drivers would be encouraged to get on the road now that are holding the proper documents. Grab's Cu also said that that booking will be smoother, as issuing franchises is one way to determine whether the supply of TNVS vehicles will meet the demand on the road. \"This is the step to get the right number of vehicles. We will see whether the supply will meet the demand. LTFRB will assess in the next months whether there's a need to increase the numbers,\" Cu said. In 2016, LTFRB suspended accepting new applications for TNVS permits for ride-hailing apps due to the rising volume of applications and concern of oversupply of units. Earlier in February, the regulatory board set the cap at 66,750 units, but said it would review the figure if the demand for TNVS is not met. (READ: Poe to LTFRB: 'Explain the math' behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles)– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-launch-service-clark-international-airport","title":"LOOK: Grab PH launches services from Clark International Airport","date":"Mar 2, 2018 5:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Nearly 400 units will be available to provide ride-hailing services for passengers from the country's second main gateway","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Passengers can now book Grab rides from the Clark International Airport.

The application for TNVS permits opens on Monday, February 5, and it will be done on a \"first come, first served\" basis.

Currently, there are around 125,000 units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber Philippines, exceeding the cap twice over. When asked whether current and active drivers would not be prioritized, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said \"that seems to be what is happening.\" Cu said they are hoping the LTFRB will consider using the transport network companies' master list of active drivers and prioritize them during the application period. \"What we're proposing, and hopefully that gets settled, is that they (the LTFRB) use the submitted master list as basis of who's active... I don't want to log jam the applications that are not complete or are not active and I think a lot of people will agree to that,\" Cu said. He also urged the LTFRB to review the cap, suggesting ways on how to arrive at better numbers. Given the total registered number, Cu said there are probably around 90,000 unique units or some 40% less the total registered vehicles. \"You subtract those who are not active.

I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There's a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it's propaganda, it won't last). They can spend millions and it will not take off. For sure meron silang (they have) PR, lets just agree on that,” Poe said. Poe, also the public information committee chair, said she would not even try to regulate it. “No, I’m not going to regulate that. Pero yung fake news, pwede kayo maging liable diyan (but fake news, you can be held liable for that),” she said. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before Congress to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. Uber has called on the LTFRB to stop imposing ancient policies on today’s technological innovations. But taxi operators have denounced the seemingly undue advantage of Grab and Uber, saying taxis and TNCs are both engaged in the same business but the latter are not being regulated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-grab-uber-drivers-minimum-hours","title":"LTFRB eyes 'minimum working hours' for Grab, Uber drivers","date":"Jul 27, 2017 12:36 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says this will ensure that the ride-hailing services fulfill their duty to serve the public, and deter the practice of operating only when surge prices are high","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Thursday, July 27, that it is \"seriously considering\" setting \"minimum\" working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. In a press briefing, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the LTFRB qualifies transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers as \"public service\" so they should observe a minimum number of hours on the road – just like government workers – to fulfill that duty. \"So if ever we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours na dapat online kayo. Kasi kung bibigyan kayo ng prangkisa, pero two hours a week lang kayo babiyahe, sayang. Bibigay na lang natin sa iba 'yung prangkisa,\" Lizada said. (So if we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours that they need to be online. Because if we will give franchises, but they will only work for two hours a week, it would be a waste. It would be better to give the franchise to other operators.) The board member said the measure will help regulate the drivers of TNVS operators, as there are currently 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers plying the roads. Imposing minimum working hours, Lizada said, would also respond to a recently-revealed practice of Grab and Uber drivers who only go on the road \"when surge prices are high.\" Currently, Grab classifies drivers as part-time if they stay on the roads below 40 hours a week, and full-time if they clock higher hours. Uber, for its part, classifies drivers as \"casual drivers\" if they operate below 10 hours, part-time if below 40, and full-time if above 40. The LTFRB bared the plan a day after its second technical working group meeting with Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 26. On Wednesday, the agency announced that it ordered the deactivation of drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017. Lizada said they hope to be done with the meetings by September 2017, and produce memorandum circulars to fix the regulation deadlock. After that, the LTFRB plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. There are bills filed in both houses of Congress seeking to regulate TNVS providers. The transport network companies had earlier filed motions for reconsideration to delay the implementation of the LTFRB's order issued last July 7, which instructed both TNCs to purge drivers without adequate documents. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-new-financing-didi-chuxing-softbank","title":"Grab to raise $2.5B in new financing","date":"Jul 24, 2017 1:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The Singapore-based firm says it will use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay","body":"SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said Monday, July 24, it expects to raise $2.5 billion in financing, mostly from China's Didi Chuxing and Japan's Softbank, as it strengthens its lead over rival Uber.

They appealed to the LTFRB to lift its July 21, 2016, order, which bars TNVS applicants from getting provisional authority permits (PAs) from the agency. Without PAs, new drivers waiting for the processing of their TNVS franchises cannot ply the roads. Citing \"public demand,\" however, Grab and Uber continued to accept new drivers and let them ply the metro's roads even with expired or without PAs.  Of 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers, 26,600 have expired or no permits. The LTFRB issued a July 11, 2017, order, slapping both transport network companies (TNCs) a P5-million fine each, and marked July 26 – Wednesday next week – as the start of apprehension of drivers without proper documents. Grab and Uber put the apprehension day on hold as they filed motions for reconsideration of the July 11 order. However, the order which put the PA moratorium remained in effect. In their defense, the drivers accredited only by TNCs and not by LTFRB said they also underwent screening in obtaining their accreditation. \"After undergoing stringent screening, training, and drug tests, we received our accreditation from our [TNCs].... Even though many in our ranks do not yet have a PA, it is hard to consider us as fly-by-night 'colorum' drivers. Remember we underwent screening, training, NBI clearance, and drug tests,\" their statement said.

He said he will push for their inclusion in the upcoming technical working group talks, where so far only the LTFRB, Grab, and Uber representatives are included. \"I will take it up with the LTFRB. They (drivers) are stakeholders. So, definitely. I am not saying anything, that's a decision that [the LTFRB needs] to make, but definitely they need to be heard,\" Orbos said.

Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua said they argued in their MR that the LTFRB did not inform them when it would lift the moratorium on accepting new driver applicants.

However, Grab said they are already taking steps to follow LTFRB as they have not allowed new drivers who do not have permits from the LTFRB to operate. Uber, for its part, continues to let new drivers without permits to operate, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada. The number of these undocumented drivers grew dramatically over the last year because of an earlier LTFRB order which had barred new drivers from applying for provisional authority (PA) permits. These PA permits allow TNVS drivers to operate for 45-135 days, and precede the longer certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise which lasts from 1-7 years. With the LTFRB preventing the inflow of new drivers needed by TNCs to replace those who leave, Uber and Grab continued to accept and allow new drivers even without permits from the LTFRB. They also allowed drivers who had expired permits to continue to operate. This prompted the LTFRB to fine Uber and Grab P5 million each for negligence, and set the deadline for the removal of undocumented drivers. With their defiance of the LTFRB, Grab and Uber put themselves in hot water as their accreditation as a TNC is still under review by the regulatory board. But with overwhelming public support, they are confident they will pull through.  \"The enforcement has been ongoing since last year in all cities where we operate.

According to the LTFRB, of the 10,054 names of active drivers that Uber submitted, they found that the PA of 5,850 were dismissed while 3,505 are still in the process of applying. This leaves less than 2,000 as having complete permits. Grab has not submitted its list. According to TNVS drivers themselves, the number of \"colorum\" drivers spiked in the last year mainly because of LTFRB Memorandum Circular (MC) 2016-008 which suspended the issuance of new PAs beginning July 21, 2016. (READ: Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications) In addition to negligence, the LTFRB also took into account the TNCs' violation of LTFRB MC 2015-016, which mandates the following: 'Strong passenger demand'   Grab country head Brian Cu admitted in the hearing that they accepted new drivers despite the earlier order of the LTFRB. \"Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers... we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],\" Cu said. When asked by Delgra whether the move was for \"marketing reasons\" so that competition would not get their clients, representatives from Uber agreed. In their defense, Grab and Uber invoked passengers' needs. \"In all honesty everyone we accepted since July are still 'colorum.' They remain on the road. Because there is [a] demand that is needed to be met, we let them,\" Cu said. Delgra noted, however, that demand does not justify illegal operations. He likened the TNCs' alibi to a manufacturer of fake license plates who argues there is demand for such. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber's operations should have been shut down. But according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, the interest of the riding public \"overrides\" the provision. But while the transport network giants were not ordered closed, their accreditation as TNCs will still be reviewed. Grab's accreditation expired on July 3, while Uber's is set to expire in August.

TopSpeed and Busypaps, organizations consisting of at least 250 Uber and Grab drivers, urged on Friday, July 7, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to lift their ban on new driver applications. “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority,” TopSpeed Bobby Coronel said, reading their petition. (We are appealing to the LTFRB, we hope you listen to our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues who still do not have provisional authority [permits].) They are rallying against an LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2016-008 issued on July 21, 2016, which suspended the applications for the provisional authority (PA), or temporary permits to operate, for Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applicants.  The order was released to limit operations of TNVS while LTFRB prepares a pitch on how to further regulate TNVS providers. The Philippines is the first country to regulate TNVS service providers. TNVS simply pertains to any transport service where commuters and drivers get matched through an application. The 45-day PA permit is the precursor for the regular permit, which is renewed every 3 years. Ever since the order was implemented, thousands who wanted to drive for transportation network companies (TNCs) or providers of TNVS, were barred from applying.  This has forced the aspiring TNC drivers to go to other transport services like airport car services, or to become taxi drivers, Coronel said. 7,000 in limbo While applicants have been rejected from applying as TNVS drivers, some 7,000 already-accredited drivers did not get their PAs renewed in 2016, with all of them having expired PA permits by December 2016, Busypaps president Jephthe Gamad said. \"We are not colorum by choice, our colleagues were left with no choice,\" they said in the petition.\"Many of us were unemployed, some are retirees. We were given the chance to be productive in becoming partners of TNVS companies.\" LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra clarified in an earlier press conference that the drivers can “renew or extend the PA”. Drivers applied for renewal and extension, but according to Gamad, LTFRB has not processed their applications. \"Nakapagpa-renew naman kami. Ang problema lang kasi hindi kami nilalabasan ng papeles, (We renewed our PAs, but the problem is that they have not given us our documents),\" Gamad told Rappler. He added that since December 2016 most drivers already had expired PAs. Some continued to drive and said that they were not apprehended by the LTFRB, while some were forced to go off the road. As drivers who do not own the cars they drove, they were forced off the road by their operators – the car owners – who feared penalty from apprehension. \"Medyo masakit on our part, we do our best to give riding experience to our commuters. Yun lang ang tanong eh, bakit tinatangkilik pa rin kami kung pangit ang serbisyo namin?\" Coronel told Rappler. (It pains us that we are doing our best to provide [a good] riding experience to our commuters.

Senator Grace Poe, chair of the public services committee, filed Senate Resolution 262 seeking a congressional inquiry into the unfair practice and the need to create standards to limit it. During the holiday season, passengers complained of the unfair price increases, with surge amounts ranging from P2,000 to P28,000. Poe denounced this, saying it is just similar to the “kontrata (contract)” system rampant among regular taxi cabs, which passengers try to avoid by using TNCs. “The surge pricing experienced by consumers is no different from 'kontrata,' where cab drivers would demand a fixed and excessively high fare during rush hours and the holiday season,” the senator said in her resolution. She also cited cases in other countries like Australia and the United States, where Uber had been criticized for increasing its fares during disasters and emergencies such as the Sydney hostage crisis and Hurricane Sandy. “Here and in abroad, commuters have complained that sometimes, the ride they requested would suddenly get cancelled, and when they request for a new ride, surge pricing appears,” she added. Congress should craft guidelines While the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has ordered Uber and Grab to limit the fare increases, the senator said Congress should craft guidelines to curb surge pricing. (READ: LTFRB warns Uber, Grab over unreasonable price surge) In pushing this, Poe said lawmakers abroad have already tried to address the problem by proposing “to ban surge pricing or put a cap on it.” In the House of Representatives, a bill has been filed banning the \"exorbitant\" and \"undue\" rate surges. A counterpart bill has yet to be filed in the Senate. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian filed a measure in August 2016, but it focused only on the regulation of TNCs, without specific provisions prohibiting unfare price surging. Poe also asked Congress to look into how TNCs have been used by some businessmen to skirt franchising laws and operate a fleet of private vehicles, “resulting in further traffic congestion.” “TNCs should not lose sight that their services are mainly for the convenience of the riding public, which is why they were awarded a certificate of public convenience.” The transportation department's Department Order No. 2015-11 allows TNCs \"to determine their fares in line with efforts to encourage innovation in public transportation in order to increase mobility on major thoroughfares, boost travel time, improve the quality, sustainability and reliability of public transport services, and respond to the needs of the modern commuter.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/demo-sopir-taksi-uber-grab-izin","title":"Pemerintah akhiri kisruh taksi konvensional vs online","date":"Mar 24, 2016 5:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber dan Grab diminta lengkapi izin dalam dua bulan.

Selama itu, Uber dan Grab diminta untuk memenuhi tiga syarat yakni: Semuanya, menurut mantan direktur PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) ini, sesuai dengan Undang-Undang No. 22 tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. Dengan demikian, operasi Grab dan Uber akan sesuai dengan hukum di Indonesia. Dilarang ekspansi mitra bisnis Selama masa transisi yang berakhir pada 31 Mei 2016 mendatang, kedua perusahaan asing ini dilarang menambah rekanan bisnis. “Dilarang menambah mitra pengemudi dari badan layanan transportasi, atau pun perorangan, yang tidak sah,” kata Jonan. Menteri Komunikasi dan Telekomunikasi Rudiantara mengatakan akan ada sanksi bagi mereka yang bandel, ataupun belum memenuhi syarat pada 1 Juni mendatang. Sedangkan Kementerian Koordinator Politik, Hukum, dan Keamanan akan mengawasi, dan memberitahu perusahaan mana yang masih membandel. “Kalau dibilang tutup, nanti saya tutup,” kata Rudiantara.

Dalam dokumen tersebut, Kemenhub menyebut keberadaan kedua perusahaan itu telah menimbulkan keresahan dan konflik di kalangan pengusaha angkutan resmi dan pengemudi taksi resmi serta meyuburkan praktek angkutan liar (ilegal). Hal lain, keberadaan dua perusahaan itu turut membuat angkutan umum semakin tidak diminati. Dengan mempertimbangkan semua aturan itu, maka dalam surat tersebut Kemenhub mendorong dua hal: 1. Kemkominfo segera memblokir situs aplikasi milik GRABTAXI dan UBER serta melarang seluruh aplikasi sejenis. 2. Tidak bekerjasama dengan perusahaan angkutan umum lain yang tidak mempunyai izin resmi Lalu, apa komentar Kemenhub mengenai surat tersebut? Kepala Pusat Komunikasi Kemenhub, JA Barata membenarkan surat yang beredar di dunia maya tersebut. \"Surat itu memang sudah ada dan baru dikirim ke Kemkominfo pagi tadi. Yang melaksanakan pemblokiran nanti juga Kemkominfo,\" ujar JA Barata ketika dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa bedanya kebijakan Kemenhub saat ini dengan yang dikeluarkan Menhub Ignasius Jonan pada 17 Desember 2015? \"Kalau kebijakan saat ini hanya tertuju kepada Taksi Uber dan Grab Car karena perusahaan angkutan ini dianggap melakukan pelanggaran terhadap UU yang berlaku, karena di dalam UU itu diatur syarat untuk mendirikan perusahaan taksi,\" kata Barata. Sementara, yang dituntut oleh Kemenhub dalam kebijakan 17 Desember tahun lalu, menyasar angkutan aplikasi online gojek dan grab bike. Barata menegaskan tidak ada aturan khusus mengenai angkutan transportasi umum sepeda motor. Pada 17 Desember 2015, Kementerian Perhubungan juga melarang Gojek dan Grabike beroperasi tetapi larangan itu dicabut sehari sesudah diumumkan. Pencabutan kebijakan dilakukan usai Presiden Joko Widodo memanggil Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan ke Istana Negara.  Kemenhub, kata Barata, menyerahkan sepenuhnya keputusan akhir pemblokiran aplikasi online kepada Kemkominfo. Regulasi tak dipegang Kemkominfo Sementara, Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika, Rudiantara mengatakan tak akan menutup transportasi berbasis online. Rudiantara bahkan berpikir, jika memang aplikasi tersebut dinikmati oleh masyarakat maka sepatutnya dicarikan solusi alternatif. \"Dari sisi Kemkominfo, kami tidak relevan mengatur mengenai regulasi. Hal itu seharusnya ditangani oleh Kemenhub, dishub daerah dan pemda,\" ujar Rudi ketika ditemui di kompleks DPR Senayan pada Senin, 14 Maret. Justru dia mengatakan tidak semua aplikasi harus mengajukan perizinan. Kecuali jika startup di bidang e-commerce itu memberikan pelayanan kepada publik, mereka membutuhkan akreditasi, tapi itu semua diserahkan ke industri. Kemkominfo justru ingin menerapkan light touch regulation, sehingga jika membutuhkan izin, hanya keluar dari satu pintu. \"Kalau izin cukup dari dirjen ya maka dari dirjen saja. Nanti, dirjennya melapor ke saya,\" kata Rudi. Dia bahkan mengkritik jika segala sesuatu membutuhkan perizinan dan diurus oleh pemerintah, maka sektor tersebut tidak akan kompetitif. \"Itu kan idenya anak muda. Untuk apa start up minta izin? Ketika memulai kan belum tentu jadi bisnis, jadi tinggal lapor saja ke Kemkominfo,\" tuturnya.  Kendati begitu, Rudi menyebut akan terus berkoordinasi dengan Ignasius terkait dengan kebijakan ini. Beri waktu 15 hari Sementara itu, Ketua Paguyuban Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Cecep Handoko yang ditemui di kantor Sekretaris Negara mengatakan mereka dan pemerintah sudah mencapai kesepakatan. PPAD memberikan waktu 15 hari kepada pemerintah untuk mengeluarkan kebijakan agar GRABTAXI dan Uber mematuhi aturan yang ada. \"Iya, permasalahannya ini kan di regulasi. Kami merupakan pengendara mobil pelat kuning itu dibebani berbagai macam aturan hingga ke penetapan ongkos. Maka, jika mau setara, mari dibuat Peraturan Presiden atau Instruksi Presiden yang tidak perlu legislasi hingga nanti ada revisi terhadap UU Lalu Lintas tahun 2009,\" kata Cecep. PPAD menegaskan mereka akan terus mendesak Kemkominfo untuk segera mengambil tindakan tegas agar segera menerapkan rekomendasi dari Kemenhub. \"Maaf, bukan bermaksud sombong, tetapi kami beri waktu 15 hari. Kalau enggak ada tindak lanjut, maka kami akan demo lagi. Sebab, ini sudah menjadi kegelisahan kawan-kawan pengemudi,\" tutur Cecep. - Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/binay-camp-pena-credit-grabbing-epal","title":"Binay camp accuses Kid Peña of ‘credit-grabbing,’ ‘epal’ moves","date":"Sep 7, 2015 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"The city government's PR department says it's putting out advertisements for Acting Makati Mayor Kid Peña because it has underspent on this front","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The camp of suspended Makati City Mayor Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay Jr slammed acting Mayor Romulo “Kid” Peña Jr for issuing a “self-serving” media statement allegedly crediting himself for the city’s tax collection figures for the first half of the year. “Having been in his post for barely two months at the time the total income of the city was tallied, it was presumptuous, if not downright brazen, of Peña to attribute the 90% attainment of this year’s target total income of the city to his administration,” Binay’s spokesperson Joey Salgado said in a statement on Monday, September 7. “This is a clear example of credit-grabbing, something that the acting mayor and his people have been doing for the past weeks,” he added. The latest report from the Makati Treasury Department showed that from January 2 to August 20, the city has already achieved 90%, or P11 billion out of P12.28 billion of its target revenue collection for 2015. However, Salgado said that prior to Binay’s suspension in June, the total revenue collection had already reached P9.5 billion. “Official financial records will show that Makati has consistently increased its annual revenue collection for the past two decades,” said Salgado, who is also the media affairs head of Vice President Jejomar Binay, who was mayor of Makati for 21 years. “It cannot be denied that the business-stimulating policies put in place by the Vice President during his term, which were continued and enhanced by his son, Mayor Junjun Binay, built and sustained a high level of investor confidence in the country’s financial center,” Salgado said. He added that the city “never incurred” a deficit in the last two decades under the Binays. ‘Bagong Makati’ Last week, Peña released a statement saying that the “transparent and good governance being implemented in the city government of Makati is now gaining ground,” and one proof of this, he said, is the growth in tax collection. “Rest assured that under the ‘Bagong Makati’s (New Makati)’ guiding service principle, we shall serve with transparency, fairness and integrity,” said Peña, who used a term referring to Makati under his leadership. “Everyone can stand proud because equal services will be delivered to the business community and all the people of Makati. Regardless of status and color, together we will enjoy the good life,” he added.  Elected vice mayor, Peña replaced Binay in an acting capacity following Binay’s 6-month preventive suspension order from the Ombudsman. On Monday, Peña’s spokesperson Gilbert delos Reyes denied that the acting mayor was taking the credit from Binay. “Sa tingin ko, hindi naman [‘yun] credit-grabbing. Masaya lang siya (Peña) kasi sobrang taas nung collection at 'yung projected target ay na-hit agad even before matapos ‘yung two months niya as acting mayor,” Delos Reyes told Rappler. (I think that’s not credit-grabbing. He’s just happy because the collection was high and the projected target was hit even before the end of his two months as acting mayor.) He added that they had been receiving testimonials from residents supposedly lauding Peña’s governance of Makati. “Kaya doon sa pagbabayad ng buwis, consistent sila (That’s why they’re consistent in paying their taxes).” Epal Kid? In his statement, Salgado also slammed Peña’s “flagrant misuse of government funds” by using money from the city’s coffers for print advertisements promoting “Bagong Makati” that appeared in various newspapers on Friday, September 4. Salgado said these “do not serve the public interest at all” and are instead “aimed for self-promotion or [being] ‘epal.’” \"Epal\" is a derogatory reference to public officials who advertise themselves using government projects. “The recent print advertisements of Peña are obviously self-serving and merely intended to promote his own image. They do not serve any public information purpose and do not befit Makati’s standing as a financial center,” Salgado added. Delos Reyes came to the defense of Peña, who previously announced his interest to run for mayor in 2016. (READ: Running for Makati mayor? History shows odds will be against Kid Peña) “Walang direct hand d'yan si acting mayor (The acting mayor had no direct hand here),” said Delos Reyes, who is the current officer-in-charge of the Makati Information and Community Relations Department (ICRD). He said that he decided to make use of ICRD’s remaining advertising expenses because the budget allotted budget for it is being underspent, with a utilization rating of 16.68%. According to ICRD records, the approved budget for advertising expenses is at P51.95 million. However, as of July 31, the city government only spent P8.66 million. Delos Reyes said the advertisements are part of the city government’s social marketing program to promote its projects for the youth. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/de-lima-power-grab-norberto-gonzales","title":"Gov't vows 'full force' vs 'power grab' plotters","date":"Feb 22, 2015 6:47 PM PHT","snippet":"Justice Secretary Leila de Lima slams Arroyo allies over actions that can 'be contemplated as conspiracies relating to sedition, rebellion, or coup d' etat'","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The government vows to apply the “full force of the law” against the President's critics who push for an “unconstitutional and illegal power grab,” Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said Sunday, February 22. De Lima singled out the National Transformation Council (NTC), a group composed of allies of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The group includes Norberto Gonzales, a former defense secretary and national security adviser under the Arroyo administration. In a statement, De Lima slammed the NTC for urging “the installation of a civilian-military junta.” She pointed out that the group wants to become “the de facto government” of the Philippines. She also criticized the NTC for proposing or conspiring “to commit the crime of coup d'etat,” as when it requested the military's support. “The NTC’s pronouncements and publicly declared strategy for the capture of state power through active military support to the NTC are therefore acts which already constitute conspiracy or proposal to commit rebellion and coup d’ etat (Art. 136 in relation to Arts. 134 and 134-A, Revised Penal Code), conspiracy to commit sedition (Art. 141 in relation to Art. 139, RPC) or, at the very least, inciting to sedition (Art. 142, RPC), as well as illegal assemblies (Art. 146, RPC),” the justice secretary said. She explained: “A junta by any other sanitized name is still illegal and unconstitutional. By calling for people power and military support to force the President’s 'resignation' in order to pave the way for a junta, the NTC and its mushrooming allied alphabet soup organizations of discredited government officials consisting of charged plunderers, grafters, and tax evaders, or of those under investigation for such crimes, may have just crossed the line of legitimate dissent.” “The government will not relent in applying the full force of the law against them in order to protect the people and the State from an unconstitutional and illegal power grab,” De Lima said. Reports of a coup plot surfaced as President Benigno Aquino III faces the worst crisis of his presidency: a bloodbath in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, that killed 44 members of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), 18 Muslim rebels, and at least 3 civilians.  'Perverting nation's grief' On February 16, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV – a former coup plotter himself – earlier identified Gonzales as among the persons trying to oust Aquino.  “Ang papel ni Norberto Gonzales, manggulo sa Pilipinas,” Trillanes said. (The role of Norberto Gonzales is to sow confusion in the Philippines.) Rappler is still trying to reach Gonzales as of posting time.  In her statement on Sunday, De Lima accused the NTC of spreading the word about a supposed coup threat. She said the reported threats “are not coup threats in the strict sense of the word” because they “do not come from any section of the government's security forces.” She said this is part of the NTC's “carefully formulated” strategy – “in the false hope of propagating it legally in the mass media and among supporters without however accruing any criminal liability under the penal laws on rebellion, sedition, and coup d’ etat.” “This is a false hope, since certain actions already implemented by the group, from organizing foras and conferences of supporters and sympathizers, can already be contemplated as conspiracies relating to sedition, rebellion or coup d’ etat,” De Lima said. De Lima stressed that “any civilian or religious-led putsch will not succeed” because the military “will never support” a junta led by ex-officials and bishops affiliated with Arroyo.  “It is the height of pathetic gutter politics, when the tragic loss of 44 police officers killed in the line of duty is used by disgraced pathological personalities to crawl their way back to national relevance, at the expense of the people’s effort to come to terms with the complex issue of peace in Mindanao in their search for justice for the SAF 44,” she said. De Lima said, “The nation is still grieving, and without any sense of shame, these personalities would use the people’s grief to pervert a national catharsis, serving only their own thirst and craving for absolute power by imposing upon this nation a tyranny of religious and political has-beens.” The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, for its part, also rejected extra-constitutional measures as bishops linked with the NTC call on Aquino to quit. (READ: Cardinal Vidal not calling for Aquino resignation – secretary) The NTC's moves came as various groups and individuals, including the President's uncle, Jose \"Peping\" Cojuangco, also called on Aquino to quit. A group led by Cojuangco staged an anti-Aquino rally on Sunday at the EDSA Shrine, a monument to remember the People Power Revolution in 1986 that toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos and catapulted the President's mother, Corazon, to power. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/smart-communications-gigamania-prizes-freebies-2020","title":"Smart celebrates the season of giving with GIGAMANIA","date":"Dec 4, 2020 7:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Over Php 30 million worth of exciting prizes and weekly freebies are up for grabs","body":"[Editor's note: With the GigaLife app, Smart Prepaid, Smart Postpaid, Smart Bro, and TNT subscribers can enjoy various prizes and freebies.

Actually, to be more precise, I judged by its title.   There is just something about a well-thought-out title that immediately grabs your attention. The title is the comic book’s figurative handshake.  Combined with striking cover art, the title goes a long way in convincing you to do a double-take at the bookstore shelf – or in the case of internet shopping, to stop scrolling – long enough so you can read the synopsis or flip through a few pages.   When the title is prosaic or downright lazy (and there are many of these, too), you are much more likely to pass it up.  And though there are times the comic book may not live up to the hype the title creates, there are an equal, if not greater, amount of times that they do. Here are the most remarkable titles I’ve encountered these past few months – titles which piqued my interest enough, allowing me to discover remarkable comic books that I may not have otherwise noticed.  Werner Dell’Edera and Miquel Muerto’s visceral and unsettlingly sparse art enhances the grim but unputdownable story penned by James Tynion IV in Something is Killing the Children. Judging from just the title, the story seems sufficiently straightforward. A disturbing wave of cases of children who go missing or who meet gruesome deaths sweep through several small towns in the United States.   Enter Erica Slaughter. She is a monster hunter and a card-carrying member of an Order that traces its lineage back to St. George, the 5th century warrior-saint and dragon-slayer. Erica is sent by the Order to hunt down the monster which is killing these children. The known reported case was in Archer’s Peak, Wisconsin. But there is one catch: aside from children and Erica, none of the adults see the monsters or believe they even exist. Who in his right mind thinks monsters exist anyway? The police department's primary suspect in the murders is a serial killer. And Erica, the mysterious stranger from out-of-town, seems to fit this bill. She arouses strong suspicion when she arrives at Archer’s Peak. After all, she kept asking peculiar questions about the Archer’s Peak cases, had two machetes in her backpack, and was last seen going into the woods where the children disappeared, hauling a shopping cart full of gardening shears, knives, and a chainsaw. By the end of the first story arc in issue #5, we know without a shadow of a doubt what is killing the children. And we are emboldened by Erica’s uncanny ability to hunt down and kill these monsters. This is small comfort, however, since we discover that things are not as straightforward as they seem. What caused the surge in monster attacks? Is Archer’s Peak just a prelude to a larger attack? What is the truth behind Erica Slaughter and the shadowy Order of St. George?   Each succeeding issue raises the stakes for both Erica and the children of Archer’s Peak in this critically-acclaimed, immersive, and compelling read.  Nominated for a 2020 Eisner Award for Best New Series, Something is Killing the Children is haunting and extraordinary.  It comes to no surprise that what began as a 5-issue mini-series expanded into an ongoing title in response to public clamor.   If you missed out on the single issues, the trade paperback for volume 1 (issues 1 through 5) was just released.  Volume 2 (issues 6 through 10) came out in November. The title says it all. A basket with a lot of heads inside. But what kind of heads are these? What are they doing there? Who put them there? Of course, the enigmatic cover art, of a cloaked woman holding an axe, might have already tipped you off as to what this comic book is about. Basketful of Heads is part of a line of horror-themed titles under DC’s Black Label for mature readers, curated by Joe Hill, horror master Stephen King’s son.   Joe Hill is himself an Eisner Award-winning (for Locke & Key, now a popular Netflix series) acclaimed horror writer, and this is in full view in Basketful of Heads, which he himself wrote. Complemented by the vintage comic book-inspired art of LEOMACS and Dave Stewart, this is a fast-paced and layered tale of corruption and deception that experiments with story-telling techniques.   While on vacation, June Branch is trapped by an unseasonal, violent storm on Brody Island, off the coast of Maine with her boyfriend Liam, who is working part-time as the island’s Sheriff’s assistant. A group of recently-escaped convicts kidnap Liam and soon comes after June.   But they are in for an unexpected and deadly resistance. While hiding out in the Sheriff’s house, June arms herself with a cursed Viking axe. She is at first unaware that the axe is cursed, but this soon becomes evident due to the ease at which she is able to relieve each convict of his head and the terrifying way the disembodied heads retain the ability to speak.   Before long, June has a basketful of human heads, each of whom has a malevolent tale to tell. In order to unravel the mystery and stay alive, June needs to uncover whether these tales are part of the truth, are self-absolving confessions, or cunning trickery meant to lure her into a trap.  Basketful of Heads is an ingenious take on the whodunit. The comic book uses creative narrative structure to ensure that neither June nor the reader is in full possession of the facts. We follow June every step of the way, piecing the puzzle along with her. And we are surprised by the twists and turns as much as our axe-wielding heroine. The hardcover collecting all 7 issues of Basketful of Heads was released in early September. This book is as exquisite as its title. Written by Ram V, with art by Sumit Kumar and Vittorio Astone, These Savage Shores is a masterclass in creating a comic book classic.   Poetic language coalesces with haunting, textured art to tell an engrossing and ambitious tale set against the backdrop of the Anglo-Mysore Wars in the 18th century.  Though epic in scope, These Savage Shores provides an intimate portrait of love, loyalty, betrayal, and evil told mainly through the eyes of star-crossed lovers Bishar and Kori, the fanatical vampire-hunter Zachariah, and in the epistolary style reminiscent of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. These Savage Shores is both history and allegory. 18th century India and England come alive in story and art. Ram V and Sumit Kumar painstakingly and vividly recreate the time period, from the landscape, costumes, rituals, and personalities, including a historically-accurate depiction of Hyder Ali, Sultan, and ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. They set the stage for the defining battles of the Anglo-Mysore Wars and provide keen insight into the politics of the day. The tale is also a poignant allegory of English colonial abuse in India. A vampire coven journeys from London to the subcontinent via East India Company ships to avenge one of its kind who was killed after attempting to victimize the local populace.  They discover soon enough that in India, there are beings more ancient and powerful than vampires, and they do not take kindly to those who threaten their home.   For in These Savage Shores, “the days are scorched and long, and the nights are full of teeth.” The trade and hardcover collecting all 5 issues of These Savage Shores was published in November 2019. One thing you will probably notice is the fact that all of these books are horror-themed. I do not mean to imply that intriguing titles are the exclusive domain of horror comic books — not by a long-shot. Take King of Nowhere, Wicked Things, We Only Find Them When They’re Dead, or Family Tree for instance, none of which are straight-up horror (though some would fit nicely in a Twilight Zone episode). Mind you, intriguing titles are not a guarantee of a great comic book, nor should comic books be judged solely by their titles. There have been times when I bought books based exclusively on the title and cover art but found the story lacking or difficult to sink my teeth into.  Then there are remarkable comic books whose titles may not be all that exciting. Comic book titles have been hit-and-miss.  For every Youngblood, Bloodstrike, Deathblow, Secret (Anything) and every other comic book title obsessed with the word blood, death, or secret, you have creative, compelling, and evocative titles like Marvel’s House of M and Civil War, Joker: Killer Smile, Once and Future and Little Bird: Fight for Elder’s Hope. At the end of the day, titles do not necessarily make the book. But from my personal experience, great titles make me take a second look. And for a long-time comic book fan in search of new reads, that can make a world of difference. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/live-jam/phantom-padilla-music-sessions-july-26-2020","title":"[WATCH] Rappler Live Jam: Phantom Padilla","date":"Jul 26, 2020 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab your headphones, turn down the lights, and experience this show by this avant-garde duo","body":"Phantom Padilla is performing on Rappler Live Jam!

Prime Minister Najib Razak faces a stern test at next month's vote due to the controversy surrounding sovereign wealth fund 1MDB and a challenge from his former mentor and veteran ex-leader, Mahathir Mohamad. Mahathir, a strongman who led Malaysia for over two decades, has shaken up the race with a surprise comeback at the age of 92 as the prime ministerial candidate in an opposition alliance packed with parties he crushed while in power. But Najib's Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence from Britain in 1957, is tipped to win due to splits within the opposition, and what critics warn will be widespread cheating at the dirtiest election in Malaysian history. In the unlikely event that Mahathir wins the May 9 poll, he will become the world's oldest prime minister. There was a festive atmosphere around the country Saturday as candidates formally registered to stand in the election, with flag-waving supporters from different parties parading through the streets. Once the election commission confirmed their candidacies, the 11-day campaign formally got under way, with 222 parliamentary seats up for grabs. Najib, in dark blue traditional Malay dress, registered in his constituency of Pekan, in Pahang state, which he has held for over 4 decades, as his supporters gathered, singing the national anthem and waving flags. \"He has developed our country, developed an Islamic nation, race and country,\" supporter Azizah Abdul Aziz told Agence Frace-Presse (AFP). Holiday island battle On the holiday island of Langkawi, Mahathir arrived at a local government office to register, wearing bright red Malay dress and a traditional black cap. Outside about 5,000 backers of the opposition coalition he is heading, Pact of Hope, waved flags and chanted.  \"Mahathir can help reboot this country,\" supporter Aziah Mohamad Nasir told AFP. \"Prime Minister Najib has destroyed justice, there is no rule of law.\" Not all candidates registered successfully. Tian Chua, a leading member of opposition group the People's Justice Party, was disqualified from contesting his seat due to a fine imposed by a court for insulting a police officer. Mahathir was spurred out of retirement to take on Najib – who heads the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the main party in the ruling coalition – as allegations mounted about the 1MDB scandal. Billions of dollars were allegedly stolen from 1MDB, which was set up and overseen by Najib, in a campaign of fraud and money-laundering, with American authorities claiming it was used to buy everything from high-end real estate to artwork in the United States. Najib and the fund deny any wrongdoing, but the controversy has only added to BN's problems after years of falling popularity driven by official corruption, divisive racial politics in the multi-ethnic country and anger at rising living costs.  The 64-year-old leader is under pressure to score an emphatic win after BN lost the popular vote for the first time at the 2013 election. Najib, who has been premier since 2009, has weathered the 1MDB scandal by sacking critics in government and launching a crackdown that has seen opponents arrested on various charges. In recent weeks, BN has taken steps that critics liken to gerrymandering – such as redrawing electoral boundaries in a way the opposition says will tilt the race in the government's favour. Ibrahim Suffian, head of independent polling firm Merdeka Center, told AFP that BN was likely to win but signalled it could be a tough fight. \"There are a few states where the opposition does have a strong presence, so it makes for some uncertainty,\" he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/uber-drivers-transition-grab-philippine-competition-commission-review","title":"Uber drivers' transition to Grab pushes through amid PCC review","date":"Apr 4, 2018 12:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says it will 'prepare the necessary documents and share information required' by the Philippine Competition Commission","body":"MANILA, Philiippines – The review being conducted by the country's antitrust watchdog will not stop the full transition of Uber Philippines' drivers to Grab's platform by Sunday, April 8. Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales said the transition will proceed even as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Tuesday, April 3, launched its own review of the local implications of the sale of Uber's Southeast Asian business to Grab. \"As the PCC conducts its review, Grab will continue to put our utmost support to ensure full transition of accredited Uber drivers onto our platform. To our driver-partners, we are doing our best to minimize any disruption of services so you can continuously get jobs,\" Gonzales said in a statement on Wednesday, April 4. Even if the deal falls below the threshold of the PCC's mergers and acquisitions review, the commission started to look into the potential effects of the transaction, expressing concern that it would lead to \"a virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market.\" Gonzales said Grab will fully cooperate in the watchdog's motu proprio review.

The PCC's mandate is to protect competition in the market and prohibit anti-competitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. The antitrust watchdog said it will evaluate and analyze if after the acquisition, prices will likely increase; ride-sharing services will deteriorate; passengers will effectively have less options; and how likely new transport network companies (TNCs) will be able to fairly compete against the merged firm. Should anti-competitive concerns arise, the PCC said Grab and Uber may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or prevent negative effects on market competition. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/when-uber-shuts-down-not-all-drivers","title":"Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us","date":"Mar 28, 2018 9:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Because of sheer volume, not all former Uber drivers will be onboarded by Grab on April 8","body":"In a press briefing on Wednesday, March 28, Grab Philippines Head Brian Cu said that they have started the so-called onboarding process of Uber drivers since Monday, March 26.

Meanwhile, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada assured the commuting public  that fares will not be raised with Grab’s acquisition of Uber. “Grab cannot increase its fare on its own. We know their range. We monitor them. Any request for fare hike goes through a hearing, where commuter side is heard, where NEDA (National Economic Development Authority) helps us. Grab knows how serious we are with violations as we fined Uber before,” Lizada said on Wednesday. Cu added that the increase in Grab's available drivers will also mean demand will be met better. “With the increased supply base, it’s easier to allocate, meaning surge will not be as frequent as it used to be,” he said. Although fares right now may not increase given the merger, Grab Philippines and Uber earlier submitted petitions to increase fares due to the tax reform law. The hearing is set on April 3. Only option Lizada also said that Grab will not monopolize the transport network vehicle services industry. She said that other potential transport network companies have submitted applications to the LTFRB before but they are just waiting for them to complete their documents. “If you say that there is no competition, soon there will be. Owto, Lag go, and Hype had applied to be TNCs,” she said. Once all requirements have been submitted, Lizada said the regulatory board will deliberate if they will be accepted. Confusing Many Uber drivers were confused by the situation.   At Grab’s onboarding site in Quezon City, Ruggo Rivero and Olga Diaz said they only found out that the Uber app will shut down on Monday. “It was very confusing for us. We only knew about it two days ago. As partners, we would have appreciated if we knew about this earlier given that Uber has not been meeting its target profits,” Rivero said in a mix of English and Filipino. With limited time in their hands, Rivero said he had to give up a day of driving just to finally process his papers. “I could’ve driven now as surge pricing is higher but here I am now.” However, Rivero sees a light at the end of the tunnel with better income coming from his driving. “Well, I guess I’ll be earning more with Grab than with Uber. Olga earns more than I do [when she drives for Grab]. But at the end of the day, for us it’s all about service,” he said. On Monday, March 26, Uber announced that it decided to sell its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab.

Namun insiden tersebut ternyata tidak sampai membuat Go-Jek sebagai perusahaan ikut memusuhi perusahaan taksi. (BACA: Sopir taksi bentrok dengan pengemudi Go-Jek dan GrabBike) Go-Jek dan perusahaan taksi terbesar di Indonesia, Blue Bird, mengumumkan bahwa mereka akan menjalin sebuah kerjasama strategis, pada Senin, 9 Mei.  Melalui siaran pers, Go-Jek dan Blue Bird mengatakan kalau kerjasama ini akan meliputi aspek teknologi, sistem pembayaran, dan promosi. Kerjasama tersebut akan berfokus pada peningkatan layanan transportasi melalui mobile solution yang mudah dan nyaman untuk pelanggan Go-Jek dan Blue Bird di seluruh penjuru nusantara.  Apa sebenarnya bentuk dari kerja sama yang terkesan misterius ini? Go-Jek dan Blue Bird sama-sama bungkam Meski sudah mengirim siaran pers ke media, namun pihak Go-Jek bungkam dan mengatakan bahwa kerjasama lebih lanjut akan dijabarkan oleh kedua pihak dalam waktu dekat. Hal yang sama disampaikan oleh Teguh Wijayanto, Head of Public Relations dari PT. Blue Bird. Teguh mengatakan bahwa pihaknya belum bisa memberitahukan mengenai kerjasama tersebut karena masih dalam tahap finalisasi. Namun Teguh menjelaskan kalau Blue Bird akan tetap mempertahankan layanan pemesanan lewat aplikasi bernama My Blue Bird yang mereka miliki.  “Pada bulan Mei ini, kami akan meluncurkan ulang aplikasi My Blue Bird dengan tampilan yang lebih segar dan user friendly dengan berbagai fitur terbaru. Salah satu fitur terbaru kami adalah sistem pembayaran non-tunai,” kata Teguh. Akankah Go-Jek dan Blue Bird membuat layanan serupa GrabTaxi? Setelah menjadi salah satu pemain besar di bisnis ojek online, Go-Jek pun ikut meluncurkan layanan pemesanan mobil seperti UBER dan GrabCar yang bernama Go-Car.  Hal itu membuat mereka mempunyai hampir semua layanan yang disediakan oleh pesaing mereka, yaitu UBER dan Grab. Satu-satunya layanan milik Grab yang belum dimiliki Go-Jek hanyalah layanan GrabTaxi. Oleh karena itu, kemungkinan paling besar dari kerja sama tersebut adalah munculnya layanan pemesanan taksi Blue Bird lewat aplikasi Go-Jek. Kemungkinan ini bertambah besar karena dalam menyediakan layanan GrabTaxi, Grab telah menjalin kerja sama dengan Express Group, yang merupakan pesaing berat dari Blue Bird. Hal ini pun sesuai bila kita melihat penjelasan Go-Jek dan Blue Bird kalau mereka akan bekerjasama dalam aspek teknologi, sistem pembayaran, dan promosi.  Munculnya layanan pemesanan di Go-Jek jelas akan membantu Blue Bird dari sisi teknologi dan promosi. Untuk soal pembayaran, kemungkinan para pengguna akan bisa membayar dengan layanan non-tunai milik Go-Jek, yaitu Go-Pay. Mari kita tunggu bagaimana sebenarnya bentuk kerjasama antara Go-Jek dan Blue Bird ini, serta nama yang akan mereka gunakan.  Semoga saja kerja sama ini bisa membuat konflik antara transportasi konvensional dan transportasi berbasis aplikasi bisa mereda, dan pelanggan pun akan diuntungkan dengan kehadiran layanan yang memuaskan. —Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/adele-fast-food-grammys-2016-performance-glitch","title":"Adele takes comfort in fast food after Grammys performance glitch","date":"Feb 16, 2016 8:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Adele grabs burgers after a glitch at the Grammys caused her to go out of tune","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA –  Pop superstar Adele said Monday, February 15 she was treating herself to fast food after a snafu at the Grammys caused her to go out of tune.

Opinion polls suggest the Kuomintang (KMT) are heading for heavy losses as they struggle with growing fears over Chinese influence, a slowing economy and a string of food scandals. Leadership elections are due in early 2016 with China policy a key issue as embattled President Ma Ying-jeou – who came to power in 2008 on a Beijing-friendly platform – must step down at the end of his second 4-year term. Around 15,000 polling stations opened at 8:00 am (0000 GMT), with 18 million people eligible to vote and a record 11,130 seats at every level of local government up for grabs. Ma smiled and waved at reporters when asked if he was confident about his party's performance as he voted in the capital Taipei, but made no comment. Turnout is expected to be between 65% and 70% and campaigning has been intense, with mass rallies, giant floats and firework displays. The KMT faces humiliation in key strongholds, including Taipei and the central municipality of Taichung. \"Many young people are concerned about job prospects and high housing prices so I hope to see change and new thinking in the government to make things better for us,\" graduate student Mark Hsu told Agence France-Presse (AFP) outside a polling station in the capital. 'Too close to China' The KMT currently dominates 15 of Taiwan's 22 cities and counties, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) holds 7. Of the 6 larger municipalities – the most hotly contested seats – the KMT controls 3 in the north and one in the center, against the DPP's two in the south. Ma ended the DPP's 8-year rule in 2008 when he was elected on a pledge to boost the economy and trade with China. He has overseen a marked improvement in previously frosty ties between Taipei and Beijing. However, the public has grown increasingly anxious over China's influence on the island. A proposed trade pact with the mainland sparked mass student-led protests and a 3-week occupation of Taiwan's parliament earlier this year. The DPP has traditionally been skeptical over closer ties with Beijing and has criticized the KMT for lack of transparency over trade deals with China as well as incompetence in handling domestic issues. Taiwan and China split in 1949 at the end of a civil war but Beijing still claims the island as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. \"I support the DPP because I think the Ma government is leaning too close to China and opening up trade too much... many factories have moved to China and many Taiwanese young people can't find jobs,\" a retired businessman surnamed Hsiao told AFP at a polling station in Taipei. Emotions were high at election-eve rallies, with tearful candidates kissing and hugging their families and supporters as crowds waved flags and chanted the popular slogan \"Get elected!\" Ma urged supporters in the capital to vote for KMT candidate Sean Lien in the Taipei mayoral race – Lien has been lagging behind independent candidate Ko Wen-je in opinion polls. \"It's an extremely important choice for Taipei and Taiwan,\" Ma said at a rally late Friday, November 28. (READ: Taiwan ruling party faces rout in biggest ever local polls) DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also made an island-wide tour in a final push for votes Friday. \"Tomorrow we will use our votes to tell the incompetent and arrogant government that we've had enough,\" she told a crowd in central Taiwan. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/the-grid-do-it-yourself-food-kits-available-grabmart","title":"The Grid's DIY food kits now available on GrabMart","date":"Nov 30, 2020 1:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Gourmet selections from the Grid Food Market can now be delivered to you via Grab","body":"The Grid Food Market now offers their DIY Food Kits on GrabMart.

The win brightened moods of Pinoy basketball fans after Gilas was eliminated from contention with a one-sided loss to South Korea in the quarterfinals, and was beaten by Lebanon in the battle for fifth place. Terrence Romeo's clutch 3-pointer with 46 seconds remaining cut Jordan's lead to one point, and Aguilar's lay-up under the basket gave Gilas the lead, 71-70, with 12.6 remaining. Romeo also got things done on the defensive side as his steal attempt on the ensuing inbounds pass forced a turnover for Jordan, which led to Gilas cushioning for the win. Gilas Pilipinas let go of 10-5 lead but was unable to keep their defense intact and let Jordan grab a 7-0 run to end the first quarter with a 17-all deadlock. Philippines unleashed a strong offensive blow in the second period behind Jayson Castro and Terrence Romeo’s killer treys for an 8-0 blitz to grab the lead at halftime, 35-27.

Millsap scored 26 points and 12 rebounds as Atlanta improved to 40-38, a half-game ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks in the battle for fifth place.

The Celtics are now 50-29, lying in second spot behind reigning NBA Finals champions Cleveland who are 51-27 and now primed to lock up first place.

Washington point guard John Wall warned however that the Wizards would need to improve their defense if they were to prosper in the playoffs. \"Our defense is terrible right now,\" Wall said. \"If we think we're going to go to the playoffs with this defense, we'll have an early exit. \"We have to figure that out,\" he added after a win which lifted Washington to 48-31, level with Toronto, who had a rest day on Thursday.

Butler also produced 10 rebounds and 10 assists for only the fourth triple-double of his career in what was a fifth win in six games for the Bulls. The Bulls are locked in a neck-and-neck race with Indiana for seventh place in the Eastern Conference, with identical records of 39-40 following the Pacers' win on Thursday.

Paul George had 23 points and 10 rebounds to subdue the Bucks, who fell to 40-39. Indiana coach Nate McMillan said he was encouraged by the grit shown by his team on their road trip. \"We now know exactly what we have to do on this upcoming road trip,\" McMillan said.  \"We were solid on defense tonight, and we did a lot better job attacking. Those are things we have to do. We also did a better job with our spacing tonight.\" Bucks coach Jason Kidd bemoaned his team's carelessness in possession. \"We had way too many turnovers,\" Kidd said.  \"We talked about it before the game, that we've got to take care of the ball. If you turn the ball over against Indiana, it puts you in a bad situation defensively, because they are going to take advantage of it, and they did.

The Americans, however, face a stiff challenge from a powerful Australian quartet led by in-form sprinter Cameron McEvoy. Phelps, who came out of retirement for one last crack at the Olympics in what will be his fifth Games, has the backing of US legend Mark Spitz, who is tipping the 31-year-old to win \"several\" medals in Brazil. \"I think Michael is going to do great,\" Spitz told AFP in Rio. \"This is his swansong, if you may, and he's going to make every single stroke count.\" The other headline star of the US swimming team, Katie Ledecky, also goes for gold in the 400m freestyle.

In a non-medal action on Sunday, host nation Brazil face Iraq in the men's football tournament bidding to bounce back from a disappointing 0-0 draw in their opening game against South Africa. It will be an opportunity for Brazilian superstar Neymar to win over critics after the team was booed off the pitch in their opening game last week. Neymar is shouldering the burden of expectation from Brazilian fans, still scarred by the memory of the team's humiliating 7-1 exit to Germany in the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup.

After coming up short  in 2013, Chris Tiu's team obtained a victory in Year 2 of the Master special, beating Team Marc, 135-110, on Saturday, June 21, at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. Spearheading the Tiu-coached club was Chris Ellis, whose athletic prowess was a perfect fit to the pace played by both teams on Saturday. The Ginebra fan-favorite's teammate, Greg Slaughter, meanwhile, led Team Marc along with son of PBA Hall of Famer Benjie Paras - Andre Paras. Both teams got off to a sluggish start, as players missed most of their outside shots to start the contest. Slaughter, who served as the lone non-collegiate starter, woke up the audience with a breakaway slam moments later, getting Team Marc within two, 6-4. However, Team Chris' young guns responded well, leaning on the brilliance of Chris Newsome. The Ateneo stalwart hit a long-range shot and followed it up with another conversion to cap off a 9-2 run. Thanks to Slaughter's towering height, Team Marc stayed within striking distance as its big man slammed two more jams - the latter a poster over UST's Kevin Ferrer. Before the PBA players entered the fray, Team Chris' lead was down to two, 19-14. Tiu's set of pros played better than those of his opponent, giving his club a comfortable advantage after 12 minutes of action. Following a set of Ellis layups, Team Chris took a 32-17 lead entering the second frame. The onslaught continued in the second canto, as the guys in black extended their lead to as much as 20 before Pingris opted to return his college stars and Slaughter. The latter stepped up to the plate, knocking down three 3-balls to help get his team within 10, 55-45. At the half, Team Chris was on top, 59-51. Pingris' boys trimmed the deficit to two early into the third quarter thanks to a tandem of Jared Dillinger threes, 67-65. But due to their lackluster open court defense, Ellis was able to get out on the break often and converted consecutive easy lay-ins. With 2:42 to go in the third, Tiu's team gathered another double-digit advantage, 85-72, and would have the same amount of lead heading into the final period, which Team Marc couldn't bounce back from.

Grab driver Florence Norial, 26, was detained from around 7:40 pm on Tuesday evening up to as late as Wednesday afternoon after  she was accused of direct assault, alarm and scandal, and disobedience to authority from the encounter. This developed after Florence asked a driver to move his vehicle which was blocking the exit driveway of Grace Mall in Taguig City. At that time, she just picked up her Grab passenger from the mall. It turned out the driver of the vehicle blocking the passage was a certain Captain Ronald Saquilayan \"Help pls! Nasa...police station po ako ngayon. Gusto po ako ikulong. Nag pick up ako pasahero sa Starbucks, ngayon kahit anong pakiusap ko s [pulis] na nasa harap ay ayaw umalis,\"  Florence said in a Facebook status on Tuesday 8:41 pm, before she was detained. (Help please. I am at a police statioon now. They want to jail me. I picked up a passenger at Starbucks, and whatever pleaded  I made to ask the police to move, he still didn't want to leave.) Mirza Miguel Shahzad – Florence's boyfriend who spoke and stayed with her before she was locked away – denied the allegations of the police, providing an hour-by-hour account of the events to Rappler in an email.  Narrating Florence's and his experience on Tuesday evening, Miguel said that the policeman was first to hit Florence. He said that Florence only acted on self-defense, and that the charges against her were fabricated, with the help of other personnel of the Taguig City Police. In a text message to Rappler, Taguig police chief Colonel Celso Rodriguez said Saquilayan was not assigned in their area, but was detailed with the Pateros police. He did not confirm whether they would launch a probe into the incident.  Meanwhile, Pateros police chief Colonel Ramchrisen Haveria Jr confirmed in a phone interview with Rappler, that Saquilayan was assigned with them.  Still,  Haveria said Taguig police should investigate the incident as it happened under their territorial responsibility. In a text message to Rappler, Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said they were “already investigating the matter” and have “reached out to the family of the driver.” At around 7 pm on Tuesday evening, October 6, Florence was taking a passenger to the Starbucks branch in Grace Mall.  They stopped at the  driveway of the mall because a stalled dark grey Ford Ranger blocked the passage. Florence flashed her headlights and honked her horn, but the vehicle did not move. She walked over to the stalled vehicle and knocked on the driver's door. Still, she was ignored. Florence asked the assistance of the guard nearby, and they knocked on the Ranger's door once more.  This time the door swung open \"suddenly and forcefully,\" Miguel said, knocking Florence down to the bushes beside the driveway and injuring her. On impulse and in self-defense, Florence stood up and slapped the driver. The driver then said he was a police officer and arrested Florence.  The man who arrested Florence was wearing a printed black shirt and camouflage pants. He hastily arrested her without reading her rights. \"He then forced her to the walls outside of Starbucks to cuff her as he asked his daughter (who was inside the Ford Ranger) to get his handcuffs inside the said vehicle,\" Miguel said. In her last Facebook status before her arrest, Florence attached a video of her argument with the driver of the stalled vehicle. In the video, the man said \"I am police Captain Ronald Saquilayan,\" and said he was arresting Florence \"for hurting me, for hitting me.\"  Aside from the vague reason for the arrest, the police officer did not read her rights which is the standard protocol. Miguel added that an unidentified civilian tried to intervene by telling the police officer to stop hurting Florence and to let her go. Saquilayan stood his ground and insisted on arresting her. A police mobile patrol brought Florence to the Taguig City Police Station 4 in Usasan at around 7:40 pm.  Miguel and Florence's older sister, Aubrey,  rushed to the police station. Miguel said Saquilayan exaggerated his claims against Florence. Miguel added that the police at the station refused to acknowledge them when they said they wanted to file their own complaint against Saquilayan. \"They never listened on our side and insisted that Florence hurt the said police officer, that she almost destroyed his window which in this case was physically impossible. For Christ’s sake, she could not even lift a 5-gallon water jug, not even a half-full of that 5-gallon jug,\" Miguel said. At 9 pm, Miguel and Aubrey were told that Florence would be transferred to the main Taguig City Police Station near city hall. They asked if they could use their own car to transfer Florence. The station police chief said yes, but when they boarded the car, they were accused of another crime. \"For some reason, as we already were in the car, he got angry and stormed off to us and said we were in violation and were executing 'police disobedience' and added that case [against] Florence,\" Miguel said. Miguel and Aubrey tried to take a video of the police sub-station chief threatening to arrest them. The police chief then snatched Aubrey's phone. Miguel was able to continue recording the incident and posted the footage on Facebook. In the video, the chief of the sub-station ordered his men to handcuff Aubrey.  Florence was then placed in a police mobile unit and brought to the main police headquarters. Miguel and Aubrey followed. At 10:25 pm, a policeman finally read Florence her rights and was told she was accused of disobedience. She was cuffed then taken to the Pateros District Hospital for her pre-detention medical examination.  They returned to the main police station at around 11:20 pm. At around 1:30 am on October 7 at the main police station, Miguel and Aubrey demanded that they see the police report, the medical report, and the quarters where Florence was detained. Cops provided none of these. \"They even said they would arrest us if we would check on her detention cell,\" Miguel said. He added: \"After all of this happening, I was clearly shocked on how they would abuse the word 'arrest' in every move you would commit that would not even harm them as you were just documenting the said events that transpired. We were also not given a chance to have an attorney in all of the said events.\"  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/trump-grabs-spotlight-reclusive-biden-leads-polls","title":"Trump grabs spotlight but reclusive Biden leads polls","date":"Aug 16, 2020 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"History professor Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the results of every US presidential election since 1984. His 2020 forecast? It's Joe Biden.","body":"Despite being gaffe-prone, getting up in years, and barely heading out on the campaign trail, Democrat Joe Biden is leading in the polls as the coronavirus epidemic and economic crisis make the November presidential election a referendum on Donald Trump. The COVID-19 outbreak has stripped Trump of his beloved campaign rallies but he has made the most of his White House pulpit to remain in the public eye. The 77-year-old Biden, on the other hand, has held few campaign events, spending most of his time since mid-March at home in Wilmington, Delaware.    Biden's sparse public schedule has minimized the risks of his catching the virus while at the same time reducing his chances of making any faux pas. And if the polls are any indication, the Democratic candidate's low-key style is paying off. The election website Real Clear Politics has Biden with a 7.7-point lead over Trump nationally.   Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, has correctly predicted the results of every US presidential election since 1984, including Trump's upset 2016 victory. His 2020 forecast? Biden, president Barack Obama's two-term vice president, will win the November 3 vote. \"This has nothing to do with Joe Biden,\" Lichtman said in an interview with Agence France-Presse. \"It's not dependent on Donald Trump's personality either. It's based on the record.\" The professor bases his predictions on what he calls the 13 \"Keys to the White House.\" Among them: How strong is the US economy? Is there social unrest? Is the president an incumbent? Is the president charismatic? Is his opponent? Of this last \"key,\" Lichtman says \"Biden doesn't fit that bill.\"  \"He's a very empathetic, sincere man, but he's not inspirational,\" he said. In late 2019, Lichtman had Trump in good shape to win reelection. \"What has happened since is he made the colossal mistake of thinking he can talk his way out of the crises that hit the country, the pandemic, the cries for social justice, the economic downturn,\" Lichtman said. \"That doesn't work. And the result is a failed presidency.\" With more than 169,000 deaths and over 5.3 million COVID-19 cases, the United States is the worst-hit country in the world with an economy on its knees. The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer, triggered a summer of nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. While Trump's handling of the virus outbreak and the protests has been widely criticized, Biden has been climbing in the polls. The former vice president has been able to largely sit back and watch events unfold, with the Trump campaign accusing him of \"hiding\" in his Wilmington basement. \"By his almost reclusive campaign he has maintained the spotlight on President Trump,\" said Christopher Arterton, professor emeritus of political management at George Washington University. And Trump's management of the crises facing the country has pushed many independent voters \"from undecided to, 'I'm not going to vote for him,'\" Arterton said. Despite Biden's lead in the polls, neither professor is ready to say he has the election locked up, not in these uncertain times and with a candidate as unpredictable as Trump. \"He will do anything, he has no scruples,\" Lichtman, an avowed Democrat, said of the Republican president. Trump, 74, has suggested that Biden is senile and called him a puppet of the \"radical left\" who would somehow \"hurt God.\" There are also three debates scheduled between the two men in September and October which could be the occasion for fireworks. With Trump largely unable to expand his voter base, the real estate tycoon has been accused of trying to suppress the Democratic vote. Lichtman said this could pose dangers for Democratic hopes of regaining the White House. \"My big worries about this election are two things that have nothing to do with the keys,\" he said. \"One is voter suppression. Trump and his enablers are going to make it difficult for people to vote, particularly to vote by mail in a pandemic,\" Lichtman said. \"And number two, Russian intervention. How effective is their intervention going to be? Because we know Donald Trump not only won't do anything to stop it, he'll welcome it again. \"Those are two wild cards. No system can take that into account.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/game-results-trail-blazers-raptors-january-7-2020","title":"Vintage Melo grabs winner as Blazers stun Raptors","date":"Jan 8, 2020 12:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Carmelo Anthony knocks in the game-clincher as the Trail Blazers rally from a double-digit deficit against the defending champions","body":"   LOS ANGELES, USA – Carmelo Anthony rolled back the years with 28 points and a last-gasp winner as the Portland Trail Blazers upset the Toronto Raptors, 101-99, in the NBA on Tuesday, January 7 (Wednesday, January 8, Philippine time). Anthony finished with 7 rebounds to continue an impressive run of recent form which included 26 points in last week's loss to the New York Knicks. The 35-year-old 10-time All Star had not played for more than a year when he signed for Portland in November. Yet the veteran drew on all of his experience to help Portland stage a fourth-quarter fightback at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena.     The Blazers overturned a double-digit deficit in the final period, 78-88, to dig out a win over the reigning NBA champions, Anthony nailing the winner with 3.3 seconds on the clock. \"I trust in my workout. I trust in my shot. It's a shot I work on every day, and it went in,\" Anthony said afterwards, praising the team's composure in the 4th quarter as they chased down the Raptors. \"We just stayed with it.

A video of the pink machine, containing the creatures and emblazoned with a picture of a smiling red crab under the phrase \"Come and catch me\", went viral after being posted this week. Similar to machines where people pick up soft toys, the game sees customers pay Sg$5 ($3.7) to use a joystick to move the claw over the creatures before lowering it to try to grab one. If successful, the customer can have the Sri Lankan crab cooked on the spot free of charge, choose to take it home, or leave it at the House of Seafood restaurant to eat another time. But internet users condemned the game as cruel after the specially produced video promoting it went online. \"This is too much,\" Joseph Soh wrote on Facebook. \"Why are you making their remaining life even more difficult... Absolutely disgusting.\" The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the machine \"causes unnecessary harm to the animals and it also encourages people to see animals as nothing more than objects to play with\". \"Crabs are living creatures, not toys,\" it added. The government's Animal and Veterinary Service said it was alerted to the case and was investigating. House of Seafood chief executive Francis Ng told AFP the promotion, which began this month, had been suspended after the outcry – but added he was surprised at the reaction. \"People think I torture them but we don't have any intention of doing that,\" he said. \"The crabs are not being hurt.\" The claw is covered with plastic and the area inside is cushioned to prevent injury if the creatures are dropped, added Ng, who also posted an apology on the restaurant chain's Facebook page. Ng said a similar promotion at two restaurants he operates in China was a success. He plans to meet with Singapore authorities and will cease using the machine permanently if ordered. Restaurants across Asia often keep live seafood in tanks for diners to pick out for their meals. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/goodrap/grabfood-riders-job-rewarding","title":"Why these GrabFood riders find their job rewarding","date":"Jul 24, 2019 3:09 PM PHT","snippet":"Get to know some of the people behind your orders","body":"MANILA, Philippines – At this point, ordering via GrabFood is second nature for a lot of us. Every day, we pull out our phones to order merienda – pretty much on autopilot mode. But for the people behind each order, it’s a ticket to a better life. Loid Herrera: Being his own boss and finding a second family  Twenty-five-year-old Loid Herrera supports his two young kids by working full-time as a GrabFood rider.  Loid previously worked odd jobs in the food industry but enjoys working as a rider more. “Kung minimum earner lang, hindi ko masusuportahan yung dalawang anak ko (If I were a minimum earner, I wouldn’t be able to support my kids),” he says. He now calls himself his own boss. He also found a second family in his fellow riders, with whom he would go on outings during days off. No job is without its difficulties, though. Loid runs into customers who would talk to him rudely, make him wait outside in the heat or rain, or cancel orders after he had already bought the food. For cancelled orders to be reimbursed, he would have to bring them to Grab’s office in Makati.  And that’s the least of a GrabFood rider’s problems. They’re also vulnerable to accidents. Once, while on his way to deliver milk tea, Loid got hit by an ambulance. He messaged fellow riders, who immediately came to his rescue and went with him to file a blotter. Aside from having to take a break from work for over a week, he also had to borrow money to buy a new bike. Thanks to Grab’s gift of P20,000 and groceries, he and his family were able to pull through.  “Thankful kami sa Grab sa ginawa niyang system. Malaking tulong talaga siya sa taong ayaw ng amo pero walang pagpuhunan ng negosyo (We’re thankful that Grab created this system. It’s helpful for those who want to be independent but don’t have the capital for business),” Loid says. Jayson Osita: Working his way through college At just 21, recent college graduate Jayson is already helping his parents out financially.  Back when he was a college freshman, Jayson saw his parents struggling with money. He decided to withdraw from the private college he was attending. But rather than totally quit schooling, he transferred to a public college and started working. “Sabi ko kay mama, mag-wowork ako. Ayaw pa nga nila nung una, kasi ayaw nila akong makitang naihirapan. Sabi ko, ‘Kaya ko yun, Ma.’” (I told my mother I was going to start working. My parents intially didn’t want me to do it, because they don’t like seeing me struggle. I just said, “I can do it, Ma.”) He started as an all-around crew member of a fast food chain, but he wasn’t earning enough. Besides, the inflexible schedule made it difficult to juggle school and work. Jayson then decided to try working for GrabFood. Right after his last class at 3pm, he’d already go on his way to deliver his first order. “Nakakatulong na po ako kay mama. Nakakaraos din po sa bayaran ng tuition,” he says. (I’m able to help my mother out. I can also pay for my tuition.) His father, who works as a cook, serves as his inspiration. Jayson dreams of setting up his own food-related business once he saves up enough money. He recognizes the importance of education in pursuing this goal, which is why he took up entrepreneurship in college. Working as a rider also changed Jayson’s life in small, poignant ways – he’s now able to try the delicious food he used to only be able to deliver.  Jayson’s definitely a family guy. And he found another family in his co-riders. “Kahit walang booking, nagsasayawan, nagtatawanan,” he says. (While waiting for bookings, we’re all laughing and dancing together.) Alfredo Clemente, Jr.: Breaking limits for PWDs Alfredo has never let being a PWD get in the way of a job. He previously sold french fries in the streets of Batasan. When his wife got pregnant, he decided to try working for a food delivery service. In February, however, they lost the child, who was born prematurely. Shortly after, the company he was working for suspended its operations.  Fortunately, GrabFood reached out to him and other displaced riders. Alfredo now works as a full-time rider to support his wife and to save up for a better future.  He’s earning a lot more than he used to, but has bigger dreams in mind. “Lahat kasi gusto nilang ma-change yung life nila. Ayoko kasing kung anong ginagawa ko, yun yung ginagawa ko sa pagtanda. Kaya kailangan mag-prepare ka para sa future.” (Everyone wants their lives to change. I don’t want to be doing this my entire life. That’s why you have to prepare for the future.) This is why he sticks to the job – despite the risks that come with late-night deliveries and the profit lost when customers keep him waiting. In the future, Alfredo also wants to help others like him. “Masakit yung ikaw yung nagmamakaawa para tanggapin ka. Plano ko for the future kung papalarin, gusto ko magtayo ng ganito. Para ako naman yung magbibigay ng opportunity sa iba.” (Begging for others to accept you is painful. In the future, if I’m lucky enough, I want to build something like this. So I can be the one to give opportunities to other people.)

It is but inevitable that in this market, an unnecessary and patently lazy attempt to revive the franchise will happen. Bland from the get-go F. Gary Gray’s Men in Black: International is bland from the get-go. The film goes through the motions of setting the storyline, introducing Agent High T (Liam Neeson) and Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) rushing into the Eiffel Tower to supposedly stop an alien invasion. The opening abruptly ends before revealing what is touted to be a twist, giving way to another introduction of another character, Molly, a young girl who allows an adorable alien to escape without her memories being erased. Molly (Tessa Thompson) becomes obsessed with the men in black and makes it her mission to join the ranks. She eventually does and is eventually given the name Agent M. What really propelled the Men in Black franchise to complete an entire trilogy without its fans suffering from fatigue is the cleverly conceived tandem of stoic Tommy Lee Jones and bombastic Will Smith, whose rapport add further absurdity and color to its already absurd and colorful premise. Sadly, Hemsworth and Thompson’s blend of flirtatious nagging and droll jib and jabber are not enough to make this revival truly memorable. The pairing lacks the wit that made Jones and Smith work. Hemsworth and Thompson rely too much on infatuation and romantic inclination to carry with it any real and lasting humor.     Content with being ordinary Men in Black: International is content with being ordinary. Its storyline of a mole that has infiltrated the organization is sorely lacking in mystery and surprises. Its array of aliens is lacking in novelty, with only Pawny (Kumail Nanjiani), the pint-sized and hilariously servile guard, dishing out truly hilarious gags. Gone are the aliens whose intended similarities to the diverse culture that comprise America bear more than a subtle jab at the state of immigrations. Now, they’re all eyecandy, existing only to further exoticism. It is all fine.  Men in Black: International isn’t noxious entertainment. It does get repetitive. The action scenes never astound. The humor is standard fare. If anything, it is really just an unimaginative money grab, with the studios delivering plain popcorn entertainment that has just enough salt and butter to make it tolerable enough to sit through. While it incorporates current attitudes about women finally being recognized, it doesn’t really push for that agenda, making it very clear that its motive is not to correct the past but to capitalize on it.   Pales in comparison Men in Black: International is a film that won’t have people begging for a continuation. It just pales in comparison to its livelier and more ingenious predecessors. — Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-to-deactivate-drivers-june-10-2019","title":"Grab to deactivate 8,000 drivers by June 10","date":"Jun 3, 2019 7:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipinos can expect longer booking time and price surges, as Grab is set to deactivate some 8,000 drivers for failure to comply with LTFRB requirements","body":"MANILA, Philippines – There will be fewer Grab cars on the streets by June 10, as the ride-hailing company will deactivate at least 8,000 transport network vehicle services (TNVS) partners.

Maddie Madayag tallied 14 points as she led the Lady Eagles’ frontline. Kat Tolentino also played great on both ends, scoring 12 points and registering 14 digs. Ateneo head coach Oliver Almadro praised his team for responding well to his challenge to communicate better against a confident UP squad. “Mahirap ang game na ito kasi alam mo UP, high morale, they really played well, they really fought hard, but my players kasi they really seek deep inside them what they really want and iyon ang nangyari,” said Almadro.

The Lady Maroons dropped to 3-2 behind the three-way logjam of La Salle, University of Santo Tomas and Far Eastern University (4-2). Ateneo came out with a strong 8-4 start, but the Lady Maroons rallied back with a massive 8-2 run. However, a Tots Carlos attack error sparked an Ateneo 6-0 run that shifted the momentum and paved the way for the Lady Eagles to claim the opening frame.  The Lady Maroons absorbed another blow early in the 2nd set when Remelyn Altomea hurt her right ankle when Ateneo was up 6-3. Ateneno kept its distance, 20-15, and Ponggay Gaston carried the squad late in the 2nd frame with 3 straight points that awarded the Lady Eagles with the set win and a 2-0 match advantage. The 3rd set started pretty much the same with the Lady Eagles setting the tone early, 14-8. Although the Lady Maroons showed signs of life, tying the game several times, the Lady Eagles survived the late challenge behind Bea de Leon and Deanna Wong in the extended set and secured the victory to stretch their winning streak to 4 games. – Rappler.com      "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-philippines-donates-shooting-simulator-highway-patrol-group","title":"Grab Philippines donates shooting simulator to highway police","date":"Feb 27, 2019 6:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says the simulator would enhance the PNP Highway Patrol Group's road safety and security skills","body":"MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to enhance road safety, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines donated a shooting simulator to the highway police.

If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less,' says Grab Philippines head Brian Cu","body":"MANILA, Philippines – PBA Partylist Representative Jericho Nograles accused ride-hailing company Grab Philippines of forcing its drivers to work in \"slave-like\" conditions. In a statement on Thursday, June 7, Nograles said the ride-hailing company subjects its partner-drivers to unfair profit sharing mechanisms and \"humanly impossible\" quotas for incentives. \"With no financial and health risk, Grab is making a lot money, while the drivers who are working in slave-like conditions are left without any protection. To me, this is immoral and this is utterly wrong. This has to stop now and put Grab to the place where it really belongs,\" Nograles said. Grab drivers who attended a consultation meeting with Nograles revealed that their take-home pay is only about P655 per day after working a minimum of 18 hours, the lawmaker said. The average commission of Grab per day amounts to P600, he added. Nograles had accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker said he would support the petition to implement fare changes if Grab Philippines foregoes of the 20% commission they charge from drivers, and to only take the P40 base fare per ride. \"I will definitely back up the driver's petition to implement the fair charges, on the condition that Grab Philippines forego any commission from this charge,\" Nograles said. Reimpose P2 per minute In a statement late Thursday, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said: “No one among Grab parters is being forced to drive long hours. If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less.” Cu then again raised Grab Philippines' appeal with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to reimpose the suspended P2-per-minute travel charge. \"[I]n the spirit of fairness, we also urge him to enjoin all TNCs (transport network companies), which all have LTFRB-approved per-minute fare component in their fare structures, to forego their commissions, as he suggests,\" Cu said. Grab earlier said the suspension of the charge led to fewer drivers, with only 35,000 drivers available for over 600,000 bookings a day. Cu said Nograles' earlier accusation of illegal charges caused the drivers' income to \"drop drastically.\" \"Nograles actually caused drivers' income to drop drastically when he questioned the legality of the P2 per minute fare component.... Without the P2, many drivers stopped driving, making commuting more difficult for the riding public,\" Cu said. \"Throughout the past months, he certainly has not been a constructive force in helping both drivers and the riding public,\" he added. This is the latest move by the lawmaker in a bid to regulate Grab Philippines. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April.

Horford finished with 26 points while Tatum added 28 points as Boston surged into a 1-0 lead in the best-of-7 series with a statement victory. Horford later praised Rozier's superb contribution. \"I've always seen that potential in Terry. I just think he's taken advantage of the opportunity,\" Horford said.  \"It's a great experience for him to come into a playoff game of this magnitude and have such a great game,\" Horford added. \"I just think defensively we did a great job tonight, really containing them and just trying to play with pace at the other end.\" The third-seeded Sixers had advanced to the semi-finals after a confident demolition of Miami in the opening round. But the Celtics lineup look to be a vastly more challenging proposition for the Sixers, who saw Joel Embiid top score with 31 points while pulling down 13 rebounds. J.J. Redick had 20 points for the Sixers, while point guard Ben Simmons had 18 points from 41 minutes on the court. Yet it was the shooting prowess of Celtics ace Rozier that caught the eye as the 24-year-old point guard kept Boston firmly on track for a well-earned win. Boston, who advanced to the semi-finals after a gruelling 7-game series win over Milwaukee, have regrouped superbly after a slew of injuries which means they are without stars Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward. Rozier's 29-point haul included 21 points from three-point range, a 77.8 conversion percentage from outside the arc. Rozier credited his form to a determined training regime launched last year. \"Up early every day. Putting in a lot of work, watching a lot of film.

No matter who it is out there, we're going to play hard and take care of business.\" Sixers coach Brett Brown was left to reflect on a below-par night for his team while acknowledging the Celtics had simply been better. \"We did have an off night shooting but a lot of that you can attribute to their good defense and them getting to our shooters,\" Brown said. \"We give them credit. I never really felt we were in the game. It sure felt like we were playing a good team today.  \"But defensively, offensively, this isn't who we are. This was a poor game from us.

On Tuesday, the LTFRB conducted a hearing on the alleged illegal charges by Grab Philippines on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) During the hearing, the regulatory board questioned representatives from Grab on how they \"unilaterally\" changed their fare scheme mid-2017, adding P2 per minute for every ride. \"We are very specific how this mechanism was supposed to be implemented when a December 27, 2016 order remains as of today,\" LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said. The December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services' fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The order does not include travel duration charges. \"It is the position of the Board that the December 27, 2016 order mandates the fare structure – therefore there should be no other change in the fare structure, considering the fact that the Board exercised our adjudicatory powers,\" Delgra said. The LTFRB instructed Grab to disclose in another hearing – set for May 29 – when exactly the travel duration charge was implemented, and how many rides were affected. It also asked Grab to further explain its algorithm for fare pricing in May. Illegal charges? Grab maintained, however, that it informed the LTFRB of its fare structure in a technical working group (TWG) meeting in July 2017. John Paul Nabua, Grab's lawyer, said the ride-hailing company started charging the travel duration rate in \"early June 2017\" and informed the LTFRB about it the following month. As to why Grab implemented the new fare structure without the LTFRB's approval, Nabua said Department Order (DO) 2015-11 issued by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allows pricing changes, only \"subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of disruptions in the market.\" Nabua also said the LTFRB's December 2016 order mentions the \"time travel charge,\" and Grab deemed this applicable to ride-hailing firms. But Delgra said the provision does not apply to Grab, as the company did not charge by travel duration prior to the December 2016 order. \"Was there a time rate when the order was decided in December 2016?\" Delgra asked Grab, and was told, \"No.\" In response, the LTFRB chairman said, \"Then this [provision] does not apply to you.\" Refund? PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who was also present during the hearing as complainant, said Grab only confirmed it did not go through the right process. \"First of all, informing [the LTFRB] through a PowerPoint presentation is not a cause for approval. What we are pushing for here is due process for the rights of our consumers. The P2-per-minute charge did not undergo due process,\" Nograles told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino. The lawmaker said that based on his calculations, Grab owes its riders some P3.2 billion. Some Grab drivers and operators who were also present during the hearing argued that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should the LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Some senators had also slammed the ride-hailing company's \"predatory pricing and overcharging.\" The LTFRB previously ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare. Grab is now the only transport network company offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber formally closed down on April 16.

Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body's crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What's the issue about? Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year. What's the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB's earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don't have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it's not their fault they are considered \"colorum.\" They point to the LTFRB's earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB's preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What's the LTFRB's position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their \"partner drivers\" to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it's standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a \"minority\" in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB's admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies' accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab's accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber's is set to expire in August.   How did the public react? With the LTFRB's crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government's move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What's next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it's considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-27-2017-evening-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, Aguirre, PCGG | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 7:52 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it is 'seriously considering' setting \"minimum\" working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre conducts a surprise inspection of the New Bilibid Prison. Malacanang says proposals to abolish the Philippine Commission on Good Government is driven by the need to streamline government, not politics. Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella claims the European Union and the Commission on Human Rights were invited to President Rodrigo Duterte's State of the Nation Address. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve 'in any capacity' in the U.S. military.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-27-2017-midday-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, Gorio, Trump | Midday wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the ride-hailing companies after June 30. State weather bureau PAGASA says Tropical Storm Gorio has slowed down but maintained its strength. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve 'in any capacity' in the U.S. military."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-26-2017-evening-edition","title":"Uber and Grab, Fariñas, Cayetano | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 26, 2017 8:12 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada says Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they’re just noisier on social media. House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas says Congress will form its own technical working group to propose amendments to the 1987 Constitution and pave the way for federalism. Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Cayetano says the proposed joint development with China in the West Philippine Sea should adhere to Philippine laws if it pushes through. State weather bureau PAGASA says residents of parts of Luzon should brace for more rain, as Tropical Storm Gorio enhances the southwest monsoon. Vatican finance chief Cardinal George Pell denies before an Australian court all charges of historical sexual abuse.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grieving-lawmaker-demands-grab-uber-legal-accountability-ltfrb","title":"Grieving lawmaker demands Grab, Uber legal accountability","date":"Jul 25, 2017 9:09 PM PHT","snippet":"AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe lost his nephew two weeks ago in a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore","body":"MANILA, Philippines – If a crash happens involving a Grab or Uber driver, can the transport network companies (TNCs) be sued? This was the question that grieving lawmaker AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe posed to TNCs and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday, July 25, during the hearing of the House committee on Metro Manila. The committee hearing comes after the LTFRB encountered a regulation deadlock with the TNCs, as the LTFRB attempted to put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) cars in the metro. “Two weeks ago, namatay ang pamangkin ko sa Singapore, Uber. Yung driver hindi namatay, pero pamangkin ko namatay in Singapore…Let's say dito sa Pilipinas nangyari 'yun, sinong idedemanda ko?\" Batocabe asked. (Two weeks ago, my nephew died in Singapore [while riding] Uber. The driver didn't die, but my nephew did. Let's say it happened in the Philippines. Who do I sue?) LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III pointed Batocabe to Memorandum Circular (MC) 2015-015, which says that the driver, not the TNC, will be liable. “The TNC shall be liable for failure to exercise due diligence and reasonable care, except if such non-compliance is due to acts or omissions outside of the TNC’s control. However, such liability shall not extend to actions of drivers, who are independent contractors who provide the transportation services directly to passengers,” the MC read. But for Batocabe, the TNCs should also take a part of the blame since they also accredit their drivers as their “partners.\" “They can’t just operate with apps and everything without any regulation especially when it involves public utilities and public service [and when] it involves our people,” Batocabe said.  Batocabe recommended that the LTFRB issue a “remedial order” to reinforce their last MC increasing the accountability of the TNCs. Passenger insurance In their defense, representatives from Grab and Uber said that all rides booked through their applications are insured by the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency, setting insurance as high as P200,000 per passenger in case something untoward happens. They also said that they actively reach out to passengers when they get into trouble in their trips. Uber government relations chief Yves Gonzalez added that passengers can file a case against Uber if they find fault committed by the company itself. Meanwhile, the LTFRB chairman said he will raise Batocabe's concern in the board's technical working group meetings with Grab and Uber in the coming weeks. Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. In its July 11 order, the LTFRB directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. But Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. LTFRB is set to release their verdict on Wednesday. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-20-2017-evening-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, SALN, Calida | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 20, 2017 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: Undocumented Grab and Uber drivers can stay on the road until the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board decides on the appeal filed by the two ride-hailing companies. Public Works Secretary Mark Villar is the richest member of President Rodrigo Duterte's Cabinet with a net worth of P1.4 billion. Solicitor General Jose Calida says he will set in motion the re-arrest of National Democratic Front consultants who were temporarily released from detention to participate in the peace talks. Malacañang urges American lawmakers to consider 'all sides' of the Duterte administration's war on drugs on the same day the United States Congress is set to hold a public hearing on the issue. United States President Donald Trump's eldest son and his former campaign manager will testify before Congress next week as part of investigations into the Trump team's alleged contacts with Russia.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/dotr-tugade-government-share-grab-uber-earnings","title":"Tugade wants government share of Grab and Uber earnings","date":"Jul 19, 2017 6:49 PM PHT","snippet":"Department of Transportation secretary Arthur Tugade says ride sharing services should be regulated financially too because it is no longer a service done 'in the spare time' of operators","body":"MANILA, Philippines— The government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber according to Department of Transporation (DOTr) secretary Arthur Tugade. \"Kailangan diyan may share din diyan ‘yung gobyerno ‘yung kinikita doon.

Southeast Asian ride-hailing app company GrabTaxi saw this as a sound business investment. In November last year, GrabTaxi decided to pilot its motorcycle service called GrabBike in Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. But just two months after, GrabBike faced resistance from the government. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday, January 27, ordered GrabBike to cease operations until the regulator has promulgated guidelines to authorize the service. For hundreds of GrabBike drivers like Noel Barredo — a former liaison officer at a shipping company — this is bad news. \"Nagresign ako sa trabaho ko at napagdesisyunan na gawin itong full-time kasi mas maganda ang kita dito kaysa sa minimum [wage of P466 per day]. Pero ngayon, hindi ko na alam gagawin ko (I resigned from my previous job because I decided to make this full time as the pay is better than the minimum wage of P466 per day),\" Noel, who has been working as a full-time GrabBike driver for two weeks, said in a phone interview. \"Siguro, hanap muna ng ibang pagkakitaan habang naghahanap ng bagong trabaho (Maybe, I’ll look for another source of income while finding a new job),\" Noel replied when asked if he has other sources of income. Noel added that an average GrabBike driver works around 12 hours a day, ferrying an average of 10 passengers. This equates to an average income of P800. It's not just the GrabBike drivers who are disappointed with LTFRB’s order, commuters who rely on the motorbike service are dismayed as well. But why, LTFRB?

Citing the 2015 World Health Organization road safety report, the LTFRB said more than half (53%) of those who die in road accidents in the Philippines are motorcycle riders.  The LTFRB also cited a leading builder of Japanese motorcycles and motorcycle parts, which says motorcycle accidents ranked 4th as the top causes of death in the Philippines. \"The motorcycle maker said that there are 3.4 million motorcycle users in the Philippines and most of them are beginners. Because motorcycle is the most economical and easiest means of transportation to beat traffic congestion in the city, they are also involved in alarming statistics on motorcycle accidents in the country,\" the Philippine land transport regulator said. According to Transportation Assistant Secretary for Planning Sherielysse Reyes-Bonifacio, the GrabBike service, locally known as habal-habal, is not covered by any transportation category promulgated by the government. \"It’s a bit of a gray area. Motorbikes used as public transport aren’t covered by the new department order on transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Uber. Only four-wheeled vehicles are covered by TNVS,\" Bonifacio told Rappler in an interview last week. \"Commuters should understand. How can we protect them if this public transport service isn’t regulated?\" she added. LTFRB’s Ginez warned that GrabTaxi could face a cancellation of its accreditation if it continues to offer the motorcycle service. Until the government decides whether it will set up new rules for motorbike services, four-wheeled vehicles will remain the king of the streets in Metro Manila. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grabcar-uber-application-tro-quezon-city","title":"No Uber, GrabCar applications for 20 days – court","date":"Dec 4, 2015 1:59 PM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) The TRO does not apply to current operations of Uber, GrabCar, the Quezon City RTC judge clarifies","body":"MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A Quezon City court on Friday, December 4 ordered the government to stop accepting Uber and GrabCar applications for 20 days. This was after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) faced opposition and complaints on the accreditation of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS), particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber, GrabCar units plying and earning from the public transportation. In a 7-page temporary restraining order issued by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, Judge Santiago Arenas said the transportation department and LTFRB should stop \"accepting, processing, and approving of applications belonging to TNVS category…for a period of 20 days effective from date of receipt.\" It said that the petitioner, Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organization Transport Coalition, Incorporated (STOP and GO), \"has demonstrated that there is extreme urgency to issue TRO to prevent grave and irreparable injury and damages to the association’s officers and members because of their claim that they suffer less or low incomes…due to the sudden and uncontrolled increase in the number of TNVS utility vehicles running in the streets of Metro Manila.\" A separate letter signed by LTFRB Board Member Antonio Enrile-Inton Jr in October said there are a total of 4,465 accredited TNVS units to date, while around 3,500 applications are pending with the LTFRB. Asked if the TRO includes the suspension of operations of accredited TNVS, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said in a phone interview with Rappler: \"It's unclear if the operations of existing certified TNVS units are included in the TRO. What is clear is they are asking to stop for 20 days the applications of TNVS.\" Ginez said that the LTFRB will meet with the Office of the Solicitor General, which is handling the case, that afternoon. \"We will discuss our remedy,\" he said, but declined to elaborate. But later on Friday, Arenas clarified that the TRO does not apply to current operations of Uber and GrabCar, as it only stops government offices from accepting TNVS applications at the moment. Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya, meanwhile, replied to Rappler via a text message,\"We need to see a copy of the TRO and read its contents.\" Abaya is with President Benigno Aquino III in his working trip to Paris, Rome, and Vatican City and is flying back to Manila Friday. Implications In a statement, Uber said: \"Uber is aware of a decision issued earlier today by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court and is studying the implications of this decision upon Transport Network Vehicle Services performed by Uber partners. Uber was not a party to the proceedings that resulted in the court's decision and plans to coordinate closely with the DOTC and LTFRB.\" It added, \"Uber remains 100% committed to serving Filipino commuters and has confidence that the DOTC and LTFRB will continue working productively with Uber and other industry participants to issue all necessary permits under the prevailing regulations and assure the smooth operation of Transport Network Vehicle Services in Metro Manila and elsewhere in the Philippines.\" The imposition of a moratorium on the acceptance of applications for TNVS units was already opposed by Uber Technologies, Incorporated in October. \"[Imposing a] cap is not the right answer. The right answer is to let us, as a business, manage. The part of the game is building demand. So that is why when we come to a country like the Philippines, we spend a lot of money in marketing – to make people more aware of the service and make the pie much bigger,\" Uber Asia President of Business Eric Alexander told reporters in October. In a statement, GrabTaxi PH said the TRO has not been officially received by neither GrabCar nor the LTFRB. \"Until we receive the TRO, we will continue to operate as usual,\" it said. GrabTaxi PH added it is closely coordinating with the government and is hopeful it will get their support \"to be able to provide safe and convenient GrabCar rides in the country.\" \"Our commitment toward providing the highest quality of service remains.

Unlike similar app-based service Uber, passengers using GrabTaxi will need to specify their destination to get a ride. The system will then send a notification informing nearby drivers of the booking request. But this feature allows drivers to decide whether or not to pick up the passenger based on his or her destination, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said. The LTFRB board met with representatives of transportation network companies Uber and GrabTaxi on Friday, September 18, after complaints against GrabCar – a private car service also under Grabtaxi – went viral last week. Thousands of commuters were left stranded after a heavy downpour Tuesday night, forcing some to walk home due to the traffic gridlock. On social media, some commuters posted photos of their failed attempts to get a ride through GrabCar. They complained that none of the drivers shown as \"available\" in the app were accepting their booking requests. Several users also complained that they had to offer hefty tips before they were able to get a ride through the app-based service.  GrabTaxi has since apologized to its passengers, and said the company is looking into new ways to improve their services. At the LTFRB meeting, GrabCar Philippines head Natasha Bautista responded to complaints on the availability of nearby drivers when a passenger makes a booking request. While the app may show that there are dozens of available GrabCar drivers nearby, Bautista explained that not all of those units are available for the requesting passenger. \"The perception of the passenger is that there's one passenger and many drivers around. But what's really happening, when you look at the system, is that there are maybe around 200 passengers and 100 available drivers. It's not one is to 100,\" she said. Bautista added that some of their GrabTaxi units, who are also authorized to function as \"regular\" taxis, may show up as available on the app, but may already be carrying passengers who hail them from the streets. Tips as bribes? Last week, former Metropolitan Manila Development Authority \"traffic czar\" Yves Gonzalez also called out GrabTaxi over its abusive drivers who wait for big tips before picking up passengers. Gonzalez said desperate passengers are forced to offer big tips – which Gonzalez preferred to call \"bribes\" – just to get a ride home. \"Pesos are lost as the current mentality of a lot of the drivers is to wait for a big fat 'tip' to be inputted by the rider, who out of desperation to get a ride will succumb to the broken system and offer this 'tip.' The system has made a mockery of the traditional definition of a tip, which is something given after a job or service is well rendered,\" he said. But Bautista clarified that GrabCar drivers do not see the tips offered by passengers.  \"Drivers can't see the tips, so we can't say that the drivers only accept if they see the tips. We took out that feature since July,\" she said.

In the juniors division, the University of Cebu (UC) Junior Webmasters dealt the Don Bosco Technology Center (DBTC) Greywolves its sixth loss, 98-51, to improve its standings to a 3-2 win-loss record. In the other junior contest, the University of San Jose Recoletos (USJR) Baby Jaguars survived a second half challenge mounted by the CIT-U Wildkittens, 77-70, to clinch its second win in four games. With the win, the Warriors has kept its record clean, 5-0, after it has yet to drop a game halfway in the first round of the season. Ian Jefferson Tagapan clinched the best player title after he topscored the Warriors with 22 points, 18 of which he scored in the second half and went 9/16 field goals. He also pulled down 3 rebounds and had 1 assist and 1 block. Charles Pepito was once again very instrumental in the Warriors' fifth win by dominating the board with 11 rebounds and added 11 points. Both team's imports, Shooster Olago for USC Warriors and Steve Cedrick Akomo for UV Green Lancers also did not disappoint as they put on a dunking show to the spectators' delight. Olago finished with 20 points, 7 rebounds, 3 steals and 1 assist. Although Akomo had more presence under the net with 7 rebounds and 7 blocks, he also committed 6 turnovers. He finished with 12 points and managed 3 steals. The Warriors never relinquished the lead after they had immediately taken the upperhand, 12-2, just three minutes into the first half. The closest that the Green Lancers could come was at the start of the second half when they managed to tie the game at 39-all on Francisco Arong's Layup. However, Tagapan exploded with five baskets, three of them shot from the arc, to widen the gap at 52-42, which silenced all but one of Green Lancers shooters, Akomo, who managed to sneak in two baskets to keep his team at arm' length. A turnaround fadeway shot from Nicolas Kyle Magat and two baskets from Olago allowed the Warriors to erect a 12-point lead in the last two minutes of the third canto. The Green Lancers' situation was further complicated when Alwin Aguirre fouled out after committing three consecutive fouls on Caesar Ian Ortega, Pepito and Olago halfway in the final canto. The Green Lancers managed to cut down the Warriors' lead to 4 points on Jun Kent Manzo's basket, 70-66, with only 4 minutes remaining. But a triple play from Tagapan, who drew a foul from Jerome Napao, once again put them out of reach. The Green Lancers was awarded a free shot after a technical foul was called on the bench of the USC for improper decorum. Appropriately, Tagapan, who scored the first basket of the ballgame, was also the one who sealed it, allowing the USC a 10-point winning margin. The loss dropped the UV Green Lancers to second place with its 4-1 win-loss card. In the game between CITU Wildcats and USPF Panthers, Joshua Dela Cerna once again topscored with 21 points and 7 rebounds. However, the Wildcats will be missing a player on its next game after Joerio Kristoffer Mumar was ejected for throwing a punch to Lyndon Colina with just seconds left in the third quarter. This will bring to a total of 4 players this season who will undergo 4 hours of community service aside from the penalty of a one game suspension and P5,000 fine. The loss puts the comebacking USPF Panthers at the bottom rung with one more game to play in the first round. In the DBTC Greywolves versus UC Junior Webmasters game in the junior division, the Greywolves held a 1 point lead at the end of the 1st quarter but was not able to sustain it as they not only allowed the Junior Webmasters to wrestle the lead but also trailed as much as 12 points, 28-40, at the break. The Junior Webmasters' advantage ballooned to 30 points going into the final canto. The Greywolves' misfortune continued in the fourth quarter with their scorers, Rae Adrian Duque and Juan Miguel Dela Torre, being helped off the court one after the other. Duque was favoring his right knee while Dela Torre had his left foot iced after landing badly on it with four minutes remaining in the ballgame. In the other junior game, the CITU Wildkittens also failed to improve its standings against the USJR Baby Jaguars. The loss gave the Wildkittens a 1-4 win-loss record.

Operators of Uber, and competitor GrabCar will be apprehended starting Friday, August 21, if they are unable to secure the necessary franchise or provisional authority from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), chairman Winston Ginez said in a text message on Tuesday, August 11. It was in October 2014 when LTFRB stopped apprehending unregistered online ride-sharing providers, following an outcry from commuters. This paved the way for the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and LTFRB to create new transport categories, legalizing the new public utility vehicle (PUV) players. Accreditation issues In May this year, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. But after 3 months since its implementation, there are still TNVS operators who have not applied for TNVS accreditation. Despite their non-compliance with the regulations, the private vehicles accredited by Uber and GrabCar are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise, the LTFRB chairman said. “Though the regulations were issued in May, only GrabCar applied for accreditation as of today. But despite its accreditation as a transportation network company (TNC), GrabCar's partner vehicles are yet to apply for franchise with LTFRB,” Ginez said. Individual GrabCar operators will have until August 20 to apply for TNVS franchises and continue their operations. Starting August 21, the LTFRB said it will start apprehending unregistered TNCs and TNVS operators. Uber, according to LTFRB, has not applied for TNC accreditation yet. \"3 months had lapsed but Uber has yet to submit its application for accreditation,\" Ginez said. “I’ve been receiving public criticism. Despite this, we will continue to implement the law without fear or favor,” Ginez said. Under Joint Administrative Order (JAO) 2014-01, owners of private vehicles that operate as PUVs will be fined P200,000 ($4,346.90) each, and be impounded for 3 months. Sought for comment, Uber said it is confident of completing requirements by August 20. \"We are working closely with the DOTC and LTFRB and are confident of completing the relevant formalities for accreditation in the time stipulated,” Uber spokesperson Karun Arya said in an email. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodia-land-grab-victims-seek-icc-probe","title":"Cambodia land grab victims seek ICC probe","date":"Oct 7, 2014 10:03 AM PHT","snippet":"Victims of land grabs by Cambodia's 'ruling elite' call for the International Criminal Court to probe their mass evictions as a crime against humanity","body":"THE HAGUE, Netherlands – Victims of land grabs by Cambodia's \"ruling elite\" called on Tuesday, Otober 7, for the International Criminal Court to probe their mass evictions as a crime against humanity. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians have been affected as part of a \"widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, pursuant to state policy,\" said a complaint to be filed at The Hague-based ICC. \"The ruling elite have illegally seized and re-allocated millions of hectares of valuable land from poor Cambodians for exploitation or speculation by its members and foreign investors,\" said the complaint to be filed on behalf of victims by lawyer Richard Rogers on Tuesday. Aid groups estimate that 770,000 people, or six percent of Cambodia's population, have been evicted since 2000, including 20,000 people in the first three months of 2014. At least 4,000,000 hectares (10 million acres) of land have been confiscated, which represents 22 percent of Cambodia's land area, often for lucrative rubber or sugar plantations. \"Anyone who resists is being shot, raped, wrongfully prosecuted,\" Rogers told Agence France-Presse. \"The violations of human rights are massive.\" \"All this for the tiny elite ruling over the country to get richer and to retain power.\" Land grab victims are either sent to resettlement camps or left with nowhere to go, he said. 'Worse than Pol Pot' While Western countries have tried to condition aid on human rights, increasingly China is \"giving money without asking questions,\" Rogers said. The \"ruling elite\" has quelled resistance with attacks on civil society leaders, monks, journalists, lawyers, environmental activists and protesters, the complaint said, allegedly including over 300 politically motivated murders since the 1990s. \"There is a reasonable basis to believe that members of the ruling elite have committed, aided and abetted, ordered and/or incited the crimes of forcible transfer, murder, illegal imprisonment, other inhumane acts.\" Anyone can file a complaint with the office of ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and she must decide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an official investigation. Cambodia has ratified the court's Rome Statue, meaning the ICC has jurisdiction over the most serious crimes committed there since 2002. \"Entire villages have been burned to the ground and possessions stolen or destroyed\" by the police, the army and private security firms supported by \"the state apparatus,\" the complaint said. \"Dissidents have been brutally murdered by professional assassins or condemned to linger in jail on spurious charges.\" One eviction to make way for a development in Phnom Penh in January 2009 saw police armed with guns, electric and steel batons, wooden sticks, tear gas and water canon forcibly remove 400 families. \"When I saw the eviction it really was worse than Pol Pot,\" said an unnamed social worker and eviction victim, referring to the late leader of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime. \"During the Khmer Rouge people were evacuated from Phnom Penh, but they did not destroy the houses and give all the land to an individual.\" Land titles are a murky issue in Cambodia where private ownership was abolished during the 1975-1979 rule of the communist Khmer Rouge and many legal documents were lost. It is up to the ICC prosecutor to decide which individuals to prosecute, the complaint said, adding that Cambodia's justice system was not prosecuting any of the allegations, leaving it up to the ICC to intervene. The threat of a probe may encourage the Cambodian government to change its policies or pursue the alleged crimes in domestic courts, which would head off an ICC investigation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/ceres-pachanga-ufl-fa-league","title":"Ceres, Pachanga grab wins in UFL FA League","date":"Sep 24, 2014 2:26 AM PHT","snippet":"Ceres-La Salle FC and Pachanga-Diliman FC thwarted their foes to snatch wins in the group stage of the United Football League FA League Cup","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Ceres-La Salle FC and Pachanga-Diliman FC thwarted their foes to snatch wins in the group stage of the United Football League (UFL) FA League Cup at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium on Tuesday, September 23. Capitalizing on their momentum coming off an imposing first game win, Ceres FC dominated Stallion FC, 4-2, to tally their second win in the FA League Cup. The battle between the two Visayan clubs started off with Stallion FC exhibiting their strength by asserting their way through the heart of their rival’s defense, resulting in an early goal by Jordan Mintah in the 11th minute. Not long after, UFL rookie Adrian Gallardo answered back with a goal of his own off a pass from Orman Okunaiya in the 14th minute to level the score line at 1-1. A flurry of attacks coming from both sides marred the remaining minutes of the opening half but no more goals were sunk going into the break. Azkals standout Patrick Reichelt, who came in as a substitute in the 34th minute, extended the lead for Ceres as he notched one through the middle of the Stallion FC defense in the 50th minute. With just a single goal separating them from their opponents, Stallion FC continued on with their game, pressuring Ceres on both sides of the pitch but their toothless attacks were easy pickings for veteran goalkeeper Ed Sacapaño. Reichelt headed another goal into the back of the net off a corner kick in the 57th minute to extend the lead of his squad to 3-1. Consequently, Stallion retaliated on the other side via a free kick goal by Angel Carrascosa in the 61st minute. The game progressed with Ceres only leading Stallion by a goal, 3-2.  In the dying minutes of the game, veteran defender and Ceres FC skipper Juani Guirado wrote the final sentence of the match as he slipped a final goal in to end the game, 4-2. Meanwhile, Pachanga FC captured their first win in the tournament by overshadowing Manila Jeepney FC, 4-3. The action-packed game escalated quickly as back-to-back goals were slithered by both clubs five minutes into the first half courtesy of Pachanga’s Behrouz Khoshgavar and Manila Jeepney’s Arthur Kouassi. A few minutes after, Kouassi, in an effort to break the deadlock, broke free from his defender and struck a scissor’s kick towards the Pachanga goal but the crossbar denied his shot.  In the 22nd minute of the match, Gerardo Valmayor managed to find a gap on Manila Jeepney’s defense via a pass from his teammate Jafary Dastjerdi and finally break the 1-1 standstill between the two teams. Pachanga-Diliman was relentless with their offensive blitz forcing the defense of Manila Jeepney FC to give up a penalty kick due to a handball inside the box. Yi Young Park took the penalty and converted, giving his club a 3-1 advantage going into halftime. Preventing their adversaries from capturing an easy win, Manila Jeepney shifted their offense to full throttle which then led to another goal by Kouassi in the 53rd minute. The recharged offense of the Manila-based club proved to be instrumental as they managed to pull off a comeback via a penalty kick that was sank by Jahanbakhsh Zabihi Taher to tie the game at 3-3. Answering back on the other end, Valmayor logged his second goal to extinguish the fired up offense of Manila Jeepney and end the game with a 4-3 score line for his home squad. Also, to cap off the victories for Tuesday’s UFL action, Loyola Meralco Sparks FC trounced Army FC, 3-1, at the Emperador Stadium while Global FC devoured Dolphins United FC, 12-0. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/softbank-grab-public-listing-talks-spac-deal","title":"SoftBank-backed Grab in talks to go public in nearly $40-B SPAC deal – sources","date":"Mar 12, 2021 10:07 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab is expected to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion from private investors, according to a report","body":"Grab Holdings Inc is in talks to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that could value the ride-hailing giant at nearly $40 billion, making it the largest ever blank-check deal, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, March 11.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day SoftBank-backed Grab was in talks with Altimeter Capital Management LP. Grab is expected to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion from private investors, according to the report. Reuters first reported in January, citing sources, that Singapore-based Grab was exploring a listing in the United States. Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Altimeter has backed two SPACs –Altimeter Growth Corp and Altimeter Growth Corp 2. The WSJ report did not specify which of the two SPACs Grab was in talks with. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public. Other recent large SPAC deals include UMW Holdings Corp's $16-billion merger with a blank-check firm backed by billionaire Alec Gores, and the $24-billion deal that luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors struck with a Michael Klein-backed SPAC.

The 5-year senior secured loan was upsized from the initial $750 million after the company secured commitments from international institutional investors, Singapore-based Grab said in a statement on Monday, February 1. Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Grab, said that investors recognized the value of Grab's super app platform, as \"we continue making consistent progress in achieving our growth and sustainability milestones.\" Backed by investors including Softbank Group Corporation, Grab has evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. Ranked as Southeast Asia's most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $16 billion, Grab recently won a digital bank license in Singapore. Last month, Grab said its total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year-on-year in 2020 and recovered to comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. The loan will be used for general corporate purposes and will allow Grab to diversify its finances. Grab said the interest rate on the loan was lowered by 100 basis points from the original launch guidance to 450 basis points over LIBOR. Grab's food business, which has benefited from a sector-wide boom in food delivery as countries imposed lockdowns, accounts for more than 50% of its revenue. Grab expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021.

Denice \"The Menace\" Zamboanga (7-0) maintained her clean record as she scored a unanimous decision victory against Japanese veteran Mei \"V.V\" Yamaguchi (21-12-1).      Zamboanga completely dominated the former title contender from start to finish and left prints of her fists on Yamaguchi's face. The 23-year old-fighter landed clean jabs and averted the takedown attempts from Yamaguchi in the opening round. More of the same happened in the 2nd round as Zamboanga continued to deliver powerful counters and combinations. The Japanese veteran, though, momentarily brought down the Filipina striker, but Zamboanga turned things around and pummeled her foe with punches while on the ground. Zamboanga kept her aggressive attacks and delivered the finishing touches in the final round to complete another upset. The Filipina brawler out of Fairtex Gym, who stunned another atomweight prospect Jihin \"Shadowcat\" Radzuan in her ONE debut last December, will now look for a title shot against Angela Lee. Yamaguchi, on the other hand, saw her four-bout winning streak end. Banario vs Wiratchai Meanwhile, Honorio \"The Rock\" Banario (15-10) snapped out of his slump and snagged a split decision victory over Thai striker Shannon \"Oneshin\" Wiratchai (9-6)     Wiratchai tried to open the match on a high note and landed a clean left body kick early in the 1st round before Banario brought the fight on the ground late. The former ONE Featherweight champion absorbed another left kick in the 2nd round but immediately put his foe back to the canvass, where he took control and bombarded the Thai fighter with punches and elbows. Wiratchai put up a fight in the final round and avoided Banario's take down attempts. But the Team Lakay representative already created enough separation to pull off the win that ended his losing streak. Banario dropped all of his 3 bouts in 2019, including a submission loss against Shinya Aoki last October. Abelardo vs Worthen There was no sweep for the Filipino fighters, though, as Filipino-Kiwi Mark \"Tyson\" Fairtex Abelardo (19-7) could not handle the flawless performance of American wrestler Troy \"Pretty Boy\" Worthen (7-0) and suffered from a decision loss.     Worthen pretty much manhandled Abelardo all throughout the match through his accurate kicks and powerful takedowns. Abelardo had his moment early in the opening round where he displayed a beautiful combination, but the American fighter quickly answered and stunned the Fil-Kiwi with a left head kick. In the co-main event, the strawweight kickboxing champion Sam-A Gaiyanghadao (369-47-9) took the inaugural ONE Super Series Strawweight muay thai belt as he edged the Aussie figter Rocky Ogden (36-5-1) via unanimous decision. Sam-A dominated the match and toyed Ogden in the 4th and 5th round to secure another ONE title belt. Meanwhile, American kickboxer Janet \"JT\" Todd (36-11) took a split decision win to claim the ONE Atomweight kickboxing title over Thailand's Stamp Fairtex (63-16-5).

The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media. A personal apology followed. \"We lose patience many times,\" Francis confessed. \"It happens to me too. I apologize for the bad example given yesterday,\" the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican. Twitter enthusiasts commented with abandon on the pontiff's prompt riposte to the woman. Francis had greeted children before the Nativity scene on Saint Peter's square and was turning away when the woman who had crossed herself then cried out something, pulled on his hand and almost caused him to fall. The 83-year-old pope grimaced before managing to break free by slapping her hand twice. He continued his tour, walking with some difficulty while maintaining a slightly greater distance from visitors, and gradually relaxed again as he came into contact with other children. Twitter comments were mostly supportive of the pontiff's instinctive reaction. \"HE IS HUMAN.. Been (sic) a Pope doesn't make you immune to Pain or avoid Reaction to pain,\" one typical comment read. In his first Mass of the New Year, the pontiff later denounced \"all violence against women\" as \"a profanation of God, born of a woman.\" Francis also said women were \"the source of life\" but deplored that they were constantly \"offended, beaten, abused and forced into prostitution\" and forced to \"supress the life they carry within\" them. He emphasised that the \"rebirth of humanity began with a woman,\" and bemoaned that women's bodies were \"sacrificed on the profane altars of advertising, profit, pornography.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/video-game-recap-highlights-april-17-2019","title":"WATCH: NBA game recap and highlights","date":"Apr 18, 2019 7:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Three teams grab a 2-0 series lead to inch closer to the NBA playoff conference semifinals","body":"    MANILA, Philippines – The Milwaukee Bucks and Houston Rockets inched closer to the NBA playoff conference semifinals after posting easy wins while Kyrie Irving led a late Boston fightback in a dramatic win over Indiana on Wednesday, April 17 (Thursday, April 18, Manila time).

In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. \"What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares... but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,\" Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab's pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is \"sufficient competition\" in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. \"The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it's providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,\" Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB's franchise cap at 65,000 units. \"To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of 'maximum supply' – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,\" Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as \"demand exceeds supply.\" To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/nba-2k-league-esport-launch","title":"Virtual championship, real ambition as NBA launches eSport league","date":"May 1, 2018 12:03 AM PHT","snippet":"A total prize pool of $1 million is up for grabs in the league featuring 17 of the 30 NBA franchises","body":"LOS ANGELES, United States – A virtual championship with real ambitions gets under way on Tuesday, May 1, as the National Basketball Association tips off its bid to gain a foothold in the burgeoning arena of eSports with the launch of its NBA 2K League. The league mirrors the NBA – with a regular season, playoffs and a draft presided over by commissioner Adam Silver, where top franchises vie to secure the stars of tomorrow. The NBA 2K League is based on the best-selling basketball video game of the same name which has sold more than 60 million copies since its launch in 1999. It is the first time a major professional US sports league has embraced eSports to the point of setting up its own league. The NBA 2K season will run for 17 weeks until August, with a 15-week regular season followed by two playoffs and three independent tournaments, competing for a total prize pool of $1 million (820,000 euros). Seventeen of the 30 NBA franchises have agreed to field teams of 6 players, who each receive a salary of between $32,000 and $35,000, in addition to their accommodation. Speaking at the new league's draft in April, NBA commissioner Silver said the new eSports venture was now part of the league's family, enthusiastically lauding the skills and dedication of its players. \"From the NBA's standpoint, this is our 4th league. We have the NBA, the WNBA, the G-League and now this is the 4th league in our family, and that's exactly as we're treating it,\" Silver said. 'New generation of athletes'  \"What's so exciting today is we'll be welcoming a new generation of athletes, of NBA players, into this league,\" \"It's a different set of physical skills certainly, but to watch these gamers/athletes compete, what I've read about their training regimens they go through, it's incredibly hard work.\" Silver, a former lawyer who has been widely praised for his leadership of the NBA since taking over in 2014, was impressed by the potential of eSports after seeing 22,000 fans flock to Madison Square Garden in August 2015 for the North American League of Legends Championship final, the pinnacle of eSports. Silver swiftly convinced NBA 2K video game publisher Take-Two Interactive to embrace his vision for an NBA-backed league. While not every team has entered a franchise in the inaugural season, those who are participating have said the decision was a no-brainer. \"It was an easy decision to make,\" Jason Wexler, president of business operations with the Memphis Grizzlies, told AFP. \"It's a good way to start to understand the eSport base a little bit better. It's not a gimmick, it is a very real sport. It's better to figure out how to come onboard now, rather than wait.\" With their virtual championship taking place in a studio in New York, which will be broadcast on the Twitch gaming platform, NBA officials say they hope to engage three types of audience – the millions of gamers who play NBA 2K around the world, the estimated 1.4 billion fans of the NBA, and a further 200 million or so estimated eSports enthusiasts. eSports 'exploding'  Brendan Donohue, managing director of the NBA 2K League, said the league's launch reflects the pull of eSports. \"We saw eSport just exploding,\" Donohue told AFP. \"Over the last three years it has doubled in size. Experts say it is likely to again double in size in the next 3 years.\" To select the league's players, an open casting was held among all those who have won at least 50 games on NBA 2K's difficult Pro-Am setting. That process produced 72,000 hopefuls, whose skills were evaluated virtually and remotely by playing 40 matches at a specific position and with a profile and physical capabilities predefined by the game designer. Eventually 102 mostly American players were selected, entering a draft which then decided the make-up of the 17 teams. Lang Whitaker, the general manager of Memphis's eSport team –\"Grizz Gaming\" – said teaching players used to competing in isolation to be part of a team was a particular focus. \"Most of these guys are pretty much used to playing the game the whole day. They are used to putting in a huge amount of time,\" Whitaker said. \"They haven't been in the same room playing togther. That's our focus, discussing strategy. They are the very best of the game. They just need to get used to playing together.\" – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-appeal-ltfrb-order-p2-per-minute","title":"Grab appeals suspension of P2-per-minute charge","date":"Apr 20, 2018 6:36 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines says the suspension order is 'contrary to the law' and would 'cause irreparable damage' to riders and drivers","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines on Friday, April 20, filed a motion for reconsideration after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered the ride-hailing company to suspend its P2-per-minute travel duration charges. In its appeal, Grab Philippines said that the suspension order is \"contrary to the law\" and would \"cause irreparable damage\" to riders and drivers. \"[T]he said decision is contrary to law, the revised rule of procedure of the LTFRB and jurisprudence, which would cause grave or irreparable damage not only to the respondent but more so, to the operators and drivers of the accredited transportation network vehicles if the same is not rectified,\" the motion said.  LTFRB maintained that it did not approve the additional travel duration charges, consistent with its December 27, 2016 order that regulated the fares of ride-hailing companies. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, the December 2016 order said. In a statement released late Thursday, April 19, Grab Philippines said they had removed the P2-per-minute charges in their fare scheme, but reiterated that the charges went to the drivers and the riders. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) \"Pursuant to LTFRB's order, we are suspending our P2-per-minute fare component effective today and until further notice.

Uber announced last March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. The PCC's mandate is to protect competition in the market and prohibit anti-competitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. The PCC said it will evaluate and analyze if after the acquisition, prices will likely increase; ride-sharing services will deteriorate; passengers will effectively have less options; and how likely new transport network companies (TNCs) will be able to fairly compete against the merged firm. Uber drivers in the Philippines were told to move to the Grab platform by Sunday, April 8. (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?) \"A merger or acquisition review using competition lens will determine whether the merger of two players in the ride-sharing market will substantially lessen competition,\" the PCC said. Meeting with Grab, Uber The PCC said it is set to meet with representatives of Uber and Grab on Monday to determine if the companies are required to formally notify the commission about their deal and have it reviewed. Back in March, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC raised the threshold to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations. Like in other global transactions that the PCC has handled, the commission said it will look into the operations of Grab and Uber in the Philippines as basis for the thresholds. \"If the transaction is notifiable, Grab and Uber are not allowed to consummate the deal without PCC approval,\" the commission said. \"If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns.\" Should anti-competitive concerns arise, the PCC said Grab and Uber may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or prevent negative effects on market competition. The PCC may launch a motu proprio review or open a case that may disentangle or block the deal, should Uber and Grab decline to submit transaction details. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/canaleta-no-revenge-clutch-meralco-blackwater","title":"Canaleta says 'no revenge' in clutch performance vs former team","date":"Dec 22, 2017 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The Meralco Bolts' KG Canaleta scores 25 points and grabs 9 rebounds against the Blackwater Elite","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Journeyman KG Canaleta showed why he remains a commodity in the PBA with a vintage game of 25 points and 9 rebounds for the Meralco Bolts against the Blackwater Elite, his former team.

But the Tarlac City native clarified he wasn't out for revenge against the Elite, whom he helped almost pull off an upset against the Bolts in the quarterfinals of the 2017 Governors' Cup. \"Wala namang revenge or ano,\" Canaleta said. \"Every game naman, kailangang maging motivated ka.

Tulod and his still-unidentified companions booked a ride with Maquidato on the night of October 26 before shooting and killing him. A witness said he heard gunshots around 7:50 pm and saw the lifeless body of the Grab driver pushed out of his silver Toyota Innova along Bonanza Street in Pasay City.

A sworn statement by the witness, who asked not to be identified for safety reasons, said Delemios shot and killed Balbuena while they were playing cara y cruz in the early morning of October 10, 2014, at the corner of Bagong Sikat Street and Dimasalang Extension in Baclaran. Delemios, the witness said in the statement, was with a certain Jeric Lim, who served as “back-up” in the incident.  Balbuena’s sister said a possible motive for the killing of Gino was a petty quarrel in a basketball game.  Maquidato was one of Grab Philippines' driver awardees, recognized for giving a courtesy ride to a sick passenger. A Facebook post, which went viral in August 2016, commended Maquidato for picking up a diabetes patient on her way to collect bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato did not charge his passenger for fare out of kindness. (Read the Facebook post here.)  Because of the killing of Maquidato, Grab Philippines has implemented a \"No ID, No Entry\" policy, allowing their driver-partners to ask passengers for personal identification cards before letting them onto their cars.   \"Before starting the trip, our driver-partners may ask you to show a personal identification card (ID) to verify your identity, especially during nightshift hours.

Mana yang berikan layanan termurah saat hujan?","body":"Memesan ojek online memang telah menjadi kebiasaan bagi masyarakat, terutama di kota yang penuh kemacetan seperti Jakarta. Dibanding menggunakan kendaraan umum atau memesan transportasi on demand berupa mobil, layanan seperti Go-Jek, UberMotor, dan GrabBike tentu bisa lebih cepat mengantarkan para pengguna di tengah kemacetan. Namun ketika musim hujan, menggunakan layanan on demand berupa sepeda motor pasti akan mengurangi kenyamanan. Untungnya, masyarakat masih mempunyai alternatif berupa taksi atau layanan on demand berupa mobil. Pertanyaannya, dari sekian banyak layanan yang tersedia, mana yang menghadirkan tarif termurah? Saya pun mencoba untuk membandingkan semua layanan tersebut. Sebagai informasi, saya memesan layanan ini dari kawasan Mampang Prapatan menuju Plaza Festival di Kuningan, Jakarta Selatan, yang berjarak 3,7 kilometer. Pesanan tersebut saya lakukan di hari kerja, sekitar pukul 16:30, dan dalam kondisi hujan. UberX dan UberPool  Layanan pertama yang saya coba adalah UberX. Uber sendiri mengenakan beberapa komponen tarif yang harus dibayar pengguna layanan ini, yaitu tarif dasar sebesar Rp3.000, biaya bensin Rp2.000 per kilometer, dan biaya pengemudi sebesar Rp300 per menit. Saat kondisi hujan dan waktu pulang kerja, permintaan di lokasi tertentu biasanya akan naik, dan UberX pun memberlakukan kenaikan harga (surge pricing). Ketika saya mencoba memesan, saya mendapati kenaikan harga sebesar 1,3 kali. Oleh karena itu, tarif minimal yang tertera di aplikasi Uber adalah sekitar Rp19.500. Selain UberX, Uber juga menyediakan layanan berbagi tumpangan yang bernama UberPool. Layanan ini menghadirkan tarif tetap yang besarnya 25 persen lebih murah dibanding tarif minimal UberX. Oleh karena itu, saya hanya perlu membayar Rp14.500 jika menggunakan layanan ini. Berbeda dengan layanan lain yang saya coba dalam perbandingan ini, dengan UberPool saya harus berkendara dengan beberapa penumpang lain. Karena itu, meski tarif UberPool lebih murah, waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk sampai di tempat tujuan bisa menjadi lebih lama. Go-Car Berbeda dengan Uber yang membagi tarif mereka menjadi tiga komponen, Go-Car hanya menghitung tarif berdasarkan jarak yang ditempuh oleh pengguna.  Mereka memberlakukan tarif Rp6.000 per kilometer di jam sibuk (rush hour), sehingga seharusnya saya hanya perlu membayar sekitar Rp22.200 untuk sampai di Plaza Festival. Akan tetapi, ketika saya mencoba layanan Go-Car, aplikasi Go-Jek justru membuat rute yang sedikit memutar, sehingga menaikkan jarak tempuh menjadi 4,8 kilometer. Itulah mengapa tarif yang tertera di aplikasi adalah Rp29.000. GrabCar Serupa dengan Go-Car, GrabCar juga hanya mengenakan tarif per kilometer kepada pengguna. Mereka memberlakukan tarif Rp2.800 per kilometer pada hari kerja, dan Rp4.000 per kilometer saat akhir pekan. Namun GrabCar juga memberlakukan surge pricing apabila permintaan terhadap layanan mereka naik. Itulah mengapa tarif normal yang seharusnya hanya sekitar Rp10.360 (dengan jarak perjalanan 3,7 kilometer) naik 2,7 kali lipat menjadi Rp28.000. GrabTaxi dan Blue Bird Selain kendaraan on demand berupa mobil, masyarakat Jakarta juga bisa memesan layanan taksi secara online, baik dengan aplikasi Grab (untuk layanan GrabTaxi) maupun dengan aplikasi Blue Bird. Karena tarif taksi ditentukan berdasarkan argo, maka kedua aplikasi tersebut pun hanya bisa memberikan perkiraan harga, bukan harga pasti. Dari aplikasi Grab, saya mendapatkan perkiraan harga Rp30.000 hingga Rp45.000, sedangkan dari aplikasi Blue Bird saya mendapatkan perkiraan tarif Rp20.000. Ketika saya mencoba secara langsung, ternyata perkiraan dari Grab lebih mendekati kenyataan, karena saya akhirnya harus membayar sekitar Rp35.000. Dari perbandingan di atas, bisa dilihat kalau layanan UberX merupakan pilihan yang cukup baik ketika hujan karena harganya yang lebih murah. GrabCar juga bisa menjadi alternatif karena tarifnya yang cenderung lebih murah apabila tidak ada surge pricing. Namun perlu diingat kalau surge pricing dari UberX dan GrabCar memang bisa berbeda-beda, tergantung kondisi pada saat memesan layanan tersebut. Dalam kondisi ekstrem, tak mustahil kalau tarif UberX dan GrabCar bisa jadi lebih mahal dibandingkan layanan yang memberlakukan tarif tetap seperti Go-Car. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/death-squads-incomplete-history","title":"Death squads: An incomplete history","date":"Oct 27, 2016 2:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Rooted in colonial history, their growth was spurred during the periods of transition when state power was up for grabs","body":"Duterte, as is well known, made his reputation by negotiating with both vigilantes and communists, absorbing elements of both into his regime. If various reports are to be believed, he, or at least those around him, recruited former NPAs and other lumpen types to serve as para-military forces in dealing with a new enemy: drug lords and drug users. As mayor of Davao, his reputation as “the Punisher” emerged at the crossroads of democratic transition and counter-insurgency, when \"People Power\" was taken to mean that ordinary people would be empowered to act on behalf of the state and kill its designated enemies. In a way, death squads are the perverse doubles of NGOs as both shared a parallel history in the outsourcing of state functions. Contradictory course Things have thus come full circle. Death squads encouraged by Cory as a much-needed supplement to the military's counter-insurgency war have now morphed into the death squads used by Duterte in his war against drugs. Rather than a new development, death squads, vigilantes, para-military volunteers of all sorts have long been a part of the colonial and national state. As with other modern states, the Philippine state has pursued what seems like a contradictory course: it has simultaneously sought to monopolize the use of violence even as it outsources it, using uncivil means to secure civil society. The legal and the illegal constantly blur into one other, as the language of the president often sounds like the rhetoric of a gangster. Indeed, the police double as vigilantes, while convicted felons ally with government officials to silence the latter's critics. Extrajudicial killings, sold to the public as a remedy to the inefficient and corrupt legal system, normalize murder even as it foregrounds fear as a primary technique of governing. Public resources are used to forge private armies--a kind of PPP, or public-private-partnership for producing the techniques for the efficient delivery of death. Exercising a kind of bio-political power, the state seeks to secure the life of its citizens. But it does so by way of a necro-political power, whereby the state consigns others as social enemies destined for abjection and disposal. A final note: there is an interesting way in which the labor of death squads resonates with the most prevalent form of labor among the country’s citizens today. Those who join death squads are essentially contractual laborers. They can be hired and fired for as short or as long as their employers need them. They occupy a very precarious existence, and are liable to be killed themselves. In short, they are like so many millions of Filipinos today working on contractual basis, whether at home or abroad. Just as the political history of death squads is the \"underside\" of People Power, especially outside of Metro Manila, its political economy of violence seems to echo the normalized violence faced by workers today. – Rappler.com   (Author’s notes: I’m indebted for these reflections to the works of several scholars, including: Eve Lotta Hedman, John Sidel, Alfred McCoy, Michael Cullinane, Patricio Abinales, Donna Amoroso, Benedict Anderson, Greg Bankoff, Roseanne Rutten, Rico Jose, Mila Guerrero, Achile Mbembe, Michel Foucault, and many others.

Five non-permanent seats are up for grabs in the vote at the UN General Assembly, but two are all but decided. Ethiopia and Bolivia are running unopposed after their regional grouping put them forward as their candidates, but they must still pick up 2/3 of votes cast in the 193-nation assembly. Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden are competing for two spots while Kazakhstan and Thailand are squaring off for a seat reserved for Asia. On the eve of the vote, Human Rights Watch called on UN member-states to take a cold, hard look at the human rights record of Kazakhstan and Thailand. Thailand's military junta, which seized power in May 2014, has banned political activity and ramped up prosecutions under tough sedition and royal defamation laws. \"Thailand's pledges to lead the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide as a Security Council member ring hollow in the face of its widespread abuses at home,\" said HRW's deputy director for global advocacy, Philippe Bolopion. Vying for a council seat for the first time since its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has been criticized for cracking down on journalists and political activists. \"Debate happens in UN corridors in New York in a way that is not allowed in Kazakhstan itself,\" Bolopion said. Italy takes migrants to UN Italy has lobbied fiercely for a council seat, portraying itself as a crossroads country in the Mediterranean and touting its experience dealing with the refugee crisis. \"Italy is a global security actor,\" said Italian Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi during a recent election debate. \"We think we are ideally placed to deal with the peace and security issues on the agenda.\" Italy is also seen as a player in efforts to pull Libya out of chaos. The Netherlands, home to the International Criminal Court and other world tribunals, has played up its commitment to international justice while Sweden has highlighted its role as a major aid donor. Italy and the Netherlands have a \"very good chance of winning\" seats, said David Malone, rector of the United Nations University. \"Surely Asia, with many governments focused above all on economic and social development in often creative and highly successful ways, can do better\" than Thailand and Kazakhstan, he said. The 5 elected countries will begin a two-year stint on the council on January 1, taking their seats alongside the five permanent council members – Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States. As the most powerful body of the United Nations, the Security Council can impose sanctions, endorse peace accords and authorize the use of military force. It also oversees 16 peacekeeping missions in the world, with a budget of about $8 billion. Winning a Security Council seat \"is a great PR victory for governments to their constituents,\" said Martin Edwards, who teaches UN and global governance at Seton Hall University. The challenge is finding space to influence decisions that are mostly in the hands of the five veto-wielding members. \"They'll have the chance to speak but some states speak more loudly than others,\" said Edwards.

Mereka menuntut agar transportasi berbasis aplikasi online segera ditutup. Salah satu perwakilan dari Paguyuban Pengendara Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Suwardi mengatakan ada sekitar 15 ribu demonstran yang ikut turun ke jalan. \"Kami menuntut agar aplikasi online tersebut segera ditutup, karena sudah menyengsarakan pengemudi angkutan umum resmi,\" ujar Suwardi yang merupakan sopir taksi Blue Bird. Dari armada taksi tempatnya bekerja, masing-masing pull mengirimkan 40 orang untuk berdemonstrasi. Belum lagi dari armada taksi lainnya. Semula mereka berkumpul dan berorasi di depan Balai Kota serta menuntut untuk bertemu Gubernur DKI Jakarta, Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahja Purnama. Namun, perwakilan hanya bisa bertemu dengan Kepala Dinas Perhubungan. Dari sana, mereka berjalan kaki menuju ke area Monas di dekat Istana Negara. Suwardi menjelaskan sejak transportasi umum berbasis aplikasi online beroperasi, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Salah satu rekannya yang bekerja di armada taksi Express hanya bisa menyetor sekitar Rp150 ribu hingga Rp200 ribu. Padahal, sebelumnya, rekannya itu bisa menyetor hingga Rp300 ribu. \"Saya sendiri hanya bisa setor ke perusahaan. Komisi untuk dibawa pulang tidak ada,\" keluh Suwardi. Akibat berkurangnya pemasukan tiap bulan, banyak rekannya yang tidak sanggup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari seperti membayar kontrakan. Bahkan, ada istri yang meminta cerai. Dia mengatakan kantor pusat Blue Bird merestui niat mereka berdemonstrasi. Baginya lebih baik dia dan sopir taksi lainnya berdemonstrasi hari ini, ketimbang tidak ada kejelasan di masa depan mengenai persaingan yang tidak sehat tersebut. \"Kami bukannya mempermasalahkan kalah saing dengan transportasi berbasis online. Selama mereka menaati aturan-aturan yang sudah ada, membayar pajak, jika mereka taksi maka mereka memasang plat kuning, ada argo dan tera, kami tidak mempermasalahkan,\" papar Suwardi. Sementara, setiap kali mereka mengaku rugi karena harus mengeluarkan biaya untuk mengurus  semua persyaratan agar menjadi transportasi umum yang legal. \"Sementara, pengendara grab dan Uber kan menggunakan mobil pribadi. Bahkan, ketika kami perhatikan dari platnya tidak hanya berasal dari Jakarta, tetapi juga Tangerang, Tegal, Semarang dan Cirebon,\" kata dia. Mewakili rekan-rekannya, Suwardi mengaku kecewa terhadap sikap pemerintah yang malah melanggar aturan yang mereka buat sendiri. Demonstrasi anarkis Dalam demonstrasi tersebut, Rappler menemukan satu kendaraan dengan jenis Toyota Avanza berwarna hitam yang dirusak oleh para demonstran. Menurut petugas polisi yang Rappler temui, mobil tersebut dirusak oleh para demonstran merupakan salah satu armada Grab yang tertangkap basah tengah beroperasi di depan Kementerian Koordinator Politik, Hukum dan Keamanan. Lalu, bagaimana respons dari perwakilan PPAD soal sikap anarkis ini? Suwardi mengatakan tidak bisa mencegah hal itu. \"Karena di sini kan ada beberapa pihak yang ikut berdemonstrasi, sehingga tidak bisa menjamin 100 persen. Kalau kami dari sopir taksi pasti tertib. Walau ada suara sumbang dari kami, tetapi itu kan hanya sebatas suara,\" papar Suwardi. Buka lapangan pekerjaan Sementara, salah satu pengemudi transportasi berbasis online, Go-Jek, Dadang Trisnandi mengatakan tidak mempermasalahkan jika para sopir kendaraan umum konvensional ingin berdemonstrasi. Dia hanya berharap demonstrasi tidak berlangsung anarkis. \"Saya memang menduga mereka berdemonstrasi karena mengeluh mengenai pendapatannya yang banyak berkurang setelah ada kehadiran Go-Jek dan Grab. Tapi, itu semua kini ada di tangan pemerintah,\" ujar Dadang. Sebab, dia melanjutkan yang membuat aturan dan hukum adalah pemerintah. Dia turut menyebut justru dengan kehadiran Go-jek dan perusahaan startup sejenis membantu pemerintah menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan. \"Saya kembalikan kepada masyarakat selaku pengguna, apakah mereka ingin Go-Jek ditutup atau tidak. Pemerintah atau pejabat yang berwenang terhadap masalah ini juga perlu membuat kajian apakah transportasi berbasis online memberikan banyak manfaat atau malah merugikan,\" kata dia. Tak bayar pajak? Guberur DKI Jakarta, Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama yang ditemui pada Selasa, 15 Maret meminta pemilik atau pengelola layanan transportasi berbasis online untuk memenuhi kewajiban membayar pajak. Berdasarkan aturan, setiap pengusaha angkutan di Jakarta wajib membayar pajak yang nilainya sekitar 25 hingga 28 persen dari total pendapatannya setiap tahun. Pengusaha transportasi berbasis online juga tak luput dari pajak itu. \"Transportasi online itu pasti lebih murah, karena kan tidak harus membayar pajak, bayar asuransi dan lain-lain. Sedangkan, angkutan umum konvensional dan taksi harus memenuhi kewajiban untuk membayar pajak tersebut,\" ujar mantan Bupati Bangka Belitung itu. Sementara, salah satu pengemudi Grab Car bernama Bashari menepis jika pihaknya abai membayar pajak. \"Bahkan nominal yang dipungut perusahaan itu berkisar Rp170 ribu-Rp180 ribu setiap minggunya. Itu dari satu pengemudi,\" ujar Bashari ketika ditemui Rappler pada Senin, 14 Maret. Dia pun berkisah saat ini menjadi pengemudi Grab Car semakin kompetitif, karena jumlahnya yang semakin banyak \"Sekarang, saya harus bekerja selama 15 jam sehari untuk bisa mencapai target penghasilan Rp3 juta per minggu. Jadi, kami turut merasakan kesulitan,\" kata dia. Harus lebih kompetitif Pengamat transportasi dari Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia (MTI), Dharmaningtyas, berpendapat senada dengan Ahok. Menurutnya, walaupun mengaku sebagai perusahaan teknologi, tetapi baik Grab dan Uber memberikan jasa layanan transportasi bagi publik. Di saat taksi-taksi reguler dikenai pajak, kir (pengujian kendaraan bermotor), dan dituntut memiliki pull. \"Sementara, angkutan seperti Grab dan Uber kan tidak. Masalahnya kan di situ. Menguntungkan konsumen, tetapi bagi operator taksi pada umumnya merugikan. Apalagi bagi taksi reguler,\" ujar Dharmaningtyas yang dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin malam, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa yang sebaiknya dilakukan pemerintah? Dharmaningtyas menyarankan agar Presiden Joko Widodo mengingatkan kedua perusahaan itu agar tetap tunduk kepada UU No 22 tahun 2009 mengenai Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. \"Tetapi, jika Presiden ingin merevisi UU tersebut harus hati-hati. Sebab, penggunaan angkutan berbasis aplikasi online ini hanya ada di kota-kota besar. Sementara, UU kan berlaku secara nasional,\" kata dia. Dia menyarankan sebaiknya aplikasi itu digunakan oleh operator taksi yang legal. \"Tetapi, taksi konvensional juga harus berbenah diri, menurunkan tarif agar lebih bisa kompetitif. Alasan publik menggunakan taksi Uber dan Grab kan karena tarifnya lebih murah. Pengelola taksi reguler harus mencari jawaban bagaimana bisa menerapkan tarif yang kompetitif,\" papar dia. - Rappler.com BACA JUGA:  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-montero-commuters","title":"LTFRB: Avoid riding Montero units offered by riding services","date":"Dec 3, 2015 4:25 PM PHT","snippet":"The agency tells the public to choose other premium vehicles from companies like Uber and GrabCar","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Following recent complaints about the \"sudden unintended acceleration\" of Mitsubishi Montero units, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) advised the public to avoid using them when offered by riding services.

A concerned lawyer urged LTFRB Thursday, December 3, to put on hold the approval of the applications of Montero vehicles accredited by Uber and GrabCar. \"As shown on TV and news item, said model Mitsubishi Montero Sport would suddenly accelerate very fast and run wild beyond the control of the driver thereby causing damage to properties and injuries not only to the driver but to pedestrians as well,\" wrote Felizardo Tiu's letter to LTFRB. \"[We] request your office to suspend or hold in abeyance the approval of application of Transport Network Vehicle Service.\" Tiu called for urgent action on the part of the regulatory body. \"It's just proper to protect the riding public. You might not be using Montero Sport but if that [Montero Sport] is on the highway, then suddenly accelerates, who would stop them?\" the lawyer told reporters after he filed his complaint. The LTFRB assured the public of a speedy response to the case but also stressed that it would have to wait for the results of the Department of Trade and Industry's investigation, which is set to be released in two weeks. Asked about their quickest action to prevent any accident, Inton said they would ask for the TNC's initiative to suspend their vehicle's accreditation. \"If [Uber and GrabCar] suspend the accreditation of those Monteros within that two-week period, [it would] probably help. If the TNC will suspend the accreditation and furnish their copy to us, then we can act on that their suspension,\" Inton said, noting that they cannot simply revoke the provisional authority they issued to the vehicles.

The new categories, expected to be published later this week, are an effort to modernize transportation services, and usher in the conveniences offered by technological innovation especially with increasing demand for these services, the DOTC said (READ: Taxis beware: Gov't introduces 4 new transport categories). “The Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) classification will allow app-based services offered by Transportation Network Companies (TNC) to exist within our regulatory framework,” said DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya. The new classification is the fruit of collaborative efforts between the DOTC, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and TNCs a few months ago to formulate updated classification policies. Under the new classification, a TNC is defined as an organization that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an Internet-based technology application or a digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles. TNCs will provide the public with online-enabled transportation services known as a TNVS, which will connect drivers with ride-seekers through an app. A new classification is also being created for Premium Taxis, which compared to regular taxis, will have the advantage of being equipped with global positioning system (GPS), of having online and smartphone booking capability, a 7-year age limit, and transactions using credit or debit cards. “Many people appreciate the safe and convenient services offered by the TNVS category. We want this to motivate other public utility vehicle operators to modernize, upgrade, and innovate their services for the benefit of the public,” Abaya said.  Requirements The DOTC is imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility under the new TNVS classification like the requirement of GPS tracking and navigation devices for convenience and safety. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles will be allowed and a maximum age limit of 7 years will be enforced.

The country is also in an advantageous position to grab Japan's declining automotive investments in Thailand and China, said Toru Asai, Automative International Trade Policy Director of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Monday, June 16. Asai is in the country for the Industrial Cooperation Dialogue between the Philippines and Japan. \"It is necessary to take strong policies to prevent domestic vehicles from falling behind imported cars as quickly as possible,\" Asai said in his presentation. Asai said without policies that would offset price differentials between imported cars and domestic cars, vehicle production in the Philippines will remain stagnant or even decrease. Local production must hit 200,000 units by 2020 – a critical tipping point for local production to invite suppliers in time with the model change and the motorization of the Philippines. ASEAN’s laggard Based on data from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Automotive Federation, the Philippines is the laggard among 5 ASEAN vehicle manufacturers in 2013, outpaced by Vietnam. Asai said that increasing the ratio of local content or increasing production scale will directly affect the cost-competitiveness of the Philippines and market growth can be expected. A model life cycle is anywhere from 5 to 10 years. Asai said vehicle production in the Philippines does not increase inspite of market growth partly due to the tariff elimination since 2010. The Philippines relies on imports to procure many parts, unlike Indonesia (which produced 1.2 million units in 2013) and Thailand (which produced 2.45 million units) where automobile manufacturers produce most of the parts domestically. \"The large number of imported items and little volume of auto production has led to high production costs,\" Asai said. Transportation cost for completely built-up units is lower than for knocked down parts, which partly explains why production decreases in spite of market growth, Asai pointed out. He said the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) price of vehicles produced in Thailand is 15% lower than those produced in the Philippines. PH as a regional manufacturing hub The June 16 dialogue was the first in a series of discussions with Japan on industrial policies, particularly on automotive, services, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Department of Trade and Industry Undersecretary Adrian Cristobal Jr said. Similar consultations with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) on shipbuilding was also conducted, Cristobal added. DTI Assistant Secretary Ceferino Rodolfo said the Philippines is trying to lure 10,000 first and second tier suppliers, mostly SMEs in the automotive industry or those in the assembly and in modules supply for functional parts, interior/exterior parts, machining and pressing, and tier 2 suppliers or those engaged in parts processing (pressing, plating, cutting, screws, cast/forged special parts). Japan sees the wide linkages of the automotive industry even in textile, iron and steel, plastics, electrical wiring, petrochemicals, aluminum, etc, Rodolfo noted. Japan's investment in the automotive industry fell by 50% in Thailand and has been reduced in China due to political and wage issues in those countries. Even Indonesia is becoming expensive for the Japanese, Rodolfo said. \"The Philippines is stable politically and also in terms of wages. These along with the fact that we are in the verge of motorization, Japan sees the country as a possible regional hub for manufacturing,\" he said. According to the Japanese External Trade Organization (JETRO), Japanese companies invested ¥2.33 trillion ($22.8 billion) in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam in 2013, with $887 billion yet invested in China.  In 2012, Japanese investments in the automotive industry doubled in Southeast Asia and fell by 18% in China.   In 2013, Japanese capital flow to China dropped to $6.5 billion, less than half the $13.48 billion Japanese investment China attracted in 2012. JETRO further reported that Japanese companies planning expansion in China fell to the lowest number ever at 55%. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/tech-giants-internet-of-things","title":"Tech giants scramble for lead on 'Internet of Things'","date":"Jun 8, 2014 11:34 AM PHT","snippet":"Samsung, Apple, and a host of tech companies are setting their sights on grabbing a piece of the latest moneymaker: the Internet of Things","body":"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – It's not just smartphones and tablets anymore. The world's tech giants are now battling over a wider array of connected devices, from refrigerators to cars to wristwatches. Announcements in recent days from Apple and Samsung made clear they are staking their claim to the \"Internet of Things\" following Google's announcement earlier this year that it was creating a new Android platform for wearable electronics. \"The Internet of Things is the next big platform,\" said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. \"These are potentially billions of devices. That's a big market, so every consortium is lining up for that.\" A study released by research firm IDC said the market for the Internet of Things (IoT) will grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion in 2020 as businesses and consumers adopt smart technology for homes, cars and a variety of accessories. Apple unveiled Monday its new mobile operating system iOS 8 along with HealthKit software to manage personal healthcare and HomeKit for home appliances, while encouraging developers to create services for the iOS operating system used in iPhones and iPads. Apple opens up \"Apple iOS 8 has the beginnings of a full-fledged platform supporting IoT, you can see it with their health and fitness hooks and their ability to entertain more third party devices,\" said Compass Intelligence chief mobile analyst Gerry Purdy. But Apple is following its own path, aiming for tighter control and with less interoperability by limiting connections with non-Apple devices. \"It may be that Apple will just colonize a few areas and do it well,\" said Kay. Samsung, meanwhile, is jumping into the fray with Tizen, an open-source operating system that could take on iOS and Android for connected devices. Frank Gillett at Forrester Research said Samsung -- by far the most successful maker of Android phones and tablets -- wants to distance itself from Google in the next phase of technology. \"I think Samsung is in a challenging and difficult place,\" Gillett told AFP. \"They have been successful in building devices but they don't have a software platform or a consumer relationship.\" Gillett said that with Tizen, Samsung is aiming for \"a multi-part software and services strategy to build sticky relationships with customers to keep them buying hardware.\" Still, he said it was \"an uphill battle\" for Samsung, which is trying to establish a new platform to compete against Android, iOS and others -- including Microsoft's Windows and BlackBerry's QNX, which is widely used in automobile systems. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research says Google has shown it can make money from this strategy of offering Android for free. \"Samsung has mistakenly assumed that it can maintain its 18 percent handset margins by focusing on hardware. Consequently, it has been willing to cede complete control of the ecosystem to Google,\" he said in a research note. \"This has ensured that Google will grow nicely driven by mobile advertising revenues while we expect Samsung to experience declining earnings.\" A wide open market But the Internet of Things will likely be big enough for several platforms and may not see the same platform wars as the PC or smartphone markets. \"I don't put any platform out there in front,\" Gillett said. The analyst said that the market is unlikely to be a \"duopoly,\" and that there \"is a whole other layer of complexity\" to the market for the Internet of Things. For now, some analysts see Google as best positioned to benefit from the new phase of the Internet. Bob O'Donnell at TECHnalysis Research said the Apple strategy \"is creating a great reason to stick with Apple devices across all their main categories,\" but added that \"most Apple users don't have all Apple devices.\" \"Their vision could be made much more effective if they could somehow bring other non-Apple OS devices into the group,\" O'Donnell said in a blog post. Kay said Google's ubiquity is giving a reason for developers of apps and other products to use Android. \"Android has been widely adopted and it's an adaptable platform,\" Kay said. \"Developers go to the place with the most seats, because they want to sell to the largest audience.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/merkel-to-be-sworn-in-ending-political-limbo","title":"Merkel, finally, to be sworn in ending political limbo","date":"Dec 17, 2013 2:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Eighty-six days after Merkel, 59, swept to victory in elections but failed to grab an outright majority","body":"BERLIN, Germany – Angela Merkel is due to be sworn in Tuesday, December 17, for a rare third term as German chancellor, capping months of political uncertainty as she bartered with her rivals to help govern Europe's top economy. Eighty-six days after Merkel, 59, swept to victory in elections but failed to grab an outright majority, the Bundestag lower house of parliament will vote on handing her another four-year term. The ballot is secret but the outcome likely holds little surprise. With a whopping 504 of the 631 seats, Merkel's conservatives and their new centre-left partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), hold a comfortable majority under their hard-fought 'grand coalition' deal. Afterwards she must be confirmed by President Joachim Gauck at the presidential palace before returning to the Bundestag to be sworn in as Germany's only third post-war chancellor to win a third mandate. The ceremony and later swearing-in of ministers followed by the first cabinet meeting will enable Merkel to finally get back down to business in earnest after the longest government-building period since World War II. Merkel is then due to address parliament Wednesday, December 18, and travel to Paris for talks with President Francois Hollande the same day, ahead of an EU summit at the end of the week. A parliament debate after Wednesday's address will be the first opportunity for a face-off across the floor since the SPD moved off the opposition benches. Merkel has defended the time spent haggling over policy and posts with an initially reluctant SPD as time well spent, voicing appreciation on signing the coalition pact Monday \"that we listened to each other\". Few observers doubt though that the road ahead will be bumpy. Merkel at 'peak of her power' Having wrested concessions from the conservatives in negotiations to pave the way for the new coalition, SPD chief Sigmar Gabriel, the new vice chancellor and economy and energy minister, will need to impose his party's imprint on the new government to avoid the costly mistakes of its first tie-up with popular Merkel. Cartoonists in Monday's (December 16) Tagesspiegel newspaper depicted her in a wedding dress next to her 'groom' Gabriel pledging \"until death do us part\" – Merkel clutching a dagger and Gabriel with a gun. Merkel on Monday pledged \"solid finances, secure prosperity and social welfare\" and said that \"a grand coalition is a coalition for grand tasks – we want to make sure that the people in 2017 are better off, even better off, than they are today\". News magazine Spiegel online commented that Merkel was \"at the peak of her power\". \"The red-hued coalition agreement admittedly asks a bit of the (conservative) Union but when you get more than 41% in a federal election that's enough to calm your own people.\" Merkel keeps her trusted lieutenant Wolfgang Schaeuble as finance minister to continue Berlin's tough loans-for-reform stance toward troubled eurozone countries and as the watchful guardian of the German public purse. The SPD gets the foreign ministry, where Frank-Walter Steinmeier returns as Germany's top diplomat, while the CDU's rising star Ursula von der Leyen, a worldly high achiever and mother-of-seven, takes over the defence ministry. Despite its poor election outcome, the SPD came out of coalition talks with trophy concessions such as a national minimum wage and pension benefits that helped win over the party base, who signed off on the deal at the weekend. Berenberg Bank's chief economist Holger Schmieding however has echoed business concerns that softening tough decade-old labour and welfare reforms in rapidly aging Germany will harm its still humming economy in future. \"These policies will weaken Germany over time,\" he wrote. \"They are the opposite of what Germany is urging other European countries to do. \"But due to its strong starting position, Germany can afford such costly policies for a while.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/deactivated-drivers-grab-philippines-appeal-ltfrb-dotr","title":"Deactivated Grab drivers ask LTFRB, DOTr for ‘understanding, compassion’","date":"Jun 10, 2019 9:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab drivers list the reasons it’s difficult for them to secure the certificates of public convenience that the LTFRB requires","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Bracing for financial losses, drivers of Grab who had been deactivated from the ride-hailing service sought for “understanding and compassion” from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation. Grab deactivated some 8,000 drivers without a certificate of public convenience (CPC), which was a requirement of the LTFRB. In a press briefing on Monday, June 10, drivers enumerated the following processes which make securing the requirements to get a CPC difficult: CPC hearing process – Drivers said Transport Netwrork Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators can only be represented by either the spouse, parents, or descendants. They said this requirement affected many operators leading to dismissals and resultingr in monetary losses. “TNVS operators affected mostly are those who work abroad, doing part time for TNVS, or not based in Metro Manila,” their statement read. Drivers appealed to the agencies to allow them to issue a special power of attorney to any person they want to represent them. Bank conformity – This document is secured from banks and allow the units to be used for public transportation. “Different banks have their own processes and fees in securing this certificate,” the drivers said. Moreover, they said that this requirement was only good for companies with a fleet of cars. In the case of TNVS, most only have one car or two. “Many operators cannot comply, some banks will ask for thousands of pesos in fees, plus an increase of monthly amortization,” the drivers said. Instead of a bank conformity, they proposed getting a commercial insurance of their choice to still protect the interest of the banks. Proof of financial capability – The LTFRB increased this requirement 233% to P50,000, from P15,000. Drivers said this is hard for many small entrepreneurs.  “Many have no savings of P50,000, and it is only now that they are able to save…. We pray for the board to recompute the amount that is fair for small businesses,” the statement read. Due to the problems cited, many TNVS operators supposedly gave up and had their cars surrendered to banks.

Gumanda nang halos limang ulit ang rating niya sa loob ng 9 na buwan. Kaunti na lang, abot kamay na. Sa kanyang pag-iikot sa Pilipinas, dalawang mensahe ang paulit-ulit niyang ipinapaabot.  Una, na siya gatekeeper ng Pangulo. “Ako po ang magiging tulay ninyo kay Pangulong Duterte.” Kahit daw mga anak ni President Rodrigo Duterte at mga miyembro ng Gabinete ay dumadaan sa kanya.  Pangalawa, na siya ang promotor ng one-stop-shop ng gobyerno sa pagbibibgay tulong sa mga mahihirap na maysakit – ang Malasakit centers. Sa katunayan, nasa sentro si Bong Go sa lahat halos ng photo-op ng Malasakit Centers mula nang buksan ang mga ito noong Setyembre 2018.  Ano ba ang Malasakit Centers? Kung ika’y mahirap na pasyente, hindi ka na kailangang mag-ikot sa iba’t ibang ahensiya ng gobyerno at pumila sa bawat isa. Isang pilahan na lang, at Malasakit Center na ang mag-aasikaso ng mga pondong maaaring hugutin mula sa mga ahensiya ng pamahalaan para ibigay sa iyo.  Simpleng solusyon sa masalimuot na burukrasya. Pero hindi ito idea ni Go.  Ang nagtutulong-tulong – ang nagmamalasakit – para magbigay ng serbisyo at pondo sa mahihirap na kababayan natin ay ang mga ahensiyang tulad ng Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Philippine Amusement and Games Corporation, PhilHealth, Department of Health, at Department of Social Work and Developent. Nakakaeksena lang si Go dahil tuwing may pasinaya ang Malasakit Centers, nakikiputol siya ng ribbon tulad ng executive secretaries ng mga presidenteng nauna kay Duterte. Andoon si Go, representante umano ng kanyang amo.  Marami nang mga naging \"alter-ego\" ng mga presidente: sina Peter Garucho, Teofisto Guingona Jr, Ruben Torres, at Alexander Aguirre noong panahon ni Fidel Ramos; Ronaldo Zamora at Edgardo Angara noong panahon ni Joseph Estrada; Renato de Villa, Alberto Romulo, Eduardo Ermita, at Leandro Mendoza noong panahong ni Gloria Arroyo; Paquito Ochoa Jr noong panahon ni Benigno Aquino III. Pero wala sa mga opisyal na ito ang katulad ni Go na nakaagaw ng papuri para sa mga proyektong di naman siya ang nag-isip, nagsimula, o nagpapatakbo.  Kahit nga ang executive secretary ngayon na si Salvador Medialdea, ang siyang tunay na \"little president,\" ay hindi nagawang angkinin ang takak ng Malasakit Centers. Nakikigatong pa ang iba pang opisyal tulad ni Commission on Higher Education Chairman Prospero de Vera, na tinawag si Go na “secret weapon” sa pagsusulong ng libreng tertiary education. Sandali lang, maraming lehislador na nagpursigeng ipasa ang batas na 'yan! Siyempre, ang pinakamalakas na megaphone ng kandidato ay walang iba kundi ang kanyang amo, na buong pusong bumabanggit sa ngalan niya sa halos lahat ng talumpati, at nagtaas ng kamay niya sa Comelec noong nag-file siya ng kandidatura. Hindi na bagong diskarte ito ni Go. Bago nagdesisyon tumakbo, sumikat siya bilang \"pambansang photobomber\" – nagpo-post ng mga litrato ng world leaders, tulad ni Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, at Xi Jinping, dahil may access siya sa mga engrandeng okasyon bilang buntot ng Pangulo. Gumamit din siya ng pribadong pondo at mamahaling billboard isang taon bago ang eleksiyon – na maaaring paglabag sa government ethics code. Pero hindi lamang sa ganitong paraan nagagamit ni Go ang kanyang koneksiyon. Ayon sa Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, nabakuran ng kumpanya ng kanyang ama ang malalaking kontrata mula sa Department of Public Works and Highways sa Davao Region. Ang pangalan ng kompanya: CLTG Builders – initials para sa Christopher Lawrence T. Go, ang special assistant ni Duterte.  Mula sa isang tahimik na assistant, nagpalit-anyo ang special assistant to the president sa isang mapapel na alipores na feel-na-feel ang reflected glory ng kanyang amo. Ano’ng aasahan natin sa administrasyong salat sa propesyonalismo at delikadesa at hanggang leeg sa patronage politics?

Grab Philippines recently introduced their new leadership structure, with country head-turned-president Brian Cu still at the helm of the ride-hailing giant. Lawyer Nicka Hosaka, the newest public affairs manager, will be working with its head Leo Gonzales. Before joining Grab, Hosaka served as the chief of staff and legal counsel of PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe from April 2017 to May 2018. After her stint with the PCC, she became the legal counsel for e-commerce platform Shopee for about 6 months. Grab's acquisition of Uber's Southeast Asia operations in March 2018 prompted the PCC to review the deal. It bound the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. Compliance monitoring is still ongoing, with the antitrust body imposing another P6.5-million fine on Grab for violating its commitments to the PCC. Conflict of interest?  Section 7 (b)(1) of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees does not allow government workers to: Own, control, manage or accept employment as officer, employee, consultant, counsel, broker, agent, trustee or nominee in any private enterprise regulated, supervised or licensed by their office unless expressly allowed by law The law states that it \"shall continue for a period of one year after resignation, retirement, or separation of office.\" In an interview with Rappler, Bernabe said Hosaka is \"not covered\" by the rule. There's no conflict of interest, he said, with Hosaka being with Grab now. Bernabe explained that despite reviewing the Grab-Uber buyout, the PCC is neither regulating nor supervising Grab. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) Bernabe also added that the PCC did not give Grab the license to operate because that falls under the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. \"The code of conduct is not applicable in this case. In terms of optics it might create, Nicka never worked on the Grab case. She was never part of the team that conducted the review,\" Bernabe said. The commissioner also said that Hosaka had already left the PCC when the antitrust watchdog was reviewing Grab's voluntary commitments. \"Nicka is a very good lawyer and she was a very good staff member. We trust that she will not be involved in anything still pending with the PCC. That's a commitment she made when she went to Shopee,\" Bernabe told Rappler. No work overlap Bernabe expects Hosaka to be hands-off the Grab-Uber deal in terms of lending her legal expertise.  \"That's our expectation. Out of sense of propriety or delicadeza,\" Bernabe. Hosaka, in an interview with Rappler, maintained that there is \"no conflict whether legal or personal\" with her new role in Grab. \"In so far as the transaction was concerned, it was ongoing but it just started when I left. I wasn't involved in the review team. I wasn't even part of any discussions with the parties with Grab or Uber,\" she said. When she first met with the ride-hailing giant, Hosaka said she had informed Bernabe of the role. She said the height of the Grab-Uber buyout issue was when she was at Shoppee. \"Now, I am working with [Grab's] public affairs team. With the PCC, I was acting as chief of staff and was doing some legal counsel work for Commissioner Bernabe. There's no overlapping in terms of duties and obligations there,\" she said. Hosaka assured that she will not be handling any PCC-related matter while she's working with Grab. \"Right now, while I'm with Grab, Im not handling any PCC matters, also because out of propriety.

Grab denied a hand in the filing of case, saying it was the \"TNVS drivers who were greatly affected.\" Under the government-approved fare scheme issued in December 2016, Grab Philippines can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. Last January, Grab applied for a 5% fare hike. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new ride-hailing companies, but Grab still dominates the market after its acquisition of Uber.

Around half of the funds came from Japanese car giant Toyota, which announced last month it was pumping $1 billion into Grab, Southeast Asia's dominant ride-share company. Grab said a \"significant portion\" of the proceeds would go to developing operations in Indonesia, where it has partnered with local firm Ovo to offer what it said was the country's most widely accepted mobile payments system. The announcement comes after Grab's regional rival, Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, said in May it was investing $500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Singapore-based Grab, which operates in eight countries, launched an on-demand grocery delivery service in Jakarta last month. Southeast Asia's ride-hailing market is expected to be worth $20 billion by 2025, according to research by Google and Singapore investment vehicle Temasek. However, Grab's agreement to buy US giant Uber's Southeast Asian business this year has run into trouble, with Singapore's anti-monopoly watchdog calling for changes to the deal and threatening to overturn it. Grab last week disputed the watchdog's finding that the buyout infringed competition rules, but vowed it would continue to cooperate with the ongoing review. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. Since the merger, several new players, including India's Jugnoo and Singapore-based Ryde, have entered the city-state's ride-hailing market. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/jericho-nograles-grab-philippines-illegal-minimum-fare","title":"Lawmaker accuses Grab of charging 'illegal' P80 minimum fare","date":"May 28, 2018 7:25 PM PHT","snippet":"PBA Representative Jericho Nograles says the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board did not authorize this minimum fare","body":"MANILA, Philippines – PBA Representative Jericho Nograles on Monday, May 28, claimed ride-hailing company Grab Philippines is charging an \"illegal\" minimum fare of P80. In a statement, Nograles said this minimum fare was not authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). \"Without any public hearing, Grab Philippines again unilaterally imposed a new illegal fare condition. [D]uring the April 17 LTFRB hearing, Grab Philippines denied to the board that they impose an P80 minimum fare,\" Nograles said. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies' fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. \"Now, no less than the Grab app publicly declares that the company charges the same minimum fare. This brazen act shows not only disrespect to the regulators, but proof that Grab Philippines has no intention to follow Philippine laws,\" Nograles said. \"This is a usurpation of the powers of the LTFRB and this is a violation of our existing laws. Just because they now have a virtual monopoly of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) sector, they can now violate our laws by setting their own fare rates?\" he added. Under the information card on the Grab app, its sedan and 6-seater vehicles for hire charge a minimum of P80 per ride, while the premium cars start at P125. Nograles said that under the approved fare structure, a rider should only be charged a maximum of P68 for a 500-meter ride at a surge rate of times two. It should not be at P80, he said. The lawmaker earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?)

On the tech side of things, they're rolling out a new app interface for both iOS and Android.  Visually, the revamped interface cleans all the clutter in the home screen and divides Grab’s services to two tabs, namely Transport and Delivery. What’s more is that pinning locations in the map is now said to be more intuitive, and has been designed to make it easier for passengers and drivers to locate each other.   But for passengers who feel they have had a bad experience with the service, the key update is the new ability to report their concerns to Grab’s Help Center without leaving the app. The hope is it will expedite the filing of concerns, and encourage consumers to voice out their issues via the help center. To support the improved intergration, the ride-hailing service also announced that they're enlarging their customer service team by partnering with a BPO company, which they expect to be fully operational by July. With the expansion of the cusomter service team, Grab said that they’re ensuring reports are resolved within 48 hours. After Uber's exit, Grab has been in the spotlight for several issues including higher fares, misbehaving drivers, and long wait time for rides.  The in-app Emergency button, added in July of last year, is getting some added features and a name change. Now called the SOS button, passengers can directly connect to 911 and send text messages to three registered phone numbers in-app in case of emergencies. This new button is going to be launched starting June 4 this year.  “Our aim is to be passengers’ partner for better trips at all times. We have carefully studied new features that will further enhance our services while ensuring passenger safety on the road,” Cindy Toh, Country Marketing Head, said.  Grab also said plans to expand destination masking beyond the 25% of drivers with low acceptance rates are under review. According to them, the introduction of destination masking late last month had a bigger negative impact on ride acceptance rather than ride cancellations. They believe this could make it harder for passengers to book a ride if they expand beyond the initial number.  The revamped app interface has already started rolling out for iOS and is expected for Android by July 2018. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-appeal-ltfrb-suspension-illegal-charge","title":"Grab to appeal LTFRB suspension of P2-per-minute travel charge","date":"Apr 19, 2018 5:15 PM PHT","snippet":"'If our drivers lose income because of traffic in Metro Manila, they might stop working as a TNVS driver and that would mean fewer vehicles to serve the public,' says Grab Philippines head Brian Cu","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines on Thursday, April 19, said it will file a motion for reconsideration on the government's decision to suspend its P2-per-minute charge.

Cu also pointed out that amid the heavy traffic in Metro Manila, drivers could stop servicing passengers since they would earn less. \"If our drivers lose income because of traffic in Metro Manila, they might stop working as a TNVS (transport network vehicle service) driver and that would mean fewer vehicles to serve the public,\" Cu said. On Wednesday, April 18, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to suspend its P2-per-minute travel charge through an agency order which was signed by LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III and Board Member Ronaldo Corpus. The suspension order came after Grab appeared in a hearing to explain the alleged illegal charges on top of the government-approved scheme. Grab maintained that its charges are legal, citing a transportation department order that supposedly allows companies to set fares on their own.

'Spare' Grab drivers In a text message sent to Rappler on Thursday, Nograles said the show-cause order will allow Grab to prove the “legality” of the  additional charges.  He said, however, that drivers should be spared if Grab is sanctioned. “The show-cause order for Grab to appear before the en banc Board will allow Grab to prove the legality of the charges they imposed without knowledge of the drivers and riders. If ever the Board sanctions Grab, I hope that they will spare the innocent drivers of the refund and penalties,” Nograles said. Grab drivers are concerned about the allegation as they expect to bear brunt of the refund if the LTFRB deems the charges as illegal, according to Grab driver Winson Esteras. Esteras was interviewed by the media on the sidelines of the LTFRB hearing with Grab and Uber on Wednesday. “Ang balik noon sa amin eh, sa aming mga driver na bumibiyahe sa Metro Manila, sa amin kukunin ‘yun.

He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They've been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal 'yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn't that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don't know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-limits-surge-after-uber-suspension-ltfrb","title":"Grab puts cap on surge charges after Uber suspension","date":"Aug 15, 2017 3:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The maximum 1.4x surge amounts to an additional fare of at least P20 and at most P50, the company says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab will limit its surge charging in the wake of the one-month suspension of their main competitor Uber, the company announced on Tuesday, August 15. “We put it at 1.4 [times the regular rate] because we wanted the price not to surge excessively,” Grab country head Brian Cu said. The surge amounts to an additional fare of at least P20 and at most P50, Cu said. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) He said the company recorded a 10-15% rise in bookings in the morning of Uber’s suspension, explaining why riders had a hard time picking up a ride, while those who do manage to get rides, pay high prices. With around 66,000 drivers from Uber forced off the road after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspended the company's operations for repeatedly disobeying the agency's orders, Grab said they have had a difficult time keeping up with the demand. Their application’s algorithm, Cu said, takes into account the number of bookings in an area relative to the number of drivers available there, before calculating the fare. He said the cap is only temporary. They may change the surge cap the following weeks as they do not want to limit the income of their drivers. Cu added that they stand with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in suspending Uber. “We do try to question [some LTFRB orders], but at the end of the day we comply.

During the House committee hearing on the registration and franchising or lack thereof of the two companies, Uber said it has more than 66,000 \"partners who have taken at least one trip in the past year.\" Out of that number, only over 2,500 have either a provisional authority (PA) permit or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise, which allows them to ply the streets of Metro Manila. Grab, meanwhile, has more than 52,000 vehicles accredited with only 3,000 to 4,000 of those vehicles possessing either PAs or CPCs from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). \"We are shocked, to say the least,\" LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said, after the two companies stated the figures. Delgra said up until today, the number of vehicles registered under Grab and Uber had been unclear even to them. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before the House of Representatives to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. \"Come to Congress, get your franchise, and don't fight with LTFRB,\" said AKO Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe, author of a bill that would regulate TNCs. Batocabe lost his nephew to a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore last month. Lawmakers also quipped that it was no wonder traffic in Metro Manila has gotten worse, given the sheer number of TNC vehicles on the road.    Both Uber and Grab, however, clarified that not all of the vehicles registered in their networks ply Metro Manila at the same time. Some \"partners\" are registered with both companies. Not all drivers are full-time either, meaning they only drive their vehicles for a few hours a day at most. Bong Suntay of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) said they are fine with operating alongside Uber and Grab so long as these ride-hailing services \"are regulated just like [taxis].\" \"The requirements are almost the same. But the difference is in the compliance. So it's an unequal application [of the rules],\" said Suntay. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/clarification-tugade-grab-uber-income-share-taxes","title":"LTFRB clarifies: Tugade wants share in Grab, Uber taxes","date":"Jul 20, 2017 8:25 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III points out: If some 26,600 Grab and Uber drivers are not registered, then how can government go after them for taxes?","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Martin Delgra III clarified Thursday, July 20, what Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade meant when he said the government should have a share in the income of Grab and Uber drivers.

On Wednesday, Tugade said in a press briefing in Malacañang: “Kailangan diyan may share din diyan 'yung gobyerno, 'yung kinikita doon. Kung kailangan may mekanismo at tsaka pamamaraan niyan na 'yung plete na binabayaran o 'yung kita na inaambag, eh ibahagi 'nyo naman sa gobyerno.” (The government should have a share in their earnings. If needed, there should be a mechanism and a way that the government gets a share in the fares what [the drivers] get or what the share they contribute [to Grab and Uber]. You should give the government a share.) The secretary's statement was met with online rage from regular Grab and Uber riders. “Ang punto ni Secretary Tugade at ng LTFRB, kapag colorum ang isang sasakyan, walang habol d'yan ang gobyerno. Paano mo masisingil ng tamang tax kung hindi nga sila rehistrado?” Delgra said in a press statement on Thursday. (The point of Secretary Tugade and the LTFRB is, if a vehicle is “colorum,” then the government go after them. How can you charge taxes if they are not registered?) “Like any business, TNCs and their partners are covered by laws of taxation and they must give what’s due to the government,\" Delgra added. However, the LTFRB cannot collect taxes anytime soon. Their hands are tied since they had given Grab and Uber until July 26 before apprehending some 26,600 colorum drivers, whose numbers have increased since 2016. Delaying the apprehension further, the transport network companies both filed motions for reconsideration against the LTFRB’s order.

Is it the operators, the drivers, or is it them?\" he asked. He added that surge pricing – rooted in the demand and supply of vehicles, as well as other factors – needs to be further regulated,  The problem, according to Orbos, is that the TNCs have not given them data on how this demand is measured. Uber representatives earlier said it was difficult to put a number on something that changes constantly. \"Sila may datos (They have the data). I think they should allow us or explain to us how their system works,\" Orbos said.

Uber launched a motorbike taxi service - UberMotor, to compete with Grab and Go-Jek, which is widely used by Indonesian commuters. The drivers of UberMotor wear a black jacket representing their company, as well as a helmet with the Uber logo on it – similar to Grab or Go-Jek drivers. I tried to hail UberMotor at around 9 am in Kuningan City in South Jakarta on April 13, a day after it launched, but I couldn't find any drivers through the app at that time. The app showed there were no motors available. Cheaper Later that evening, I successfully ordered an UberMotor near National Monument from Monas to my home. The trip was a 5-kilometer ride, and surprisingly cost me only \"Rp 3.500\" or $0.26. The fare stunned me. Can you buy anything with that price? It was especially a shocker compared to GrabBike's minimum fare: Rp 10.000 ($0.76). Acording to Uber's official website, the base fare is Rp.1.000 ($0.076) and it charges customers another Rp.1.000 per km and and Rp100 ($0.0076) per minute. Payment options are also different. I can pay my UberMotor fare with cash or credit card, while GrabBike and GoJek only accepts cash. It seems that UberMotor has the upper hand with its local rivals GoJek and Grab, however because it is so new, it might take you more than 10 minutes to request a UberMotor.Long wait  I waited for 15 minutes for UberMotor, and I could not find any driver when I tried the app at the first time. Meanwhile, it takes me less than 5 minutes to grab a motorbike using Grab. \"I think there are only 200 drivers today,\" the UberMotor rider told me. He said that he worked for GoJek before. Uber's expansion to motorbikes I believe, is a benefit to Indonesian commuters. They now have more choices. However, other motorbike or taxi drivers must be unhappy with the added competition – especially taxi drivers who held a protest against ride-hailing apps in Jakarta last month.

Following a fireworks-filled opening ceremony, the game had a slow start, with only Joshua Alolino Layup—good for a 2-0 lead for host team NU—to show for after 3 and a half minutes of action. Despite the attacking play of UE’s Shei Roi Sumang and Pedrito Galanza, the Red Warriors had little going for them with NU’s Henri Betayene manning the paint. The Cameroonian big man altered attempts and forced slashers to adjust in mid-air, in one instance, swatting two shots in less than 10 seconds. Forgoing set play, the Red Warriors opted to attack on the run. With pesky defense, Sumang led the UE run, which culminated in a buzzer-beating triple to end the quarter and put the Warriors up, 15-13. Things went downhill for the red side, however, as the Bulldogs held them to only 8 points in the second canto. With a flurry of 6 three-pointers—4 of them coming in the first 4 minutes—NU led 48-23 at halftime. The third quarter featured a spirited Red Warrior run. Early on, the Bulldogs dictated the pace of play with their superior athleticism. A pair of fastbreak dunks from Bobby Ray Parks and Emmanuel Mbe not only put NU up 56-25 but also drew out the first “oohs” and “aahs” of the season.

Thirteen European center-right parties urged their European Peoples Party (EPP) political group to expel Orban's Fidesz party after he assumed emergency powers on Monday. Orban insists he must rule by decree to tackle the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic. But many, including some of his allies in the EPP, accuse him of a power grab gone too far. \"With all due respect I have no time for this,\" said Orban in a letter to EPP Secretary General Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White posted on Twitter by one of his ministers Katalin Novak. \"I can hardly imagine any of us having time for fantasies about the intentions of other countries. This seems to me to be a costly luxury these days,\" he wrote. \"I am ready to discuss this once the pandemic is over,\" he added. The Scandinavian, Greek, Belgian, Lithuanian, Czech and Slovak conservatives, who signed Thursday's statement calling for Fidesz to be kicked out of the EPP, do not represent a majority of the group. But their letter strengthens the hand of party chairman Donald Tusk, the former Polish leader and president of the European Council, who is pushing the EPP to distance itself from Orban. The signatories call on the EU executive, the European Commission, to \"address the situation in Hungary forcefully\" and brand Orban's move a \"violation of the founding principles of liberal democracy and European values.\" Under the emergency law, Orban has the power to rule by decree until his government decides the virus crisis is over. It also threatens journalists with prison if they publish \"falsehoods\" about the virus or the government's actions to slow it.

Roscom denied he pointed a gun at Azarcon and said he was shocked when he got arrested. He admitted, however, that he had a pellet gun in his car – a caliber .38 revolver replica – which was seized by police. Ines said that police would retrieve the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the bar to verify the claim of the driver. Roscom is currently under police custody.

Isang importanteng tanong: Ano ang baseline data na ginamit? Ano ang forecast model for future demand ang ginamit?\" she said. (Data science has greatly improved that's why many people are interested to know what are the justifications. One important question is: What was the baseline data used? What forecast model for future demand was used?) On Thursday, January 18, the LTFRB released a memorandum circular setting a \"common supply base\", limiting the number of cars operating under Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) to 45,700. Impact Poe highlighted the possible impact on both drivers and patrons of the service. The senator asked if consultations with patrons were done by the regulatory agency. \"If the most important components in the ride-sharing business, the customers, were consulted, was there a survey? Was the pulse of those who'll be affected were taken into account?\" Poe said in a mix of Engish and Filipino. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada explained that the numbers were computed based on the data submitted by ride-hailing application companies and the \"churning rate\" of drivers which takes into account those who decided to quit driving. (EXPLAINER: LTFRB requirements for Grab, Uber permits) Poe noted that the review should not be based on the churning rate but through an algorithm that determines demand and supply.  \"Given that there are currently about 100,000 TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,\" she said. Units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber are around 125,000, exceeding the cap two times over. The memorandum is the latest move by the LTFRB in an attempt to regulate ride-hailing apps like Grab and Uber. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/komura-book-fair-experience-driven-haruki-murakami","title":"WATCH: This 'experience-driven' book fair is inspired by Haruki Murakami","date":"Nov 18, 2017 7:38 PM PHT","snippet":"At Komura Book Fair, you can listen to live music, read a book, or even grab a beer or two","body":"  MANILA, Philippines – Looking for quirky art and new stories?

This was underscored in a panel discussion at the 2017 Social Good Summit held on Saturday, September 16. The discussion focused on the challenges to innovation in the Philippines, and what various groups have been doing to promote entrepreneurship in the country. Ongoing conversation The recent deadlock between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber reflects the challenges encountered by innovators clashing with government regulators. Uber is no stranger to controversy, encountering backlash in the places where it launched because its business model did not fit current transportation laws. The Philippines is unique in that respect, since it created new transport categories back in May 2015 to accommodate Grab and Uber's business models. In July this year, the LTFRB cracked down on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms, eventually leading to Uber's suspension and the imposition of a hefty fine. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)  The issue sparked controversy, with some criticizing the LTFRB while others pointed out the need for accountability and regulation for these transport network companies. Lawyer JJ Disini cited this issue as he discussed the challenge of balancing innovation with the need for government regulators to do their job and protect the public interest. In other countries, some firms can try out new ideas by participating in a regulatory sandbox, where businesses are allowed to test out their innovative products or business models without following some legal requirements. The results and information generated from participating in a regulatory sandbox can be used by the government to craft regulations that better fit the public need, Disini said. This way, both innovators and regulators can work together to learn and refine the new business models. \"We need regulators to be there. Their job is to protect the general public, but we should also understand that they're constrained by that. At the same time, they want innovation as well. We do understand the complexities of the issues,\" Disini said. Supporting PH startups On the part of the government, there have been efforts among different government agencies to enable an environment where local startups can thrive. Rosemarie Edillon, planning and policy undersecretary of the National Economic and Development Authority, said entrepreneurship is key to helping the Philippine economy prosper. \"One of the big problems we're trying to address is the economy, and the way to have more employment is to have more employers. So we see entrepreneurship as one strategy,\" Edillon said. \"We actually need to grow much faster, and we need growth to be more inclusive. Key to that is entrepreneurship and innovation,\" she added. To help entrepreneurs and startups thrive, agencies like the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) have their own programs geared toward budding entrepreneurs. The BSP, for instance, has a credit surety fund program to help micro, small, and medium enterprises obtain loans from banks. The DICT, meanwhile, has launched a roadmap for digital startups, that aims to provide a framework for developing the Philippine startup ecosystem. \"It's so exciting today, we're glad that [Philippine startups] have become sexy,\" said Mon Ibrahim, undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology. For Diane Eustaquio, executive director of non-profit incubator IdeaSpace, encouraging millennials to take risks and overcome a fear of failure is crucial for boosting the local startup scene. \"We're conditioned to follow and not to challenge, so it's difficult for people to become entrepreneurs,\" she said.  \"I think that's the challenge, it's not in our culture to be allowed to fail... But it's that failure that allows you to try to be better than what you were before,\" she added. –Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/maamo-ladon-conquer-aiba-world","title":"After SEA Games fervor, PH boxers Maamo, Ladon out to conquer the world","date":"Aug 25, 2017 7:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipino boxers Dannel Maamo and Rogen Ladon set out to grab medals at the biggest tournament outside of the Olympics","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Fresh off the Philippines’ two gold haul at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games, boxers from the Philippine national team will see action at a bigger, if less celebrated tournament among Filipinos.

Ladon, of Bago City, Philippines is ranked number 5 in the world and had earned bronze at the 2015 World Championships in Qatar and fought at the 2016 Olympics. He will have a bye into the second round of the preliminaries of the 49-kilogram division and will face the winner between Kazakhstan's Zhomart Yerzhan and Michael Tello of Guatemala on Sunday, August 27.

Federer will head into Wimbledon, which starts on July 3, as favorite to win an outright record 8th title. Italian Open champion Zverev had won all 3 of his previous finals this season, but was blown away by a vintage performance from the 18-time major champion in only 53 minutes. \"I played great, I felt good from the start,\" said Federer. \"It was by far my best match of the week.

Coco Crisp singled home Michael Martinez in the seventh inning for the only run as the Indians, despite stranding 7 base runners, won the first World Series game at 102-year-old Wrigley Field since 1945. \"That's a heck of a win,\" Indians manager Terry Francona said. \"We needed something, anything just to put a run across and our staff made it hold up, which was a remarkable effort.\" Cleveland grabbed a 2-1 lead over the Cubs in Major League Baseball's best-of-7 championship showdown, which continues Saturday and Sunday in Chicago then returns to Cleveland if more games are needed. The Indians, seeking their first World Series crown since 1948, took their fifth playoff shutout victory, a major league record for a single post-season campaign, and their second Series blanking of the Cubs. \"We'll learn from tonight, come back and be ready to play tomorrow,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"We're seeing good pitching. We have to adjust to it.\" Tribe relief pitcher Cody Allen escaped a last gasp by Chicago in the ninth, striking out Javier Baez to end the game with the potential tying run stranded on third base. \"We were in a little bit of a jam there. That's one of those situations you think about throughout the season or spring training or even as a kid. You play that over in your mind,\" Allen said. \"All you're trying to do is slow the game down as much as possible and just try to make one good pitch. Then you just try to make another one. So we were fortunate enough to string a few good pitches together there and get the last out.\" In all, four Cleveland pitchers struck out 8 batters and scattered 5 hits. The Cubs still have won only two World Series games at Wrigley Field, game 6 in 1945 and game 5 in 1935, both over Detroit. The game was decided when Cleveland's Roberto Perez singled and was replaced by Indians pinch-runner Martinez, who took second base on Tyler Naquin's sacrifice and third on a wild pitch by Cubs relief pitcher Carl Edwards. After a pickoff try failed following a video review, Martinez scored on pinch-hitter Crisp's single to right field. \"Coming here and seeing all that blue in the stands, you know the support for the Cubs is worldwide,\" Crisp said. \"Coming in here and getting the victory is big for us.\" The Indians did not manage another hit but didn't need it. Anthony Rizzo led off the ninth for the Cubs with a single to left field, bringing the crowd to its feet for good. The potential tying run advanced to second on a Wilson Contreras ground out and took third after Jason Heyward reached base on a fielding error by Cleveland first baseman Mike Napoli. But Baez, who grounded out to end the eighth inning with the potential tying run on third base, was struck out by Allen to send most of the 41,703 spectators home disappointed. \"To be on the field, live that moment of getting the last out and feeling the emotions of getting a win, that's a special feeling,\" Allen said. Starters baffle sluggers  Chicago starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks struck out 6 but surrendered 6 hits and two walks over 4 1/3 innings.  Cleveland starter Josh Tomlin, who won his two prior playoff starts, allowed two hits with one walk and one strikeout over 4 2/3 innings. Saturday's starting pitchers will be Cubs right-hander John Lackey, a two-time World Series champion, and Cleveland right-hander Corey Kluber, an 18-game winner who is 3-1 in the playoffs but who will be throwing on short rest after winning Tuesday's opener. – Jim Slater, Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/poin-penting-taksi-online-peraturan-menteri-32-2016","title":"Besok, aturan taksi online diberlakukan","date":"Sep 29, 2016 2:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Apa pengaruh Peraturan Menteri No.32 Tahun 2016 terhadap operasi Uber, Grab, dan Go-Car?","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Mulai 1 Oktober besok, Peraturan Menteri No.32 tahun 2016 (PM 32/2016) tentang penyelenggaraan angkutan orang dengan kendaraan bermotor umum tidak dalam trayek akan mulai diberlakukan.

Before the start of the ballgame, a moment of silence was held to pray for the soul of Karen Kaye Montebon, a 17-year-old accountancy student of USC who was murdered and allegedly raped inside her home last Tuesday, September 15. Olago's double-double performance of 30 points and 12 rebounds earned him his third player of the game tag. He also made 4 steals and two blocks. Charles Pepito continued with his stellar performance by accounting for 17 points for the Warriors win while Maverick Fitz Suarez contributed 13 points. Four Jaguars finished in double figures, Ralph Jude Dinolan (19), Ricky Dyn Peromingan (13), Jaybie Mantilla (11) and Juan Miguel Gastador (11) but for a losing cause as they were not able to draw inspiration from the winning upset that they had inflicted against the defending champion Southwestern University (SWU) Cobras last Sunday, September 13. The fight for the fourth spot has become more interesting as USJR's loss has benefited the University of Cebu (UC) Webmasters whose chances to enter the final four has been bolstered as they trailed the currently fourth-ranked Jaguars at fifth with a 3-6 win-loss record. The USJR Jaguars totes a 4-6 card. League leader USC (9-1), University of the Visayas (UV) Green Lancers (8-2) and SWU Cobras (7-3) are all assured of a semifinals ticket as well as an entry into the PCCL National Collegiate Championship. The Warriors enjoyed a slim two-point lead at the end of the first quarter, 16-14, which they build up in the second quarter to 16 points, 41-25, behind the seven points of Pepito. The game entered the second half with the Jaguars showing no sign of the spirit that they had exhibited when they surprised the SWU Cobras with Kevin Rey Villafranca not only missing his baskets but also earning 3 fouls in the first half. Further complicating life for the Jaguars was the continued miscues of their star playmaker Dinolan, who however made up for his misses by converting his gift shots. He sank nine of his 11 free throws. The Jaguars also had to contend with Olago who scattered nine points in the third quarter alone to hand the Warriors another 16-point lead going into the final canto. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars tried to rally behind the efforts of Gastador, Mantilla and Peromingan but the closest they could manage was to cut the Warriors lead to just 14 points, 53-67, before the latter pulled away to a 23-point advantage on Olago's split charities with five minutes remaining in the ballgame. The Jaguars refused to give up and eventually managed to trail by just 13 points as the final buzzer sounded. In this Saturday's game, the SWU Cobras will try to recover from their shocking loss to the Jaguars as they face the UC Webmasters while the University of Southern Philippines (USPF) Panthers will get another chance to post a win this season as they go up against the Cebu Institute of Technology-University (CIT-U) Wildcats.

Cabahug also registered 3 assists and two blocks. Joshua Renz Ortiz once again led the Baby Jaguars with his 13 points while Gonzaga and Ibero added 10 points apiece. The Baby Jaguars only made six of 37 field goals and none of their players tallied an assist in the first half. They trailed by as much as 22 points in the first quarter, 5-27, and ended the first half by just adding 13 points, 18-42, at the halftime break. The match became physical and heated with both teams given warnings especially Beirn Anthony Laurente for the Baby Lancers and Ortiz for the Baby Jaguars. With Cabahug sitting out half of the third quarter after incurring his third personal foul, the Baby Jaguars clawed back into the game and managed to cut the Baby Lancers lead of 26 points to just 16, 42-58, going into the final canto. Yannick Noah Enriquez, also one of Baby Jaguars star player, complained of being hit in the eye by Ramish Alforque in a skirmish under the net at the start of the fourth quarter but no unsportsmanlike behavior was called. Alforque and Jhiey Paraldo took over the scoring cudgels for the Baby Lancers in the final canto combining for 11 points. The Baby Jaguars once again came close at 15 points on the basket of Geo Ibero but it was the best that they could muster as the Baby Lancers clinched their semifinals ticket with a 19-point advantage at the endgame buzzer. The Baby Lancers will have a challenge on their hands as they face the Magis Eagles who swept their games in the elimination round.

But responding to concerns over passenger safety, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has required transport network companies (TNCs) to get a certificate of accreditation. The LTFRB has released a series of memorandum circulars detailing the rules and regulations on the accreditation process for the new category of vehicles. Under the guidelines, accredited TNCs are required to conduct a criminal background check on their applicant-drivers, who must possess a professional driver's license. Drivers should also wear an identification card issued by the TNC and issue electronic receipts to passengers. They are allowed to carry a maximum of 7 passengers inside the vehicle. Drivers may not pick up passengers who hail their services from the streets. The LTFRB also said that drivers of app-based vehicles cannot pick up passengers inside airports, \"unless authorized by airport management.\" The vehicles must also bear a \"trade dress,\" or signage that identifies the vehicles as part of a TNC and differentiates them from other private vehicles. An accreditation fee of P10,000 must be paid to obtain a certificate of TNC accreditation, valid for two years.

We don't care about personal stats. We just care about helping each other.\"  Aroga was the best player on the court on Sunday afternoon, August 3, but he got a lot of help too as the NU Bulldogs escaped past the UE Red Warriors, 57-55, at the Araneta Coliseum.   Aroga finished with 18 points and 15 rebounds, while Glenn Khobuntin and Jeth Rosario combined for 25 and 13.  Pedrito Galanza and Roi Sumang led the Red Warriors with 16 markers each.   \"It was a tightly contested game,\" said NU Coach Eric Altamirano after the game. \"It could have gone either way.\"  He also complimented his team's strong chemistry, which was guided them to a 5-1 record after today.   \"They're trying to play for each other.\"  Gelo Alonino finished with 6 points and 4 rebounds, while Tristan Perez recorded 4 markers.  The Bulldogs bounced back quick to start the third quarter after trailing by five heading into the break. Not feeling the pressure of the Red Warriors' press, NU managed to get within one, 32-31, following an Aroga basket.  The ball continued to bounce off the rim for UE, which got good looks but failed to convert. Sumang also started to go cold along with Galanza and Chris Javier, paving the way for National U to extend their lead to four, 36-32, after a Khobuntin and-one play.  An acrobatic reverse layup by Sumang finally broke University of the East's drought, but Perez countered right away with a turnaround hook shot. In the dying seconds of the third quarter, a floater by Khobuntin counted just in time to give the Bulldogs a 42-36 lead entering the final period.  NU threatened to run away with the game after a Perez bucket extended the lead to eight. However, UE's Sumang-less lineup caught fire from the outside, as jumpers from Galanza, Dan Alberto, and Emil Palma spearheaded a 12-0 run to make the count 50-46 in favor of UE with under six minutes left.  The Red Warriors pushed the lead to as much as six by getting easy transition baskets, but NU rallied and took advantage of multiple offensive rebounds. With 3:30 to go, Alonino was left open and converted an easy 3-ball to put his club back on top, 55-54.  An Aroga bucket would push the deficit to three for UE before Sumang split his charities to make the count 57-55. With 17.1 seconds remaining, the Red Warriors got the ball back, though Sumang failed to convert his layup, sealing the loss for his team.   \"They refused to lose,\" the NU coach said after the game about his boys.  National U will aim to finish their first round campaign with a 6-1 record by taking down the FEU Tamaraws.   \"FEU is playing very well,\" Altamirano remarked about the Tamaraws. \"They're also sharing the ball... We have to prepare really well for them.\"  The Bulldogs finished with 40 bench points to UE's 21, further showing how deep the team is.   \"We're unpredictable,\" the NU coach commented on his team's depth.  National U also shot more FTs that UE, going 11-of-19 from the stripe.    Scoring 13 of their team's first 15 points, Sumang and Galanza helped the Red Warriors build an early lead over the Bulldogs.   Consecutive long-range jumpers from Alberto then added to UE's great start, as the team rode a 20-12 lead entering the second quarter.   However, the Red Warriors lost their lead at the midway point of the second period, as an Aroga layup capped off an 9-0 Bulldogs run.  After going minutes with their offense stagnant, Sumang finally broke the dry spell with a jumper to give his team a 22-21 lead. The explosive scorer would also be responsible for four more points before halftime, giving his club a 28-23 lead after 20 minutes of action. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/npa-admits-killing-bukidnon-mayor","title":"NPA admits killing Bukidnon mayor","date":"Jul 7, 2014 4:26 PM PHT","snippet":"The communist guerrillas say Impasugong Mayor Mario Okinlay worked closely with the military and grabbed land from the poor","body":" DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Days after Mayor Mario Okinlay of Impasugong, Bukidnon, was shot dead, the New People's Army (NPA) took responsibility for it, saying it was carried out in the name of \"revolutionary justice.\""},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/abducted-chinese-mine-workers-myanmar","title":"Two Chinese mine workers abducted in Myanmar","date":"May 19, 2014 10:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The copper mine triggers fierce opposition from local villagers due to alleged land grabs and environmental damage","body":"YANGON, Myanmar – Activists have kidnapped two Chinese workers at a China-backed copper mine in Myanmar and are threatening to harm them, their firm said Monday, in the latest eruption of tensions over the controversial project. China's Wanbao, which operates the Letpadaung mine in the northwestern town of Monywa, said the activists holding the two 23-year-old contractors were demanding the \"total halting\" of work. The mine has triggered fierce opposition from local villagers due to alleged land grabs and environmental damage, and has raised questions about Myanmar's reliance on investment from neighboring China – which gave crucial political support to the former junta. \"We are deeply distressed and concerned by this threat,\" the firm said in an updated statement on Monday, adding it had received new threats that the men would be harmed if activists' demands were not met. \"Wanbao vehemently condemns this unprovoked attack,\" it said. The company, which runs the project as part of a joint venture with a Myanmar military-backed firm, said earlier the men were surveying a part of the mine Sunday when they were set upon by activists and two local monks, who later issued a death threat. A 21-year-old Myanmar national was also abducted Sunday but released the same day. \"We strongly urge that our two colleagues be released soon,\" said Wanbao official Cao Densheng, adding that the company had asked for help from local authorities in Sagaing division. The copper mine has been the subject of several protests by campaigners and local villagers, mainly over land rights and compensation.  A local monk, who asked not to be identified, told Agence France-Presse the Chinese were held after they entered a village near the mine. \"They are threatening that they would kill the two Chinese men if the village is raided. The situation is very tense at the moment,\" he said. Local people said the incident followed a clash between residents and police on Saturday night. \"Villagers are now trying to negotiate with the authorities,\" said Thwe Thwe Win, an activist from a nearby village. A botched raid on a protest at the mine in November 2012 sparked anger after police used phosphorus against demonstrators. Dozens of people including monks were injured in the harshest crackdown since the end of military rule in early 2011. Call to halt mine Wanbao said the demands escalated during Sunday, with the kidnappers finally calling for the entire mine project to be halted and threatening to kill the captives if people from the village were injured by police attempting to free the men. \"Wanbao cares greatly for the people of Myanmar and we very much hope that this issue can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible so that our colleagues can return to their families,\" the firm said, adding that opposition to the mine came from \"a small number of extremists and activists.\" An official from the Forestry and Mining Ministry in Sagaing said top officials were on their way to the area without giving further details. The incident comes as China sent five ships to help evacuate its nationals from Vietnam after territorial tensions between the neighbors spilled into deadly rioting last week. During Myanmar's junta era the ruling generals, tarnished by mounting human rights abuses, were shielded from some international opprobrium by China's economic might and its UN Security Council veto. China in turn had access to Myanmar's abundant natural resources such as metals, timber and gemstones, as well as involvement in numerous hydropower projects. But observers believe the scale of China's influence helped spur the Myanmar junta in 2011 to hand power to a quasi-civilian government. It launched dramatic political reforms that helped to sweep away most Western sanctions. President Thein Sein in 2011 ordered the suspension of work on a hugely unpopular Chinese-backed mega-dam. In July 2013 the country revised the terms of the mine deal with Wanbao, in an apparent attempt to allay public anger over the scheme by giving the nation a share of the profits. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is normally venerated around the country, was heckled by villagers last year after she recommended that the mine be allowed to go ahead. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/jayz-samsung-album-release-online","title":"Jay-Z, Samsung do album release promo","date":"Jun 17, 2013 3:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Jay-Z's latest album to get released early on the first one million Samsung devices that grab an app","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Jay-Z is the latest celebrity to team up with Samsung, with the two setting up a promotion to give a million copies of Jay Z's upcoming album early to Samsung users.

Both carriers are slated to release the iPhone 5 on December 14, which means you've got 7 days to figure out which carrier you're going to buy from. To help you out, we've rounded up some information and enthusiast analysis to help you make a more informed decision regarding your future purchase.  Globe's prices and perks Following the prepaid pricing scheme, Globe's iPhone 5 units are priced at Php35,400, Php40,800, and Php46,300 for 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB of internal storage, respectively. As for snagging a free phone for the lowest price, Globe provides a 16GB iPhone 5 unit for free if you decide to take advantage of Plan 2499. Globe's price list for the iPhone 5 may be relatively simple, but the company expands on its offerings on the plans page by providing perks for buying a phone from them. With an iPhone 5, Globe will also give you 4 months of insurance in addition to the warranty that comes with the purchase. You will also get discounts of up to 50% for purchasing cases for your shiny new device, as well as a subscription to the GCASH American Express Virtual Card and a US$5 off every US$ 25 shipping cost paid for using the virtual card. Smart's massive matrix Smart's pricing matrix is a little more complicated, as they have the basic pricing matrix above and a massive page with the breakdown of prices according to the plan you want. Despite this, it provides users with more options regarding how to best spend their money. Smart's prepaid iPhone 5 units are priced at Php33,600, Php38,780, and Php43,950 for the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB units, respectively.  Smart also offers either a 16GB or 32GB iPhone 5 unit for free with their Plan 2499. Perks and downsides Yugatech has a great breakdown on the iPhone plans, as well as some clarifications regarding how the plans will work. Most notable in the descriptions on the breakdown is that the units offered are HSPA+ and do not have LTE.  The Plan 2499 packages for the two providers have different perks and downsides: 1) Smart's Plan 2499 package does not currently indicate if the texts and calls are free when sending to other networks, but does appear to have unlimited and uncapped Internet connectivity. 2) Globe's Plan 2499 package allows for 10 minutes of calls and 200 texts to all Globe and TM numbers, and you also get 5 minutes of calls and 25 texts to other networks. The plan also gets up to 5 freebies, which Yugatech describes as the following: \"unli calls & text to 1 Globe/TM number (up to 5), 10 min calls & 200 SMS to any Globe/TM number (up to 5x), and 5 min calls and 25 SMS to other networks (up to 5x).\" There's also consumable amount of P1,500. (I earlier misinterpreted the information I had on-hand as stating that you could use each add-on five times. Thanks to RoyceGenman Arellano for spotting the error.) One additional thing noted is that Smart's Data Plan 3000 has the dubious honor of costing more but having fewer texting credits than Plan 2499. Unbox.ph also has another perspective check between the two carriers. Namely, if you plan on getting an iPhone 5, find out what services you intend to use most, and then check the data for which plans serve your needs best. The plans or their perks may be subject to change and revision, so those interested in picking up an iPhone 5 on December 14 will want to keep the information here in hand.

Tobias “Toby” Tiangco stole the crowning glory from prosecution spokesperson Marikina Rep. Romero “Miro” Quimbo when he appeared as a witness at the #CoronaTrial, Monday, March 12. Tiangco turned his back on his House colleagues as he testified for the defense. But as coined by humor blogger The Professional Heckler, his hairdo was the “mane attraction.” The congressman’s spiked salt-and-pepper hair, bright green tie, and eyebrows distracted many viewers, and triggered a salon-like discussion online on what exactly his hairstyle is called. It even inspired a wacky blog entry featuring the more senior members of the impeachment court.  Tiangco is not the first challenger to Quimbo’s matinee-idol-status. Earlier, Quimbo was once quoted as saying his spikes are no match for the skin of Defense Spokesperson Tranquil Salvador III. Anime? Charice? Clooney? Quimbo is known for his signature ‘do known as a faux-hawk but Tiangco’s hair is sui generis, a class of its own. Is it a bird’s nest? Plain funky? Super gelled? The debate is fierce, with references ranging from Hollywood, K-Pop to Navotas livelihood. Some Twitter users think Tiangco took a page out of George Clooney’s stylebook.  Several netizens though think Tiangco’s hair is Asian-inspired, either by anime or K-pop.  Commission on Elections Spokesperson James Jimenez casts his vote on Tiangco’s look.  Others including columnist Wilson Lee Flores looked closer to home, comparing Tiangco’s hair to the controversial new look of Charice. Perhaps he echoes Charice, “This is me. This is who I am.”  Twitter user @HilagaPedro thinks Navotas, the country’s fishing capital, has something to do with the look of its congressman.  ‘Who wore it best?’ Even ANC anchor Tony Velasquez could not resist jumping into the conversation. @Kakanturing posed the ultimate fashion question: “Who wore it best?”  Quimbo still maintains a fan base but many think Tiangco trumped his look.  Don't worry, Rep. Quimbo. The fashion scene is much like the impeachment trial.

Javi Gomez de Liaño turned out to be a model of efficiency after finishing with 19 points on a 7-of-8 shooting from the field, while Juan Gomez de Liaño scattered 14 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists.  Thailand gained momentum after cutting its deficit to 14 points, 50-64, in the third quarter before the Gomez de Liaños combined for 7 points in an 11-2 run the Philippines erected for a 75-52 lead going into the last frame.

Isaac Go and Justine Baltazar formed a formidable frontline in the win and combined for 11 points, 21 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals.  Chanatip Jakrawan did most of the heavy lifting for Thailand with 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 2 steals, but his monster game proved not enough for his team to clinch its first win.

Claiming to be the first in the country, Hakoot developer Efren Jamolod Jr. – a Dapitanon working as software architect in Linköping, Sweden – said he, together with his brother Jesrome – a software engineer in Cebu City – developed two applications for the system, one for the garbage collectors and the other for the residents and establishments. “Through their cellphones, residents and establishments can in real time inform garbage collection management (of) the volume and kind of garbage they want to dispose,” Efren said.  He added the city’s solid waste management receives feedback and input, enabling them to efficiently manage the routes of their garbage trucks, effectively dispatch garbage trucks and crew, and decide whether there is a need to send garbage trucks for another round. Efren added Hakoot enables residents and establishments to monitor through their cellphones the location and direction of garbage trucks. An existing ordinance provides that garbage should be taken out to the streets only when garbage collectors arrive.  “Hakoot enables residents to know when to take out their garbage, unlike the present set up wherein residents and establishments have to watch out the whole day for the garbage truck that sometimes doesn’t come,” he said.  Efren also stressed that the maximum effectiveness of Hakoot remains dependent on solid waste management infrastructure – having enough garbage trucks and collectors and the establishment of Material Recovery Facilities and the main residual containment facility.  “We have the residual containment facility, but we still have to prod each barangay leadership to establish their own material recovery facilities, and worst we don’t have garbage trucks, we just borrow two dump trucks from the Engineering Office,” Alvi Agolong, head of Dapitan's Solid Waste Management operations, said, The problem with borrowing trucks is a borrowed truck can only be used for a single round on its route every day, “and it has to be sent back for engineering works,” Agolong said. Dapitan has only about 5  tons of garbage daily, which can be met up with 3 to 4 garbage trucks and about 32 collectors and drivers.  At present, Agolong admitted they can hardly collect the city’s garbage, “particularly if the schedule is disrupted when the aging dump trucks bog down or if trucks are already full before its routes are completely covered.\" Efren noted, \"Frustrated residents have no one else to go to but social media.\" He added, \"We were troubled, annoyed with the rants of our fellow Dapitanons on uncollected garbage, that’s why I called up my brother telling him we have to do something.”  “Thus the birth of Hakoot, but we will continue on improving the software through the feedback of those in the solid waste management (department) and the residents and establishments. Hakoot has to be tailor-fit for the needs of the city,” Efren stressed.  In principle, the Jamolods and the City Government have already agreed to use Hakoot, and a memorandum of agreement will be signed this week with Mayor Rosalina G. Jalosjos, who just ordered the immediate purchase of two new garbage trucks and another two next year.  Asked why the letter “o” is used twice in Hakoot, the developers smilingly replied, “That’s how we Bisaya-speaking pronounce it.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-urges-drivers-set-for-deactivation-june-10-2019-reapply","title":"Grab urges drivers set for deactivation on June 10 to reapply","date":"Jun 9, 2019 11:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The deactivation of unaccredited Grab drivers will push through on Monday, June 10, but the company says those affected can still vie for 10,000 new slots","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines said it will proceed with the deactivation of around 8,000 unaccredited drivers on Monday, June 10, but urged those affected to reapply.

On Thursday, March 21, Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran told Rappler that Tugade does not intervene with LTFRB matters, despite being an attached agency. \"Secretary [Tugade] is not a micromanager.

In a text message to Rappler, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that Velox is no longer foreign-owned but \"still below the 60-40 requirement.\" To qualify as a TNC, it should be 60% Filipino-owned. In March 2018, Grab bought the Southeast Asia operations of Uber, therefore having a \"virtual monopoly\" of the industry, as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) previously said. In a statement on Friday, March 22, Grab Philippines said it had \"willfully\" invested over $164 million in the Philippines for its operations \"while remaining faithful, compliant, and respectful to regulators and policy makers.\" \"We, in no way, undermine their mandate and the trust given to them by the President by seeking special preference or partisanship in favor of our business,\" Grab said. \"We will continue to demonstrate our compliance as a fair and law-abiding corporation operating in the Philippines. We encourage everyone – both existing and incoming market players – to remain faithful to the procedures and the regulations set by the government,\" it added. Since Uber left, ride-hailing services patrons have complained about unserved bookings from Grab. Drivers also said they don't receive as much incentives as when the California-based firm was still here. The acquisition was eventually approved by PCC, but the antitrust body slapped Grab Philippines with a P12-million fine for causing \"undue\" difficulties to the review. The PCC again fined Grab P6.5 million for violating its pricing commitments in January. Will the Philippine government ever allow Go-Jek to operate in the country?

(He can’t recognize his own mother. Imagine, Marko just went out and booked a ride on Grab, then suddenly he can no longer move, speak, and can’t understand his loved ones.) Medical expenses The family said Grab has offered to pay only for a fraction of the P2.5 million worth of medical expenses. The De Guzman family said Grab made several offers but not enough to cover his hospital bill. They also claimed that Grab's policy only gives out a maximum of P200,000 for accidents. \"Marko lost his future, his chance to get a job and earn for himself and his family. He lost his capacity to learn, to understand, to recognize his loved ones,” Steffi said. The family is now raising funds for Marko’s medical expenses. In a statement, Grab Philippines said it is “saddened by this terribly unfortunate incident.\" \"We continue to pray for his immediate and successful recovery,\" the company said. Grab Philippines Spokesperson Leo Gonzales said they have been in constant communication with the family and offered financial assistance. \"While the family has not accepted any of our offers, we are continuously reaching out to extend adequate support that would cover Marko’s hospital expenses. We are also assisting them in claiming their insurance, which is offered to all Grab passengers and driver-partners,” Gonzales said. The driver, Allan Sarmiento, has been permanently banned from the Grab platform.

In a statement late Tuesday, July 10, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu cited a 2015 Department of Transportation (DOTr) order which allows transport network companies to change fares on their own. \"We stand by the legality of the P2 per minute fare component and we are disappointed by the order of LTFRB. We would like to reiterate that it is legal, pursuant to the DO 2015-011,\" Cu said. Grab said it is studying its legal options given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) July 9 order fining the company. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) \"We are currently studying our legal options regarding LTFRB's order. But no matter how we decide to move forward from this, be assured, Grab will stay,\" Cu added.  The LTFRB on imposed a P10-million fine on Grab, and ordered the company to reimburse its riders by way of rebates, for charging P2-per-minute on top of its government-approved fares. But Grab can still appeal the order within 15 days. Following a December 2016 order, Grab Philippines can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. Charge 'legal'? While LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada signed the July 9 order, she dissented from the majority opinion of the Board. Lizada pointed out that another department order is needed to repeal DO 2015-11.  DO 2017-11 was issued on June 19, 2017, which allowed TNCs to have a \"pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB.\" Grab implemented the P2-per-minute fare component on June 5, 2017, which means that the travel charge was rolled out prior to DO 2017-011. \"Respondent imposed the travel time rate of P2 per minute on June 5, 2017, which was prior to the effectivity of the said Department Order…Thus, it is clear that another [DO] was needed to supersede [DO] 2015-011, absent the former, [DO] 2015-011 remains valid,\" Lizada wrote in her dissenting opinion. But the board member said that administrative sanctions must be imposed after the effectivity of DO 2017-011. \"Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,\" Lizada added.

In a statement on Wednesday, May 30, Grab said it had received the PCC's Statement of Concerns (SOC) dated May 22, where the antitrust watchdog said that the Grab-Uber deal \"has resulted and will likely continue to result in a substantial lessening of competition\" in the market. The SOC is part of the PCC's ongoing review of the deal. Grab again argued that there are too many passengers and not enough vehicles. (READ: Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day) \"We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,\" Grab said. This demand and supply imbalance, added Grab, \"is likely to be temporary\" because the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has since accredited 5 other ride-hailing companies – MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Go Lag, and Hype. But the PCC's Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) found that the new industry players are unlikely to provide much of a challenge to Grab – at least not in the near future. With Uber's exit, Grab now controls 93% of the ride-hailing market. \"Such entry of competitors would not be timely, likely, and sufficient because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base sufficient to contest the incumbent,\" said the PCC. 'Deteriorating' service As for complaints about poor service, Grab noted that it recently launched a \"100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience.\" One of the top complaints is driver cancellation, though Grab earlier claimed that riders are more likely to cancel than drivers. The PCC, however, had said that its data show \"prices are increasing, while quality of service is deteriorating, to the detriment of the riding public.\" Grab, according to the PCC, also increased the frequency of its surge pricing. The commission's MAO based its findings on \"total observations of 27,648 booking requests over 3 phases\" as well as \"mystery shopper surveys (a total quota of 1,104 rides),\" conducted before and after Uber exited the market on April 16. \"Passenger surveys and interviews... indicate more driver cancellations, forced cancellation of rides, and longer waiting times,\" said the PCC. In response to these findings, Grab said it would share its own market analysis with the PCC, to show that its deal with Uber \"has no anti-competitive effect.\" The company will file a formal reply to address the points in the SOC. \"We hope that the PCC will fairly assess our arguments and sit down with us to discuss how to address any issues that the PCC may identify moving forward,\" the company said. Illegal fares? In a separate statement, Grab also maintained that its fares are \"legal and upfront,\" denying the allegations of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it charges illegal rates. Nograles earlier claimed Grab had an unauthorized charge of P2 per minute of travel and a supposedly illegal P80 minimum fare. The LTFRB suspended the P2 per minute charge – a decision that's under appeal – and also said it was not informed about the minimum fare. Grab said a 2015 order from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allowed transport network companies (TNCs) to set their own fares without LTFRB approval. \"Congressman Jericho Nograles may be rocking the boat for his political ends, not really to protect the riding public. Proof is his own bill in Congress wants the TNCs to set their own fares, exactly what he is opposing now,\" said Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales. In response, Nograles told Rappler that \"Grab cannot change the facts through press releases.\" The lawmaker added: \"Grab advertised that they don't charge per-minute fees, when in fact they did. Grab admitted under oath that they did not inform the riding public, the LTFRB, or the drivers and operators when they implemented the illegal fees on June 5, 2017.

Called Micab, the service launched in 2012 in Cebu before expanding to a few other provincial markets. In April this year, it got the nod of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to operate in Manila.  Since Grab acquired chief rival Uber's Southeast Asia operations in March, the ridesharing market has practically operated in a monopoly. The arrival of Micab, and other upcoming ridesharing services such as Owto, Go Lag, Hype, and Hirna, is expected to restore some balance to the market. For consumers, the arrival of new players sparks hope that it will eventually be faster to book a ride, and that drivers will behave more fairly at the risk of losing customers to other players.  We talked to Eddie Ybañez, founder and CEO of Micab, on how they'll be addressing issues that currently plague the ridesharing market. Micab's primary edge against other competitors, says Ybañez, is that it won't be charging booking fees and do surge pricing because the business is supported by its ad service, MiAds. Watch our quick video above for the rest of his answers or read the transcript below: Q: What’s your edge over the competition? Eddie Ybañez: At Micab, what we’re doing is we’re improving the taxi industry by providing safety, and a more convenient way to hail a ride. But the good thing with this is this promise comes very affordably. Because whatever the existing fare structure is, that’s what passengers have to pay. We don’t have a booking fee or surge pricing. I think that’s what our edge is compared to all the other players.  Q: How many taxis will Micab be able to bring to the ridesharing market?  EY: Our partners are capable of producing, in Manila alone, 15,000. That’s our target. That’s our target but the moment our other fleets sign on, we’ll have more taxis. Our target is about 30,000, maybe. Q: Now we’re at 5,000 in Manila? EY: 5,000 by June.   Q: When do we reach 15,000? EY: We’re targeting early next year to reach 15,000 in Manila. Nationwide, the 15,000-taxi goal is now doable, because they have already signed on.  Q: How are you addressing bad driver behavior?  EY: Before, there was no platform, no system for taxis. It was just the passenger and the driver who knew what was going on during the trip. If the driver did something, only the passenger would know – unless he posts it on Facebook or something.  But with Micab now, passengers have the power to report, to rate the driver, to commend the driver or file a complaint. The moment a 3-star rating is reported – even without details – our customer service will call the passenger and driver to investigate. Depending on the severity of the complaint, the drivers may be forced to go under re-training, or they will be taken off the platform, penalized by the operator, or if it’s a criminal offense, government agencies can step in, and impose penalties.   The driver’s license can get suspended for the next 3 months, 6 months or 1 year – that’s an existing ruling at the LTFRB. We’re actually sharing the system with the taxi operators and the government agencies.  Q: Will drivers see their passenger’s destination prior to accepting a trip? This has been seen as a reason why drivers are able to cancel on and pick passengers at will.  EY: Brainstorming on the decision whether to retain the driver’s ability to see passenger destination or not was tough. But eventually, the decision for us to allow the driver to see the destination won.  Why? As much as possible, we don’t want confrontations. We don’t want them to fight in the streets just because, say, a driver finds out that the destination is Bulacan. They might just end up fighting.   But since we’re allowing that, we’re limiting the number of times a driver can ignore or reject a request.  The moment a driver rejects 3 requests in one day, they will be blocked in the system for a day.  This will affect their rating. The moment they reach a 3-star average rating, they won’t be able to get passengers unless they do re-training.  Q: What happens when a passenger reports a driver who asks for additional fees?   EY: The operations team will investigate the incident. When they investigate, we’ll have access to their conversation on the app. So we can trace that. So passengers are actually protected. If a driver asks for a fixed contract rate for a trip, which is illegal, we can even report that to the LTFRB.  There’s a record of the conversation between passenger and driver. There’s evidence.   This is the big difference between now and then. Now there’s someone looking at them. The drivers themselves will behave better knowing that someone is monitoring them, like a parent to a child. Q: How fast can a passenger book a ride?  EY: Currently, we average 10 minutes, but we’re still ramping up in Manila. We haven’t even launched officially, but we’re operational already. The app is downloadable already. There are around an extra 1,000 cabs [about to be activated].  But we’re trying really that by the end of June, we have 5,000 cabs.  Hopefully, the moment more cabs get enabled – it’s just supply and demand, really – ride acceptance becomes faster. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/bring-in-indonesia-go-jek-compete-grab-philippines-lawmaker","title":"Bring in Indonesia's Go-Jek to compete with Grab in PH – lawmaker","date":"Mar 31, 2018 10:58 AM PHT","snippet":"Makati Representative Luis Campos Jr also says lawmakers are counting on the Philippine Competition Commission to go over the Uber-Grab deal","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Following the unification of Grab and Uber's operations in the country, a lawmaker suggested to bring in Indonesia's top ride-hailing service, Go-Jek.

The PA is given to drivers while they wait for the approval of their CPC franchise and is valid for 45 days. The PA can be renewed repeatedly until the CPC is approved. The CPC is valid for one year to 7 years. According to Lizada this is a measure in anticipation to July 26, when they will begin apprehending some 26,600 TNVS drivers who do not have permits. \"We have to bring it out to solve, to address immediately the problems of other commuters.... We are addressing the July 26 [order], we need to bring this out so the 3,700 [with PAs or CPCs] will reach 15,000,\" Lizada said. Lizada said they will prioritize the fast-tracking of 10,000 drivers with pending applications, but will still accept from the pool of 26,600 drivers who want to renew their expired permits.   Despite this, the LTFRB is still enforcing its July 21, 2016 order, apprehending Uber and Grab drivers with expired permits or no permits at all. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-18-2017-midday-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, BBL, White House | Midday wRap","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler:  Grab and Uber say they will keep their undocumented drivers on the road until the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board clarifies its order. The government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front call on Filipinos to support the revised draft of the Bangsamoro Basic Law. The White House accuses the Democrats of collusion with Ukraine during the 2016 election.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-18-2017-evening-edition","title":"Martial Law, Uber and Grab, Aguirre | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 18, 2017 11:40 AM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte wants Congress to extend martial law in Mindanao until December. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Chairman Martin Delgra says Grab and Uber should do their business elsewhere if they continue to disobey the agency's orders. The Supreme Court en banc approves Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre's request to transfer the prosecution, detention, and trial of all Maute Group-related cases from Cagayan de Oro City to Taguig City. Three Supreme Court justices inhibit themselves from hearing the petition of Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos and 6 local officials seeking to stop the House probe into the alleged misuse of P66.45 million in provincial tobacco funds. The White House accuses the Democrats of collusion with Ukraine during the 2016 election."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pole-vaulter-obiena-bronze-asian-athletic-championship","title":"Pole vaulter Obiena grabs bronze in Asian Athletic Championship","date":"Jul 7, 2017 2:31 PM PHT","snippet":"The 6-foot-two Ernest John Obiena is one of the PH's top bets in the 29th SEA Games","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Filipino pole vaulter Ernest John Obiena clinched the bronze medal in the Asian Athletics Championship on Thursday, July 6, at Bhubaneswar, India.

The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2016-008 on Thursday, July 21, directing its technical division and regional offices not to accept any applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS), particularly those of Uber, GrabCar, and Uhop proposing to ply the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.  Transportation Spokesperson Cherie Mercado said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the department’s review of the fare scheme. As of July 15 this year, the transportation department said applications for TNVS units rose to 29,151. The department said there are 5,727 pending applications for GrabCar units, 23,292 for Uber units, and 131 for Uhop units. In October last year, TNVS applications were only at about 3,500. LTFRB said the suspension of TNVS applications will take effect once the circular is published in at least one newspaper. Second time This is the second time the government has suspended accepting TNVS applications. In December 2015, a Quezon City court ordered the government to stop accepting Uber and GrabCar applications for 20 days. This was after the LTFRB faced complaints on the accreditation of TNVS, particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units. Uber Technologies, Incorporated said it respects the decision of LTFRB, but asked the agency to \"maintain the spirit of Department Order No 2015-011.\" \"We respect the decision of the LTFRB to suspend the acceptance and processing of new TNVS applications. However, this decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars,\" Uber said in a statement released Friday, July 22. \"We ask the LTFRB to maintain the spirit of Department Order No. 2015-011 that was meant to promote innovation, reliability, and consumer choice in mobility so that we can all help solve the problem of traffic congestion together,\" the service provider added. Grab Philippines echoed Uber's remarks. \"Grab respects the decision of the LTFRB on revisiting the policies of TNVS...We are hopeful that the playing field will be leveled among all transport providers and that this will direct the focus on providing the best passenger and driver experience,\" it said in a statement. \"Thousands of aspiring TNV operators will be affected by this latest development, along with the thousands of passengers who rely on our services daily. At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,\" Grab added. In May last year, the transportation department issued the department order, creating 4 new transport categories: TNVS, Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. These are meant to ease traffic congestion \"through efficient use of road space.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/kemenhub-operasi-grabcar-uber-taksi-ilegal","title":"Kemenhub: Operasi Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal","date":"Mar 23, 2016 6:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Kedua perusahan diminta memilih: Menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kementerian Perhubungan memastikan pengoperasian Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ilegal karena tidak memenuhi ketentuan dalam Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan. \"Dengan memperhatikan seluruh pasal-pasal Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 Tentang Lalu Lintas Angkutan Jalan, sampai dengan hari ini operasi dari sisi aturan LLAJ adalah ilegal,\" kata Pelaksana Tugas Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Sugihardjo dalam konferensi pers di Jakarta, Rabu, 23 Maret.  Sugihardjo mengatakan dalam undang-undang tersebut pengoperasian kedua aplikasi bertentangan karena termasuk kompetitor taksi. Untuk itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan pihaknya memberikan pilihan kepada kedua aplikasi tersebut untuk menjadi operator transportasi atau tetap sebagai aplikasi. Apabila menjadi operator transportasi, dia menuturkan, kedua aplikasi tersebut harus memiliki izin penyelenggaraan angkutan umum dari Dinas Perhubungan DKI Jakarta. \"Misalnya menjadi perusahaan taksi, berarti harus ada argometer dan tanda khusus yang diberikan oleh kepolisian,\" katanya. Selain itu, lanjut dia, pengemudi harus memiliki sim A atau sim B umum sesuai dengan jenis kendaraan yang dikemudikan. Sementara itu, Sugihardjo mengatakan, apabila Grab Car dan Uber Taksi ingin tetap menjadi perusahaan aplikasi, maka harus bekerja sama dengan perusahaan angkutan resmi yang sudah terdaftar atau koperasi. \"Rental di DKI juga banyak dan mereka resmi, silakan kerja sama dengan yang punya izin dan kalau membentuk koperasi silakan juga,\" katanya. Legal Manager Uber Indonesia Teddy Trianto mengatakan akan segera menenuhi ketentuan perizinan yang berlaku. \"Kami mendorong mitra kami untuk mendapatkan seluruh perizinan sesuai dengan ketentuan pemerintah,\" katanya. Sementara itu, Komisaris Uber Technology Indonesia Denny Sutadi juga akan melakukan hal yang sama. \"Kami juga meminta pemerintah untuk memberi tahu, berkomunikasi apa-apa yang harus kami lakukan,\" katanya.Ketua DPO Organisasi Pengusaha Angkutan Nasional Bermotor di Jalan (Organda) Adrianto Djokosoetono mengapresiasi upaya tersebut dan berjanji akan mencari solusi terbaik untuk semua. –dengan laporan Antara    BACA JUGA:              "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/pangilinan-abs-cbn-pulse-asia-march-2016","title":"Kiko Pangilinan grabs solo lead from Sotto in survey","date":"Mar 15, 2016 10:58 AM PHT","snippet":"Erstwhile senatorial survey front runner Senator Vicente Sotto III slides to 2nd place","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Former senator Francis Pangilinan grabbed the solo lead in the latest ABS-CBN survey on senatorial choices conducted by Pulse Asia from March 1-6, according to data released on Tuesday, March 15.

With the current congested and crippled state of mass transportation in the city, there are only so many options for the busy Manila commuter.  Late last year, ride-booking service Grab launched the latest iteration of their service: GrabBike. Aside from booking a taxi, car, or even a helicopter, the app’s users can now also book a motorcycle to get around Metro Manila. (READ: Road-testing the GrabBike)  Since its launch in the Philippines in 2013, the Grab app has had 12 million downloads, making GrabBike accessible to virtually anyone with a smartphone. Last Feb 4, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) issued a Cease and Desist Order for the service.  The LTFRB decision was founded on concern for passenger safety. But until the LTFRB releases revised regulations for motorcycles, only 4-wheeled vehicles will be allowed to offer public transport. Meanwhile, other 2-wheeled unofficial public transportation systems like habal-habals remain unapprehended. While the Cease and Desist Order is in place, around 800 registered GrabBike riders will be jobless and without income.

Pedrosa rocketed his Honda bike around the 3.4 mile Sepang circuit in a fastest ever lap time of one minute 59.053 seconds in Saturday qualifying, 0.409 seconds ahead of Marquez. In third place was veteran rider and championship leader Valentino Rossi, who will start in the front row ahead of his Yamaha team-mate and old rival, Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo. Lorenzo finished fourth, 0.684 seconds behind Pedrosa. (READ: Lorenzo puts heat on Rossi in Malaysian MotoGP practice) Crowd favorite Rossi, who put on a stellar ride to the delight of his supporters, was 0.673 seconds behind Pedrosa. \"To start in the front row will help me in the tough race. Anything can happen,\" the Italian told reporters with a smile. Bitter championship battle  Lorenzo, 28, had dominated Friday's practice, but qualified in fourth and will start in the second row along with Honda's Cal Crutchlow and Ducati's Andrea Iannone. It will be a nail-biting world championship battle: only Rossi and Lorenzo can win this year's MotoGP crown in the final two rounds of the season. Two-time world champion Lorenzo came in second at Philip Island last week and has narrowed the gap with Rossi to just 11 points. Despite crashing during the fourth free practice, Lorenzo looked resolute in attempting to catch up by securing front row in Sepang, but the Italian - cheered on by his die-hard fans - denied Lorenzo a prime place in the grid.  Rossi is hoping for a 10th career world title, but has yet to win since in 2009. On Friday, Lorenzo rubbished Rossi's allegation that 22-year-old rival Marquez had helped Lorenzo win the Philip Island race, following a similar denial from Marquez himself. Lorenzo and Rossi were team-mates at Yamaha between 2006-2008, but relations was tense. Things improved after Rossi rejoined Yamaha in 2013, but with the world title at stake their old animosity has re-emerged. For Rossi to win the title on Sunday, he would need to push his advantage up to 26 points. Rossi, the oldest rider in the MotoGP entry list, risks a world title showdown in the season's final race in Valencia on November 8 if he does not grab the title in Malaysia. Sepang is one of the season's most demanding circuits but is also Rossi's favorite track as the Yamaha racer has won 6 times here in the premier class. Temperatures can soar well above 40 degrees Celsius at the circuit, which lies outside Kuala Lumpur and is one of the longest in the season. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/government-regulation-uber-grabcar","title":"Why government regulation of Uber and GrabCar will not help us","date":"Aug 17, 2015 2:40 PM PHT","snippet":"A ride-sharing convert says the government's move to regulate the industry does nothing for the riding public","body":"Additionally, it’s not clear to me whether allowing cash transactions differentiates GrabCar to a significant enough degree from its competitor. Ride-sharing services are always going to be upper- and middle-class-only solutions in the developing world, in the same way that Starbucks is a luxury available only to the top two brackets of our population. The people who can afford to spend 300 pesos a day on transportation tend to come from the same 3–5% of the population who are most likely to have credit cards and mobile data plans. No one in the C, D, and E economic brackets can afford to spend over 30% of their household income on transportation  – that’s over 90% of the country. The effect of this economic gap is interesting when you compare it to the ride-sharing situation in San Francisco. According to my ride history, I took over 3 dozen Ubers while visiting the Bay Area, and in most cases, the driver owned their vehicle. In the Philippines, the majority of Uber and GrabCar drivers are employees of the car’s owners, many of whom are subject to the same “boundary” agreements as regular taxi drivers. One of my recent GrabCar drivers related a very familiar set of daily requirements from his employer: Once the car had accrued 2,500 pesos in earnings for the day, the driver would earn 90 pesos for each booking above that. In practice, he would make about 500–800 pesos per day over a 10-hour, 18-trip shift. If the 2500-peso minimum isn’t reached however, the driver makes nothing. As the government-imposed deadline for Uber’s licensing in the Philippines looms, my transportation situation and the livelihoods of thousands of car owners and drivers hang in the balance. On August 11, the LTFRB has declared that all Uber and GrabCar cars will be apprehended on the road if the service and the operators aren’t properly licensed. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) I am reminded of the oft-repeated joke that “licensing” is what it’s called when a government “takes away your right to do something and then sells it back to you.” Admittedly it’s a reductive way to look at the situation, but it’s hard to beat such a colourful soundbite. Under the new licensing plan, platforms like Uber and GrabCar will need to apply to be Transport Network Companies (TNCs), and their individual vehicle operators will have to apply to be franchisees. Both the networks and the individual operators will need to register their businesses with the BIR. Accompanying these announcements was some rhetoric about the government’s continued commitment to public commuter safety, buses-falling-off-skyways and MRTs-crashing-through-barriers notwithstanding. (READ: LTFRB to Uber: No one is above the law)  Uber’s legal status has been questioned a number of times in the 59 countries it currently operates in. In May 2015, Italy banned the UberPop service as being “unfairly competitive.” In June 2015, police arrested the Uber country directors for France and charged them with “enabling taxi-driving by nonprofessional drivers, among other crimes of entrepreneurship.” The $50B company seems more than capable of defending itself however, as their recent campaign and resulting victory against New York Mayor Bill de Blasio indicates. On the west coast, meanwhile, there’s an ongoing debate about whether Uber drivers are in fact employees of the company and thus entitled to health insurance and other benefits. To your average Filipino, the notion seems almost quaint — the regular taxi fleet operators here aren’t exactly renowned for giving their drivers any employee benefits. At the heart of all this is the notion that traditional industry is being disrupted by technology, and regulation is racing to keep up with innovation. The same thing happened to information and entertainment in the late 90's and early 2000’s respectively, and is currently happening in the finance sector with the cryptocurrency revolution. There’s no question that ride-sharing solutions are providing compelling alternatives that are both environmentally-friendly and cost-effective, and it’s not clear whether these additional licensing requirements will make our respective Uber or GrabCar rides any safer than they already are. (READ: #CommuterWatch: 'Choosy' taxi drivers and other transport woes') I don’t relish the idea of going back to driving myself through heavy traffic again every day, even if it were financially viable. Regulating the innovators only serves to equalize the playing field for the incumbents, and does nothing to improve the situation for citizens.

The move left a small portion of the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which transports Caspian oil destined for Western markets, under Russia's effective control.  \"This is yet another aggressive action by Russia against Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Georgian Foreign Ministry spokesman David Kereselidze told Agence France-Presse. \"Russia continues its creeping annexation of Georgian territory and threatens peace and security in the entire region,\" he said. \"We call on the international community to condemn Russia's illegal actions.\" Kereselidze said that Russian border guards had installed last week border markers, which read \"State Border of South Ossetia,\" some 450 meters from Georgia's main east-west highway, leaving a 1.6-kilometre segment of the Baku-Supsa pipeline out of Tbilisi's control. The United States' ambassador to Georgia, Richard Norland, denounced the move as \"provocative and humiliating.\" Georgian Energy Minister Kakha Kaladze told journalists that the pipeline's section could be rerouted in the event of issues with its operation.  Russian troops have been installing barbed wire around South Ossetia since Tbilisi's defeat in the brief 2008 Russia-Georgia war over control of the Moscow-backed separatist region. After the war, Moscow recognized South Ossetia – along with the Georgian separatist enclave of Abkhazia – as independent states and stationed thousands of troops in the regions that make up some 20 percent of Georgian territory.  The breakaway regions, whose self-proclaimed independence has been recognized by only a handful of countries, are heavily dependent on Russia's military and financial support.  The Baku-Supsa pipeline, also known as the Western Route Export Pipeline, runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia's Black Sea terminal of Supsa and can transport up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day. Last year, some 31 million barrels of crude were pumped through the 830-kilometre pipeline.  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/tabal-buenavista-sea-games-athletics","title":"Tabal grabs silver, Buenavista stumbles in SEA Games athletics","date":"Jun 7, 2015 3:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Misfortune befell veteran Eduardo Buenavista in the rain and wind, but Cebuana Mary Joy Tabal grabbed silver in the women's marathon","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Misfortune befell veteran Eduardo Buenavista in the rain and wind as the Philippines began its campaign in track and field in the Southeast Asian Games in Singapore on Sunday, June 7.  Buenavista, who had the fastest time of 2:24.11 in the event this year, threw up at the 30 kilometer mark while he was in the lead with archrival Boonthung Srisung of Thailand and faded to fifth place, according to distance coach Ojon Artiaga in a Facebook message.  But Mary Joy Tabal unexpectedly finished second as she hung on in the women's marathon, earning silver with a time of 3:04.39, 1:14 behind Thai gold medalist Jane Vongvorachoti.  (READ: Diminutive Cebuana Tabal stands tall at Hong Kong Marathon) Male competitor Soh Rui Yong overcame the elements to win in 2:34.56, becoming the second Singaporean to win the marathon.

Hugnatan finished with a conference-best 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting in addition to 6 rebounds to spearhead the Bolts locals, while Davis was back to his high-energy play and registered 32 points to go with 19 rebounds. Gary David continued his impressive play despite being out of action for two weeks in lieu of the league’s All-Star Wekeend, finishing with 14 points that was punctuated by his game-sealing 3-pointer with two minutes remaining in the game. “Gary David got hot in the second half and he helped us pull the game out,” his head coach, Norman Black, said following the contest. “I want to give credit to Reynel Hugnatan who had a big game for us offensively,” Black said about his big man, who scored a career-high 28 points when Meralco faced Barako Bull last conference. “I think one of the main reasons why he played really well today is because we shared the basketball.” The Bolts finished with 19 assists and shot a superb 50% from the field, despite going just 3-of-13 from downtown. Fortunately for Black, two of those triples came at very crucial stretches for his team. Led by by former Ateneo Blue Eagles star Nico Salva, the Energy stormed back from a double-digit second half deficit and was within 7, 84-77, with 4 minutes to go. A hook shot in the paint by Davis extended his team’s edge back up to nine, but free throws and a baseline midrange jumper by Salva, who scored all of his 10 points in the final period, trimmed his club’s deficit down to 5, 86-81, with 3 minutes to go. A few plays later, an offensive possession for the Bolts went haywire as the Energy’s defense cut off driving lanes and closed out on shooters. This led to Hugnatan having to take an off-balanced right-corner 3-ball, which luckily for his squad, hit nothing but net. After getting a stop on defense, Meralco handed the ball to a curling David who used a screen to get open and sink the dagger of the ballgame. “It’s nice to have Josh Davis back a hundred percent,” Black said about his import, who sustained a severe left hip contusion just before the All-Star break in a loss to the San Miguel Beermen. Despite not yet recovering, Davis still opted to play in his team's next contest - a loss to the NLEX Road Warriors where he fouled out. His teammate Jared Dillinger, who had 4 points on Friday, said that the recent arrival of Davis’ girlfriend has helped made things easier for the Bolts import. “It’s great,” Davis said post-game about having her around. “It inspires me.” “Josh Davis is a pretty good player,” Black said about his rebounding machine. “He’s not a great offensive player… but he brings a lot of energy to the table, he makes us a better defensive team.” Meralco, now 6-2 and tied with the Talk ’N Text Tropang Texters, will look to close out their campaign strong with remaining games against the Alaska Aces, Purefoods Hotshots, and Blackwater Elite. \"It just gets more difficult; we get Alaska and Purefoods back to back,\" Black said. If the eliminations ends with the Bolts and TNT still tied, the former would get the tiebreaker owing to their head-to-head win. Barako Bull entered Friday’s game at 4-4 and with the fourth seed in the league standings, but now falls to a tie with KIA at the no. nine seed thanks to the loss. The Energy has remaining matches against Purefoods and NLEX. Barako's JC Intal finished with 10 points and 7 boards but struggled from the field, shooting just 5-of-16. Chico Lanete raced off to a strong first half, but slowed down in the final two quarters and registered 13 points. Team import Solomon Alabi had just 14 points on 4-of-10 shooting and 12 rebounds.

Ally Washington, the United Nations and Egypt all called for an urgent rethink after Sunday's (August 31) announcement, which angered the Palestinians and alarmed Israeli peace campaigners, and comes days after a long-term ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians took hold. According to the Israeli military, the land move was a political decision made after the June killing of three Israeli teenagers snatched in the same area, known to Israelis as the Gush Etzion settlement bloc. \"This announcement, like every other settlement announcement Israel makes, planning step they approve, and construction tender they issue, is counterproductive to Israel's stated goal of a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians,\" a US State Department official said. \"We urge the government of Israel to reverse this decision.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of settlement expansion on land the Palestinians claim for a future state is deemed illegal by the European Union and an \"obstacle to peace\" by the United States. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was \"alarmed\" by Israel's plans, his spokesman said. \"The seizure of such a large swathe of land risks paving the way for further settlement activity, which – as the United Nations has reiterated on many occasions – is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-state solution,\" the spokesman said. \"The secretary-general calls on Israel to heed the calls of the international community to refrain from settlement activity and abide by its commitments under international law...\" Egypt – which last week mediated a permanent truce between Israel and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip to end a 50-day war – denounced Israel's move. \"This is not a positive step – it contradicts international law and will have negative consequences on the peace process,\" a foreign ministry statement in Cairo said. The foreign ministry did not mention the Gaza truce talks, but insisted that Israel's planned West Bank land grab would be \"an obstacle\" to a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Rights watchdog Amnesty International similarly denounced the Israeli plans, saying that it \"appears to be the largest land grab in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1980.\" \"Israel's strategy of illegally confiscating land for settlements in the West Bank must stop once and for all,\" said Amnesty's Philip Luther. The Palestinians have called for diplomatic action against Israel, while Israeli peace campaigners said the land expropriation is the biggest of its kind in three decades. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba-heat-pacers-top-seed","title":"NBA: Heat loss allows Pacers to grab top seed","date":"Apr 15, 2014 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Trevor Ariza scored a game-high 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting as the Washington Wizards cruised past the defending champion Miami Heat 114-93 at Verizon Center","body":"WASHINGTON, USA - Trevor Ariza scored a game-high 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting as the Washington Wizards cruised past the defending champion Miami Heat 114-93 at Verizon Center on Monday.

Last weekend's Monte Carlo runner-up regained his accustomed position on an ATP winner's podium with his fourth title of 2013 and his third on clay for the year. He rallied from two breaks down on a day of drizzle and heavy conditions, beating Almagro for the tenth time without defeat. \"I'm very happy,\" said Nadal. \"This has been an important week for me.

Since his February return, he has played finals in all six events he has entered. Nadal went into recovery mode after trailing Almagro 0-3 in less than a quarter hour on the heavy court. But as quickly as he had temporarily let his guard down, Nadal was able to muster his resources to fight back. He claimed an epic ninth game for a 5-4 lead before serving out the opening set a game later as Almagro couldn't reach a forehand to the corner. The second seed sped away with the second set in the testing conditions and finished off the victory with an overhead smash. \"I'm used to losing to Rafa,\" said Almagro. \"But matches like this are what makes you a better player.

The huge turnout in the iconic square in the heart of Cairo, as well as in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and most of Egypt's 27 provinces on Tuesday, November 27, marked the largest mobilization yet against the president. Elsewhere in the country, protesters enraged by Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers attacked three regional headquarters belonging to the president's Muslim Brotherhood movement, a security official said. In Tahrir, protesters who had voted for Morsi in the election joined forces with die-hard opponents of the Islamist. \"I'm here to protest Morsi's autocratic decisions,\" said Mohammed Rashwan, an engineering graduate who voted for Morsi in the country's first presidential election since a popular uprising toppled Hosni Mubarak last year. Three people have died in clashes since Morsi decreed his new powers. A rival rally in Cairo by the Muslim Brotherhood on Tuesday in support of the president was called off to \"avoid potential unrest\" but that has done little to abate the split between Morsi's supporters and foes. Meanwhile US officials said Washington was closely following the drama unfolding in Egypt, with a warning that Cairo could put vast amounts of international aid at stake if it veers back off the democratic course. The situation was evolving, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. \"I think we don't yet know what the outcome of those are going to be. But that's a far cry from an autocrat just saying, my way or the highway,\" she said. Despite her carefully worded statement on Tuesday, the US embassy in Cairo seemed to suggest that Egypt was indeed on the path to a new dictatorship. \"The Egyptian people made clear in the January 25th revolution that they have had enough of dictatorship,\" the embassy tweeted in a message on its Twitter account. Nuland stressed that \"we want to see Egypt continuing on a reform path to ensure that any money forthcoming from the IMF truly supports a stabilization and a revitalization of a dynamic economy based on market principles.\" The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said Egypt can still get its $4.8 billion loan, agreed last week, despite the turmoil as long as there is \"no major change\" in its reform commitments. The Egyptian protesters are angry at the decree that Morsi announced last Thursday allowing him to \"issue any decision or law that is final and not subject to appeal\", which effectively placed him beyond judicial oversight. The decree put him on a collision course with the judiciary and consolidated the long-divided opposition which accuses him of taking on dictatorial powers. The demonstrations come a day after Morsi stuck by his decree after a meeting with the country's top judges aimed at defusing the crisis. There has been \"no change to the constitutional declaration\", presidential spokesman Yasser Ali told reporters at the end of the meeting. But he added Morsi sought to clarify that any irrevocable decisions apply only to issues related \"to his sovereign powers\" and stressed the temporary nature of the decree. The head of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) -- the Brotherhood's political arm -- said the meeting between Morsi and the judges had been \"fruitful\". But judges said the crisis was not over. \"The meeting failed,\" Judge Abdel Rahman Bahlul, who attended the talks, told the independent daily Al-Masry Al-Youm. \"We cannot say this is the end of the crisis between the judiciary and the presidency,\" another judge who attended the talks, Judge Ahmed Abdel Rahman, told the paper. A judicial source told AFP that even if immunity were limited to sovereign powers, \"which appears to be a compromise, there are still concerns that the text itself remains unchanged\". The decree bars the courts from dissolving a controversial panel that is drafting a new constitution. Liberals, leftists and church leaders have already walked out of the Islamist-dominated panel charging that it fails to represent all Egyptians. - Haitham-El-Tabei, Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/hackers-see-sheeple-sheared-by-google-wireless-data-grab","title":"Hackers see 'sheeple' sheared by Google wireless data grab","date":"Jul 30, 2012 12:22 PM PHT","snippet":"The Wall captures data sent wirelessly by smartphones, laptops or other gadgets and then finds information unguarded by encryption or tough passwords","body":"LAS VEGAS, Nevada, United States - Long before Google online mapping service cars snatched data from private wireless hotspots there was the Wall of Sheep. The Wall, created by Aires Security, has long been a mainstay of the infamous Def Con gathering of hackers that ended Sunday in Las Vegas. Designed as a \"security awareness tool\" and refined over the years, the Wall captures data sent wirelessly by smartphones, laptops or other gadgets and then finds information unguarded by encryption or tough passwords. Wall builders have long branded folks careless about what they send wirelessly as \"sheeple\" vulnerable to wolves who can eavesdrop on transmissions as easily as one can overhear a chat in a coffee shop. Those behind the Wall see what Google did by sucking up unprotected wireless data with Street View vehicles as perhaps unethical but perfectly legal. \"If you overhear a conversation in a public place, a Starbucks for example, you are not doing anything illegal,\" Aires chief Brian Markus said as private data of \"sheeple\" was projected on a wall behind him. \"For wireless, if you are monitoring it passively and you don't have to break into anything that should be legal.\" The Wall team's T-shirts this year were emblazoned with \"Encrypt or you will regret it in the end.\" The subject of whether the Wall, and by extension what Google did with Street View, was criminal was the focus of a Def Con session where hackers backed the idea that unprotected data was fair game. \"Tech people think sniffing is fine; people who understand privacy think it's terrible,\" University of Pennsylvania distributed labs director Matt Blaze said during the session, referring to capturing wireless data. \"If you understand both, your head explodes.\" Attorney Kevin Bankston of the Center for Democracy and Technology played devil's advocate in the discussion, itemizing points of US law that work against Google's in the Street View controversy. \"Whatever you think of this issue it is dead clear that the law is a mess,\" Bankston said. Bankston said a key point was that while overhearing conversations isn't crimes, capturing wireless communications is unless the communication \"is readily available to the general public.\" Markus considered wireless transmissions to be just that, since gear to \"sniff\" the airwaves is easily available. \"With the Wall of Sheep, we are kind of implying that people who can't figure out how to set up their routers deserve about the same level of protection as sheep,\" Blaze said. \"Don't punish people for not being able to figure out how to turn on the crypto.\" Markus was quick to agree that the technically un-savvy don't deserve to have their privacy trampled. \"We are concerned about the everyday user, which is why we are trying to get the message out there,\" he said of the purpose behind the Wall. \"Legislation is not going to stop the problem,\" he continued. \"The answer is to push companies to fix it.\" WiFi gear that doesn't encrypt data by default is a dying breed, according to Blaze. Bankston was worried that US justice officials would take advantage of the mood in Washington to expand how much wireless data they could grab from people. \"How about a little sniffer on every cop's belt, or in every cruiser?\" he asked rhetorically. \"The Department of Justice hasn't said how they read the law right now, which is notable and worrisome.\" The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in April dropped its Street View investigation, saying it could not accuse Google of breaking US law but fining the company $25,000 for what it saw as slow cooperation. The FCC began the investigation in late 2010 after Google announced that Street View cars taking photographs of cities in more than 30 countries had inadvertently gathered data sent over unsecured Wi-Fi systems. Information sucked up by passing Street View cars included passwords, emails, and other data that was being transmitted wirelessly over unprotected routers, according to the FCC.

Graneta narrated the events of that ill-fated day during the Senate committee for public services hearing on Wednesday, October 2, regarding the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Grab denied this allegation two days later, showing the media on Friday, October 4, a photo of the check they issued to help with Graneta's expenses.  At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Graneta said the accident occurred on September 27, 2016 at Nagtahan (now Mabini) bridge when 3 trucks collided with the Grab taxi that she and her best friend were riding in. They were trapped inside the car for almost an hour, leading to the death of her best friend. Meanwhile, Graneta was hospitalized for 6 months, undergoing 4 operations in the first 5 months. Graneta said she had aspent more than P3 million for her medical expenses. All throughout her ordeal she never received any financial assistance from Grab. \"Talagang nagpapakahirap po kaming maghanap kasi syempre hindi naman po kami ganun kayaman para magkaroon ng ganyan kalaking amount (We're really struggling because we don't have that kind of money),\" she said. 'We were told assistance was extended' Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Martin Delgra III was surprised by this revelation, saying they were told that assistance was extended after the crash. \"I'll have to take it up with Grab as to what happened with this incident,\" he said. Delgra said they followed protocol after the accident and told Grab to assist the victim immediately regardless of who was at fault. He added that they issued a show-cause order to Grab because even if the taxi driver was not at fault, it was still a public utility vehicle that has obligations to its passengers. As per LTFRB regulations, a passenger is entitled to an insurance coverage of P100,000 for injuries.  Senator Grace Poe said she would also follow up with Grab regarding the incident. The committee on public services, which Poe heads, is lobbying for the creation of  a National Transportation Safety Board that would probe crash incidents. On Friday, October 4, Grab denied Graneta's allegation, saying their representative personally visited Graneta's family to know how they could be of assistance and that they had issued a check worth around P166,000 to Graneta's uncle, Roel Capuno. Graneta on Monday, October 7, refuted this, saying the money her family received came from an organization of taxi drivers, but she refused to give anymore details, as advised by her lawyers.  The ride-hailing company provided a picture of the check that was received by Capuno on behalf of Graneta. The account name indicated \"MyTaxi.ph Inc,\" the company of Grab.  The demand for damages based on the quasi-delict case filed by Graneta against Grab 3 years ago is pending in court. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/lorenzana-hits-china-bullying-scarborough-shoal-takeover","title":"Defense chief hits China's 'bullying' in Scarborough Shoal takeover","date":"Jul 30, 2019 2:43 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipinos would 'naturally' distrust China for 'grabbing' islands in the West Philippine Sea, says Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Tuesday, July 30, criticized China’s actions in the West Philippine Sea, and sided with a public opinion survey that showed a sharp decline in China’s trust rating among Filipinos. China’s aggressive moves in the West Philippine Sea contradict its officials’ statements that it wants peace in the region, Lorenzana told reporters in a briefing. Asked whether those moves qualify as China “bullying” Filipinos, Lorenzana said, “Well, the way they took over Scarborough Shoal, to me that was bullying.” China has practically wielded full control of Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal off Zambales ever since a standoff between Chinese and Philippine ships from April to May of 2012. For years, the Chinese Coast Guard chased away Filipino fishing crews who tried to approach the shoal, their ships closely tailing the fishermen's wooden boats, and firing water cannons at those who attempted to enter the main lagoon. In 2017, as President Rodrigo Duterte sought broader ties with China, then Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, now the House Speaker, said Filipino fishermen have “returned” to Panatag Shoal in exchange for shelving an international arbitral award of the Philippines’ sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea. However, despite the government’s claims, the China Coast Guard still prevents Filipino fishing boats from entering the main lagoon, which serves as a shelter from rough seas, and where fishermen can haul in a significantly bigger catch than in any of the surrounding waters. Filipino fishermen have reported a decline of 30% to 40% in their earnings ever since they were driven away from Panatag Shoal. The July 12, 2016 international arbitral award based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) declared Panatag Shoal a common fishing ground where no country can claim exclusive ownership or access. The shoal is nearer to the Philippines than to any other country, and lies within its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A Pulse Asia opinion survey conducted last month found that 74% of Filipinos had little or no trust in China at all – a 13-percentage-point drop in China's trust rating in March – following the Recto Bank incident on June 9 in which a Chinese ship hit a Filipino fishing boat and left its 22 crew members marooned. “Natural (Naturally)!” Lorenzana said of China’s low trust rating. “The Chinese, since they started grabbing islands there and bullying people around, siyempre magdududa ‘yung tao (of course people will be suspicious [of them]). Until such time masabi ko na (I can say) the behavior of the Chinese will match their rhetoric, then the low trust of the Philippines will continue.\" Such actions, and the recent passage of Chinese warships in the Sibutu Strait in the waters of Tawi-tawi without notice to the government, are examples of China’s inconsistency in dealing with the Philippines, the defense chief added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/game-results-up-feu-february-20-2019","title":"UP exerts mastery over FEU for early UAAP lead","date":"Feb 20, 2019 6:46 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The UP Lady Maroons grab the solo top spot after opening the UAAP season with back-to-back triumphs","body":"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The University of the Philippines (UP) Lady Maroons continued to prove that their preseason title run was no fluke.

The channels in question – Soapbox, Waste-Ed, and Backthen – are reportedly run by Maffick Media, whose major stakeholder is Ruptly, a subsidiary of RT. RT was dubbed as \"Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet” by a 2017 US Intelligence report. Despite previously not requiring users to provide information about their parent companies, Facebook has asked the 3 pages to disclose their affiliation with Maffick Media in order to get back on the platform. \"People connecting with Pages shouldn't be misled about who's behind them. Just as we've stepped up our enforcement of coordinated inauthentic behavior and financially motivated spam over the past year, we'll continue improving so people can get more information about the Pages they follow,\" a Facebook spokesperson wrote in a statement. The report adds that each channel focuses on a specific subject for discussion: Soapbox for current affairs, Waste-Ed for the environment , and Backthen for history, which also included views on Western Imperialism. Maffick Media since September last year hired up to a dozen contractors and freelancers in Los Angeles to help produce the channels’ videos. The company, however, is registered in Germany, not in the US. Videos from all 3 channels have over 30 million views combined.

Maffick's chief operating officer, J. Ray Sparks, similarly said the company is editorially independent of their parent company RT and said they do not need to disclose this information because “the audience is not interested”.

The president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, said on Friday, January 11, that the constitution gives the legislature the right to assume transitional power after declaring Maduro a \"usurper,\" but said it would need military backing and for people to take to the streets to demand change. \"Is it enough to lean on the constitution in a dictatorship? No. It needs to be the people, the military and the international community that lead us to take over,\" said the 35 year-old Guaido, speaking to a crowd of around 1,000 opposition supporters in Caracas. (READ: Venezuela's assembly rejects legitimacy of Maduro 2nd term) In response, prisons minister Iris Varela threatened Guaido on Twitter, saying she had a cell ready for him – as Maduro dismissed the opposition as \"little boys.\" \"I hope you quickly name your cabinet to know who is going to accompany you,\" Varela said. Foreign support for Guaido But Guaido's announcement was welcomed outside of Venezuela. US National Security Advisor John Bolton said the administration of President Donald Trump \"resolutely supports the Venezuelan National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people,\" and especially supports \"the courageous decision\" by Guaido to \"declare that Maduro does not legitimately hold the country's presidency.\" In Washington, OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro recognized Guaido as head of state, as the person at the top of Venezuela's only legitimate governing body.  \"We welcome the assumption of @jguaido as interim President of Venezuela,\" Almagro tweeted. Brazil's far-right government welcomed Guaido's readiness to \"constitutionally assume the Venezuelan presidency.\" Guaido called for a mass protest on January 23 – the day in 1958 on which the military dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez fell. The National Assembly has dismissed Maduro's election as illegitimate, but the body has been sidelined by the president's power grab. Having lost control of the legislature in 2016, Maduro last year created a rival Constituent Assembly filled with loyalists. And all decisions taken by the National Assembly are considered null and void by Venezuela's Supreme Court, the pro-government Supreme Justice Tribunal. Maduro's swearing in ceremony was even held at the Supreme Justice Tribunal. The hand-picked successor to late strongman Hugo Chavez also has the backing of the military high command, which reiterated its \"loyalty\" to the president on both Wednesday and Thursday. But as part of his call for the military to sever ties with Maduro, Guaido announced that the legislature would pass an amnesty law for military members imprisoned on conspiracy charges. Mass protests demanding Maduro's exit also erupted in 2014 and 2017, leaving around 200 dead and hundreds arrested. Maduro is widely blamed for the country's economic crisis, with basic food and medicine scarce and hyperinflation estimated to reach 10 million percent in 2019, according to the IMF. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/nba-emphasizes-freedom-of-movement-this-season","title":"NBA emphasizes ‘freedom of movement’ this season","date":"Oct 13, 2018 3:22 AM PHT","snippet":"There will be no more jersey holds, shoulder grabs, arm wraps – things that fans were used to seeing in a highly physical game","body":"      CHARLOTTE, USA – As Brandon Ingram received a pass from a running Rajon Rondo, Kevin Durant raised his left arm to block the young Lakers’ forward view. Ingram then decided to go right and started to attack the basket while Durant countered by placing his left arm on Ingram’s left arm. “Prrrrtt!” as Leon Wood blows his whistle to give Durant his sixth foul with 5:07 left in the 3rd quarter of the preseason game of the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

There’s contact.”  In previous seasons, such calls would have been let-go by the referees. But the upcoming season is looking to be different as the league is looking to institute more \"freedom of movement\" for the game and its best players. Ever since 2004 when hand-checks were considered as fouls, the league has been slowly putting more emphasis on the free-flow environment of the game. This season, they’re going all-in.  “Wraps around the waist are fouls this year,” Monty McCutcheon, NBA vice president and head of referee development and training, pointed it out at the during a training camp for referees prior to the preseason and in video a released by the league last September 27.

No more shoulder grabs. No more arm wraps. No more dislodges. Things that fans were used to seeing in a highly physical game.  What McCutcheon was pointing out was that they were putting more importance to a rule that already been on the NBA rulebook all this time, specifically, Section 12B (1) on Personal Fouls:  “a. A player shall not hold, push, charge into, impede the progress of an opponent by extending a hand, arm, leg or knee or by bending the body into a position that is not normal. Contact that results in the re-routing of an opponent is a foul which must be called immediately.   Players and coaches will now need to be more creative in their defensive strategies. One of them that could benefit from this point of emphasis is Curry, whose game thrives in screens and constant running but has been hampered by body checks by some of the burliest defenders put against him.  For Durant, he knows that they have to be adjusting to such calls. “It’s tough to make that kind of switch, points of emphasis and how to call those things,\" he said. \"We just have to be patient. We know it’s early in the season. But you know when you are in the court in the moment it sometimes gets the best of you.\"   When asked further about such changes in the post-game interview, he added: “The NBA is making ways to make the league better, to make the game better. The referees are working hard to figure some of those out. It’s a great time to put it in use in the preseason. It’s not one of those things that you have to pissed off after a game.

At 34-year-old, he displayed that speed wasn’t all about athleticism - it also requires timing, elusiveness, and a whole lot of experience. Romeo is a decade younger than the San Antonio Spur and likely leaves him in the dust in a track meet, but every time they matched up on the hardwood, Parker got the best of him. Nando de Colo is a name the common fan may not be used to hearing, but he sure left a lasting impression Tuesday. He scored 27 points to complement the 21 of Parker. Boris Diaw had 9 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists, playing both inside and out, hurting Gilas in ways more than the box score can show. France is ranked number 5 in the world for a reason, yet number 28 Gilas stood toe to toe with them. When the hometown team went ahead by double-digits, the excitement in the air was buzzing, but the fear of the inevitable comeback was prevalent too. And then it finally came, with France erecting a 13-point lead of their own, the potential of a blowout looming. The French started to dominate in the paint (they finished with 54 inside points to Gilas’ 34), and the 3-pointers started to fall in. The good news? It surprisingly didn’t get worse. Screams of “DEFENSE” filled up the arena in Pasay. Romeo started hitting shots, Castro was using lethal side-steps, Blatche was fighting through what looked like a painful ankle injury, France was shooting baskets for Gilas, and then it was a 4-point game with 3:09 to go. Then this became clear: it was either going to be an epic comeback or another one of those painful defeats that fans of the team have become accustomed to. Gilas water boys by the bench wore shirts that read “Shock the world,” and as I looked at it, I thought for a second that was going to be the case. What happened the next 3 possessions? A basket by Diaw. Misses by Castro and Rosario. A jumper by Kim Tillie. It was 89-81 with 2:01 to go. The game was decided with another disappointing defeat - similar to the ones they suffered in Spain against Croatia, Argentina, and Puerto Rico two years ago. “It was a pretty solid performance from Gilas and is something that if we could just play at this level a lot more I think we’d start turning out good results in games like this,” said Gilas head coach Tab Baldwin after the game. Baldwin is right. The Philippines committed 18 turnovers and shot 13% worse than France (54-41) from the field. A lot of times, the national team settled for isolation plays over seeking for a better shot attempt out of crisp ball movement - even if Baldwin admits “we’re an isolation team.” Getting out-scored by 20 in the paint, despite the height discrepancy, is too big a number. Yet despite all the obstacles, the Philippines was in the position to steal a victory down the stretch. A few lucky bounces here and there, and the mood of the country might be different than what it is now. What’s become clear is that when it comes to Gilas, it’s usually either ecstasy or heartbreak. And that’s what makes Wednesday’s game against New Zealand so exciting. Win, and the national team is in great position to make the next round. Lose, and it ends up going 0-2 in the biggest basketball event the country has hosted in 3 decades. The stakes are high and moments will be made - good or bad. Regardless of what happens, this much is clear: Gilas always puts its fans on a crazy ride. Wednesday night is going to be the same, and millions of Filipinos across the world are either going to join in on the celebration, or take part in the sorrow. That’s the Gilas Pilipinas experience for you, and what a journey it is. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba-pacers-knot-raptors-2","title":"Pacers knot Raptors series at 2-all","date":"Apr 24, 2016 9:17 AM PHT","snippet":"French center Ian Mahinmi scores 22 points and grabs 10 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers take Game 4","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA - French center Ian Mahinmi scored 22 points, pulled down 10 rebounds and handed out 5 assists on Sunday, April 24 (Manila time) to help the Indiana Pacers to a 100-83 series-tying win over Toronto in the NBA playoffs.

The win at San Antonio's AT&T Center was the seventh straight overall for the Spurs and allowed them to stay unbeaten at home. They turned up the heat at the start of the fourth quarter and then held on for the victory, which extended their winning streak to 31 games dating to the final 9 home games of 2014-15. First place San Antonio led 79-74 after 3 quarters, but began the final quarter with 7 straight points to give them some breathing room in a contest that included 8 lead changes. New York made a late push in the last 5-and-a-half minutes, slashing the lead to one point on Kristaps Porzingis' alley-oop dunk with 32 seconds to play.  San Antonio guard Tony Parker missed a shot with 16 seconds left opening the door for the Knicks to shoot for the victory. But New York guard Jose Calderon's 3-point attempt with 0.08 seconds to go rattled off the rim as the buzzer sounded. \"We got a good shot, and that was the most important thing, no matter who took the shot,\" Knicks coach Derek Fisher said.  San Antonio is just the second Western Conference team in history to open a season 22-0 at home, joining Portland, which won its first 26 home games in 1977-78.  (WATCH: Jordan Clarkson hits half-court buzzer-beater) The Spurs got 16 points apiece from reserve guard Manu Ginobili, forward LaMarcus Aldridge and Parker.

Even though Tanaka was in the driver’s seat in the last two rounds by pacifying his opponent’s leverage in the stand-up trade, Kelly managed to walk away with a debatable unanimous decision. The featherweight contest was scored in its entirety, and not round-by-round as is the standard. Kelly stepped on the gas pedal in the first round, where he utilized his striking arsenal from heavy high kicks to lunging right straights. As Tanaka tried to close the distance, Kelly was able to convert a takedown courtesy of Judo hip toss after losing the grip on his Japanese foe’s head for a guillotine choke. However, Tanaka was able to position himself on the back of Kelly, where he consistently wrapped his arms around the Pinoy stalwart’s waist to prevent him from engaging in a toe-to-toe exchange. In the second period, Tanaka caught Kelly’s body kick and countered with a solid right hook that completely rocked his counterpart before attaining a belly-to-belly takedown. While Tanaka was having a rear view of the Filipino fighter once more, Kelly sneakily pummeled pointed elbows that created a gory gash on the Japanese’s right eyebrow. The 33-year-old native of Baguio City was looking for a significant blow to start the third frame when Tanaka ran through him to hamper his plans and stayed behind him by grabbing his midriff. Tanaka punctuated the final round by getting another takedown and quickly sinking in hooks for a rear-naked choke, but Kelly was saved by the bell. With the debatable decision win over Tanaka, Kelly improves his professional record to 12-1 and is now riding high on a two-fight winning streak. On the other hand, Tanaka downgrades to a 10-3 standing and suffers his second-straight setback under the ONE banner. Although Kelly had his hand raised in triumph, two of his compatriots failed to hoist the Philippine flag aloft on the same fight card. Banario, Toquero lose fights Former ONE featherweight titleholder Honorio Banario (8-6) yielded to Malaysian-Kiwi combatant Ev Ting (10-3) via first-round submission. Ting only needed 56 seconds to get the job done when he defended Banario’s single-leg takedown attempt with a guillotine choke to compel the Team Lakay representative to tap. Meanwhile, one-time flyweight title challenger Asuka “Riku Shibuya” Mikami (12-3-2) overwhelmed Eugene Toquero (7-2) with his grappling pedigree to claim a unanimous decision victory. Mikami’s takedowns and superb top control neutralized Toquero in three rounds as the 34-year-old Filipino striker had no answers to the Japanese’s forearm strikes and elbow shots. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/daniel-parantac-asian-games-wushu-silver","title":"Daniel Parantac puts PH on Asian Games medal board with wushu silver","date":"Sep 23, 2014 4:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Daniel Parantac of Baguio put the Philippines on the Asiad medal board by grabbing silver in the wushu men’s taijiquan event","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Daniel Parantac gave the Philippines its first medal in the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea as he bagged the silver in the wushu men’s taijiquan event Tuesday, September 23.  The 23-year old Baguio native finished with a score of 9.68 and very nearly nabbed a gold as China’s Zhouli Chen tallied a score of 9.78 for first place.

Adamson rallied and re-captured the lead thanks to an Alex Inigo layup midway through the period. A couple of jumpers by Celedonio Trollano and Jansen Rios later on extended the Soaring Falcons' edge to five, 49-44.  UST then amped up the pressure on defense, creating easy turnovers while crashing the offensive glass on the other side of the floor for second chance points.   A John Sheriff up-and-under bucket tied the match at 52, which remained the score of the game heading into the final quarter.   Both clubs exchanged baskets in the first half of the fourth quarter, with the score reading 59-58 in favor of Adamson with five minutes left in the game, as Abdul remained remained on the bench.  The score remained the same until a mid-range jumper by Louie Vigil with 1:51 remaining broke the quarter's dry spell and gave the Growling Tigers a one-point lead.   Off the time-out, Adamson had a great opportunity to retake the lead but William Polican failed to convert an open three from the corner.  In the ensuing possessions, three different players took shots for the Growling Tigers, though the Falcons let their opponents get four straight offensive rebounds, leaving Coach Vince Hizon's guys no choice but to foul and send Mariano to the line.   The fifth-year man, however, made only one of two, giving Adamson a chance to win or tie the game, 61-59, with 7.3 seconds left.  With the clock winding down, Polican had another great look at the corner, but failed to convert his jumper, sealing the loss for his club.  Vigil lead the a Growling Tigers in scoring, putting up 13 points.

Maduro, 50, said he wanted to begin his presidency \"with a call to all Venezuelan men and women to continue to build a better fatherland of peace, an inclusive fatherland for everyone, by everyone.\" Speaking of the opposition, he said, \"I call on them to converse in the different settings where conversations can be held. I am ready to converse even with the devil.\" But the new president also resumed attacks on the opposition, highlighting what has been a week of soaring political tensions since he was declared the winner of Sunday's snap elections by a narrow margin of 1.8 percentage points. The new leader's speech was briefly disrupted when a man in a red shirt rushed onto the stage and roughly pushed Maduro aside to grab the microphone. National television coverage of the event was suspended, causing momentary confusion until it returned minutes later after Maduro regained his composure and the intruder had been removed from the stage. \"Security has absolutely failed. They could have shot me here,\" Maduro complained. Then shaking it off, he added, \"Incident overcome.\" Watching the ceremony was a packed assembly with foreign leaders, lawmakers and other dignitaries in attendance. Close allies Presidents Raul Castro of Cuba and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran were in the audience, along with the presidents of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and neighboring Colombia. Expanded audit Maduro had met the night before in Lima with regional leaders who extended their congratulations to the new government and urged all sides in the bitterly contested elections to accept \"the official results.\" The endorsement came just hours after Venezuelan election authorities announced they would conduct an expanded audit of Sunday's ballot returns in response to opposition demands for a full recount. Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles immediately accepted, congratulating his followers on their \"struggle for the truth.\" Violent post-election protests left eight people dead and dozens hurt, igniting a crisis as Maduro and Capriles traded fiery accusations over who was to blame. For Maduro, the election was the culmination of a political career that took him from one-time bus driver and union organizer to Chavez's handpicked successor. \"I am the first post-Chavez president in history,\" Maduro said on the eve of his swearing-in. The new first lady, Cilia Flores, is a heavyweight in her own right in the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela. But Maduro also lost the votes of hundreds of thousands of Chavez supporters to Capriles, a 40-year-old state governor who lost to the comandante in October by an 11-point margin. The weak performance suggested Maduro has yet to step out of Chavez's giant shadow with a mandate of his own. \"Maduro is Chavez's legacy. To support him is to support the supreme commander,\" said Jose Rendo, a 38-year-old electrician who joined hundreds of other Chavez supporters in the nearby Plaza Bolivar for the inauguration. As Maduro entered the National Assembly, supporters showered him with cheers of \"Chavez lives, the struggle continues.\" Social programs Maduro promises to uphold Chavez's legacy of ruling in favor of the poorest Venezuelans -- nearly 30 percent of the country's 29 million people -- and to maintain the popular social programs funded with the country's oil wealth. But while backed fiercely by the PSUV and the deep pockets of Venezuela's state oil industry, the burly, mustachioed Maduro emerged weakened from the elections, which saw a significant slippage of support among Chavez loyalists. In a country already deeply divided, he must deal with an emboldened opposition and a military that grew accustomed to playing key political roles under Chavez, a former lieutenant colonel who led a failed military uprising in 1992. And as president, Maduro faces a somber economic book -- soaring inflation, a weak currency, shortages of basic necessities, and fiscal constraints on the extensive social programs that were among Chavez's signature achievements. Lacking in Chavez's magnetism, Maduro nonetheless has taken on major political responsibilities before, serving as speaker of the national assembly, then as foreign minister, and finally as vice president, when Chavez chose him. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/garcia-javier-star-in-day-of-buzzer-beaters-in-uaap","title":"Garcia, Javier star in day of buzzer-beaters in UAAP","date":"Sep 2, 2012 8:08 PM PHT","snippet":"FEU ties UST at second with their 8-3 record, while the UE Red Warriors grab their second win in the season","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Former MVP (most valuable player) Ryan Roose Garcia completed a day of buzzer-beaters, sinking a lay-up as time expired for power Far Eastern University (FEU) in the nerve-wracking and controversial 77-75 win over National University (NU) on Sunday, September 2. In the 75th UAAP men's basketball tournament at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City, Garcia caught a pass from a teammate after a mad scramble on the other side of the court -- the result of his own turnover a few seconds before -- then threw the shot with 0.1 seconds remaining, to the delight of the huge Tamaraws crowd at the venue. Game officials took a while before deciding on the matter, but several reviews showed that the ball left Garcia's fingertips with a tenth of a second left, awarding the hard-earned win to the Morayta-based squad. NU has expressed their intention to file an official protest. They have until Monday, September 3, to file it.  The win allowed FEU to tie the idle University of Santo Tomas at second with an 8-3 record, almost two games clear of trailing De La Salle University and their victims. \"Heart attack game na naman,\" said coach Bert Flores, who joked about his low blood condition that sent him to the hospital for two days.

With Roi Sumang's isolation play well-defended, the point guard dished off to Javier, who was waiting in the corner, for the latter's first 3-pointer in his young UAAP career. \"It's a magical win,\" returning UE head coach Boycie Zamar said. The Red Warriors had a see-saw battle with the Fighting Maroons but a surge late in the third and early in the final canto propelled them to a 70-59 advantage. The Diliman-based squad unleashed a 17-5 blast to take the driver's seat, 76-75, but Javier scored off a free throw and drained the game-winner to help UE improve to sixth place with a 2-8 card.

Singapore-based Grab's agreement with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Altimeter Capital includes a more than $4 billion private investment in public equity by investors including BlackRock, Fidelity International, Janus Henderson Investors, and Temasek Holdings. The offering is led by $750 million from funds managed by Altimeter Capital. The transactions will provide Grab with about $4.5 billion in cash proceeds. Grab said its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance in 2020, despite the pandemic. Reuters earlier reported that Grab would announce the deal on Tuesday. The deals for Grab, which was valued at just over $16 billion last year, will be a big win for its early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp and China's Didi Chuxing. The bumper valuation validates Grab's co-founder Anthony Tan's strategy to aggressively tap growth in new sectors and ramp up market share by pumping billions of dollars to localize its services and invest in high-growth economies. The proposed transactions, which have been approved by the boards of both Grab and Altimeter Growth, are expected to close over the next few months, subject to shareholder approvals Grab attracted global attention in 2018 when it acquired Uber's Southeast Asia business after a costly five-year battle and in return took a stake in the company. Reuters reported in January that Grab, which has so far raised about $12 billion, was exploring a US listing. Grab's agreed transaction will surpass electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors' $24 billion deal struck with a SPAC in February. With operations in 8 countries and 398 cities, Grab is already Southeast Asia's most valuable start-up. Leveraging its ride-hailing business started in 2012, the firm has moved into food and grocery deliveries, courier services, digital payments, and is now making a push into insurance and lending in a region of 650 million people. The listing will give Grab extra firepower in its main market, Indonesia, where local rival Gojek is close to sealing a merger with the country's leading e-commerce business, Tokopedia. Grab, whose net revenue surged 70% last year, has yet to turn profitable, but it expects its biggest segment – the food delivery business – to break even by end-2021, as more consumers shift to online food delivery after the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash-rich, US-listed Sea is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Both Grab and Sea won digital bank licences in Singapore last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/grab-philippines-madiskarteng-boss-20-future-filipino-entrepreneurs","title":"Madiskarteng Boss 20: The future of Filipino entrepreneurship","date":"Nov 30, 2020 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"With passion and ingenuity, they’ve made it to the top","body":"Meet this year’s Madiskarteng Boss 20 – a diverse group of Filipino entrepreneurs that have successfully grown their businesses by skillfully harnessing innovative digital tools. Local businesses, especially small shops typically managed by an individual or a small group of people, were seriously affected by the quarantine regulations established at the start of the year. As the pandemic stretches on, it is becoming vital for these businesses to recalibrate their operations.  The challenge today isn’t just to keep up with technology. It’s to utilize technology to help you better reach and serve your customers as well as grow your business. And this is exactly what these entrepreneurs have accomplished with the help of GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program.  The GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club (MBC) is a rewards and loyalty program for entrepreneurs who use GrabExpress. As part of the MBC, they get a wide range of benefits including exclusive promos, webinars, free ad spaces, and even capital loans. They also become part of the MBC community, where they get to meet fellow entrepreneurs. From pet care products to sushi bake and everything in between, the Madiskarteng Boss 20 shows that any business has the potential to be successful – with diskarte and by embracing digitalization. Today, we’re giving you an inside look at how.  In this article, we highlight the humble beginnings of the Madiskarteng Boss 20, share what makes them stand out, and give you a glimpse at how they work with Grab to ensure the steady growth of their respective businesses. Introducing the future of Filipino entrepreneurship – the Madiskarteng Boss 20:  How should you begin a successful business? Try starting with something you are passionate about. Before establishing Activ Green PH, Kellsey was already a sustainability advocate. When she observed that there were only a handful of sellers of eco-friendly products in Manila, she decided to look for local sources and began her business from there. Nowadays, they are a well-known one-stop shop  for sustainable products.  Activ Green PH stands out because they don’t just promote products. They also promote a lifestyle. As advocates for sustainable alternatives to various household products, they make sure that they themselves try the products for a couple of months first before selling them.  They recently just celebrated their second anniversary with a fundraising project in partnership with the Philippine Eagle Foundation. All orders made within Metro Manila were delivered through GrabExpress. Kellsey attributes their successful celebration to the MBC promos offered at that time, which ensured that their customers were able to receive their items at the best condition for a discounted delivery fee. Nicole is proof that business inspiration can come even at the worst points of your life. In 2018, she decided to quit her advertising job to spend more time with her father after he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure. She began baking as her form of therapy. Eventually, she used her father’s successful kidney transplant journey as an inspiration for Baba Bake’s best-selling sinless cookies.  When asked why she chose to focus on keto-friendly cookies, she mentioned that she wants to change the negativity attached to healthy eating. Her goal is simple: to create cookies so delicious you wouldn’t even notice that they don’t contain sugar and flour. She has succeeded – customers constantly rave that their low-carb and sugar-free cookies taste just like any other normal sinful dessert. Baba Bake has always operated from home but that doesn’t mean there weren’t any adjustments she had to make. Because she lived in a condo community, she had to personally hand over deliveries to riders who couldn’t enter the premises. Thankfully, she discovered Grab Express’ multi-stop booking feature, which allowed her to categorize the deliveries by area and had them delivered by one rider in a multi-stop booking. These helped the riders finish deliveries faster, which also allowed her to save time and effort.  Managed by a husband and wife tandem, Backspacer Records was established in 2017 by avid record collector Robert. Since both he and Tasha had corporate jobs, his only motivation was to sell his extra copies to offset what he spent for his own collection. As their network of customers grew, he saw the business’ potential. In 2019, they set up a retail store in their friend’s Kapitolyo bar.  When lockdown regulations were implemented, they had to cease operations. But they did not let this affect them. Because it gave them time to build their own website, they were able to migrate their operations from social media platforms to a proper e-commerce site that has a shopping cart and an integrated payment system. Luckily, the lockdown also afforded their target customers with time and yearning for good music on vinyl while they’re  stuck at home. Robert says that pivoting online is the single best business decision they have made so far. Of course, they couldn’t have done it without Grab. The GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program gives them access to webinars, where they learn how to improve their services and grow their business. Aside from the consistent and reliable services that GrabExpress provides, they also get big savings from their exclusive promos. In Gemma’s own words, Bathgems is “a soapery that offers handcrafted all-natural soaps and bath products that are artisanal in design, world-class in quality, competitive market-wise, and proudly Filipino.” The quality of these products cannot be understated. Customers commend not only the appearance of these soaps but also their effects – many of them now forego lotions or moisturizers!  Unlike other soaps in the market, these products have a unique story. Each soap is environment-friendly, skin-safe, non-carcinogenic, cruelty-free, and fully biodegradable. This is in line with her belief that we need to take care of the environment while we take care of ourselves.  With the character of each product and the meaning behind her brand identified, Gemma continues to prioritize excellent service by making online shopping easier for her customers. This is made possible by GrabExpress. She praises their delivery system, which she describes as quick and precise. She also emphasized the help that the free ad spaces on the Grab App offered to MBC members has helped increase visibility for her products. Agnes began her career with a fascination for Dangwa. She used to buy flowers for her friends until some of them started commissioning her to make bouquets for their loved ones. As a senior in college, she created her first arrangements, which she sold in mason jars at P400 each. Today, Blooms by Agi is her full-time job. She has also expanded to supplying for events and weddings. Following her appreciation for Dangwa, Agnes uses local flowers from Tagaytay, Baguio, and other parts of the Philippines. Supporting the local industry is one of the tenets of her business. When the pandemic forced ports to close and no flowers came in, she and her team organized a fundraising activity for the staff and the entire Dangwa community. She also personally sold pressed flowers in frames, with all the proceeds going to the donations.  It’s no wonder that she’s in full support of the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program. “On a personal perspective, I love how it empowers Filipino entrepreneurs and gives solutions to small and medium enterprises (SME). They’ve built a community of go-getters and supported them all throughout, which means so much during these trying times.” Melvene grew up drinking fresh tea from her mother’s garden. The business itself is a tribute to her as the concept of Celestea was developed in their final 3 months together. Because of diabetes complications, she went blind and never saw the product. But as Melvene’s first customer, she loved Celestea’s first set of local teas – ginger, turmeric, and lemongrass from their hometown, Nueva Vizcaya – and made the suggestion of offering it to their family and close friends. Two years later, Celestea continues to thrive not just because of Melvene’s passion for locally-sourced teas but also because of her creativity. At the beginning of the lockdown, they were preparing for Mother’s Day and included their essential oil-infused alcogels as part of the curated boxes. When alcohol supplies ran out in stores, they sold their alcogels. With this initiative they were able to stay afloat for a few months, since people would purchase teas with the alcogel. At the beginning of the pandemic, they became dependent on same-day delivery service and used it for all their transactions. This is why she is grateful for GrabExpress MBC’s flat rate promo. Being part of the program has helped them conduct cost-efficient deliveries anywhere in Metro Manila.  Cousins Jacqui and Jam started CocoxFifi in 2013 to earn enough money and be less financially-reliant on their parents. With this homegrown brand, their goal has always been to sell bags and shoes that are stylish, functional, and affordable. This brand has another strength: they have built a lasting relationship with their customers, which they call the #CoFiCommunity.  As an established brand with set operations, the pandemic definitely necessitated several changes to their business. Apart from providing transportation and housing allowance to their employees, they also implemented a work-from-home arrangement. To support local communities in these trying times, they also added more locally-crafted bags and shoes to their product line. But their biggest change was the transition to online selling.  Being part of the Grab Madiskarteng Boss Club has been vital to their continued operations. They praise the discounts and promos offered to business owners as well as the same-day cash-on-delivery (COD) option. What do they love about these? The COD option gives customers a guarantee that they see the product before paying, making them less wary of purchasing online. Meanwhile, same-day delivery guarantees they receive the order immediately. In 2017, Larissa’s father Jojo began working with indigenous farmers in T’Boli. These farmers had arabica beans they did not harvest because they thought no one would be interested in it. Because the area is difficult to reach, production and logistics were also extra laborious – but he knew that the taste of the coffee had potential. He asked Larissa to use her background in storytelling and marketing to create a brand that would honor the farmers they were working with. Thus, The Dream Coffee was born.  Currently in their fourth harvest year with the farmers in T’Boli, their priority remains the same: to have a working sales and resource channel for coffee from T’Boli. They were also one of the few businesses that only had online operations. While in 2017 and 2018 these business decisions were not the norm, the strategy has paid off in 2020. When physical stores closed down, they did not have to make as big of a shift as other businesses. Although it was not easy to continue operations during the ECQ, they were still able to continue providing excellent coffee to their customers through GrabExpress. Through GrabExpress MBC’s many freebies for its members like flat rates, discount and price-off codes, rebates, and free ad spaces, Larissa noted that it has become easier for entrepreneurs to save on operational costs or to create delivery promos for their products and services.  This Instagram shop, run by a group of 11 cousins who live on the same street, began its operations in June, at the height of the sushi bake hype. But an ingenious business decision helped them rise above the crowd. Instead of starting with the traditional kani flavor, they gravitated towards uni (sea urchin), their family’s favorite item on any Japanese menu. Their best-selling flavor – the Truffle Scallop Aburi Sushi Bake – can give you an idea of how unique their products are.  Starting a business in the middle of a pandemic was not an easy feat. Government regulations and putting health and safety as their number one priority meant absolutely no shortcuts could be taken. But they did not let this deter them. They now have customers who have ordered more trays than they can count and some with whom they have already become friends with! Aside from providing quality bakes, the success of their business can be traced to GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club. As a member of the MBC, they were able to save a significant amount through the monthly promo codes and rebates. They also signed up for the promotions and merchant features that ran during sale events, which helps home-based business owners like them utilize tools that would otherwise be too costly and inaccessible. George’s business is the result of her love for her dog, Drogo the Bichon. When she discovered that neem – the active ingredient of the Italian product that solved his recurring skin problems – was available in the country, she made the decision to create her own product. Fetch Naturals products are safe for pets, humans, and the environment. They are the first in the country to create shampoos made out of 100% aqueous plant extracts, not oils. They use a long, low heat procedure that gently and slowly brings out the good properties of the plant in a water soluble form, making it non-toxic to pets and eco-friendly. They are also the first local pet care brand that is registered with the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) on top of being registered with the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). When the pandemic began, they already had a website. Because of this, they were not fully dependent on retail stores. To complement her online set up, she utilized the perks and promos provided by GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club including its free ad spaces for added visibility, and rebates and promos to further entice customers. GrabExpress also gave the business a fast and convenient way to deliver products for a reasonable cost.  Who begins a business in the middle of a pandemic? Only the bravest of us all. Jorge started Fresh Neighborhood Seafood during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) period. As a wine merchant, he had to follow government regulations and stop all sales. Since he had no income, he had to be resourceful. When a mini-market was opened in their multipurpose hall, he learned that there were a lot of vegetable, fruit, and seafood dealers within his neighborhood. Thus, the concept of the business was born: a community of seafood resellers, dealers, and exporters that provide consumers with a wide selection of fresh, premium, and export quality seafood that are all locally-sourced.  What started as a simple online post to help them sell their products to Jorge’s network and contacts became a business with the help of the Madiskarteng Boss Club. With Grab, they were able to implement cashless transactions. They also utilize Grab’s Pabili feature to serve clients who want to pay in cash upon delivery. GrabExpress’ new COD feature has also strengthened their sales because it has enabled them to serve customers who prefer to pay with cash. Owned and managed by powerhouse senior citizen Ada, The Juicery Manila is part of the menu of The Garden Brunch Cafe. Ada personally created the beverage menu for this restaurant, and then decided to sell her concoctions online as well. While it was originally only a simple menu, a lot of customers praised “The Vital Shot” – a ginger, turmeric, lemon mix – because it helped boost their immunity. She currently has a lot of repeat customers, including well-known celebrities. Amid the pandemic and the constant challenge to take care of our health, the demand for the best-selling “The Vital Shot” and all-natural cold-pressed vegetable and fruit juices is high. This meant that there were more orders to manage. But with GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club, this became an easy task.  Grab’s services have allowed Ada to reach more customers. GrabExpress delivery has also helped her dispatch orders quickly, ensuring that customers receive their products within an hour after booking.  For Nicole, one good thing came out of the pandemic – she was able to establish her own online business. Kuya Crepes started as a small initiative with the goal of providing food for frontliners. They wanted to ease the pain of frontliners, who did not have time to eat. Her team decided to send crêpes because these are easy to eat, filling, and delicious – perfect for anyone on the go.  As days passed, they started getting requests from the doctors, nurses, and staff to sell the crepes so they can start sending care packages to their loved ones as well. And the rest is history. They have now sold more than a thousand authentic French crêpes, all made by a chef from Bretagne, France, the crepe capital of the world. Through GrabExpress, they were able to deliver to customers in various areas, even as far as Cavite and Laguna. But more than covering this physical distance, she believes that GrabExpress makes it possible for people to gain new experiences amid the pandemic. “Through GrabExpress, our customers no longer need to leave their houses to experience authentic French crêpes. They don't even need to go to France! It's like experiencing France from the comforts of their homes.” Tonette’s business was conceptualized at a very inconspicuous time: over dinner with a group of friends. There was a mention of a meat shop in Farmer’s Market looking for someone to take over. In the beginning, she was told not to waste her time in building an audience on Facebook because meat is usually purchased in markets.  Fast forward to today – she currently manages a Facebook page that she describes as not-so-formal or business-like. Les Aunor Meatshop chats with its customers. “We have conversations about how they cook the meats they bought, pet care, Bible verses, anything and everything.” This revolutionary way of selling meat was made possible with the help of GrabExpress as it made the booking for deliveries easier. Unlike physical stores and markets, they were also able to cater to customers that were nowhere near their area. With GrabExpress MBC, she was able to learn new tips and revolutionize her business model. GrabExpress’ excellent service also gave them added confidence that their products are handled with utmost care.  Carmela isn’t new to the world of online selling. Prior to this brand, she used to sell brand new and preloved clothes and accessories. The success of Likha Lokal can be attributed to its unique concept: they create tote bags that are literally one of a kind. Using retazo and katsa, Carmela works with her seamstress to create a unique pattern for each product. Carmela’s story shows us that passion and ingenuity should always be complemented by innovation. At the start of the pandemic, Likha Lokal's Facebook account was not properly managed. Now, it has become a catalog for available products and designs. She also had to reorganize her Instagram account to make it more visually appealing for the online market. In addition to this, she’s  also in the process of creating a website for an easier shopping experience for her customers.  She was able to keep abreast of the new technologies available through GrabExpress MBC Exclusive Talks. Aside from the promos that are available to MBC members, she also notes that it’s a relief to have a partner like GrabExpress who ensures that their customers receive products in good condition.  Grace’s business began when she helped a friend design a monogram-style necklace. With the help of Mang Vic – who creates the jewelry she designs – as well as the Barrio Lucnab sewing community and the women of Barangay Vergara in Mandaluyong – who create the canvas bags, pouches, pillowcases, and other fabric products – Monogram Style personalizes various products based on their customers’ preferences.  What do customers love about their monogrammed necklaces, burlap bags, shoe bags, and aprons? The beauty of these products comes from their uniqueness and individuality. These simple items, once styled by this shop, become statement pieces for the wearer. The success of this shop can be attributed to Grace’s hard work and dedication. After identifying the need to focus on online selling, she took the initiative to learn social media marketing and build a strong online presence. Her online education has been strengthened after becoming part of GrabExpress MBC because online talks and other learning opportunities have become available for her and other members of the community.  Nene Prime Foods was one of the first businesses that took advantage of social media platforms to sell and market their products. In 2014, they established this online business. Years later, they are now well-known for their Spicy Bangus in Olive Oil.  However, this long-running business also experienced some setbacks after the onset of the pandemic. To counter these, they shortened their store hours. They also scheduled their deliveries efficiently since there were limited riders and to ensure the safety of everyone as well as maintain the quality of their products. Jennivev describes the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club as the fuel of Nene Prime Foods during the pandemic. Through GrabExpress, they were able to keep conducting deliveries. She notes that without Grab, they probably would’ve put their business on hold. The Madiskarteng Boss talks also motivated them to keep going and persevere despite the challenges they face. In 2019, Carlos and his business partner Darlene Tan both discovered the keto diet and noticed that the market – especially for baking necessities and other treats – was quite small. Because they already had existing connections with suppliers, they decided to help others while taking care of their own needs. Since the shop is managed by partners who both adhere to the keto diet, buying from them also gives you access to other services, such as tips to help combat cravings for the usual high carbohydrate food.  When asked how the pandemic has challenged the business, Carlos mentioned they both feel truly blessed in this time of crisis. The shift to online buying has really boosted their sales. With the help of their trusted courier GrabExpress, they were able to help customers stay indoors and stay safe, while still providing them with their delicious low carbohydrate food. Carlos believes that – aside from the discounts – the best part being a member of the GrabExpress MBC is establishing lasting connections. In the group, Carlos and Darlene have met riders and other business owners. They have all been really generous not just with their friendship but also with sharing their knowledge and tips gathered from the different businesses they are in. Sometimes, business ideas can appear when you least expect it. In 2018, Isabella stumbled upon a Youtube tutorial for handmade soap and fell in love with the process. Using her background in Food Science, she experimented with recipes and eventually came up with her own formulations. Today, she has expanded her offerings to other self-care essentials such as shampoo bars and body scrubs. Aside from their customer-approved scents – which they curate very carefully – what sets Saipo Soap apart is the sustainable advocacy behind it. They use premium, plant-based ingredients and eco-friendly packaging as well as conduct plastic-free delivery within Metro Manila. Promoting this unique brand became their priority amid the pandemic. They focused on their YouTube channel and collaborated with like-minded brands.  The sense of community is also part of what she appreciates about the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club. She mentioned that communicating with other entrepreneurs is very encouraging, especially since the members of the Madiskarteng Boss Club are always willing to share their knowledge and tips.  When she first started growing succulents, Gugma was a corporate worker who did not have enough time to water her plants 3 times a day. Surprisingly, this became a blessing since succulents, according to this master gardener, thrive on neglect. Her newfound passion eventually paved the way for a thriving business that can be seen in different Papemelroti branches, bazaars, weddings, celebrations, newspapers, magazines, and social media. Gugma stressed that she is a plant parent first before an entrepreneur. This is evident in her products. While SucculentsPH is known for its wooden terrariums, not many know that they have only sold plants that they have personally cared for. Their purchase process is also unique as they directly work with their clients to select plants based not just on their preference but also on their capability to care for the plant’s needs in terms of light, water, and ventilation. As a business with a lot of physical stores, the pandemic posed a huge challenge in the form of supplementing not just the lost sales of their retail partner stores but also the hundreds of plants consigned and left at the mall for months without sunlight and water. They focused their efforts on strengthening their online shop and focused on selling indoor plants, soil mix, top stones, and garden tools with the help of their delivery partner, GrabExpress.  Filipino entrepreneurship is now shifting towards online and digital operations to keep up with the changing demands of the market. For any aspiring entrepreneur, integrating business and  technology should be the foremost priority.  GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club makes it easier for local businesses, no matter how big or small, to operate.

But it may have some unintended, negative consequences too for US firms and the open internet. The deal being negotiated with the administration of President Donald Trump would carve out parts of the popular video app for Microsoft, which would gain a foothold in the fast-growing, youth-focused social media environment and join the ranks of rivals like Facebook. Such a deal \"would strengthen American preeminence in technology by moving a major consumer product from Chinese ownership,\" said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.  \"But it also could encourage data nationalism by fueling calls in many nations for local control over internet platforms and data storage within their own national borders.\" Other analysts said the deal could have far-reaching effects for the idea of an open internet, a longstanding position of Washington in contrast with that of China and other authoritarian regimes which restrict online content. \"It would cross a rubicon in terms of internet governance,\" said Graham Webster, editor of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center. \"This would result in the US appearing to support the longstanding Chinese position, which is that if they don't like the way another country's companies operate, they can ban or seize them. That would be a huge step.\" Microsoft said it has been in talks with TikTok parent firm ByteDance to acquire TikTok's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and address Washington's concerns about data security in light of claims that the social platform could become an espionage tool. Trump said he is likely to approve such a deal, and set a mid-September deadline after which he would ban TikTok in the United States. Any deal would give Microsoft a large chunk of the estimated billion-user TikTok base and technology which has helped make the app wildly popular with young smartphone users. The talks come against a backdrop of growing dominance in much of the world of US-based Big Tech firms in social media, online search and advertising, cloud computing and other sectors which have become more important during the coronavirus pandemic. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said the US may be justified in its move because of China's limits on US firms operating in that country. \"China has been imposing these rules on us for the last 25 years,\" he said. \"If you are an American company setting up in China you need a 49% local owner and you need to give up intellectual property. A Chinese firm in US doesn't need a US owner sponsor, you just open up shop. The US wants symmetric trade rules.\" Susan Aaronson, a professor and head of the Digital Trade and Data Governance hub at George Washington University, said any effort to carve up TikTok could face major hurdles and lead to negative consequences. \"They can't divide up the app, no such thing has ever been done,\" Aaronson said, adding that there has been no clarity on how a sale would affect TikTok in dozens of countries. Aaronson said Trump's \"bullying\" of TikTok and ByteDance could encourage other countries to take similar actions, possibly against American firms which dominate the non-Chinese internet ecosystem. \"The whole thesis of the internet is data should flow freely across borders,\" Aaronson said. \"If you're bullying and acting as a nationalist the internet gets more divided.\" Webster said the large US tech firms could face consequences from what might be seen as an \"expropriation\" of TikTok. \"It could be extremely costly if one of these (US) firms is forced to spin off part of its operations,\" he said. More fundamentally, Webster said a forced TikTok sale would represent a step away from globalization which has benefited the Silicon Valley giants. \"The US position has been that companies should be able to do business across borders, and that openness is beneficial to US companies,\" he said. The divesting of TikTok \"might set in motion a pattern of localization of online services\" which the US and its companies have opposed, he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/goodrap/how-grab-making-things-need-miss-within-reach","title":"How Grab is making the things we need (and miss) just within reach","date":"Jun 20, 2020 12:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Meet some of the people whose “everyday wishes” were granted during the general community quarantine","body":"Before the pandemic, we seldom gave a second thought to our routine. Grabbing our daily caffeine fix. Eating in our favorite restaurants. Commuting to work. But now that we continue to spend our days devoid of normalcy despite the easing of quarantine rules, many are missing everyday things no matter how mundane they seem.   Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading everyday app, understands that adapting to this new reality may be challenging for most of us. So, to bring comfort and delight to Filipinos in these trying times, they’re helping us re-experience the things that we miss about our normal lives through the #SagotKita project. Through a crowdsourcing social post published last June 6, Grab randomly chose 3 lucky people and granted their everyday wishes. Rose was busy preparing to move out of her housing unit inside the UP Campus before the pandemic struck. “I opted for early retirement as a faculty member of the UP College of Mass Communication effective January 2020,” she said.  At first, she didn't mind the lockdown and being quarantined at home since she was preoccupied with sorting and packing. The reality of the enhanced community quarantine only hit her when she realized she and her husband couldn't move their things out. “We were indeed locked in with no freedom of movement – us and our stuff!” When she saw Rappler’s post last June 6, she was at first dubious. But then she thought, “katuwaan kung baga” so she wrote her answer – visiting her 90-year-old mother in Baguio monthly and eating yang chow rice, sweet and sour pork, and hakaw with her husband at HapChan.  Two days after, she received a message from Grab. She was so surprised that she checked the Facebook page of the person who messaged her, thinking it might be a prank. “But it was kinda funny because just an hour before I got the message from Grab, I had just ordered wonton noodles and siopao from HapChan for our snacks, which my husband and I agreed would already be our dinner,” Rose said. “Then the message came! It’s a good thing that what I wished for was different from what I ordered for our merienda. As an afterthought, I jokingly told my husband, ‘Sana dinagdagan ko pa yung wish ko!’ Totoo pala ang news/promo na ito’ (I should have wished for more. This news/promo is true)”.  Analyn Tenedoro has 7 children. With her meager income from selling fruits in the streets and her husband out of job because of the community quarantine, she’s thankful to Grab for granting her wish.   “Wala na po kasi kaming pambili ng gatas dahil sa mahal na presyo. Pero yun lang po ang nirerekomenda ng doctor ng heart center (We can’t afford to buy it because it’s expensive. But we have no choice because it’s the only milk recommended by my child’s doctor at the heart center), she said.   She was so excited to receive the milk for her child that they waited outside as soon as she was informed that GrabExpress is on its way. “Maraming-maraming salamat po dahil pinagbigyan niyo ang wish ko (Thank you so much for granting my wish),” she said.  It’s not just them that Grab has been trying to help adapt to the new reality. They’ve also been granting the wishes of their driver-partners and providing relief as they continue to work amid the health crisis. James is a part-time GrabExpress rider and volunteer messenger for AcessiWheels, a PWD transportation service. Ever since the community quarantine started, his wife, Mean, had to scrimp on their budget. So even though his worn-out pair of shoes for work already needed replacing, it had to wait because they had to prioritize their household expenses.   This is why James was so surprised when Mean suddenly gave him a new pair of high cut shoes. “Huli ko na po nalaman eh. Nung natanggap ko na, saka niya lang sinabi kung saan galing (I only knew where the shoes came from when she gave it to me),” he said.  Through GrabPay, Grab was able to grant her wish for a new pair of shoes to help protect her husband’s prosthetic leg. This opportunity, Mean said, came at a perfect time because it served as a belated birthday gift and advanced Father’s day gift for James.   To show their commitment to being every Filipino’s partner in life, Grab continues to provide various services to help the public perform personal and business transactions while still observing proper health measures through GrabPay, GrabExpress, GrabMart, and GrabFood.  Aside from granting wishes for things Filipinos miss, Grab is also giving over 100 deals for us to enjoy from June 8 until July 5: As Grab celebrates its 8th anniversary this year, they want to assure us that they got our backs. “Si Grab muna ang bahala.”  – Rappler.com  Grab assures Filipinos that they have a partner in threading this new normal.

During a hearing held by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said that of the supposed 8,000 drivers who were told that they will be removed from the platform by Monday, June 10, only 5,000 were deactivated. \"As of yesterday, there were around 5,000 drivers who were deactivated because [they don't have] documentation. They weren't able to submit proof that they walked through the LTFRB process in securing a provisional authority (PA) or a certificate of public convenience (CPC),\" Cu told reporters in a press briefing after the hearing. The remaining 3,000 were able to submit proof to Grab that they are in the process of applying for a PA or CPC. To lawfully operate, drivers and operators need to secure a PA – the initial authorization – and then a CPC. On top of the 5,000, the ride-hailing firm also removed some 10,000 drivers from January to May this year, bringing the total deactivated units to 15,000. Cu said during the hearing that they did this to ensure that there are no \"colorum\" vehicles on their platform. \"This is really because of a regulation that we need to comply with. We have been wanting to comply with this regulation that TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should have [a] PA or [a] CPC to operate,\" Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. \"But we find it difficult to enforce because we do it manually. We talked to them one by one. We reached out to them,\" she added. To ensure that there will be enough drivers despite the deactivation, Cu said they will roll out a new incentive scheme. \"If there will be 10 cars that drive an extra hour, then it would supplement. It covers the hours lost [due to deactivated vehicles]. Over the next few weeks, we're trying to structure out incentives and promos to be able to do that,\" he said. More cars needed In a separate statement on Tuesday, Grab urged the LTFRB \"to find ways to quickly increase the number of drivers.\" On Monday, the LTFRB opened 10,000 new slots for the application of a TNVS franchise. All slots were already filled up that day. \"If LTRFB will allow the deactivated drivers to resume work while it processes the application of 10,000 new drivers, that would be the best win for the Filipino people,\" Cu said in a statement. Grab is now left with around 40,000 drivers. Before the deactivation, it had served only 60% to 65% of the total bookings daily. Grab urged the regulatory board to maximize the 65,000-franchise cap, to be able to allocate more cars to passengers. With the deactivation of \"colorum\" vehicles, Cu said passengers will bear the brunt of the inconvenience. \"This inconvenience will be felt even after the 10,000 new slots, as twice that number is necessary to provide the 70% allocation rate they said they (LTFRB) want to maintain,\" he said. But Cu said fares will remain the same, to comply with the conditions set by the Philippine Competition Commission over the March 2018 buyout of Uber's operations.

Grab allegedly created fake accounts on Micab to hit them with a “firestorm of phantom bookings” that sabotaged their operations and attempted to poach their drivers. “Drivers waste time and money going to a pick-up location for passengers that will never come, and they ultimately become wary about accepting trips.” In a BusinessWorld report, Ybañez said the number of “phantom bookings” has reportedly reached 29,000 since June. Ybañez cited a similar incident in Singapore where ride-hailing platform Ryde announced that they had allegedly been hit with over 2,000 “phantom bookings” from over 300 fake accounts. The IP addresses of the fake accounts reportedly traced back to Grab. Apart from the similarities to the Ryde incident, Ybanez said he knows his local rival is behind the attacks because drivers on his platform are being called to join Grab. “After booking one of our cabs, then waiting as usual before canceling, our drivers will receive a call a few minutes later inviting them to a driver’s orientation for Grab” “If this occurred one or two times, you could easily dismiss it to coincidence — perhaps Grab obtained the driver’s number through some under means — but it’s happened several thousand times,” he added.

The commission's order contradicted that of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB), which ordered Uber to end operations before April 16.

The sale announced on Monday, March 26, ended a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marked the US firm's latest retreat from international markets. But the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market – the first time such a directive has been issued in the city-state. Under rules which take effect immediately, the companies will not be allowed to integrate their operations until the CCS investigation is finished. They will have to maintain separate pricing and cannot obtain confidential information from each other like costing or customer and driver details. This is likely to prove a major stumbling block for the deal, under which Singapore-based Grab is set to take over Uber's ride-sharing and food delivery operations in the region. In return Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business, with chief executive of the California-headquartered company Dara Khosrowshahi joining the Grab board.

According to Lizada, the ban on accepting new drivers will remain in place as well, as the LTFRB awaited the companies updated lists of drivers. Lizada recalled that Grab and Uber said they need 15,000 drivers each to serve the public. From this, the LTFRB will determine how many drivers are already on the road, and then decide how many permits to give out. The numbers get murky as both the TNCs admitted to Lizada that there were 14,000 \"dual citizens\" – drivers that partner with both companies, thus submitting two applications.  The LTFRB expects to get the new list of drivers by July 26, when they will have their next technical working group meeting, before deciding on when to accept new applicants.

Kali ini, diharapkan pemerintah dapat memberikan solusi yang memuaskan.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kisruh antara pengemudi angkutan umum dengan penyedia jasa transportasi online masih belum mencapai titik temu. Setelah berunjuk rasa sepekan lalu, para operator yang tergabung dalam Persatuan Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD) akan mengulang aksi mereka pada Selasa, 22 Maret. “Masih sama dengan yang kemarin. Kawan-kawan PPAD merasa tak puas dengan hasil kemarin,” kata Ketua Organda DKI Jakarta Shafruhan Sinungan saat dihubungi Rappler pada Senin, 21 Maret 2016. Sesuai dengan surat bernomor 02/PPAD-II/2016 yang dilayangkan ke Polda Metro Jaya, PPAD masih menuntut pemerintah untuk membekukan penyedia jasa transportasi online seperti Grab Car dan Uber. Menurut mereka, keberadaan angkutan ini menyalahi Undang-undang (UU) Lalu Lintas Nomor 2 Tahun 2009 tentang Angkutan Umum dan Jalan Raya. Di situ tertulis, kendaraan yang berfungsi sebagai angkutan umum harus berpelat kuning. Sementara kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan Grab Car berpelat hitam, atau kendaraan untuk penggunaan pribadi. Keadilan bagi seluruh penyedia jasa transportasi Shafruhan memuji keputusan pemerintah yang akhirnya memberikan badan hukum bagi Grab Car dan Uber, yakni koperasi. Namun, hal tersebut masih belum cukup. Masih ada sejumlah masalah lain yang harus diselesaikan. Selain masalah pelat, ada pula standar penetapan tarif dan izin pengelolaan. Shafruhan menilai Uber dan Grab telah menginjak-injak pemerintah dan UU dengan cara menetapkan tarif yang semena-mena. “Dia harus memperoleh izin pengelolaan angkutan umum dari pemerintah, seperti perusahaan taksi ataupun mobil rental. Kan semuanya sudah diatur, termasuk tariff juga dari pemerintah,” kata dia. Selain itu, mobil-mobil yang beroperasi di bawah naungan Uber dan Grab juga harus sudah melalui uji kir. “Kalau mereka (Uber dan Grab) seenaknya sendiri seperti ini, kan artinya sama dengan telah menampar pemerintah. UU kan yang buat pemerintah juga, kok dilanggar,” kata Shafruhan. Ia berharap unjuk rasa besok merupakan yang terakhir, dan pemerintah bisa segera mengambil keputusan yang adil bagi kedua belah pihak.  Menurut dia, para supir sudah mengikhlaskan waktu kerja dan penghasilan mereka dalam sehari untuk menuntut keadilan. \"Kalau belum tuntas juga, kami belum tahu akan mengambil langkah apa lagi,\" kata dia. Pastikan unjuk rasa damai dan bebas penyusup Shafruhan mengimbau agar unjuk rasa kali ini tetap berjalan dengan damai tanpa ada tindak kekerasan. Besok, ia memperkirakan ada 20 ribu orang yang akan mengikuti unjuk rasa dari seluruh pelosok Jakarta. “Sudah saya ingatkan agar menggunakan atribut penanda. Tujuannya menghindari provokasi dari penyusup,” kata dia. Atribut dapat berupa seragam, atau penanda kain hitam di lengan kiri seperti sebelumnya. Unjuk rasa pada pekan lalu memang menelan korban satu unit kendaraan Grab Car, yang dihancurkan salah satu kelompok demonstran. Namun, Shafruhan mengatakan belum tentu pelakunya anggota PPAD. “Bisa saja ada penyusup yang mau provokasi. Pokoknya sudah saya imbau supaya jangan terbawa emosi,” kata dia. Aksi besok masih akan memakai rute yang sama dengan sebelumnya. Dari pelbagai titik di Jakarta, massa akan bergerak menuju dua titik, yakni gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rayat dan Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika. Demonstrasi sendiri akan berlangsung mulai pukul 9 pagi hingga pukul 17.30. Untuk itu, armada Go-Jek, Grab Bike, Car, Taxi, dan Uber diimbau untuk tak melewati area tersebut. -Rappler.com BACA JUGA:                            "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/gojek-grab-taxi-tumpangan-gratis-evakuasi-bom-sarinah","title":"Go-Jek dan GrabTaxi berikan tumpangan gratis di Jakarta untuk bantu evakuasi dampak bom Sarinah","date":"Jan 14, 2016 7:02 AM PHT","snippet":"Evakuasi gratis dari Grab berlaku di seluruh area Jakarta dan Tangerang Selatan.

In Isabela, two members of the Dy family took the new 5th and 6th districts, created after Isabela's legislative districts were reapportioned.  San Manuel Mayor Faustino Michael Dy III of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas was leading in the 5th district with 80,031 votes, versus opponent ex-congressman Edwin Uy of ruling party PDP-Laban, with 38,984 votes.  In the 6th district congressional race, barangay chairman Faustino \"Inno\" Dy V of PDP-Laban has a huge lead over ex-San Isidro mayor Abraham Lim of Lakas-CMD.   Dy has 105,324 votes versus Lim's 9,860 votes.  In the new 2nd district of Aklan, created after the province was split into two districts, Teodorico Haresco Jr of the Nacionalista Party (NP) looks set to return to the House, after getting 92,846 votes. Haresco's nearest opponent was Anita Victoria Ramos of the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), who got 49,073 votes. Ramos is the daughter of ex-congressman Godofredo Ramos. Meanwhile, Aklan lone district congressman Carlito Marquez (NPC) was reelected, this time taking the first district. Getting 91,902 votes so far, Marquez defeated independent bets former Banga mayor Antonio Maming (43,122 votes) and lawyer Axel Gonzales (4,472 votes).

Meanwhile, in General Santos City, with all votes in, Mayor Ronnel Rivera of the People's Champ Movement party won reelection after defeating Jacinto Omila of the Achievement with Integrity Movement party. But Rivera's running mate Lorelie Pacquiao lost in a close vote to Loreto Acharon, brother of South Cotabato 1st district congressman Pedro Acharon Jr, who didn't run in 2019. The city's vice mayor, Shirlyn Bañas-Nograles (PDP-Laban), will be succeeding Acharon in Congress, after defeating 3 other opponents in the polls. President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) 11198 splitting Southern Leyte into two districts, as well as RA 11243 giving General Santos City its own congressional district, carved out of South Cotabato's 1st district. However, these laws were signed after the election period. At that point, preparations for the May 2019 polls were already underway, and ballots were already being printed.

The former president turned Pampanga 2nd District congresswoman said she will be creating a House oversight committee to assess the implementation of Republic Act (RA) No. 9207 or the National Government Center (NGC) Housing and Land Utilization Act of 2003.   Arroyo made the decision on Tuesday, January 15, after visiting NGC West in Barangay Holy Spirit, Quezon City. Residents there reported cases of land grabbing and failure to reblock or set boundaries for certain properties, which the Speaker wants to investigate. (READ: Why P600-a-month housing is still a burden to the poor) \"When I was studying the law last night in preparation for the meeting today, nakita na meron pala oversight committee itong batas na ginawa noong panahon ko.

With the victory Milwaukee forced a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday in the Eastern Conference first-round series. \"We said as a team before the game that we're going to play hard, that we're going to win this game no matter what. Our season's not going to end,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"That's what we did tonight – we moved the ball really well. We were disciplined.\" Antetokounmpo, the Greek forward whose blend of size and skill have made him a rising star in the NBA, bounced back from a series-low 16 points scored in the Bucks' game five loss with a dominant performance. He added 14 rebounds, four assists and two steals, scoring 10 of Milwaukee's last 19 points as they pulled away in the waning minutes. \"At the end, it was about will,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I was out there, I was trying to make plays, I was trying to be aggressive.\" Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon added 16 points apiece for the Bucks, who lost an elimination Game 6 on their home floor last year. \"We're a better team now,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"We have a big opportunity ahead of us.\" But to reach the second round they'll have to do what neither team has done in the series – win on the road. The winner of the series will face Philadelphia in the second round. The 76ers beat the Miami Heat 4-1 in their first-round series. The Celtics looked determined to bring the series to an end as they built a nine-point lead in the first quarter. But the Bucks took the lead in the second quarter, using a 14-2 scoring run to take a 48-39 halftime lead. They expanded the lead to as many as 14 points in the third before Boston surged back, knotting the score on Jayson Tatum's layup that capped a 20-6 run. The Bucks responded and were nine points up again going into the fourth. Boston closed within two with 7:20 remaining. Over the next six minutes, however, the Celtics Boston’s offense was doing everything right during the opening four and a half minutes of the final frame. At one point, the C’s scored on four consecutive possessions –- the final of which allowed them to pull within two points to make it 80-78 with 7:20 remaining. After that point, however, the ball movement ceased for the C's, and they shot just 1-of-9 from the field during the next six minutes of play. \"I thought any time we got stagnant, we weren’t very good,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \"Clearly their speed and length and athleticism affected us,\" added Stevens, whose Celtics were out-rebounded 48-39. \"They were quicker to the ball all night than us.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-junta-vows-lift-politics-ban-june","title":"Thai junta vows to lift politics ban in June","date":"Mar 30, 2018 7:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Political gatherings of 5 or more people have been outlawed since Thailand's army grabbed power in a May 2014 coup","body":"BANGKOK, Thailand – Thailand's junta will lift a near 4-year ban on political activity in June, an official said Friday, March 30, as space for debate slowly expands in the kingdom with polls promised for next year. Political gatherings of 5 or more people have been outlawed since Thailand's army grabbed power in a May 2014 coup, booting Yingluck Shinawatra's elected government from power. The generals, who have repeatedly backtracked on promised returns to democracy, insist an election will be held \"no later\" than February 2019. Yet while parties have been allowed to register in anticipation of the vote, they remain barred from discussing policy or meeting without junta permission. Politicians have demanded the ban is lifted, while critics accuse the junta of buying time to bolster the chances of new army-linked parties in the upcoming election. A defense ministry spokesman said the moratorium would soon be lifted, confirming comments the junta's number two made to the local press on Thursday. \"The initial plan is that the ban would be lifted in June so that newly set-up parties are ready,\" Lieutenant-General Kongcheep Tantravanich told Agence France-Presse. \"While the big existing parties are already ready, the new parties need time... they will start their activities together in June,\" he added. The restricted climate has left questions swirling about leadership shuffles in Thailand's biggest bloc -- the toppled Pheu Thai party, which has dominated elections for a decade but has been repeatedly cut down by coups and court rulings. The faction – the nemesis of the junta and Bangkok elite – is officially without a leader after both of its figureheads were driven into self-exile in the wake of 2006 and 2014 coups. The exiled pair, former premiers and siblings Yingluck and Thaksin Shinawatra, made a rare public appearance at a book launch for a Japanese minister in Tokyo on Thursday. It was one of Yingluck's first public sightings since she fled Thailand last August ahead of a verdict in a court case she decried as a political witch-hunt. Analysts say both leaders are unlikely to return to Thai soil any time soon after being convicted of graft charges in absentia.  But they may continue Thaksin's approach of directing the powerhouse party from abroad. The latest coup is widely seen as an effort to squeeze the Shinawatras out of Thai politics for good. The junta's new charter limits the purview of elected politicians while boosting the clout of appointed officials. The next administration will also be straightjacketed by a \"legally-binding\" 20-year policy plan hatched by the junta. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-rematch","title":"Canelo Alvarez to face Gennady Golovkin in middleweight title rematch","date":"Jan 30, 2018 4:22 PM PHT","snippet":"The sensational sequel puts Golovkin's World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council crowns up for grabs","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – World middleweight boxing champion Gennady Golovkin will fight Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez on May 5 in a 12-round rematch of their epic draw last September, promoters announced Monday, January 30.

Stubblefield said at a press conference in San Jose, northern California, that sex he had with a 32-year-old woman at his home last year was consensual. \"I am here to state without any reservation that I am completely innocent of all these allegations,\" Stubblefield said. \"I have worked my whole career to be a part of the Bay Area community.

On a day when LeBron James powered the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 115-92 rout of Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder, Davis stole the show with an effort for the ages. The 22-year-old forward scored 8 points in the first quarter, 18 in the second, 14 more in the third and 19 in the fourth quarter with the game still in doubt to produce the most points by any NBA player in a game this season. \"Everybody on the bench was saying, 'That's a lot of points. He can score them all, you might as well get 60,'\" Davis said. \"It's great to finally score 50. Now that I've got that off my shoulders, I can go out and just keep playing. \"We play hard, play great defense, play with a lot of energy. We're just clicking on all cylinders right now.\" Davis became only the third NBA player since 1983 with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game, the first since Chris Webber had 51 points and 26 rebounds in 2001. Shaquille O'Neal had a career-high 61 points and 23 rebounds in a 2000 game. \"It's great to be in the category with those two guys who dominated the game,\" Davis said. Davis connected of 24-of-34 shots from the floor and still managed to pass off 4 assists and block a shot. He made both 3-pointers he attempted and went 9-of-10 from the free throw line. \"I just came out with a lot of energy and played very well, shot real well,\" Davis said. \"My teammates did a great job of setting me up, getting me the ball so I could score. \"I'm going to live it up tonight and hopefully I can do the same thing again.\" Davis is doing everything he can to keep the magic going. \"I told the equipment manager to give me the exact same things you gave me today, practice jersey, everything,\" Davis said. At 22-33, the Pelicans are 5 1/2 games behind Houston for the last playoff spot in the Western Conference, but Davis says New Orleans is ready for a late-season surge. \"A little tired but happy we got that win. It's very important,\" Davis said. \"We just try to come out and play with a lot of energy. We're trying to make a push to get in the playoffs.\" James, Love's double-doubles carry Cleveland At Oklahoma City, James scored 25 points, passed out 11 assists and pulled down 7 rebounds to power the Cavaliers' rout of the Thunder. Kevin Love had 29 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland while Tristan Thompson had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Durant had 26 points and Westbrook 20 in a losing cause.

The war chests they have allotted for the Philippine market would put off most anyone. A Cebuano startup success But this tall order is exactly what the founders of miCab have taken to task. Based out of Cebu, but quickly expanding to a new city in the next few months, miCab has a different business model than the other familiar transportation apps. Rather than earn from consumers, they monetize from companies, as they have an advertising-based business model. “We have LEDs that sit on the taxis and tablets inside the taxis that advertisers can book,” said Kenn Costales, the chief marketing officer of the company. According to Costales, miCab has raised 3 rounds of undisclosed funding. The company is also experiencing success on both ends of its marketplace - achieving 80% month-on-month growth for driver acquisition and 20% month-on-month growth for app installations. Costales believes that the success of miCab, as a Philippine-headquartered company, holds special significance for the country. He explained that all companies will have geographic priorities depending on where the largest market is and where the highest profits are, which usually is where the startup is founded - otherwise, they can’t scale. “As a result, offshore offices in expansion markets are either filled with expats or will have few employees overall,” Costales said. He continued, “So in other words, it’s important that there are more homegrown businesses in Philippines because these companies will, on average, employ more local talent than international companies.” Costales added that this principle applies to all types of businesses and not just tech startups. He said that miCab was founded to ultimately help both ends of its marketplace. For cab drivers, they seek to improve the standard of living. “miCab only partners with top tier and top employer taxi operators that provides drivers with benefits like SSS, Pag-Ibig, health insurance, etc, while increasing their billings per day,” he said.  Prioritizing top taxi fleets ultimately benefits consumers. “Our application also gives these top-tier taxi operators (who do their job right) a competitive advantage by driving out low performing and bad quality taxi fleets,” Costales said. This in turn results in a better user experience for their passengers. Costales feels this addresses the problems with incumbent transportation apps, which he claims prioritize taxi availability over user experience and lack employee-type protection and benefits. Winning niches Costales cited consumer awareness as the biggest challenge facing miCab. With the funding that miCab has raised, they want to focus on winning specific niches. “If the initial niche loves our product, then we expand to other niches,” he said. Costales compared this strategy to what Facebook did in the immediate wake of its founding. “This is how Facebook was able to subvert Friendster despite the latter’s huge awareness advantage in the mid-2000’s. They started with Harvard, then the Ivy League, then universities, etc,” said Costales, who added that by generating positive word of mouth in an aspirational niche, they could leverage this as fuel to acquire other or large niches. Luckily, Filipinos are not reluctant to adopting new technology. In response to what aversions we may have toward using a platform like miCab, Costales said, “The question has an assumption that Filipinos are hesitant to begin with. They are not. As long as they can get a safe / good quality cab fast, they are OK to use any taxi hailing app.” As miCab’s minimum viable product (MVP) continues to gain significant traction, the company wants to bring all its team members on a full-time basis. They are driven by a twofold goal, one for each side of their marketplace. On one hand, they want to increase the billings per day for drivers through the miCab, while providing employee-type benefits and protection for them by partnering with top taxi fleets. “For the general public, consistently offer them with an affordable, safe, and quality ride by only partnering with top tier taxi operators,” Costales said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/kaya-fc-forza-ufl-fa-league-cup","title":"Kaya FC rips Forza in UFL FA League Cup","date":"Sep 26, 2014 2:27 AM PHT","snippet":"Louis Clark grabbed his second career hat trick as Kaya FC continued its domination of Group B opposition","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Kaya FC continued to dominate their foes in Group B of the United Football League (UFL) FA League Cup after dominating the hapless Forza FC, 5-0, at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium on Thursday, September 6. Coming off a commanding 9-1 victory against Dolphin United FC last Sunday, the men of Kaya once again demonstrated their supremacy in the field, this time at the expense of Forza. Kaya FC’s offense went hard on their defenders coming out of the gates sending a multitude of shots on goal, but they were well guarded by Forza FC up until the 35th minute when Louis Clark exposed a defensive lapse following a cross from Diego Barrera. The game went into halftime with Kaya leading Forza, 1-0. As the game returned into action for the second half, Kaya FC’s offense sustained their cutthroat blitz on their enemy’s territory. The persistent offense of the yellow shirts resulted in another goal by Clark, this time via an assist by Jovin Bedic. Clark, who is coming off a 4-goal outing in their win against the Dolphins, did not rest his boots as he racked up the second hat-trick of his UFL career off a pass from Azkals standout Kenshiro Daniels in the 64th minute. Forza FC’s fatigued offense tried to spark a late game outburst but their gallant effort to tally a score for their squad was too weak for Kaya’s formidable backline.  To strum the final note on Kaya FC’s rhythmic win, Christian Ayew smacked a striking goal from outside the box, ending the game at 5-0 in favor of his club. Meanwhile, the game between Manila All-Japan FC and Team Socceroo FC concluded in a 1-1 stalemate. - Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/list-reasons-skipping-rope-good-for-you","title":"Grab a rope: 7 reasons why skipping is so good for you","date":"Feb 20, 2021 3:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Jumping rope is short on time, fun, and good for your heart health","body":"While many of us may remember skipping as something we did as children, the pastime has regained popularity during the pandemic as a way of keeping fit. Not only is jumping rope a fun, affordable and portable form of exercise, it also has many benefits for our health and fitness. Here are just a few reason why jumping rope is such a good form of exercise: Jumping rope has long been used by boxers as a form of training to help improve their footwork and general conditioning. Jumping rope will cause an increase in heart rate and breathing similar to if you went jogging. If you were to do ten minutes of jump rope everyday, you would create adaptations to your body that are beneficial to cardiovascular health, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing resting heart rate. Jumping rope will also increase your cardiorespiratory fitness which essentially means your body becomes more efficient at taking up and using oxygen. Research has shown that cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to improved health and longevity. Improved cardiorespriatory fitness has been shown to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation in the body and lower chances of developing diabetes and many other chronic disease. Skipping is a full body workout which uses your abdominal muscles to stabilise the body, your legs for jumping, and your shoulders and arms for turning the rope. It therefore provides an all over workout rather than just isolating one portion of the body. Full body workouts increase muscle tone, which will help with all daily activities, and increase our resting metabolism, which helps us burn calories even while resting. Skipping involves coordination to time your jump with the rope. Research has shown that it improves coordination, balance and basic movement skills in children. These are important fitness components for later in life as they reduce our chances of trips and falls. There are so many different exercises you can do with the rope and each one requires different coordination to complete the exercise. This may help exercise your brain as well. Jumping rope involves making impact with the ground with every jump. These impacts cause our bones to remodel themselves to become stronger, thus increasing bone density. Bone density can be a benefit later on in life, when it naturally begins to decrease. Research has shown that jumping rope increases bone mineral density. Higher bone mineral density makes you less likely to break a bone or develop osteoporosis as you get older. Hip fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, leading to loss of independence and a huge economic burden. Improving bone density and balance throughout your life reduces the chances of trips and falls later on. Because jumping rope requires fast movement of the feet and arms, it’s considered a plyometric exercise. This is where the muscles exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power. Plyometric exercise is used in the sporting world to increase an athlete’s speed. A lot of exercises, such as jogging, only improve cardiovascular health – whereas jumping rope has the added benefit of improving speed as well. Daily jump rope practice may help you run quicker than before. Jumping rope offers many health benefits that may be achieved in a short period of time. Because it’s a full body exercise that requires speed and coordination, you could argue that it’s a form of high intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT exercise is where you have short bouts of high intensity efforts followed by a short rest intervals. This is repeated several times. HIIT has been shown to produce higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in comparison to traditional endurance training. It’s also more time efficient, as you can perform exercise over a shorter period. This is why HIIT training has become the most popular workout worldwide. Jumping rope is easily adaptable, and can be a high-intensity workout depending on the effort and power a person puts into their training. One of the most important points we need to consider to help us change our exercise habits is that what we do needs to be enjoyable to us. One of the biggest barriers for people when it comes to sticking with exercise is enjoyment. And research shows enjoying exercise is critical for helping us change our exercise habits and continue exercising. The great thing about skipping is that there are so many different ways you can jump, and hop over the rope. You can create a varied workout which helps maintain your enjoyment. However, it’s worth noting that skipping can put a lot of force on our lower limbs when we land. Though this improves our bone mineral density, it can lead to lower-body injury, especially if we’re not used to this force. But different jumping styles can be used to help ease force and reduce chance of injury. As with all types of exercise, it’s good to build up duration gradually. This will help minimise injury. Overall, jumping rope could be a very beneficial form of exercise. Not only does it improve many important aspects of our health – including cardiovascular health, and improving bone density – but it’s also affordable, portable and doesn’t require much space. – The Conversation/Rappler.com  Dr Lindsay Bottoms is a Reader in Exercise and Health Physiology at the University of Hertfordshire.

The 25-year-old Davis surprised Santa Cruz with a left uppercut that snapped the champion's head back and sent him crumbling to the canvas late in the sixth round at the Alamodome Arena. Hit by a punch he never saw coming, Santa Cruz landed flat on his back under the padding in the ring corner and remained that way for about a minute while doctors attended to him. He was eventually able to sit up and was even smiling once he shook off the cobwebs. American Davis improved to 24-0 with 23 knockouts by registering the defining win of his up-and-coming career and handed the four-division champion Santa Cruz his first knockout. \"I'm going to continue to show people all over the world that I'm the best. I don't have to call anybody else out. I'm the top dog. Just line them up, and I'll knock them out one by one,\" said Davis. The 32-year-old Santa Cruz of Mexico dropped to 37-2-1 with 19 KOs. He was trying to win a title fight in his fifth weight class. Despite the coronavirus pandemic in the US, organizers allowed about 10,000 spectators into the arena with masks and social distancing rules in place. The fight pitted the knockout power of Davis against the endurance and dominating pressure style of Santa Cruz, but the latter never got the chance to wear Davis down in the closing rounds. The fight began with a solid first round in which the two exchanged punches at the center of the ring. Davis fell to the canvas but it was not because of a knockdown. His right leg got tangled up with Santa Cruz's leg and he tripped.  Santa Cruz also suffered a small cut on the bridge of his nose in the opening round but his corner did a good job of repairing it. In the second round, Davis' temper got the best of him after he got frustrated during a clinch. Davis used both arms to throw Santa Cruz to the ground prompting a verbal scolding from the referee. Santa Cruz was looking more comfortable in the sixth and willing to exchange with Davis. But he got careless late in the round and that was all Davis needed to counter a punch and land the brutal shot that put the champion down. \"There was nowhere he could have went. The rope was right there,\" Davis said. Davis' manager, Floyd Mayweather, said Davis can now pick and choose his opponents. \"Tank is the top dog,\" Mayweather said. \"I'm putting him in position to do what I did. Fight who he wants, when we want. He's the top dog.\" Davis extended his six-year knockout streak to 15 straight bouts. He has a 96 percent knockout ratio. He vacated the WBA super featherweight crown to move up to the lightweight ranks last December, stopping Cuban Yuriorkis Gamboa in the 12th round. Santa Cruz, who was taken to the hospital for a checkup, captured his WBA title last November with a unanimous decision victory over American Miguel Flores. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/bersamina-gold-barcenilla-fronda-bronzes-2020-asian-nations-chess-cup","title":"Bersamina grabs board 3 gold; Barcenilla, Fronda bag bronzes","date":"Oct 21, 2020 8:57 PM PHT","snippet":"IM Paulo Bersamina leads the way as the Philippines finishes second in the Asian Nations Chess Cup eliminations","body":"International Master Paulo Bersamina bagged the board 3 gold as the Philippines finished 2nd in the Open division after the Asian Nations Chess Cup elimination round.

Newly promoted Fulham takes on the up-and-coming Arsenal at the Craven Cottage for the season opening game at 7:30 pm, Philippine time. (READ: English Premier League games to air on Philippine TV) With renewed hopes and fresh expectations for each club, how will the league stack up this season?  There have been doubts on whether the Reds can repeat their incredible 19/20 season. The club’s form suffered a bit of a dip after it secured the league title. So far, Liverpool also hasn’t signed quality players to improve its squad depth. They have been linked with Bayern Munich’s Thiago, but nothing has materialized yet in that regard.  But with Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane, and Mohamed Salah leading the way, Liverpool displayed world-beating form when motivation struck. If it enters the 20/21 season with the same vigor that it did last season, the Reds will repeat as Premier League champions. City remains the most stacked team in the league, but based on last season, the club can be prone to mental lapses. It lost 9 games in the league including one to the relegated Norwich City.  Nonetheless, if Pep Guardiola’s squad shows the same motivation as in the 17/18 season, City should cruise to the Premier League based off talent alone.  Kevin de Bruyne is one of the world’s best players that will be leading the way for City. Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus upped their goal scoring, while Phil Foden emerged as one of the top young talents in the world. The Chelsea attack will be stacked next season thanks to Christian Pulisic’s arrival as a bonafide star and new signings Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech, and Timo Werner.  However, the Blues’ defense and goalkeeping remains a huge question mark and will ultimately prevent them from legitimately challenging for the title. If Chelsea manages to open the coffers once more to fortify the backline and replace the underwhelming Kepa in goal, it can manage to make the Premier League a three-horse race this season. Bruno Fernandes was godsend for the Red Devils last season. After acquiring Fernandes from Sporting in the January transfer window, United didn’t lose a single game in the league.  United also got 32 out of a possible 42 points, making a late charge for the third spot. A full season of Fernandes leading the attack alongside Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial – who scored a combined 34 goals in the league – will be a terrifying sight for opposing defenders. United must sign another defender to cement their spot in the top 4, but as it is, its attack is enough to carry them. In 2019, the Gunners suffered their worst Premier League season since 1995. However, under manager Mikel Arteta, the club is on the rise which culminated with a FA Cup trophy.  The presence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored 22 goals last season in the league, will assure the Gunners’ attack while young defenders William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães and the emergence of the 19-year-old Bukayo Saka will give Arsenal fans hope for the future.  For now, without a new midfield signing, Arsenal is still a piece away from the top 4. Based on Jose Mourinho’s second-season stints with his former clubs, he either overachieved or delivered a trophy.  Will he do the same with the Spurs, who last lifted a trophy in the 2008 League Cup? Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min might be the most terrifying strike partnership in the league, but their midfield will be a question mark especially with Dele Alli’s struggles last season and club record signing Tanguy Ndombele’s fitness issues.  It’s fair to expect Spurs to finish 6th once again. The club is aging and it’s one Harry Kane injury away from dropping to mid-table. Everton had a successful transfer window, revamping its entire midfield with the acquisitions of Allan, Abdoulaye Doucouré, and James Rodríguez.  Rodríguez has worked with manager Carlo Ancelotti in Real Madrid, making it the ideal situation for the Colombian to revive his career as the Toffees’ primary creative outlet in the midfield. The partnership of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin up top will be expected as the pair scored 13 goals apiece last season. There is also potential for improvement given the available boost from the midfield.  Everton might be a central defender away from solidifying its bid for a Europa League spot.  The loss of Matt Doherty to direct rivals Tottenham Hotspur is a huge loss for Wolves. Nonetheless, Wolves will still have one of the league’s best midfields in Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves, while Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez spearhead the attack. Adama Traore will continue to run wild in the Wolves’ right flank and his continued improvement will dictate how far they go this season – whether it be mid-table mediocrity or a spot in the Europa league after losing out this past season. The Foxes sat in second or third place for most of last season, but ended up finishing 5th place and missing a Champions League spot.  The loss of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea is a huge blow. But Jamie Vardy, last year’s Golden Boot winner with 23 goals, James Maddison, and Wilfred Ndidi remain. Manager Brendan Rodgers’ squad will still have enough quality to compete for European spot. Sheffield United was in contention for the Europa League spots for most of the year before it tailed off after the COVID-19 restart and finished 9th, which is considered successful first campaign back in the top flight. Chris Wilder was able to coach the Premiership’s fourth-most stifling defense but the lack of attacking punch will prove to be the Blades’ undoing yet again this upcoming season. Manager Ralph Hasenhüttl turned things around for the seemingly relegation-bound Saints last season with help from the star turn of Danny Ings, who scored 22 goals in the league. Ings’ rise as a proven goalscorer ensures that his club is comfortably mid-table with the potential to rise as a top-half team. Under manager Sean Dyche, Burnley has become a mid-table mainstay and unless they become absolutely ravaged by injuries, this season should prove to be more of the same After 16 years of toiling away from the first division of English football, Leeds is finally back in the Premiership. Leeds has the potential to be this year version of Sheffield United – a ragtag crew of hard-working players coached by one of the most brilliant minds in football in Marcelo Bielsa. Acquiring Callum Wilson was a necessary move to cover for Joelinton who had a nightmare of a season. The Brazilian, who acquired for €44.00 million, only scored two goals last season in the Premier League. Wilson, who scored 14 goals in the 18/19 Premier League season with Bournemouth, will complement wingers Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron perfectly in attack. The signing of Eberechi Eze from Queens Park Rangers and the acquisition of Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea to flank Wilfried Zaha will supply Palace with a jolt of creativity and quality in attack. After posting the league’s second most-inept attack last season with only 31 goals, Palace’s solid acquisitions supplies it with just enough goals to supplement a solid, if uninspiring, defense. Graham Potter’s squad is made up of hard-working, gritty players as Brighton continues to look like one of the most physical teams in the Prem. The addition of experienced midfielder Adam Lallana and the continued emergence of last year’s additions Neil Maupay and Leandro Trossard will help clinch Brighton’s safety for the fourth straight season.  Villa will be in the middle of yet another relegation battle this season.  Nonetheless, it has the quality to stay up by the slimmest of margins with the addition of Ollie Watkins from Brentford and the expected signing of goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez from Arsenal. Jack Grealish remains with the club to pull the strings in midfield as Villa looks toward an extended run in the Premier League.  The controversy around the club’s sale of talented youngster Diangana could prove to be a disaster to the squad morale. Even captain Mark Noble voiced out his displeasure with the club after the sale of the 19-year-old Congolese winger.  Discontent with how the club is being run may lead to a slow start from which West Ham couldn’t recover. Bringing in an experienced keeper in the World Cup-winning Alphonse Areola was a shrewd move to secure the team in between the sticks.  However, the fate of this side will be no different from their 18/19 Premier League campaign unless manager Scott Parker somehow fortifies a defense that saw the club leak the most goals in its last season in the top flight. Bringing back Matheus Pereira on a permanent transfer and staging the transfer coup of Grady Diangana from West Ham were good moves from West Brom.  Pereira, in particular, notched 20 assists last season for the club and his creativity will be instrumental in its bid to stay in the Prem. However, coming straight from the second division, West Brom just hasn’t done enough in the market to bolster the squad to avoid relegation. – Jedd Pagaduan/Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/travel-and-food/discount-grabfood-restaurants-2","title":"Get up to P100 discount from these GrabFood restaurants","date":"Jun 11, 2020 2:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Use these codes to get free delivery and discounts on Bacolod Chicken Inasal, 8Cuts, Conti’s Bakeshop and Restaurant, and more","body":"These days, the only way to get to your favorite restaurants is to order in.

The 16-time Grand Slam champion captured his fifth Paris Masters title on Sunday, November 4, with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Denis Shapovalov, but will be usurped by the injured Rafael Nadal at the top of the rankings on Monday. Nadal said he will fight until it is \"impossible\" to be fit for the start of the season-ending championships on November 10. If the Spaniard does not play or fails to win a round-robin match at the Finals, Djokovic must claim two group-stage victories and make the final to pass him. Djokovic would also be sure of the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal does not reach the semifinals. \"There's always a chance that I win all my matches in London, that I play well. I have done it in the past, and I like playing there,\" said the 32-year-old, who has won 5 ATP Finals titles. \"But it's [an] extremely difficult task considering who my opponents are going to be.\" \"You're playing [a] top 10 player every single match.

Djokovic not slowing down Djokovic has enjoyed yet another fantastic season, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon among his 5 titles. That looked a long way off when his comeback from a long-standing elbow injury suffered a setback last year with a shock French Open quarterfinal defeat by Italian Marco Cecchinato. But he has since added 5 major titles, having also claimed the 2018 Wimbledon and US Open crowns. Djokovic – who is closing in on Nadal, who has 19, and Federer, with 20, on the all-time list of Grand Slam titles – says he is hoping to play on for as many years as possible. \"I would like to play tennis for a long time. I don't know how long that is going to be, but I wish to really play pretty long.\" \"So hopefully you'll be seeing me around for many more years.\" Djokovic's victory on Sunday delivered his 34th Masters title and his 77th on the ATP Tour in total. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/queer-eye-season-3-trailer","title":"WATCH: Grab the tissues, the ’Queer Eye’ season 3 trailer is here","date":"Mar 5, 2019 2:11 PM PHT","snippet":"And it’s set to Carly Rae Jepsen’s newest single, no less","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A new season of Queer Eye is right around the corner, and if the recently-released new trailer is anything to go by, fans will be getting another tear-jerker of a season as the Fab 5 works their magic in a new destination: Kansas City, Missouri.

The 100 meters world record-holder, who is bidding for a professional contract, recovered from a painful kick in the groin to grab a double against Macarthur South West United in Sydney. Bolt, 32, finished with his left foot after some slack marking on 55 minutes, celebrating with his trademark \"Lightning Bolt\" pose. The Jamaican then capitalized on a defensive mix-up to score his second on 69 minutes before being substituted 6 minutes later with the score at 4-0. It was the first game Bolt has started since joining the A-League club in August for an indefinite trial. \"I'm just happy that I got a chance and I'm proud of myself,\" Bolt told host broadcaster Fox Sports after the game. \"It was a big deal... first start and scoring two goals. It was a good feeling. This is what I worked towards. I try to get better and I am on the way to doing that.\" Bolt said he had a \"lot more to learn\" and was keen to join the Mariners on a professional contract. \"I'm keen, that's why I'm here to play my best and to try and get into the team,\" he added.

Bolt appeared to appeal for game time, saying he would improve as he gained more understanding of his teammates and what they wanted. He has previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway to no avail.

(READ: A painful homecoming for Marawi evacuees) On Thursday, Del Rosario presented government plans for the former battle area in a big TFBM meeting in Iligan City. The subcommittees also presented their plans for the development of the rest of Marawi City.   Del Rosario sought to ease fears that the government would grab residents' land to make way for a new military camp and other facilities it wants to build.   Here are excertps from the interview. Rappler: There are residents who are worried they will lose their land. Del Rosario: That [fear] is not valid. There is no basis for that. Walang lupang kukunin. Kung mayroon kang lupa, titled, that is yours. Ang maapektuhan lang naman dito kapag nagkaroon ng expansion ang mga kalsada. (Property owners will get affected only where road expansions will be done.) But if you have titled property outside the roads, then that is yours. We will not touch it.   There are a lot of concerns. That is speculation.   What will happen to the former battle area? It will be developed. We will undertake horizontal as well as vertical rehabilitation. We are talking about widening the road nets so that when they return it will be better, and we will paying for the right of way for the expansion of the roads. For titled and non-titled properties occupied by residents, it will not be touched by the government.   There’s no reason to fear that from happening? The fear of government taking over their lands or titled property has no basis at all.   How about those who have problematic titles?  It should be resolved by the community themselves. By their allegation, they have been there since time immemorial. We will recognize it. As long as there is a peaceful environment, there is acceptance among the community that this Juan dela Cruz is the rightful owner, then so be it. We will be very compassionate, very understanding.     It is clear who own the lots inside battle area. There is no confusion. It's one of the issues we need to address so that [when there are] different claimants in one particular lot, we can settle once and for all who is the rightful owners. We anticipate that there’ll be issues, and we are creating a land dispute arbitration committee. The subcommittee can specifically identify conflict areas or conflict titles. Will residents be allowed to reconstruct their homes? Yes, they will be the ones to reconstruct their homes. We will not be constructing them. We will only construct public facilities. Private facilities, private bulidings, commercial buildings, they’ll be the ones to construct it. We will only construct public facilities.   In the former battle area? Yes, in the MAA (most affected area).   There is confusion. It’s about time that you tell that.   There were pronouncements about the goverment building condominiums inside the former battle area.  It will be built on government land, where there would be renters or [where there are people] who would like to avail [of it]. If they do not like it, there is no problem.   How about families who want help to clear their lots of debris? We will clear it. Clearing alone would cost P2.5 billion, clearing all these debris.   How about the military camp? Will it displace residents? Actually it's the private properties which have encroached into a military reservation. Let’s look at it that way. That is about 6,000 hectares military reservation, and 2,000 of the 6,000 are inside Marawi City. The military is now willing just to retain 50 hectares. All the rest can be given to legal claimants.     How about the new camp (not the existing 103rd Brigade headquarters)? The new camp is about 10 hectares only. The military is buying [from] legitimate owners. If they do not like to sell, we will not of course have it. But, in my understanding, the owners are willing to sell it.   How were residents consulted when the plans were made? Our consultation process is very, very exhaustive. So far I have conducted more than 50 consultations and, starting yesterday, our teams are conducting continous consultations until April 25.   Residents agree with the plans as presented? The teams are presenting to the different sectors, the clan owners, the barangay officials, the local government units, the academe, the youth. All sectors. They will engage and conduct a focus group discussion per sector.   What is the purpose of the continuing consultation?  It is for the rehabilitation of the MAA, so that we can identify already the specific locations as to where the conventions will be put up, the historical sites that will be maintained, the barangay hall, the health centres, the madrassahs that will be constructed. We would like to specify where these public facilities will be constructed.   You are very positive. What is the biggest challenge?   I don’t think there will be challenges that we cannot address because consultation is the key. We have the resolve to ensure that this rehabilitation will be much, much better, as promised by the President. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/personal-data-national-privacy-comission-ltfrb-uber","title":"No migration of personal data to Grab in Uber app shutdown – privacy commission","date":"Apr 6, 2018 4:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines head Brian Cu says the only data shared by Uber is driver data –\n which will only be available once the driver has given his consent","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Fret not, your personal data on the ride-hailing app Uber will not be migrated to Grab.

It is unclear how the PNP has followed through with the project ever since their return to the anti-narcotics campaign.  How can they help? As road safety marshalls, the 500 Grab drivers are expected to report any irregularity they see while plying Metro Manila roads. These irregularities include road obstructions and unruly drivers along major roads, and shootings committed by motorcycle-riding suspects in narrow streets.

The 78th-ranked Dane birdied 3 of the last 5 holes to fire a four-under-par 67 at Quail Hollow, one stroke ahead of US Open winner Brooks Koepka and his fellow Americans Gary Woodland and Grayson Murray. \"I just felt like I was playing nicely,\" Olesen said. \"The first 15 holes I played really well. I putted very nice.\" World number two Spieth, who won his third major title at last month's British Open, struggled with his putter in firing a 72. At 24, he would become the youngest on the career Slam list by winning the Wanamaker Trophy this week. \"Tee to green it was pretty solid,\" Spieth said. \"On the green was the problem. My speed and lines were a little off.\" Spieth, who also won the 2015 Masters and US Open, can become only the sixth man to sweep the four current major titles in a career after Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen. Koepka, who captured his first major title in June at Erin Hills, had 5 birdies and two bogeys, the last at 16 to fall back. He has again peaked at the right time, he said. \"These are the events where you want to play your best,\" Koepka said of majors. \"Sometimes it's a lot simpler than people think.

His most recent of four career European Tour victories came at last year's Turkish Airlines Open. But he is fighting to keep the excitement and pressure well managed. Olesen sank a seven-foot birdie putt at the second, missed the green and made bogey at the par-3 sixth, then birdied the par-5 seventh by two-putting from 60 feet and the par-4 eighth on a 15-footer from the fringe. He birdied the 14th from 12 feet and the par-5 15th after chipping to three feet, then missed the green and took bogey at the par-3 17th only to seize the solo lead with his longest putt of the day. 'A little disappointing' Spieth, who began on the back nine, birdied the par-5 15th but found a greenside bunker at 16 and missed a 14-foot par putt, then missed 10-foot par putts at the first fifth and par-3 sixth holes. Spieth answered with birdies from three feet at the par-5 seventh and inches from the cup at the par-4 eighth. \"It was a day that should have been a couple under par and ended one-over,\" Spieth said. \"It's a little disappointing but I brought it back with a couple birdies to at least having a chance going forward.\" Spieth was in the early feature group with Koepka and the year's other major winner, Spain's Sergio Garcia, the Masters champion. Murray, a home-state hopeful who struck the opening shot at the year's last major tournament, birdied 3 of the last 6 holes. \"I've got to keep putting myself in position to make gains,\" Murray said. \"You can't miss the fairways.\" 'A good turnaround' Day, who had 4 bogeys in the first 12 holes, rallied with two birdies and an eagle in the last 5 to finish on 70. \"It was a good turnaround,\" Day said. \"It's challenging tee to green but on the greens it's very hard and very fast. If you don't get yourself in position it's hard to make par.\" Among afternoon starters, fourth-ranked Rory McIlroy was level par after four holes and South Korean An Byeong-Hun was three-under through five after opening on the back nine with 3 consecutive birdies.

At past 3am Tuesday, May 10, Robredo snatched the top spot in the vice presidential race by a slim margin of at least 500 votes.  “While the country is sleeping, we have seen a steep degree of his lead from one million to now trailing by 500 votes,” Marcos’ campaign adviser told reporters in a briefing. Dela Cruz wants the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to provide their camp a breakdown of the votes, stressing that the surge of votes for Robredo “came out of the blue.” “We do not know where these votes are coming from,” he also said.  Asked what would be their camp’s next action, dela Cruz implied that they will call on the Comelec to stop releasing the unofficial results. “The unofficial count may confuse the public because we have an official count, and if the unofficial count doesn’t tally with the official count” there will be a problem, said dela Cruz. Marcos’ confidence on winning the elections slowly eroded Monday evening when he said he did not have a “comfortable lead” over Robredo. He said that he will only be relieved when he takes his oath, noting that it has been hard to identify the source of votes transmitted. His camp said that based on reports, they are uncertain what specific areas or provinces are the votes coming from. The son and namesake of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was leading the race by over a hundred thousand when transmission of results began just minutes after the polls closed at 5pm Monday, May 9. By the middle of the transmission, the margin grew by almost a million until it again shrank to a few hundred thousand.

Menteri Koperasi dan UKM, Anak Agung Gede Ngurah (AAGN) Puspayoga di kantor Kementerian Koperasi dan UKM di Jakarta menyerahkan akta pendirian badan hukum koperasi PRRI. \"Dengan adanya badan hukum tersebut, saya mengharapkan polemik seputar angkutan darat beraplikasi teknologi bisa segera diakhiri,\" kata Puspayoga pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Dia menyebut, pada dasarnya hal yang menjadi permasalahan saat ini bukan terletak kepada aplikasi online. Tetapi, pada badan hukumnya. Oleh sebab itu, perusahaan angkutan umum darat menganggap pihak lain tidak memenuhi aturan yang berlaku. \"Nah, dengan badan hukum koperasi ini, para pengemudi pun sudah memiliki payung hukum. Mereka sudah bisa melakukan uji KIR (uji kendaraan) melalui koperasi,\" kata dia. Selain itu, Puspayoga melanjutkan, dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, maka para anggotanya sudah bisa menikmati berbagai kemudahan dari pemerintah, antara lain fasilitas akses kredit usaha rakyat (KUR) dan Lembaga Pengelola Dana Bergulir (LPDB) KUMKM dengan suku bunga rendah. \"Kredit itu bisa untuk uang muka mobil, misalnya. Kredit Rp25 juta tidak perlu memakai agunan yang bisa dinikmati oleh anggota koperasi,\" tutur dia. Sementara, Ketua Koperasi Jasa PRRI, Ponco Seno menjelaskan, selama ini pengusaha rental mobil umumnya terafiliasi dengan aplikasi transportasi berbasis online seperti GrabCar dan Uber tidak memiliki badan hukum. \"Dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, artinya kita sudah memiliki wadah secara resmi untuk menjalankan usaha sewa mobil, termasuk yang menggunakan aplikasi teknologi. Kita disatukan dalam satu wadah koperasi,\" kata Ponco. Saat ini, jumlah anggota koperasi PRRI sudah mencapai 5.000 orang. Proses pengajuan badan hukum koperasi itu bahkan sudah berjalan sejak Oktober 2015. \"Dasar kami berbadan hukum koperasi adalah memenuhi ketentuan UU Nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang angkutan umum. Jadi, GrabCar sudah mengikuti aturan pemerintah untuk menjalankan bisnis transportasi di Indonesia,\" kata dia. Manfaat lainnya yang diperoleh anggota koperasi yakni mereka mendapat fasilitas asuransi jiwa bagi pengemudi, ada pool bengkel bagi sekitar 300 unit dan bekerja sama dengan ATPM untuk perawatan kendaraan. Tidak ada izin Sebelumnya, Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan mengatakan mengukung keberadaan transportasi berbasis aplikasi online. Namun, dia mempermasalahkan baik GrabCar dan Uber tidak mengantongi izin. Izin yang disampaikan kepada Kementerian Perhubungan adalah keduanya masuk kategori perusahaan Teknologi Informasi (TI). \"Itu saja, bukan (kami mempermasalahkan) soal onlinenya. Online sangat bagus, kami mendukung. Cuma hingga saat ini, baik Grab dan Uber mengaku mereka IT provider. Itu pun betul, kami tidak menyalahkan mereka,\" ujar Jonan yang ditemui di Istana Negara pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan GrabCar pun bukan dikategorikan untuk kendaraan umum baik itu taksi atau kendaraan sewa. Soal Uber dan GrabCar yang sudah tergabung dalam koperasi, dia turut mengaku belum menerima laporan itu. \"Saya kok ga terima laporan itu ada izinnya. Kalau sudah masuk koperasi ya diajukan izinnya atas nama koperasi,\" kata mantan Direktur PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) itu. Pihak GrabCar yang dihubungi Rappler mengatakan belum ingin berkomentar mengenai masuknya perusahaan mereka ke dalam koperasi. Sedangkan, pihak Uber tidak mengangkat telepon Rappler hari ini. Pada hari Senin kemarin, ribuan pengendara angkutan darat berunjuk rasa di dekat Istana Negara dan menuntut agar pemerintah menutup segera aplikasi online yang digunakan oleh GrabCar dan Uber. Para demonstran yang didominasi oleh sopir taksi itu mengeluh sejak kehadiran transportasi berbasis aplikasi online, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Para sopir taksi menuding transportasi berbasis aplikasi online bisa memberlakukan tarif murah karena tidak membayar pajak dan memiliki izin operasional di Indonesia. - dengan laporan ANTARA/Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/george-clooney-uk-sandwich-shop-help-homeless","title":"George Clooney grabs bite at UK sandwich shop helping homeless","date":"Nov 12, 2015 10:45 PM PHT","snippet":"The actor makes a stop at The Social Bite cafe, which allows customers to pre-pay for a meal which will later be given to a homeless person","body":"LONDON, UK – Movie star George Clooney dropped into a sandwich shop staffed by people who used to be homeless in Scotland's capital Edinburgh Thursday, November 12.

Indeed, going against the grain requires a great deal of discipline and courage. But here’s the problem: investing in startups has never been more popular in Asia, resulting in a lot of noise as to which opportunities are best for investment, says David Corbin, director of content strategy at Tech in Asia, at its annual Tokyo conference. Citing Tech in Asia data, David describes how the region is seeing massive increases in funding. At just US$6 billion in 2013, the aggregate amount rose to US$25 billion in 2014. It’s on track to hit US$45 billion in 2015. The number of industries with more than US$1 billion in funding has soared too. Only e-commerce surpassed that amount two years back, but in 2015, 12 industries are slated to surpass that ceiling. What’s staggering is how many of Asia’s unicorns – startups with over US$1 billion in valuation – arose soon after the financial crisis in 2008. Tokopedia and Flipkart, ecommerce leaders in Indonesia and India respectively, were started in 2009. Korea’s online shopping leader Coupang, transportation app Ola, and Japanese news aggregator SmartNews got off the ground the year after. Then, 2011 saw the launch of taxi app GrabTaxi, online groceries site RedMart, and WeChat. These companies saw their growth accelerate and their valuations soar in subsequent years. Industries in Asia benefitting most from the funding boom are payments, media, and education. Payments was at US$29 million in 2013. It’ll reach US$248 million in 2015. Media is set to soar from US$20 million to US$456 million this year. Education will see growth from US$57 million to an expected US$1.5 billion. Let’s turn to sectors that aren’t so hot anymore. Virtual currency is stagnant, while productivity software is expected to get only US$7 million this year. “There are a million Slack clones out there, many of which are annoyed at being Slack clones because they’ve existed for five years already,” says David. While gaming has grown from US$161 million in 2013 to a projected US$436 million this year, it has actually slid from the seventh most-funded vertical in 2013 and could wind up 21st this year. “Gaming is hard. It’s hard to create hit after hit after hit,” says David. Keys to success So here’s the dilemma: with all these data in our hands, how do we decide which verticals to back, and hence increase our chances of creating or backing an impactful startup? Speaking of hot sectors like media, education, and payments, blindly getting into these industries may not be a good idea since there’s a likelihood of falling into the trap of conventional wisdom. So the best way to go about it would be to follow what Tokopedia or GrabTaxi did: get into an industry just early enough to ride on a rising wave. While that alone may be sufficient in the past, things are changing. More Silicon Valley companies are seeing Asia as a lucrative market, and are making concerted efforts to tackle it early. Uber, Stripe, and Github are just some examples. The trick is to seize opportunities that put a premium on localization, giving Asia-first startups a huge advantage over Silicon Valley. Defensibility and secret knowledge is the name of the game. Logistics and healthcare are examples of industries that will see the next Asian unicorns, given how the environments in Asian countries differ from the US and from each other. In Southeast Asia, we’re seeing companies big and small rising up to meet the demand spike for e-commerce deliveries. Due to the regulatory and infrastructure challenges in the region, it’ll be hard for competitors from the West to make a dent. The goal, therefore, isn’t just to build a unicorn. “It’s to build a unicorn that can go to war,” says David. – Rappler.com This story first appeared in Tech in Asia, the online community for Asia’s technology and startup ecosystem."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/volleyball/vleague-2015-nu-pounces-ust-semifinals-slot","title":"NU pounces on UST’s slow start to grab semifinals ticket","date":"Aug 30, 2015 7:42 PM PHT","snippet":"Guest player Dindin Santiago-Manabat had another solid showing with 10 spikes and 3 blocks for 13 points","body":"MANILA, Philippines – National University smelled blood from the beginning and instinct kicked in as they swept University of Santo Tomas, 25-22, 25-23, 25-11, to barge into the semifinals of the Shakey's V-League 12 Collegiate Conference on Sunday, August 30 at the FilOil Flying V Arena in San Juan. Guest player Dindin Santiago-Manabat had another solid showing with 10 spikes and 3 blocks for 13 points to lead the Lady Bulldogs to a 5-1 carryover record at second place. Myla Pablo, whom head coach Roger Gorayeb urged to assert herself more during the game, did not disappoint with 11 points including key attacks in the second set that overturned the Tigresses' brief advantage. Jaja Santiago and Jorelle Singh chipped in 10 points apiece. \"Our attacks,\" Manabat answered in Filipino when asked what NU did right against UST. \"We weren't able to execute what we trained for yesterday in terms of service and receive but we made up for it with our attacks.\" The Tigresses, known to be a moody squad on the court, were hesitant from the first serve and displayed their so-called diesel engine tendencies. Playing cautious and gauging their foes at first may have worked for other opponents but against the experienced Lady Bulldogs, it simply spelled disaster. NU quickly created separation and kept UST within a 5-point distance. But they allowed the Espanya crew to close in towards the end of the first set, which gave the Tigresses momentum entering the second to take control of the lead. UST looked more energetic in the second frame but consecutive errors midway, however, opened the door for NU to climb back and build a 2-0 lead. The Tigresses were completely depleted by the third set as the Lady Bulldogs raced to a 4-0 early edge marked by running attacks and well-placed drop balls that found the many holes of UST's floor defense. The Tigresses found themselves stuck at 10 points in the third set and never recovered. Carmela Tunay had 8 points while Pam Lastimosa added 7 in UST's losing effort as they slipped to a 4-2 carryover card tied with Far Eastern University. NU will try to put a dent on Ateneo's undefeated record next week. \"We will focus on each and every one of them,\" Manabat said of their next match against the Alyssa Valdez-led Lady Eagles. \"They all can score.

Justine Dorog exploded for 20 points while Isa Molde and Diana Carlos contributed 14 and 12 points, respectively. Marian Buitre added 11 points in a victory that saw the Lady Maroons finish off the Lady Blazers in straight sets after dropping the first.

This was a day before the LTFRB starts its clampdown on unregistered Internet application-based transport systems. The regulator will impose a fine of P200,000 ($4,283.68) and vehicle impoundment of 3 months for operators who are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise. In May, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. “There is a need to delineate and clarify the various transportation policies pertaining to the different transport administration components such as planning, policy making, data management, and enforcement,” Aquino, chairman of the Senate Committee on Trade, Commerce, and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement. “The main challenge of the different government agencies and offices is to align their rules and regulations, as well as policies, in order to solve the worsening traffic conditions in Metro Manila,” the senator added. Lack of communication In his resolution, Aquino said the lack of communication between the DOTC and LTFRB underscores a National Center for Transportation Studies report. This, according to the senator, shows the inability to coordinate overlapping functions among transportation and traffic related units of the national and local government. “The department order was issued in response to the call of Uber, GrabTaxi, other similar Internet application-based transportation networks, and the public to recognize this innovative technology and be able to operate legally,” Aquino said. “Let us continue supporting emerging industries and new business models, especially in our public transportation system that will enhance competition and provide better service to our fellow Filipinos,” he added. On Wednesday, August 19, LTFRB authorized US-based Uber as the second company in the Philippines to operate under new rules governing application-based ride-sharing service providers. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) GrabCar secured its accreditation as TNC in July. (READ: GrabCar becomes Philippines' first authorized ride-sharing app)  Despite the accreditation, Uber and GrabCar partners will still have to apply for TNVS franchise. Sought for comment, Uber spokesperson Karun Arya said in an email: \"We are committed to ensuring every one of our thousands of partner-drivers fulfill all the requirements under the TNC/TNVS regulations issued in May.\" TNVS applications of Uber partners, according to Arya, are now being submitted on a daily basis to LTFRB.  \"Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners' TNVS application submissions,” Arya said. \"Many of our partner-drivers depend on Uber for a living, and we are working with them to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB; to ensure all driver partners are fully accredited,” he added. – Rappler.com $1 = P46.69"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/ojek-tradisional-membenci-gojek-grabbike","title":"Mengapa ojek tradisional membenci Go-Jek dan GrabBike","date":"Jul 24, 2015 2:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Apa inti permasalahannya? Dan mengapa Go-Jek berekspansi dengan posisi yang belum solid?","body":"Saat ini ada banyak aksi protes menentang perusahaan yang menggunakan teknologi untuk mengubah bisnis transportasi tradisional, dan entah kebetulan atau tidak, protes ini terjadi di seluruh dunia. Layanan booking transportasi Uber adalah yang paling sering menjadi sasaran masalah ini. Dengan aplikasi Uber, semua pemilik mobil bisa menjadi “supir taksi” dadakan, menjemput penumpang yang ada di dekat mereka, dan mengantarkan mereka sampai tujuan dengan upah yang sesuai. Tapi, supir taksi konvensional merasa model bisnis mereka terancam akibat kehadiran Uber. Di Prancis, supir taksi bahkan turun ke jalan dan melakukan demo anarkis untuk menentang Uber. Uber di Indonesia juga mengalami masalah. Tapi dalam bulan ini, konflik antara pengemudi aplikasi ojek pesanan seperti Go-Jek dan GrabBike dengan pengemudi ojek pangkalan rasanya jauh lebih panas daripada yang dialami Uber. Sejumlah orang yang mengatas namakan pengemudi ojek bekerja sama, memasang banner, dan menggunakan taktik intimidasi untuk mencegah Go-Jek dan GrabBike masuk ke area tertentu.  Ojek sebagai moda transportasi Ojek adalah moda transportasi yang ada hampir di seluruh sudut kota Jakarta yang terkenal dengan kondisi lalu lintasnya yang buruk. Ojek bisa ditemukan di tiap sudut jalan. Pengemudi ojek juga tidak perlu menjalani pemeriksaan atau pendaftaran apapun. Pembayarannya dilakukan secara tunai, dan tarifnya tergantung dari tawar menawar. Ojek terkesan tidak aman, dan helm yang mereka sediakan biasanya tidak bersih. Proses tawar menawarnya juga kadang menjengkelkan. Intinya, ojek adalah moda transportasi yang disukai sekaligus dibenci, tapi sangat diandalkan oleh orang banyak di kawasan rawan macet seperti Jakarta. Go-Jek sebenarnya sudah ada sejak beberapa tahun lalu dan ingin memperbaiki transportasi ojek dengan menciptakan armada ojek yang aman dan terpercaya. Tapi baru di awal tahun ini Go-Jek meluncurkan aplikasi mobile-nya dan mulai serius mengembangkan jaringan pengemudi ojeknya. Melalui aplikasi ini, pengguna bisa memesan ojek dan tidak perlu mencarinya lagi di jalan. Pengemudi Go-Jek juga bisa dinilai berdasarkan pengalaman perjalanan yang dialami. Pengemudi Go-Jek ini juga sudah terdaftar, melewati proses pemeriksaan, dan selalu menyediakan helm yang bersih dan masker ke tiap penumpang.  Di bulan Juni, GrabTaxi dari Malaysia meluncurkan layanan yang mirip di Jakarta dan diberi nama GrabBike. Tapi, karena muncul lebih awal, Go-Jek masih lebih unggul dan membuat mereka sedikit lebih disorot di konflik ini. Dalam waktu singkat, masyarakat Jakarta sangat menerima layanan seperti Go-Jek dan GrabBike ini, karena keduanya membuat moda transportasi yang tidak formal tapi dibutuhkan ini menjadi lebih bisa dipercaya. Pengemudi ojek juga banyak yang memanfaatkan momen, dan Go-Jek mengklaim bahwa mereka sudah punya lebih dari 2.500 pengemudi terdaftar, dan helm dan jaket hijau khas mereka sudah sering dijumpai di jalan-jalan kota Jakarta. Saya memesan Go-Jek hampir tiap hari dan sering mengajak pengemudinya ngobrol. Sejauh ini hampir semuanya (minus satu orang) yang mengaku penghasilannya meningkat sejak bergabung dengan Go-Jek. Satu orang yang mengaku penghasilannya tidak berubah pun tetap merasa aplikasi ini berguna karena memudahkannya menemukan penumpang. Lantas, kenapa layanan ini ditentang oleh beberapa pengemudi ojek? Kebanyakan masyarakat Jakarta melihat tindakan mereka sebagai sesuatu yang “terbelakang” dan mulai mempertanyakan kesiapan kota besar ini untuk menerima inovasi dari teknologi. Konfliknya Kalibata City, sebuah kompleks apartemen besar di Jakarta Selatan, tampaknya menjadi titik paling panas. Penghuninya yang berjumlah ribuan membuat tempat ini cukup menguntungkan, dan tiap lima gerbang masuk utamanya punya pojokan dengan pengemudi ojek yang nongkrong, siap menunggu penumpang. Tapi, banner di pohon dan pagar memperlihatkan bahwa Go-Jek dan GrabBike tidak diterima di wilayah ini.  Pengemudi ojek di Kalibata City cukup blak-blakan dengan penolakan (atau kebencian) mereka terhadap aplikasi seperti Go-Jek dan GrabBike. Mereka bahkan muncul di koran dan TV, yang membuat saya dan rekan saya memilih tempat ini untuk bertemu dengan pengemudi ojek dan mencari tahu motif mereka. Well, begitu kami mulai mendekati mereka, kami langsung melihat sebuah keributan. Satpam berseragam dari kompleks apartemen dan seorang pengemudi ojek berjalan mendekati pengemudi Go-Jek dan mengusirnya. Pemandangan ini sedikit sulit dipercaya, karena direkam oleh kru media dengan kamera video yang ada di depan gerbang utama. Ketika kami bertanya apakah ini dilakukan untuk sebuah acara TV, mereka malah tidak tahu atau bahkan tidak peduli akan keberadaan kamera itu. Beberapa hari sebelum tulisan ini dibuat, sejumlah sudut jalan yang menjadi jalur mereka sudah sering didatangi oleh media, dan mereka sudah terbiasa dengan semua ini. Kami berbincang dengan tiga pengemudi ojek — yang bernama Maman, Marto, dan Solas — yang mangkal di sudut jalan itu. Ketiganya memang mau mempertahankan wilayah mereka dan bahkan mengeluarkan dan memegang sebuah banner untuk kami foto. “Go-Jek merusak usaha kami,” kata Marto memulai percakapan. Inti Permasalahannya Awalnya, pengemudi Go-Jek datang hanya untuk menjemput dan menurunkan penumpang di gerbang, layaknya yang dilakukan pengemudi ojek biasa, jelas Marto. Tapi, bukannya langsung pergi, mereka kemudian mulai “singgah di dalam kompleks apartemen selama tiga atau lima menit” untuk mencari penumpang. Jumlah penumpang yang diperoleh Marto dan rekan-rekannya akhirnya berkurang sampai hanya seperempatnya. Saat itulah pengemudi ojek dari kelima gerbang bekerja sama untuk mengambil tindakan. Mereka mengirimkan perwakilan ke pihak pengelola manajemen untuk meminta dukungan, dan mereka akhirnya memasang banner. Mereka bahkan membuat kebijakan yang spesifik: Meski begitu, situasinya tetap tegang, karena beberapa pengemudi Go-Jek menyembunyikan helm dan membalik jaket mereka agar tidak ketahuan. Mereka kemudian terus berusaha masuk ke kompleks apartemen ini. “Upaya mereka membalik jaket hanya membuat ini memburuk,” kata Marto. Kemarahan mereka sudah tertimbun dan berbuah munculnya beragam makian yang cukup menyakitkan telinga. Saat bergabung bukanlah sebuah pilihan Cerita pengemudi Go-Jek diancam, ditindas, atau dikejar sudah sering muncul di media sosial. Pengguna akhirnya khawatir akan keselamatan pengemudi Go-Jek yang sekarang sangat diandalkan ini. Go-Jek sendiri sudah memberikan pernyataan terkait masalah ini, yang juga menyebar di media sosial. Go-Jek mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak ingin bersaing dengan pengemudi ojek konvensional. Mereka bahkan mengundang para pengemudi ojek ini untuk bergabung. “Dengan dukungan teknologi, kami membantu para pengendara untuk mendapatkan lebih banyak order dan menerima lebih banyak penghasilan. […] Kami membekali para driverdengan santunan kecelakaan dan asuransi kesehatan,” jelas pernyataan tersebut. Tapi bagi pengemudi ojek seperti Marto, Maman, dan Solas; bergabung dengan Go-Jek bukanlah sebuah pilihan. Penolakan mereka berdasar dari alasan yang sebagian tidak rasional, tapi sebagian juga cukup logis. Satu faktor lain — yang tidak disebutkan tapi bisa saja mengambil peranan — adalah sistem seleksi untuk bergabung dengan Go-Jek. Calon pengemudi yang mendaftar harus memperlihatkan SIM, STNK, dan dokumen legal lain seperti KTP. Pengemudi ojek juga harus berusia di bawah 55 tahun, padahal banyak pengemudi ojek — termasuk Marto dan Solas — yang usianya lebih tua. Banyak yang kesulitan menyediakan dokumen legal ini, karena motor mereka bisa saja pemberian, titipan, atau pinjaman orang lain atau masih dalam proses cicilan, yang berarti dokumennya belum lengkap. Kenyataan bahwa ojek memang tidak pernah terdaftar atau diawasi oleh pemerintah membuat profesi ini adalah salah satu pilihan untuk mereka yang tidak memiliki dokumen legal atau tidak bisa melakukan pekerjaan berat karena masalah usia. Pihak Go-Jek sendiri tidak memberi komentar ketika kami hubungi. Kami menanyakan berapa banyak laporan kejadian mengancam atau kekerasan yang mereka terima, apakah mereka mengeluarkan peringatan untuk area tertentu ke pengemudi mereka, dan apakah mereka sudah mencoba bertemu dan berunding dengan perwakilan asosiasi pengemudi ojek. E-mail kami tidak dijawab selama beberapa hari, telepon kami melalui handphone pun tidak diangkat, dan nomor layanan mereka terus sibuk. Tampaknya Go-Jek memilih untuk menunggu konfliknya reda, paling tidak selama masih bisa dikendalikan dan tidak menimbulkan masalah yang lebih besar. Berekspansi dengan posisi yang belum solid? Go-Jek tampaknya sibuk mengatasi masalah lain. Sejak munculnya GrabBike, yang merupakan bagian dari GrabTaxi, Go-Jek mengadapi saingan berat di negaranya sendiri. GrabTaxi minggu ini mengumumkan bahwa GrabBike mereka sudah mencatat 500.000 pesanan hanya dalam waktu dua bulan beroperasi di Jakarta. Go-Jek yang baru menawarkan layanan pesanan melalui aplikasi mobile sejak bulan Januari baru mencatat angka sejuta pesanan di awal bulan ini. Meskipun promosi tarif Rp 10.000 dari Go-Jek terbilang menggiurkan, GrabBike tidak mau kalah dan mengeluarkan promo tarif Rp 5.000 untuk semua perjalanan di Jakarta. GrabBike bisa melakukan ini karena perusahaan induk mereka memiliki investasi sebesar $340 juta (sekitar Rp 4 triliun) untuk berekspansi ke Asia Tenggara. Sementara Go-Jek tampaknya menerima investasi dari NSI Ventures dalam jumlah yang dirahasiakan. Berapa lama Go-Jek bisa bertahan di perang tarif ini dan terus memberi subsidi para pengemudinya untuk menarik pengguna baru tentu menjadi pertanyaan yang menarik.  Go-Jek juga bergerak dengan cepat dan mengembangkan layanannya dengan tidak hanya melayani jasa angkut penumpang, tapi juga mengantar paket dan makanan, serta belanja. Tapi Go-Jek mungkin mengembangkan diri ketika masih belum solid — media sosialnya penuh dengan keluhan tentang gangguan pada aplikasi dan sistem kredit serta laporan gagal mendapat pengemudi yang mengambil pesanan.   Setelah masa penuh promo Dari sudut pandang penumpang, Go-Jek adalah layanan yang menarik, tapi masih belum sempurna. Kenyataannya, pesanan kadang ditolak, dan menentukan tempat penjemputan biasanya tidak mudah meskipun ada GPS untuk memandu, dan sistem alamat Jakarta yang aneh tentu membuat masalahnya semakin rumit. Berdasarkan logika pasar, hanya masalah waktu sebelum penumpang dan pengemudi ojek tradisional membiasakan diri dengan sistem baru ini, dan kemudian sistem pemesanan lewat aplikasi ini akan menjadi norma yang umum. Lagipula, efisiensi ekonomi yang ditawarkan sistem aplikasi ini tentu menguntungkan bagi kedua pihak. Meski begitu, kecuali kualitas layanan dan ketersediaan pengemudinya ditingkatkan dengan cepat, masyarakat Jakarta mungkin tidak akan selamanya setia dengan Go-Jek dan layanan serupa setelah fase promo tarif murah ini berakhir. Untuk yang nyaman dengan sistem ojek informal, keluar ke jalan dan mencari ojek terdekat mungkin masih menjadi pilihan utama. Pada akhirnya, pasar ojek di Jakarta tidak akan pernah mati. Go-Jek mungkin masih bisa mengambil peran di layanan lain seperti mengantarkan barang atau membantu belanja. Bisa dibilang, keputusan Go-Jek membuka kedua layanan itu adalah langkah yang pintar. Dan jika itu terjadi, pengemudi ojek seperti Marto, Maman, dan Solas yang menolak bergabung dengan Go-Jek, mungkin akan mendapat penumpang mereka kembali. —Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di situs berita teknologi dan startup TechinAsia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grabcar-first-authorised-ride-sharing-app","title":"GrabCar becomes Philippines' first authorized ride-sharing app","date":"Jul 8, 2015 11:10 PM PHT","snippet":"GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Philippine transport authorities authorised GrabCar as the first company to operate under new rules governing ride-sharing apps, state and company officials said Wednesday. Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the Philippines' new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the government's land transport bureau. Ride-sharing services – typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis – are gaining popularity in the Philippine capital Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps – arguing they represent unfair competition. But GrabCar and other \"transport network companies,\" will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. \"We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,\" she told Agence France-Presse. GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise licence from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter \"lifespan\" than taxi cabs, Salada said. \"With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,\" GrabCar Philippines said in a statement on its website. \"We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the Philippines,\" it added. The head of GrabCar Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorisation. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The Philippines is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies. Previously, only local and city governments had regulated the services. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/san-miguel-solo-second-ginebra","title":"San Miguel holds off Ginebra to grab solo second spot","date":"Nov 16, 2014 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"San Miguel managers to fend off a late rally by Ginebra to claim solo second in the PBA PH Cup standings","body":""},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/locals-talk-n-text-air21","title":"Locals shine as Talk 'N Text grabs share of lead in standings","date":"Jun 2, 2014 11:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Ranidel de Ocampo scored 24 points and 7 rebounds and Jayson Castro added 19 as Talk N Text downed Air21 to gain parity with San Mig Coffee in the Governors' Cup standings","body":"MANILA, Philippines - The local players of the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters stepped up to the plate once again on Monday, June 2 with a 102-91 drubbing of the Air21 Express at the Mall of Asia Arena.  The victory gave the Texters a 4-1 win-loss record, which allowed the them to take their fair share of the top spot in the standings of the 2014 PLDT Home Telpad Governors' Cup along with the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers.   The Texters were buoyed by their local players in this contest with Ranidel de Ocampo leading the charge and scattering 24 points and grabbing 7 rebounds.  Jayson Castro wasn't too far behind with his 19 points, while Jimmy Alapag maintained his steady performance as of late with 16 points on 3-of-4 three-point shooting, along with 8 dimes.   Alapag and Castro combined for 18 points in the third canto, making up the bulk of Talk 'N Text's 31-point ouput in that period, which allowed them to pull away from the Express for good, heading into the fourth with a commanding 83-67 lead.   Kelly Williams and Harvey Carey also finished in double digit figures with 11 and 10 points, respectively.

He went only 1-of-5 from the field and was pushed to the outside where he scored on 3-of-7 from beyond the arc.  Black said he will be discussing with his coaching staff and the management on what they will do with their import moving forward.   Air21, on the other hand, was simply out of their element in this game and while they did attempt a final run in the fourth that brought them to within 97-87 with 3:02 left, the lead proved too big to overcome with so little time remaining and against a team with so many weapons.  Import Dominique Sutton had a 31-point, 14-rebound performance in tandem with Asi Taulava's 20 points and 15 boards.  After a spirited start to the conference, the Express are now in third place with a 3-2 slate.  Scores Talk ’N Text 102 - De Ocampo 24, Castro 19, Alapag 16, Carney 12, Williams 11, Carey 10, Fonacier 5, Baclao 3, Canaleta 2, Reyes Rob 0, Reyes Ryan 0.

Offered to fill in for 'Filipino Flash' Nonito Donaire, who contracted COVID-19 and withdrew from his World Boxing Council bantamweight title duel with Puerto Rican Emmanuel Rodriguez on Saturday, December 19 (Sunday, December 20, Philippine time), Gaballo readily gave his nod. As such, Gaballo, instead of fighting in the chief support against Chilean Jose Velasquez for the World Boxing Association interim bantamweight belt, will be elevated to the headliner opposite Rodriguez in the Showtime televised card set at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. Like the unbeaten Gaballo (23-0, 20 knockouts), Rodriguez also substituted for Frenchman Nordine Oubaali, who was supposed to be Donaire's foe but backed out after testing positive for coronavirus. According to JC Manangquil, head of Sanman Promotions which handles Gaballo's ring career, event organizers called him up early Wednesday, informing him of the development that deprived Donaire of a possible grudge rematch with Naoya Inoue.

What's important is Gaballo is in shape and ready to fight.\" While Donaire tested Inoue to the limit in their Fight of the Year encounter in Saitama, Japan on November 7, 2019, Rodriguez failed miserably earlier, hitting the canvas 3 times and getting knocked out in 2 rounds in a World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation unification in May 2019. The 28-year-old Rodriguez, who stands 5-foot-6 like Gaballo, hasn't fought since that first loss in 20 fights with 12 knockouts. Manangquil said he's waiting for the organizers' final decision on Wednesday. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/philippine-cup-finals-game-results-ginebra-tnt-november-29-2020","title":"Ginebra shuts down TNT in OT to take Game 1","date":"Nov 29, 2020 8:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Stanley Pringle, Japeth Aguilar, and LA Tenorio shine down the stretch as Barangay Ginebra grabs a 1-0 lead in the PBA finals","body":"Barangay Ginebra survived in regulation and shut down TNT in overtime, 100-94, to draw first blood in the PBA Philippine Cup finals at the Angeles University Foundation in Pampanga on Sunday, November 29. Stanley Pringle, Japeth Aguilar, and LA Tenorio shone down the stretch as the Gin Kings outscored the Tropang Giga, 8-2, in the extra period for a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.  TNT almost had the win in the bag after seizing a 92-90 lead in regulation but rookie Arvin Tolentino sank the overtime-forging layup off a Tenorio dime with 5 ticks remaining.  Tenorio brought his passing wizardry to the extra period, assisting Aljon Mariano for a 98-94 cushion and feeding Aguilar for the dunk with 19 seconds left that essentially sealed the win for the Gin Kings.  Aguilar frolicked inside the paint with 25 points and 14 rebounds, while Pringle finished with 24 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 steals as he set the tone for Ginebra by scoring the first basket in overtime.  Tolentino had 14 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 steals in his first PBA finals appearance. Tenorio churned out 12 points, 10 assists, and 5 rebounds.  The Gin Kings also drew a prolific performance from Scottie Thompson, who put up 15 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists.  \"We had a lot of contributions and that is how it is going to have to be when we play this team – no one person is going to beat Talk 'N Text, it is going to be a team,\" said Ginebra head coach Tim Cone.  Ray Parks once again led the Tropang Giga with 20 points, 5 steals, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 blocks, but he helplessly watched his team from the sidelines at crunch time after fouling out with 30 seconds left.  Roger Pogoy and Jay Washington put up 19 and 14 points, respectively, while Jayson Castro chimed in 12 points and 5 assists in the loss, missing what could have been the game-winning shot in regulation. Castro already blew by Tenorio and had a wide-open look at the rim but he muffed his floater as the time expired.

Adamson wound up at the bottom with University of the East at 1-6.  Tots Carlos led UP with a double-double of 14 points and 26 digs while Isa Molde chipped in 14 points off 11 spikes, 2 aces and 1 block. Ayel Estrañero made up for her lackluster outing in UP’s shock loss to National University with 28 excellent sets.  Although UP took home the win, head coach Godfrey Okumu wants to see better finishes from the Lady Maroons. “Today, we won.

We led well, and the 4th set was also a little challenging. But, we managed to finish well.”  Adamson’s Joy Dacoron tallied 15 markers to lead her team in the losing effort while Tonnie Rose Ponce continued to impress with 33 excellent digs and 21 excellent receptions. The Lady Maroons took control early in the opening frame, but the Lady Falcons capitalized on their errors and exploded with a 6-1 run to nab set point thanks to Bernadette Flora's ace.  UP extended the set until Tots Carlos' attack sailed wide, allowing Adamson to reach third set point before a lucky MJ Igao drop shot ended the joust.  But the Lady Maroons had vengeance on their minds in the following sets as they easily pulled away to double-digit leads. In the 4th set, the Lady Maroons’ early 8-3 advantage served as cushion as the Lady Falcons rallied within 3 points, 12-15. UP again pulled away to reach match point thanks to Adamson’s errors, but the Lady Falcons answered back with a 4-0 spurt, including back-to-back aces from Flora, to threaten the Lady Maroons anew.  UP, though, held on and Maris Layug’s offspeed attack sealed the win for the Lady Maroons. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/results-juniors-basketball-ateneo-blue-eaglets-ue-junior-warriors-december-12-2018","title":"UAAP juniors: Blue Eaglets cruise past winless Junior Warriors","date":"Dec 12, 2018 5:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Kai Sotto delivers another stellar outing as the Ateneo Blue Eaglets grab a share of the top spot in the UAAP juniors basketball tournament","body":"    MANILA, Philippines – The Ateneo Blue Eaglets continued their dominant streak in the UAAP Season 81 juniors basketball tournament with a 84-62 blowout over the winless UE Junior Warriors at the Ateneo Blue Eagle Gym on Wednesday, December 12.  Seven-foot-one sensation Kai Sotto dropped an easy 25 points and 7 rebounds on an 11-of-18 (61%) shooting with 2 blocks. JC Fetalvero added 11 markers off the bench on a perfect 3-of-3 clip from downtown while key forward David Diaz churned out a 10-point, 15-board double-double with 4 assists.  The winless Warriors gave the defending champs a good fight in the 1st half, tying them up 34-all by intermission after a few short-lived leads. However, the proverbial sleeping giant woke up as Ateneo dashed UE's upset hopes with an 18-3 run in the 3rd, 52-37, highlighted by back-to-back Sotto post buckets.  The Eaglets closed the door on their challengers with a 9-1 run off a trifecta of threes in the 4th, 77-55, with 3:20 left in regulation.  Mike Flores dragged UE to the end with 17 points off the bench on a 5-of-7 (71%) clip from downtown.

NU had 4 seconds to save its undefeated streak but was unable to convert a game-tying three in time.  Sabandal led the balanced attack with 13 points and 10 rebounds for the double-double finish. Adrian Manlapaz also tallied an 11-point, 14-board dub-dub with 4 blocks while Adam Doria chipped in 12 markers and 6 boards.  Batang Gilas stalwart Gerry Abadiano paced NU with a game-high 17 points but needed 7-of-21 (33%) shots to get there. Terrence Fortea forced up 11 markers on an even worse 4-of-23 (17%) clip.   FEU (4-2) vs UPIS (0-6)  In the opening match of the day, the FEU Baby Tamaraws made quick work of the winless UPIS Junior Maroons, 102-72. Batang Gilas prospect Xyrus Torres erupted for 27 points off the bench on a 10-of-14 (71%) clip from the field with 6-of-10 (60%) shots from downtown. RJ Abarrientos and Bryan Sajonia followed up with 14 markers apiece in the easy win.  UPIS was still in striking distance after a 35-43 1st half, but the battle-tested FEU cranked up the intensity at the turn of the 3rd quarter. By the 4th frame, the outmatched Junior Maroons had run out of gas, getting outscored by the Baby Tams 28-15, for the eventual 30-point drubbing. Allen Torres led UPIS with 23 points and 9 rebounds while lead guard Ralph Labao added 17 markers and 7 boards.   UST (3-3) vs DLSZ (3-3)  Things were much more exciting in the second bout as the UST Tiger Cubs kept the DLSZ Junior Archers at bay with a 63-55 win.  Star rookie Mark Nonoy dropped a 19-point, 12-rebound, 6-assist line in 36 minutes of action while Batang Gilas big man Bismarck Lina tallied 10 points and 12 boards for the double-double effort.  Archer swingman Jac Macasaet got the game within 3 points, 55-58, with just 1:48 to go in regulation after a huge three. However, Nonoy took over with 5 straight points down the stretch, with a clutch long bomb and two free throws to put the game away at 63-55 with 27 seconds remaining.

Now we are back,\" said Garcia. \"I prepared for the best. He gave a great fight but I was in control most of the fight and did what I had to do to win.\" Garcia seized control of the fight early, flooring American Easter in the 3rd round with a left hook to the chin. It was just the second time in his career that Easter was knocked down.  \"We wanted to land that right hand. It was a perfect punch around the chin,\" he said. Easter recovered from the knockdown but failed to mount a sustained attack outside of his jab, and was almost knocked down again in the 9th round.  Garcia is now 5-0 with two knockouts since returning from a 30-month exile from the sport due to a battle with promoter Top Rank.  The 3 judges scored it 118-109, 117-110 and 116-111 as Garcia improved to 39-0 overall after this fight which marks a return to the lightweight division. He won a junior welterweight belt in February but had to vacate it to face Easter.  Garcia immediately threw down the gauntlet to Errol Spence saying in the ring that for his next fight he wants to move up to the welterweight division to fight for Spence's IBF belt. \"He is the most feared man and I want to challenge him,\" said Garcia. The 27-year-old Easter suffered the first loss of his career to drop to 21-1, with 14 KOs. He was making his 4th title defense of the vacant belt he won in 2016.

It was a suggestion raised by lawmakers on Wednesday, January 24, as the House committees on transportation and public order and safety held a hearing on the possible regulation of “habal-habal,” the colloquial term of motorcycles used as a means of public transportation. Current laws on public transportation do not make mention of motorcycles, leading to the suspension of operations for ride-sharing applications like Angkas and GrabBike. Representatives Raul del Mar and Ramon Durano, both from Cebu province, made the suggestions as the committees began tackling possible revisions to the law. Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña, a vocal supporter of applications like Angkas, agreed with the sentiment. A former member of the House, the Cebu mayor called on more “autonomy” for LGUs. “These kind of social experiments cannot be decided in one office here in Metro Manila just by looking at maps and data. You have to go to the people and see how they feel. What we’re really asking for is more local autonomy,” he said during the hearing. The committee eventually agreed on the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to study and flesh out possible revisions to the law. The technical working group will eventually report to the mother committee, where further revisions and deliberations will take place. Realities on the ground  During the hearing, Osmeña had pointed out that national government had failed to address the “realities” of life outside of the metro. In far flung areas, for instance, the habal-habal can be the only means of transportation for locals. It’s either that or walking. Habal-habal in the Philippines can refer to motorcycles that can carry up to 8 passengers without any attachments or those that can carry even more thanks to the installation of makeshift wooden planks. The Cebu city mayor raised this when a motorcycle safety expert said that it’s recommended that only a maximum of two people ride a motorcycle at once. “If a mother has to bring her baby to the hospital using the habal-habal, what does she do? Does she tell the driver to bring the baby there first then come back to get her?” he said. Experts told the committee that ideally, a single motorcycle should carry only a maximum of 150 kilograms. Services like Angkas or GrabBike only allow one passenger for every motorcycle driver. “They’re not in the mountains, they’re not talking to these farmers who brings the child to school. They cannot do it from the 10th floor of a high rise building. You cannot look at the map and say ‘I know the problem.’ You have to be in the foxhole, you have to be on the field,” said Osmeña, explaining why he wants LGUs to have a higher stake in regulations such as that of public transportation. Besides, he said, if mistakes are made by one LGU, it can always learn from other who implemented programs better. Concerns were raised, however, that should LGUs be allowed to impose their own regulations, standards might be too different in different areas. These will all be fleshed out by the TWG. “You ask for federalism but you’re complaining about our ability to run our own affairs. Let the local government solve their own problems,” added Osmeña. Congress is current deliberating on possible amendments or revisions to the 1987 Constitution so that the country can shift to a federal form of government. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/livelihood-dead-navotas-public-cemetery","title":"Making a living among the dead inside Navotas Public Cemetery","date":"Oct 31, 2017 10:59 AM PHT","snippet":"Children and adults alike inside the Navotas Public Cemetery grab the opportunity to make money doing odd jobs that come with the Undas rush","body":"MANILA, Philippines – November 1 has always had a profound place in the heart of family-centric Filipinos.  The usually quiet cemeteries across the country are filled to the brim with families visiting to pay their respects to their departed loved ones every All Saints’ Day. Some even travel to their provinces, braving traffic and long lines in terminals, just to spend time with relatives.  But days before the Undas rush, cemeteries are already bustling with people looking for opportunities to make a living among the dead. Among them are families who call the Navotas Public Cemetery home.  Not long after stepping into the 1.5-hectare burial grounds, groups of children as young as 9 are bound to greet visitors and offer a variety of services for tombs. One of them is 14-year-old Anya* who has been cleaning tombs every Undas season since she was 9 years old. She first started helping her parents, tomb caretakers themselves, but eventually led a group of young girls on her own. When Rappler interviewed her on Friday, she said they already cleaned 3 tombs since her semestral break began that week. It was less than the number they cleaned last year, she added.  This has been a usual sight in the cemetery ever since families set up shanties inside. Small hands are used to scrub cemented tombs, drag buckets of water, and sweep soot away from corners – all to make the final resting place of a loved one look good come All Saints' Day. The pay varies, Anya said. Sometimes they get P100 ($2)* for one tomb, sometimes P300 ($6), all depending on how generous the client is. They don't get paid, however, until the families return on November 1.  When asked what she’ll do with this year’s earnings, the 3rd of 4 children had her own family in mind. “Ibibigay ko sa kanila tapos kung may tira, bibili ako ng damit,” she told Rappler. “Pero paghahatian pa namin lahat ng kita.” (I will give to them and if there’s more, I can buy clothes. But we still have to split everything first.)  These children who double as tomb cleaners during Undas are part of families who have been living inside the cemetery for many years. From playgrounds during ordinary days, the stacked tombs become opportunities to make money to put food on the table. It is tiring, Anya said, but they have to work to help their parents. She is just happy that she gets to spend time with her friends while cleaning. 'Competition' Deeper into the cemetery, past the family mausoleums owned by Navotas’ old rich, you’ll find the apartment-style tombs that are at least 10 feet high.  Settled in between rows are men and kids as young as 8 years old holding worn-out brushes and tin cans of white paint. “Papintura po (You want paint)?” at least 3 boys asked in chorus as they trailed an old lady and her companion – two of the few visitors that day in the public cemetery.  For P50 ($1) to P100 ($2), weathered tombs are given fresh paint jobs just in time for All Saints’ Day.  The “lucky” boy who gets the job, however, has to climb the high apartment tombs that cater mostly to the dead who belong to the lower class.  Sometimes they use a ladder made of discarded wood and bamboo, sometimes they move upwards with only their arms as support. It is quite usual to see a boy jumping from one tomb to another just to get the job done.  Despite the danger that comes with the job, it does not pay well – even if the Navotas Public Cemetery is the final resting place of more than a thousand people. “Marami po kasi kaming nagpipintura dito kaya agawan,” 13-year-old Jun* said. “Minsan may away pa kasi sasabihin siya nauna.” (There are a lot of us painting here so it’s really competitive. Sometimes we fight because they say they’re the first ones here.)  On Friday, October 27, Rappler counted at least 15 boys offering to paint tombs. They were huddled on the ground, talking among themselves, or teasing other kids.  The number excludes adults who are more used to doing intricate designs. These painters have a more stable roster of customers. When asked what they do once Undas is over, Jun, an out-of-school youth, just shrugged. “Kung ano-ano lang (Anything).” Informal sector workers  People trying to earn a living among the dead in Navotas Public Cemetery in preparation for Undas are among the 15.6 million informal sector workers in the Philippines.  Informal economy workers as those \"independent, self-employed, small-scale producers and distributors of goods and services,” according to the International Labor Organization (ILO). They are “highly vulnerable” because they lack the social protection that other employees enjoy, such as health benefits. (READ: What you need to know about PH's informal sector workers) But resorting to a job in the informal economy bridges the gap left by high unemployment rate and poverty incidence in the Philippines. Earnings from this type of job put food on the table despite the lack of security and seemingly substandard labor practices.  This is why even people who have other temporary jobs also make the most out of the pre-Undas rush. They sell goods – mostly packed meals, cold drinks, and cigarettes – to both early visitors and workers inside the cemetery.   But vendors only have until Tuesday, October 31, to recover their capital as rules state that stalls will no longer be allowed inside the cemetery on November 1.  Prohibiting vendors on the day when the crowd is expected to balloon in number lowers chances of earning more. One vendor told Rappler that they earn less and less every year because of this rule.  Some, however, are more “creative” and have gone beyond just setting shop in one corner of the cemetery.  Donna Mae and her friends walk around to peddle boiled eggs and coffee to people either visiting a dead loved one or there to work.  Since the start of preparations for Undas, Donna Mae has been going to the cemetery to take advantage of the crowd even if it means travelling back and forth from Bulacan where she lives.  The group even sings and laughs as they walk along the cemetery's only road, while trying not to get run over by cement mixer trucks. But the cemetery also holds painful memories for her. It is the final resting place of her friend, Joana Layson, who was killed by unknown vigilantes inside her Navotas Public Cemetery shanty in January 2017.  Life goes on, she said, and there is money that needs to be earned.  “Nakakapagod pero masaya naman kasi nandito iyong mga barkada ko,” Donna Mae told Rappler. “Nagtatawanan na lang kami.” (It’s tiring but it’s fun because I’m with my friends. We all just laugh.) The peak of the informal economy inside Navotas Public Cemetery will probably last until November 2.  After Undas, the people will move on to other temporary jobs.  They might set up shop to sell cigarettes on the small sidewalk outside the cemetery where jeepneys pass, they might find other construction-related jobs that pay better sans benefits, and the children might go back to school.   But one thing is most likely: they will come and work again in the cemetery same time next year. – Rappler.com *Names have been changed as requested by the minors *$1 = P51.57"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/death-pool-cabongaoan-beach-burgos-pangasinan","title":"Jump into 'Death Pool' at Cabongaoan Beach in Pangasinan","date":"Oct 14, 2017 4:12 PM PHT","snippet":"From a sleepy town to a thrill-seeker’s destination, Cabongaoan Beach and its Death Pool have been grabbing tourists' attention","body":" Pangasinan is one of the best places in the north of the Philippines for beach adventures. We all know about the popular Hundred Islands in Alaminos, the sugary-white sand of Patar Beach in Bolinao, and a number of enchanting side trips you might want to add to your list – falls, caves, farms, mountains, and much more.  But Pangasinan has more to offer when it comes to booming beach hot spots. Burgos, a municipality located 30-minutes away from the provincial capital Alaminos, is gaining momentum to become the next big tourist attraction, all for its thrilling offering – Cabongaoan Beach. After an hour's tricycle ride from the municipal proper, the sound of gentle waves will tell you that you are nearing the place. The area is not like other touristy places in Pangasinan. Since the beach is a tad remote, there are only few accommodations available in the area. If you want to feel more of the beachside vibe, pitching a tent would be a great option too.  Touching the fine white sand while walking along the beach barefoot will give you a laidback vibe. Nipa huts, a few boats for fishing, and local kids playing by the shore are common sights.  In the morning, you will be greeted with calm waters, which will entice you to take a dip. Be careful though, as there are many rocky parts of the beach.It is better to find the safe spots for kids to frolic in. For family and barkada bonding, there are a few resorts offering nipa huts for rent, often paired with karaoke rentals for the usual belting voices.  Death Pool But a trip to Cabongaoan Beach will never be complete if you forego checking out the reason for which it is most famous – the Death Pool.  Originally called Depth Pool, locals coined the term “Death Pool\" because it suited the site's thrilling effect. The Death Pool is a natural pool located on the far right side of the beach.  Getting there is not for the faint-hearted. A couple of minutes of walking towards the pool and you'll need to pass through rocky paths leading to even bigger rock formations. You might enjoy walking barefoot by the beach, but having footwear is advisable when walking to the pool. After passing big boulders, you will be greeted by the crashing sound of waves and probably the shrieks of tourists at the famed Death Pool. The natural tidal pool, with a crooked circle shape, looks deadly. Waves that crash into it might make swimmers lose their balance, as if they are being wiped out. It also drains out water, which makes it look frightening to jump or swim in. People would sit around the pool, thinking whether they should jump or just hold a firm grip on sharp rocks. Some would jump into it as the waves crash, while some will just opt to look on.   But get this: the Death Pool is not really a deadly destination. From the looks of people visiting the place, it is more of a thrilling and fun experience rather than a dangerous one. It is for – from kids to those young at heart.  And for those who want a less thrilling swimming experience while enjoying the view of waves and the sea, there are many small natural pools within the area. Some will opt to just float in the pools hidden in big rocks, or frolic in safer pools scattered all over the place.  Planning to go? With the thirst to discover more and more destinations in the Philippines, it is not surprising to know that Cabongaoan Beach and its Death Pool is bringing in tourists.  Before, when roads were not developed, it took almost a couple of hours to reach the place. Roads are way better now, which makes it easier for many to drive to the beach. There is already a tourism information booth in the town proper to help visitors with their itineraries.  If you are planning to go to the place, here are some tips you might want to check out: Getting there To all you adventure seekers out there, check out our coupons section for the best deals on travel and hotels and have the time of your life!"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/arwind-santos-game-winner-barako","title":"WATCH: Arwind Santos hits game-winner over Barako Bull","date":"Nov 22, 2015 6:29 PM PHT","snippet":"San Miguel Beer grabs control of solo lead in the Philippine Cup standings thanks in part to Arwind Santos' game-winning putback","body":"MANILA, Philippines - A day after FEU's Mac Belo hit a game-winning putback to send the Tamaraws to the UAAP Finals, another FEU alum repeated the feat for his PBA team.

Both teams actually tote the same win-loss record of 9-2 but the 10-time champion UV Green Lancers takes the solo lead by virtue of a simple tie. The Green Lancers not only wrestled the top spot but also avenged the only loss they suffered at the hands of the Warriors in the first round of eliminations. Alfred Codilla, whose rainbow shot allowed the Green Lancers to pull away when the Warriors started to cut down on their advantage, was once again named as the best player of the ballgame as he topscored with 18 points and grabbed two rebounds. Two other Green Lancers finished in double figures - former national youth team member Leonard Santillan who had 14 points and Cameroonian import Steve Akomo who chipped in 10 points. The Warriors only had one hoopster scoring in double figures, import Shooster Olago also of Cameroon who finished with 13 points. Santillan started the scoring spree for the Green Lancers with his back-to-back baskets as soon as the ballgame started. The Green Lancers immediately went on a rampage to erect a 19-point lead near the close of the first quarter as only Nicolas Kyle Magat, Charles Pepito and Olago connected with the net for the Warriors. Nothing seemed to work for the Warriors as the Green Lancers continued to widen the gap between them to post a seemingly insurmountable 25-point advantage at the halftime break. But the 10-minute breaktime only fueled the Green Lancers' spirit as they pulled ahead by 29 points as soon as the second half started on two baskets from Santilland and Codilla. Not about to give up, the Warriors started clawing back on the combined efforts of Olago, Giovanni Laguyo and Ian Jefferson Tagapan and managed to stave seven points off the Green Lancers' lead, 29-51. The game was interrupted then with Christian Maconocido of the Warriors hitting the floor writhing and favoring his left ankle. Another drama ensued in the return play as Jerome Napao of the Green Lancers claimed he was punched on the right side of his face. No call was made. The game finally resumed with the Warriors continuing to hack on the Green Lancers advantage bringing the gap further down to just 20 points, 41-61, on the basket of Caesar Ian Ortega at the 6:35 mark of the final canto. However, Codilla pulled off a shot from beyond the arc and with Santillan sinking his freebies, the Green Lancers was able to once again pad their lead with 4 minutes remaining in the ballgame.

Jasper Dela Cruz, who called himself an \"ordinary concerned citizen,\" posted with the letter a photo of an alleged identification card for senior citizens of Pililla in Rizal. What put Dela Cruz off was the placement of suspended Mayor Leandro Masikip's picture on the lower left side of the card – even bigger than the picture of the owner.  Masikip was suspended for 90 days starting February. The Office of the Ombudsman also charged him with falsification after he and another government official \"made it appear that members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Pililla deliberated upon and passed\" a resolution despite the council's non-participation.  Dela Cruz insisted that an ID should \"should bear information of the individual who carries it.\" \"An ID should only contain a single picture, and that is the carrier’s own photo,\" he wrote. \"Have you seen an individual who has two faces?

And other senior citizens from our town choose not to get discounts on certain establishments just because they are ashamed to present their ID with your face in it.\" Dela Cruz challenged everyone reading the post to visit the municipality to prove that it is not \"photoshopped\" or edited.  'Epal' He added that it is \"is appropriate to call politicians epal (credit grabbers) whenever they practice that culture.\" \"It is somewhat disheartening to live in a country where politicians practice a culture of putting/plastering their face & name on each and every possible area they can think of,\" Dela Cruz wrote. \"Please don’t shove your faces/names to us.\" The word epal is colloquially used in the Philippines to describe public officials who display their names and faces to claim credit for government projects. Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago filed the Anti-Epal Bill to prevent such instances. Several organizations also campaigned against the practice of \"credit-grabbing\" of politicians, especially as the 2016 presidential election draws near.

Grab also encourages GrabPay, their cashless payment system, as much as possible. If cash is the only way, customers are advised to place it an envelope and leave it for the rider to pick up. Grab delivery-partners must have regular temperature checks, and are advised to strengthen their immune system, avoid touching their faces, use a face mask, and cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough. – Rappler.com Order your favorite 8 Cuts Burger now with this GrabFood promo.

Why? Two things: Don't prejudice our ability to impose remedies. It also prejudiced our ability to make an assessment of the situation,\" PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo said. \"If you want to exit the market, you can sell of course. But don't do it right away. In this situation, when Grab purchased Uber, Uber already exited. We would have a more difficult time imposing the possible solution. That's why we said come back first,\" Quimbo added. On April, the PCC released interim measures while they were reviewing the Grab-Uber deal. Quimbo said that the ride-hailing companies violated two measures, for a total of 10 counts. Under the law, PCC can impose penalties of, at most, P2 million ($37,097) per violation, which led to the P16-million total. The PCC left it to both firms on how they will settle the penalty. The order, which was sent to Grab on October 11, can still be appealed. The ride-hailing firm must submit a motion for reconsideration 15 days since receipt. Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales said in a statement on Wednesday, October 17, that the firm is still \"studying all legal options.\" \"We are currently studying all our legal options with regard to the fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission. We will continue to provide additional information as it becomes available,\" Gonzales said. In August, the PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines. It chose top UK audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor Grab's compliance. – Rappler.com *$1= P53.91"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/catantan-grabs-silver-esteban-bags-bronze-southeast-asian-games","title":"Catantan grabs fencing silver in SEA Games debut; Esteban earns bronze","date":"Aug 21, 2017 7:44 PM PHT","snippet":"15-year-old Samantha Catantan finishes the fencing tourney with a silver medal in her first SEA Games stint","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Samantha Kyle Catantan improved the Philippines' medal haul as she finishes with a silver medal in the 29th SEA Games foil individual fencing tournament on Monday, August 21 at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Maxime Hamou, 21, grabbed Eurosport journalist Maly Thomas around the neck and shoulders while she interviewed him following his first round defeat on Monday. \"It was frankly unpleasant. If it hadn't been live on air, I would have punched him,\" Thomas told the French edition of the Huffington Post. Hamou, the world number 287, was subsequently banned from the Roland Garros site by organizers. \"The tournament directors have decided to cancel the accreditation of Maxime Hamou following his reprehensible behavior with a journalist on Monday,\" said a Roland Garros statement.  A Eurosport spokesman told AFP that Hamou's actions were \"highly inappropriate\". \"We sincerely regret the incident that occurred during yesterday evening’s interview between Maly Thomas and Maxime Hamou. The behavior of the interviewee was highly inappropriate and we do not condone such conduct in any way,\" the spokesman said. \"Maly is a highly respected journalist and we are pleased that a full apology is being offered. We apologize to any viewers who may have been affected.\" Hamou had already come under fire for his behavior during a qualifying match last week when he screamed at an umpire: \"Why are you here?\" But it was the incident with Thomas which was causing outrage and on Twitter especially as it prompted laughs and applause from studio guests on the Eurosport programme, \"Avantage Leconte\". \"He kisses her by force, she tries to get away, he holds her by the neck and everyone... laughs ...#tired,\" tweeted French politician Cecile Duflot. French journalist Claude Askolovitch tweeted in French: \"In a normal world, Maxime Hamou would be in court for sexual assault\".

Hal utama yang mereka keluhkan adalah keharusan mengubah nama di Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan (STNK) menjadi nama perusahaan atau koperasi, serta kewajiban memiliki SIM A Umum, dan melakukan uji kir.  Menanggapi aksi demonstrasi tersebut, Kementerian Perhubungan pun bergeming, dan tetap akan menjalankan aturan tersebut pada batas waktu yang telah ditetapkan. Hal ini kemudian dibantah oleh Agus Muharram, Sekretaris Kementerian Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil Menengah.  Agus, melalui siaran pers, menjelaskan apabila mobil yang digunakan sebagai armada Uber, GrabCar, dan Go-Car merupakan milik pribadi, maka nama di STNK pun harus tetap menggunakan nama pribadi. Menurut Agus, hal tersebut telah disepakati dalam rapat yang dihadiri oleh Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika Rudiantara, Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, serta perwakilan dari layanan transportasi on-demand. Keputusan ini diambil karena perbedaan struktur organisasi antara perusahaan taksi dan layanan transportasi on-demand yang berbentuk koperasi.  “Dalam prinsip koperasi, anggota adalah pemilik dan pemilik adalah anggota. Karena itu, pengemudi yang tergabung dengan layanan transportasi on-demand bukanlah pekerja seperti pengemudi taksi konvensional,” ujar Agus. Terkait syarat-syarat lain yang telah ditetapkan, seperti keharusan pengemudi memiliki SIM A Umum dan melakukan uji kir, Agus mengatakan kalau pihaknya akan membantu layanan transportasi on-demand untuk memenuhi hal tersebut. Kabar ini tentu akan disambut baik oleh para pengemudi layanan transportasi on-demand seperti Uber, GrabCar, dan Go-Car. Namun melihat peraturan yang terus berubah-ubah selama ini, mereka tentu tetap harus waspada, dan aktif berkomunikasi dengan pihak-pihak terkait di lingkungan pemerintahan. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya telah diterbitkan di Tech in Asia"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-votes-upper-house","title":"Japan's Abe claims victory in parliamentary vote","date":"Jul 10, 2016 7:34 AM PHT","snippet":"(4th UPDATE) Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expresses relief as his coalition gains at least half of the seats up for grabs in the polls","body":"TOKYO, Japan (4th UPDATE) – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe claimed victory Sunday, July 12, for his ruling coalition in parliamentary elections, which came despite lukewarm public support for his economic policies and wariness over amending the country's pacifist constitution. Abe, in power since late 2012, has yet to achieve a strong recovery in the world's third-largest economy through measures centered on massive easy money and other steps – so-called Abenomics. Voters have also expressed misgivings about his cherished dream of making changes to the country's constitution, imposed by the United States after Japan's defeat in World War II and which prohibits it from waging war. But his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Buddhist-backed Komeito gained as public confidence in the ability of opposition parties was even lower. Abe seized on the election results for half the seats in parliament's upper house as a vote of confidence. \"I'm relieved that we were able to secure more than... half the seats contested,\" he told private broadcaster TBS television about two hours after polls closed at 8 pm (1100 GMT). \"I think (voters) told us to firmly accelerate Abenomics.\" The LDP and Komeito were set to take at least 66 of the 121 seats up for grabs – half the chamber's total – up from 59 previously, public broadcaster NHK said. Its projection and similar estimates by other media were based on incoming results and their own analysis. Final numbers were not expected until Monday, July 12, at the earliest but the trend was clear. The two parties control 77 seats from the other half of the chamber, which was not contested Sunday, meaning that they are set to increase their majority in the 242-seat body. The House of Councilors, as the upper house is formally known, is the less powerful chamber in Japan's bicameral parliament, and half its seats come up for election every 3 years. NHK and other media also said the LDP was in reach of a majority on its own in the body which, if achieved, would be its first in 27 years. 'Passively approved' Shinichi Nishikawa, professor of political science at Meiji University in Tokyo, said the result, though undeniably a win, was no mandate. \"Considering the current negative signs for the economy, we can say many voters reluctantly voted for ruling candidates due to the weakness of the opposition,\" he told AFP. \"Voters passively approved Abenomics with no alternatives.\" Abe went into the vote hoping that the coalition and a loose group of hawkish conservatives from smaller parties could grab a two-thirds majority in the upper house, which they already have in the lower chamber – thus giving him the strength to start amending the constitution. The House of Representatives, the lower chamber, sits for a 4-year term unless dissolved early. The last election was held in December 2014. Media analyses of Sunday's vote said it appeared that the parties favoring constitutional revision could reach such a super majority in the upper chamber, though votes were still being counted. The constitution is deplored by nationalists as a relic from Japan's World War II defeat. But many Japanese staunchly embrace its pacifist ideal. And while the LDP's own draft amendment plan calls for keeping the war-renouncing spirit of the document, it wants to remove language it sees as infringing on the country's means to defend itself. Abe was bombarded by questions on TBS about what the election result means for any attempt at revision. But he played down the issue, even suggesting any change was unlikely during his remaining time in office. \"I don't think voters were asked to express pros and cons on the constitution in this election,\" he said. \"My term lasts for two (more) years, but it is also the goal of the LDP,\" he said of amending the country's basic law. \"We will sit down and tackle the issue.\" Any legislation that mustered the two-thirds majorities needed to pass both houses of parliament, however, would face a national referendum, currently seen as a difficult hurdle to overcome. The Japanese public is largely supportive of the constitution as it stands and will probably show resistence to attempts to tinker with it, said Sadafumi Kawato, professor of politics at the University of Tokyo. \"A two-thirds majority doesn't mean that Abe's government can tackle the amendment to the constitution immediately.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba-warriors-hold-off-hawks-50th-win-pistons-shock-cavs","title":"Warriors hold off Hawks for 50th win, Pistons shock Cavs","date":"Feb 23, 2016 2:06 PM PHT","snippet":"The Golden State Warriors waste a 23-point third-quarter lead but holds on to grab win number 50 in their 55th game of the season","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – The Golden State Warriors notched their 50th win of the NBA season in record-setting style, thwarting a Hawks rally to triumph 102-92 in Atlanta on Monday, February 22 (Tuesday, February 23 in Manila). Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry scored 36 points for the Warriors, who wasted a 23-point third-quarter lead but held on to grab win number 50 in their 55th game of the season. That eclipsed the record of 56 games needed by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls needed to reach 50 wins – another encouraging sign for a Warriors team bent on beating the record 72-10 regular-season mark put up by those Michael Jordan-led Bulls. \"We're right on track,\" Curry said. \"We're not complacent, (we're ) trying to get better, finding different ways to win. \"We understand our potential, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves,\" Curry added. \"Fifty wins is great, but we've got to keep plugging away and stay hungry.\" Curry connected on 14 of 22 from the field and made 5 of 11 3-pointers. He has made a 3-pointer in 126 consecutive regular-season contests, one shy of matching the all-time record held by Atlanta's Kyle Korver. Klay Thompson added another 5 3-pointers for the Warriors, scoring 12 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter as Golden State battled back after seeing the Hawks gain an unlikely lead. The game looked as if it would be a blowout until the third quarter. Golden State led 58-30 at halftime and built the cushion to 70-47 on Curry's drive to the basket with 6:58 left in the third quarter. But with center Al Horford and guard Dennis Schroder scoring 8 points apiece, the Hawks responded with a 28-6 scoring run that pulled them to within a point heading into the fourth. They took the lead on a basket by Horford and led 80-76 on a three-pointer from Thabo Sefolosha. But Golden State regained control with a 17-4 scoring run. Golden State center Andrew Bogut, back after missing a game with a sore Achilles tendon, had 3 of his 5 blocked shots in the fourth to help the Warriors seal it. Pistons shock Cavs  As the Warriors continued their march toward the post-season, Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland were up-ended on their home floor, falling 96-88 to the Detroit Pistons. Reggie Jackson scored 23 points and center Andre Drummond had 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Pistons, who had 59 points dropped on them by New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis on Sunday but bounced back to end the Cavaliers' 5-game winning streak. Pistons guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 19 points, coming up with a big late steal from Cavaliers star LeBron James that resulted in a basket. James's 12 points matched his season low as the Cavaliers came out flat a day after handing the Oklahoma City Thunder their worst defeat of the season. Cleveland turned the ball over 18 times and were ineffective at both ends of the floor. \"We lacked energy, starting with myself, all the way down to everybody else,\" James said. Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving scored 30 points – a day after sitting out much of the game at Oklahoma city with what the team called flu-like symptoms. Irving said he was sickened and sleep deprived after finding bed bugs in his Oklahoma hotel room. Heat hold off Pacers  In Miami, the Heat welcomed veteran Dwyane Wade back to action with a 101-93 overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers. Wade, who missed the previous two games with knee soreness, connected on 4 of 21 from the field, but set the Heat up for overtime with two free throws in the waning seconds of regulation. Goran Dragic scored 24 points for the Heat and Hassan Whiteside came off the bench to score 19 points with 18 rebounds and 6 blocked shots as Miami withstood a 31-point performance from Pacers forward Paul George. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/womens-softball-gold-sea-games","title":"Philippines rules women's softball, earn SEA Games gold","date":"Jun 10, 2015 5:23 PM PHT","snippet":"The Philippines grabbed another gold medal in the 28th Southeast Asian Games by defeating Thailand, 3-0, in the women softball grand finale","body":"MANILA, Philippines - The Philippines grabbed another gold medal in the 28th Southeast Asian Games by defeating Thailand, 3-0, in the women softball grand finale at the Kallang Softball Field in Singapore on Wednesday, June 10.  The Philippines scored two runs in the third inning and another one in the fourth, while shutting out their Thai opponents over six innings.

Alaska import Romeo Travis - the high school teammate of NBA superstar LeBron James - was all over the floor on Wednesday, resembling the dominant effort of his former comrade in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals by finishing with 27 points, 14 rebounds, 7 assists, and 5 steals. Travis, who played high school ball with James at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s, also hit a clutch, turnaround jumper in the post that created breathing room between the two teams late in the fourth quarter. The Aces defense let the Hotshots - now 1-4 and losers of 4 straight - shoot 49% from the field but forced 21 turnovers that led to 27 points.  “The one thing I really appreciated was the defensive effort we had - the stops that we got. And they were high-energy,” Alaska head coach Alex Compton said after the game.  “You know when you play a tough team like Purefoods, you have to grind it out,” he later said. Vic Manuel came off the bench and provided 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting, while Cyrus Baguio put up 9 points. Star was led by Marqus Blakely, who had 22 points and 12 rebounds. It looked like Alaska sealed the game when they went ahead 83-72 with 6:34 remaining in the fourth quarter, but a 7-0 run by Blakely and James Yap - who put up 9 points on 3-of-9 shooting - inched their team back to striking distance.  Alaska, however, maintained their lead and was ahead 88-83 with 1:14 to go. After a missed shot by Blakely, Travis received the ball in the post down the floor and nailed the turnaround jumper to put his team up 7. Joe Devance hit a triple a few plays later to commence a late Star run, but after Alaska called time-out, Jvee Casio was left open for a baseline jumper which he converted with 19 seconds remaining. With the score at 92-86 in favor of the Aces, the Hotshots turned to Yap who missed a 3-pointer, sealing the Hotshots' worst start to a conference this season and first 4-game losing skid in 12 conferences. Mark Barroca finished with 17 points to aid Blakely, while Devance registered 8.

The 17-time Grand Slam winner had just completed a routine 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Colombia's Alejandro Falla when he was shocked to see a young fan sprinting towards him on the showpiece Philippe Chatrier Court. It was particularly embarrassing as security at this year's French Open has been tightened following January's deadly Islamist attack on Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Although the male fan was quickly manhandled away, 33-year-old Federer was furious with the lapse in security, claiming he had also been targeted in practice on Saturday. \"I am not happy about it. It happened yesterday in the practice, too. It's just a kid, but then three more kids came. And today on center court where you would think this is a place where nobody can come on, just wanders on and nothing happens,\" said Federer. \"Something needs to happen quickly. Normally I only speak on behalf of myself, but in this situation I think I can speak on behalf of all the players, that that's where you do your job, that's where you want to feel safe.  \"And so clearly I'm not happy about it. But nothing happened, so I'm relieved. But clearly it wasn't a nice situation to be in.\" Federer was also involved in a security scare in the 2009 final at Roland Garros when a fan ran on to the same court and placed a hat on the star's head. Two years ago the final, which featured Rafael Nadal, was also held up when a shirtless spectator, brandishing a flare, leapt from the stands and onto the court before he was wrestled away by security officials. Player safety at tennis tournaments has been a major concern ever since 1993 when Monica Seles was stabbed by a deranged fan in Hamburg. Tournament director Gilbert Ysern admitted that Federer was right to be \"pissed off\" and admitted that the youth, who had been sitting in the courtside sponsors boxes, had been banned from the event. \"But it's not the end of the world,\" added Ysern. \"It's embarrassing. It shows that we made a mistake and we have to correct it to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" Federer, the 2009 champion and seeded two this year, goes on to face Spain's Marcel Granollers for a place in the last 32. Federer, one of a record 39 men over 30 in the first round, is desperate to make the most of a kind draw which dumped top seed Novak Djokovic, nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray all in the opposite half. Federer's Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka, the eighth seed, took just 96 minutes to make the second round, seeing off Turkey's Marsel Ilhan 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. Wawrinka, who made the last-eight in 2013, goes on to face either Serbia's Dusan Lajovic or Maximo Gonzalez of Argentina in the next round. But he too was unhappy with organizers after the tournament's official website went into surgical detail regarding his private life. Former Australian Open winner Wawrinka announced last month that he and his wife Ilham were separating but he was furious to discover that his personal problems were the focus of the website's preview of his opening round match. \"It was a completely stupid article. For a Grand Slam website, it should be an article about the tennis and that's it,\" said Wawrinka. \"It was a shit article.\" Nishikori through Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori enjoyed a 6-3, 7-5, 6-1 win over France's Paul-Henri Mathieu and next faces either Australia's Marinko Matosevic or Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil. Latvian 24th seed Ernests Gulbis, who knocked Federer out in the fourth round last year on his way to the semi-finals, defeated Dutchman Igor Sijsling 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) for only his third win all year. Romania's Simona Halep, the 2014 runner-up and third seed, saw off Russian world number 91 Evgeniya Rodina 7-5, 6-4 and next faces Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, the Croatian player who knocked her out of the US Open last year. Russian ninth seed Ekaterina Makarova breezed past US wildcard Louisa Chirico 6-4, 6-2 while Spanish 21st seed Garbine Muguruza, who shocked Serena Williams in the second round last year, beat Croatian qualifier Petra Martic 6-2, 7-5. Croatian 18-year-old Donna Vekic, coached by 1997 champion Iva Majoli, put out French 31st seed Caroline Garcia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 for her first win at the tournament. Later Sunday, Serbian seventh seed Ana Ivanovic, the 2008 champion, starts her campaign against Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova, a quarter-finalist in 2010 and 2012. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/winners-losers-asean-2015","title":"Winners and losers in ASEAN 2015","date":"Apr 6, 2014 10:37 AM PHT","snippet":"A number of ASEAN firms are taking steps towards grabbing opportunities that ASEAN 2015 could bring but some sectors also stand to lose out","body":"This is the fundamental bedrock of free trade; and this process can serve as an engine of high and sustained growth. Yet is this growth necessarily inclusive? Critics are right to point out that these macro-level gains are not necessarily a guarantee that everyone shares in these benefits – Yes, the pie will grow, but who gets to share? Inclusiveness depends on whether most sectors are able to compete, and ultimately, whether competition brings out better products and services for most consumers. Observations of strategic adjustments by ASEAN firms in a database being constructed by the AIM Policy Center suggest that some of the most competitive firms in the region are already taking decisive steps to take advantage of the opportunities that ASEAN 2015 could bring. Yet there are also sectors that may stand to lose out; and that is where public sector intervention is critical in order to make the integration process a fair one. Banking The banking industry is a key sector to watch as consolidation and network externalities (more branches and more customers spell lower costs on the margin and higher profits) take place. As expected, several regional giants are seeking to gain a foothold and expand in relatively underdeveloped markets. In the CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam which together account for approximately 167 million of 617 million people in ASEAN), Thai banks like Bangkok Bank, Krungthai Bank and Siam Commercial Bank, are pursuing expansionary strategies. Many of these same banks join DBS Holdings (a Singaporean bank trying to acquire Indonesian PT Bank Danamon) and Affin Holdings Bhd (a Malaysian banking group trying to acquire a majority share of Indonesian PT Bank Ina Perdana) in expanding in Indonesia, the largest ASEAN member country (population of about 250 million or about 40% of ASEAN). The top 2 Malaysian banks (Maybank and CIMB) have also started penetrating the Philippine banking market, with Maybank planning to increase its branches in the Philippines to 100 in 2014 and 200 by 2018. Manufacturing Various manufacturing firms are now also trying to break into (or expand existing facilities in) CLMV. For instance, Universal Robina Corporation (Philippines) plans to spend US$20-30 million to set up food manufacturing facilities in Myanmar. Asiawide Refreshments Corporation (exclusive manufacturer and distributor of RC Cola in the Philippines) will similarly set up manufacturing facilities in Myanmar and Thailand. Also, Singha Corporation (Thai manufacturer of beer products) plans to set up a brewery in Myanmar (to tap potential markets in Myanmar and Southern China) and also aims to tap Cambodian and Vietnamese markets. In addition, Thai Beverage Company together with its sister company, TCC Assets, acquired a majority ownership of Fraser and Neave Ltd., a major player in the Singaporean and Malaysian softdrinks market. Air transport Lion Group ordered 230 Boeing 737 jets in a deal worth $22.4 billion in 2011, and 234 Airbus medium haul aircrafts in a deal worth $23.8 billion in 2013. Air Asia Group purchased an additional 100 Airbus planes (worth $9.4 billion) in line with its expansion goals in ASEAN. Cebu Pacific acquired a 40% stake in TigerAir Philippines, while Air Asia Philippines acquired a 49% stake in Zest Air (creating Air Asia Zest). Utilities and infrastructure San Miguel Corporation acquired 65% of Esso Malaysia (from Exxon Mobil) for M$1.8 billion in 2011 (in this case, all Esso stations in Malaysia are now rebranded to Petron), and established a consortium with Citra group whose projects include construction of tollways and other road infrastructure projects in Philippines and Indonesia. Further, Manila Water, which has a 49% stake in one of the main suppliers of water in the northern part of Ho Chi Minh City, has acquired 51% equity share of the water concessionaire in charge of the Western Zone of Jakarta. In addition, Meralco engaged in a joint venture with First Pacific Co acquiring 70% stake on an 800 MW Liquefied Natural Gas project on Jurong Island in Singapore from the GMR Group (a Singaporean firm).   Sugar Nevertheless, not all firms or sectors will end up winners in the integration project. Some will undoubtedly be affected by increased competition (even as consumers end up benefiting from lower prices and better products). Turning to the Philippines, the sugar industry is an example. It is expected to contract with the onset of increased competition from ASEAN. Through Executive Order 892, the country committed to gradually reduce its sugar tariff from 38% in 2011, to 28% in 2012, to 18% in 2013, to 10% in 2014 and finally to 5% starting 2015. Separate simulation studies by Caesar Corporaton (International Food Policy Research Institute) and Randy Tuaño (Ateneo de Manila) predict that the reduction of protection in this sector (e.g. tariff reduction and elimination of quotas) could produce welfare gains for Philippine consumers and industries that use sugar as an input. Hence even as the sugar industry itself may suffer a contraction, the gains in other sectors, according to these studies, could more than make up for these expected losses. (Remember that with free trade, the cost of some imported goods like sugar is expected to go down, leading to cheaper inputs in producing other goods.) In fact, about 70,000 people on net could move out of poverty as a result of liberalizing this sector. Other sectors’ competitiveness will be unleashed; and consumers will be better off. These studies bring us to the crux of the issue as regards international economic integration. Many countries have been able to use more economic openness as a means to boost their industrialization and job creation, thus reducing poverty much more aggressively. This is the story of China, the ASEAN tiger economies and virtually any other developing country that made significant inroads in development in the past several decades. Government support in these countries appears to have been applied with some discipline. Industries and companies receiving support were guided by clear targets on penetrating international markets, acquiring new technologies and generating competitive products – all leading to more robust employment generation. Economic openness more or less guarantees efficiency gains so that the entire country ends up growing more (a net gain); but more integrated markets do not guarantee that all sectors will end up winning. The most competitive sectors will likely corner the lion’s share of gains, though it might help if some of these sectors are labor-intensive so more could people participate in the gains. This is, of course, the case for manufacturing; and this is why efforts are now underway in the Philippines to boost these sectors through the government’s “new industrial policy.” Yet for those sectors that will contract, it is only fair to consider adjustment and compensation mechanisms so that the overall result of integration is acceptable to the entire population. And this is where the tricky part is – support must not prolong inefficiency. Here there is much to be learned from how effective social protection support for the poor is provided. The latter is disciplined and evidence-based – providing temporary support, conditioned on measurable outcomes and impact. Accordingly, the support provided to firms and sectors should have clear objectives – either they take adequate steps to boost productivity and/or employ more people, or slowly ease out of that industry if they are unable to do so. If we can expect poor families under the Philippines’ Pamilyang Pantawid Program (4Ps) to abide by the discipline of child-outcomes-based government support, then we should also be able to extend and enforce similar outcomes-focused programs for the firms and sectors that the country supports for the sake of the general welfare. – Rappler.com The authors belong to the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/usa-basketball-edges-lithuania-makes-semis","title":"USA basketball edges Lithuania, makes semis","date":"Aug 4, 2012 11:40 PM PHT","snippet":"LeBron James seized command with the game up for grabs as the United States defeated Lithuania 99-94 to clinch a berth in the medal playoffs","body":"LONDON - LeBron James seized command with the game up for grabs as the United States defeated Lithuania 99-94 on Saturday, August 4 to clinch a berth in the medal playoffs at the Olympic men's basketball tournament. But the US NBA Dream Team received its toughest test yet at the London Games only two nights after unleashing an Olympic record 156-point performance in a shooting practice of a victory over Nigeria. James and Carmelo Anthony each scored 20 points while Kevin Durant added 16 as the Americans remained unbeaten despite a 25-point effort from Lithuanian captain Linas Kleiza of the NBA Toronto Raptors. Darius Songaila sank a jumper to pull Lithuania within 87-86 before James took charge with nine points in a game-winning 12-2 US run, hitting a 3-pointer to start the spurt and a layup to end it in the dying seconds. The US multi-millionaires rose to 58-1 record under coach Mike Krzyzewski since revamping the national team program after settling for bronze at the 2004 Olympics. Strong competition The Lithuanians have a history with the US squad that includes a 1998 world championships victory, a 94-90 triumph at the 2004 Olympics and an 85-83 loss at the 2000 Olympics when a half-court buzzer shot fell short. The US NBA stars led 78-72 entering the fourth quarter but Kleiza sparked a 10-2 Lithuania run to give the Europeans an 82-80 edge, setting the stage for the closing drama. Sarunas Jasikevicius sank a 3-pointer 36 seconds into the third quarter to give Lithuania a 56-55 lead. But the Americans struck for the next seven points, two James layups sandwiched around a 3-pointer by reigning NBA scoring champion Durant within a 24-second span for a 62-56 US edge. Anthony sank a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Americans a 33-25 lead after the first quarter, but Kleiza helped pull the Europeans within 55-51 at half-time.

The Wednesday, July 15, vote was the first parliamentary election since the Social Democrats added \"North\" to the Balkan country's name last year – a move that ended a decades-old dispute with Greece but was highly controversial at home. The historic accord ushered the country into NATO and opened the door to future EU membership. But critics are still bitter about conceding a part of their identity to appease Athens, which was blocking the EU path because it claimed exclusive rights to the name Macedonia for its own neighboring region. Lacking an outright majority with some 36% of the vote, the center-left Social Democrats will now face tough coalition talks that could drag on for weeks before a government is formed. That could mean a leadership void at a time when coronavirus infections are surging and the country's already weak economy is headed towards a pandemic-triggered recession. According to projections by the state election commission, the Social Democrats are in line for 46 seats in the 120-member assembly, followed by 44 from their right-wing rivals VMRO-DPMNE, though the numbers are still subject to change. If Social Democrat leader and former prime minister Zoran Zaev fails to muster the necessary alliances, VMRO-DPMNE would be allowed to try. The party is formally pro-EU but has been highly critical of the name deal, lambasting it as \"treason\" and appealing to nationalists in a country that has faced identity battles with neighbors since emerging from former Yugoslavia in 1991. \"Our path to progress is confirmed,\" Zaev said in a victory speech after midnight Wednesday.  \"The citizens went out and voted for a clear future, for unity and solidarity, for economic patriotism, for law and order,\" the 45-year-old said. At opposition headquarters meanwhile, VMRO-DPMNE secretary general Igor Janusev insisted the vote still showed that \"people want change.\" Despite the first-place finish, the Social Democrats fared slightly worse than in the last poll in 2016, when they ultimately ended VMRO-DPMNE's nearly decade-long reign, a period marked by repression and corruption under now self-exiled former strongman Nikola Gruevski. There is a perception that beyond the progress with the EU talks, the Social Democrats have \"not delivered on some of the key promises, including justice reforms,\" said Elena Stavrevska, a political scientist at the London School of Economics. Low wages, high unemployment and widespread corruption have also been gnawing away at public faith in politics for years. \"We have had enough of promises, now it is time for progress,\" said 70-year-old Dimitar Sumkovski, a voter in the capital Skopje. The elections were held to replace a caretaker government that took over after Zaev stepped down 6 months ago following the EU's initial failure to open accession talks – a promise Brussels had made in exchange for the name change and other reforms. The bloc later gave the green light in March, although Skopje is still waiting for a date to start formal negotiations. Analysts predicted \"difficult\" coalition talks ahead.  \"We are going into a period of hard party negotiations,\" said political analyst Nikola Spasov, warning of instability ahead. The top options for junior partners are parties representing the ethnic Albanian minority, who make up around a quarter of the two million population. The Democratic Union for Integrity (DUI) was ranked third with some 15 seats followed by another rival Albanian camp with 12, according to the election commission. DUI, the traditional kingmaker, has this year demanded that its candidate be named prime minister in exchange for any alliance. Zaev – whose camp is already allied with a smaller Albanian party – has previously shot down the proposal as \"blackmail.\" With nearly 400 deaths from COVID-19, the landlocked country has the highest per capita fatality rate in the Western Balkans, according to official data. On Wednesday, masks were mandatory at polling stations, which closed later than normal to allow for more social distancing.  Those infected with the virus were able to cast ballots earlier in the week, as were the elderly and infirm. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/park-grabs-first-pro-win-virus-proofed-korean-golf-event","title":"Park grabs first pro win at 'virus-proofed' Korean golf event","date":"May 17, 2020 6:16 PM PHT","snippet":"Park Hyun-kyung rules the first high-level women's golf event as action returns in South Korea for the first time in months","body":"SEOUL, South Korea – The world's first big-purse golf tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic wrapped up in South Korea Sunday, May 17, marked by a ban on spectators and stringent safety measures that saw competitors having to sit apart while eating. The Korean LPGA Championship – featuring 3 of the world's top 10 women players – grabbed global attention, with broadcasting rights sold to countries including the US, Canada and Australia. Normally overlooked outside South Korea, the tournament is the first high-level women's golf event to be played since the US-based LPGA suspended its season in February.  Park Hyun-kyung prevailed at Lakewood Country Club in Yangju, scoring her first victory since turning pro in 2018 to claim $180,000 of the $2.5 million purse.   She shot a final-round five-under-par 67 to finish 17 under for the tournament – a shot ahead of Bae Seon-woo (68) and third-round leader Lim Hee-Jeong (71). \"The moment I had always dreamt of finally has come true,\" a tearful Park told cable channel SBS Golf.  World No. 3 and double-major winner Park Sung-hyun missed the cut, 6th-ranked Kim Sei-young finished two under for the tournament for joint 46th, while world No. 10 Lee Jeong-eun finished 15th at nine under. To avoid the risk of coronavirus infection, players were advised to keep 2 meters (6 feet) apart on the course and minimize physical contact, while touching the pin without gloves was prohibited.   Players also had to wear masks before and after their rounds, but could choose whether or not to do so during play – with most deciding against. The 20-year-old champion was congratulated by her mask-wearing peers with elbow-bumps, and held up the trophy at the prize-giving ceremony while also wearing a mask.  South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China but brought it under control with a widespread \"trace, test and treat\" program. Professional football and baseball both resumed this month – albeit behind closed doors. Only 4 LPGA Tour events have been completed this year – the last in Adelaide in February – but the tour has outlined plans to resume in mid-July in Michigan. The men's US PGA Tour, which came to a juddering halt when the Players Championship was abandoned after the first round in March, has penciled in a restart behind closed doors at the Charles Schwab Challenge beginning June 11 at Fort Worth, Texas. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/grabfood-celebrates-first-anniversary-growth-merchant-partners","title":"GrabFood celebrates first anniversary in PH by highlighting growth of merchant-partners","date":"Nov 19, 2019 2:44 PM PHT","snippet":"For Grabfood, success isn't measured by numbers alone.

And it’s particularly difficult if you’re doing something for work or school.  Hunger hinders you from giving a project your all. It’s scientifically proven that when your tummy is satisfied, you’re less stressed, better able to concentrate, less prone to mistakes, and more productive. When you’re busy doing things you love, you need food that can power you up to do your best.  You need to listen to your body’s cues – it’s important for your interpersonal relationships and psychological and mental health too.  Late-night munchies are about to become a thing of the past, however. GrabFood recently announced that it would now be operating 24/7.  “With our expanded operations, GrabFood has become a more reliable partner for hungry eaters in the Philippines, catering to a wide variety of palates through its extensive restaurant choices,” says GrabFood country head EJ dela Vega.  GrabFood has expanded exponentially in the past year, with 62% choosing GrabFood as their most used app for online food delivery. The data also saw an increasing trend of late-night orders.  Now, customers in at least 20 areas, including Manila, Makati, Quezon City, Pasig, Pasay, Paranaque, Las Pinas, Marikina, Muntinlupa, San Juan, Caloocan, Valenzuela, Mandaluyong, Malabon, Pateros, Navotas, Taguig, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu, and Mandaue can enjoy GrabFood services even during the wee hours of the morning.

Customers have a variety of merchants to choose from, including favorites such as McDonald’s, KFC, BonChon, Bully Buffalo Wing Bar, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Mister Kabab, and Ersao. And they haven’t forgotten milk tea! You can get your fix from Chatime and Happy Lemon any time you want.  But don’t starve your wallet while filling your tummy.

The prize will be given to the top 5 teams in the national event featuring 21 sports and 96 local government unit (LGU) delegations.  Luzon will field the most number of teams at 28, followed by Mindanao (27), Visayas (26), and the National Capital Region (15) in the games organized by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC).  PSC commissioner Ramon \"El Presidente\" Fernandez, the PNG overall chairman, said the cash prize will serve as PSC’s assistance to the sports  programs of the best LGU teams in the week-long event. National team members will see action, except for the Philippine track and field athletes due to a schedule conflict with the National Open.  According to Fernandez, the PNG was originally set last December but got pushed back due to the “clean up” campaign of the PSC and the national sports associations. “This is the elite of the elite, the cream of the crop athletes in our country, national team members will represent their LGUs and we envision for the PNG to become the Philippine Olympics,” said Fernandez, who added that the multi-sporting event will later on serve as one of the tryouts for the national teams.  The PNG has been one of PSC’s talent identification program and has also served as an assessment tournament for the national team members’ performance.  Cebuano hospitality Teams will compete in 21 sports with Cebu hosting athletics, archery, arnis, badminton, boxing, chess, cycling, dancesport, judo, karatedo, sepak takraw, softball, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, triathlon, volleyball, and weightlifting. Most of the events will be held in the city except for duathlon and triathlon, which will be held in Tabuelan, northwest Cebu; cycling in Danao City, also north of Cebu; and the women’s division of lawn tennis in Naga City, south of Cebu. Gymnastics and rugby football will be held in Manila due to lack of international standard facilities here.  Joint hosts Cebu City and Cebu Province promised to welcome the teams with warm Cebuano hospitality, but noted that the province will be all business once action kicks off.   “We are the hosts, we want them to feel welcomed in Cebu, but we want to beat them also,” said Cebu City Sports Commission chairman Edward Hayco during a press conference last Thursday, May 17, at the Cebu City Sports Center, where most events will be contested. Cebu Provincial Sports Commission executive director Atty. Ramil Abing, PSC PNG head secretariat Annie Ruiz and PSC Visayas’ Nonie Lopez also graced the press conference. Fernandez added that the PSC plans to make PNG a biennial event to align it with the Southeast Asian Games. By doing this, the basketball legend said it will make the PNG more prestigious and turn it into an event that athletes will really look forward to. Opening ceremonies As the PNG returns to Cebu after 21 years, it will have no less than Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as the keynote speaker during the opening ceremonies on Saturday afternoon, May 19, at the Cebu City Sports Center. The last time that Cebu hosted the PNG was in 1997.  The President will be joined by Cebu Province Gov. Hilario Davide III and Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña. The opening ceremonies itself will be something to look forward to, according to Ricky Ballesteros, a multi-awarded Milo Little Olympics organizer, who has been tapped to oversee the program.  Ballesteros said the opening program will be an event to remember, noting that it will be very modern but interwoven with the Cebuano culture.  All regional delegations will be highlighted during the parade of athletes in the opening ceremonies, which will feature dancers garbed in regional “lighted” costumes, said Ballesteros. Ballesteros also promised that the lighting of “the urn of peace and unity” will be unique and will feature Fernandez along with Philippine sports heroes led by Olympic silver medalist and Filipino weightlifting star Hidilyn Diaz. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/boston-celtics-grab-3-2-series-lead-over-milwaukee-bucks","title":"Boston Celtics grab 3-2 series lead over Milwaukee Bucks","date":"Apr 25, 2018 1:56 AM PHT","snippet":"The injury-plagued Celtics will get a shot to clinch the NBA Eastern Conference first round series on Thursday","body":"  BOSTON, United States (UPDATED) – Al Horford scored 22 points as the Boston Celtics defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 92-87, to take a 3-2 lead in their best-of-seven playoff series.

Lawyer Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), told senators that this practice is no different from Uber and Grab's surge pricing, or the increase in fares based on demand during peak hours. \"[Grab and Uber] are trying to incentivize drivers para kapag traffic, may high demand, pupunta ang auto sa pasahero. Because if they don't do it, hindi susunduin ng mga sasakyan nila 'yung mga pasahero,\" Suntay said during a Senate public services committee hearing on Thursday. (Grab and Uber are trying to incentivize drivers so that during heavy traffic and there's high demand, they would agree to pick up passengers. Because if they don't do it, the drivers won't pick up the passengers.) Suntay explained that some taxi drivers ask for additional payment due to insufficient income or losses incurred in traveling to far or congested areas. \"May taxi driver na magsasabi, 'Puwede ba padagdag ng P50 sa metro?' Dahil alam 'nyo ho, pagka ang pasahero magpapahatid sa lugar na matraffic, malulugi 'yung driver,\" he said. (There's a taxi driver who will say: \"Can you add P50 to the metered fare?\" Because you know, if a passenger wants to be brought to a congested area, the driver would incur losses.) \"If a taxi driver gets stuck in traffic for an hour, the meter would only earn him P75 because our waiting time is P3.50 for every two minutes. A driver who pays a boundary of P1,200 [a day] would need P60 an hour just to make the boundary. This is the reason why taxi drivers ay tumatanggi na maghatid (decline to get passengers),\" he added. Suntay also said he is not \"justifying\" the act, which has exasperated commuters and prompted them to switch to transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab. \"I'm not justifying it. I'm just saying the real reason why it's done,\" he said. Suntay added that the lack of income leads to the negative behavior of drivers. \"As with any normal person, income has a direct connection to individual behavior and action. Kapag walang pera, mas bugnutin ka, mas mabilis kang mainis. Kapag maliit ang kita mo, naghahanap ka ng paraan to augment it (If you don't have money, you're more irritable, you're easily annoyed. If you have limited income, you find ways to augment it),\" he said.

(PUVs need to show the public that they can also provide good service... What happened with the [transport network vehicle service] operators, they became the symbol of good service, but we all have the potential for good service, we just need to show it.) Orbos was addressing PUV transport groups in a consultation, telling them that their services can improve in simple ways. (READ: Taxi, jeep, van operators call out LTFRB for 'unfair treatment') He recommended that jeepney drivers keep their aisle lights on at night, and avoid wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts while working.

(They're small gestures but if you can do them, people will see what service you want to give them.) Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Aileen Lizada seconded Orbos' recommendation. Lizada told PUV operators that the public's support for Grab and Uber should be taken as a \"wake-up call,\" especially because jeepneys, buses, and taxis serve the majority of the riding public. Taxi driver-operators, said Lizada, should know how to navigate, keep their cars presentable at all times, and agree to take passengers to wherever their destination is. \"'Yung mga gano'n dapat sabihan 'nyo rin 'yung ibang taxi drivers na 'pag ginawa nila 'yun (mistakes), apektado ang buong taxi denomination,\" she added. (You should inform other taxi drivers, because if they [commit mistakes], the whole taxi denomination will be affected.)

According to him, traffic volume in the metro's roads has been the MMDA's problem for the longest time, and keeping thousands of unregistered Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers does not help. \"Last year, 417,000 cars were sold. The projection this year won't be less than 450,000. Let's say 30% of those cars are in Metro Manila. But the capacity of EDSA is not expanding,\" Lim said in a mix of English and Filipino. Of Grab and Uber's 42,000 drivers, the LTFRB estimates only 15,400 have the necessary permits to operate. The number of unregistered drivers ballooned over the past year as the LTFRB imposed a moratorium barring new drivers from getting temporary permits to operate while they wait for their certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Earlier, the LTFRB ordered unregistered drivers off the streets by July 26, but Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration allowing them to operate further. For better regulation, TNCs and the LTFRB have started technical working group talks, expecting to agree on the number of maximum cars that the TNCs can operate. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/jason-day-stunning-putt","title":"WATCH: Jason Day sinks stunning putt to grab share of PGA lead","date":"Jul 31, 2016 9:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Jason Day sinks a 72-foot birdie putt from way downtown","body":" SPRINGFIELD, USA - Top-ranked defending champion Jason Day sank a stunning 72-foot birdie putt at the sixth hole Sunday, July 31 to grab a share of the lead at the rain-soaked PGA Championship. Australian star Day was still playing his third round when he holed the wonder putt to reach eight under par, level with Americans Robert Streb and Jimmy Walker atop the leaderboard at a saturated par-70 Baltusrol. But his feat came as the fourth round began, the seldom-seen move of two simultaneous rounds being played without redrawing the pairings in a bid to finish on time Sunday.

Otherwise, what's the point?' transport coalition STOP and GO says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A transport coalition hit the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by a Quezon City court against Uber and GrabCar, after the judge clarified that the order won't stop existing operations of the app-based transportation network vehicle services (TNVS).  Lawyer David Erro, representing the petitioner STOP and GO coalition, said the 20-day TRO was \"useless\" if it only stops transportation agencies from accepting or processing TNVS applications without affecting existing operations. \"We were surprised by the clarification given by the judge because the very intention of our petition is to injunct operations....I don't know why, by a mere interview, the order was amended,\" Erro said during the hearing on Tuesday, December 8. In an interview with reporters, STOP and GO president Jun Magno also criticized the judge's clarification. \"We firmly believe that the TRO should cover everything, including existing operations... Otherwise, what's the point of our TRO?\" he said. Last week, Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 Judge Santiago Arenas stopped the implementation of several department orders and memorandum circulars of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The issuances outlined the guidelines for the accreditation and operation of TNVS. The TRO, however, was limited only to the processing and approval of future applications. In the 7-page TRO, Arenas said the transportation department and LTFRB should stop the \"implementation and enforcement of DOTC Department Order No 2015-11, LTFRB Memorandum Circulars Nos. 2015-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2015-18 and other issuances thereto which include the accepting, processing, and approving of applications belonging to TNVS category…for a period of 20 days effective from date of receipt.\" He made no reference to previously approved applications. Only future applications stopped Following the reports of other media organizations that the TRO supposedly covered existing Uber and Grabcar operations, the judge was prompted to issue the clarification. The TRO will not affect existing operations of TNVS units already accredited by the LTFRB. But Erro, who raised his voice several times during the hearing, said it was \"common sense\" that the group sought a TRO to stop existing operations, not future ones. He also pointed out that the operation of TNVS units falls under the DOTC's department orders, and that stopping the orders should mean stopping operations of TNVS as well. \"These TNVS are creations of the department order. We're questioning the implementation of the department order. If the court restrains that order, then existing operations should also be restrained,\" he said. But Arenas stood by the TRO, citing jurisprudence that previously issued permits are not covered by the restraining order. Arenas also said that Uber and GrabCar were neither ordered to stop their operations, nor were they named in the dispositive portion of the TRO, because the two companies were not included in the body of infomation submitted by the petitioner when they sought the TRO. STOP and GO wants to stop the operations of TNVS. The group said taxi drivers suffer lower income because of the oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units plying the streets of Metro Manila. The next hearing for the transport coalition's application for preliminary injunction is set on Tuesday, December 15. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/kalibata-city-gojek-grabbike-dilindungi","title":"Penghuni Kalibata City minta akses Go-Jek, GrabBike dilindungi","date":"Aug 10, 2015 4:06 PM PHT","snippet":"'Penghuni Apartemen Kalibata City merasa sangat resah dengan kondisi ini'.","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Persaingan antara ojek konvensional dan layanan ojek berbasis aplikasi mulai mendorong pengguna jasa tersebut untuk bersuara. Sebuah petisi di Change.org yang mengatasnamakan penghuni apartemen Kalibata City meminta pengelola gedung untuk memberi akses pada layanan daring ini.   “Saat ini di sekeliling Kalibata City dapat ditemukan poster-poster penolakan terhadap Go-Jek dan Grab Bike dari Persatuan Ojek Kalibata City,” begitu bunyi petisi yang diterbitkan hari ini, Senin, 10 Agustus.  Poster-poster yang melarang tukang ojek Go-Jek dan GrabBike dapat ditemukan di hampir di setiap akses masuk motor ke lingkungan Kalibata City Tidak hanya memasang poster, pihak-pihak yang mengaku dari kubu ojek konvensional tersebut juga diduga melakukan teror berupa pengusiran secara verbal maupun fisik.  Menurut petisi tersebut, penghuni juga ikut diteror oleh pengemudi ojek konvensional.   “Penghuni Apartemen Kalibata City merasa sangat resah dengan kondisi ini.

Myanmar's military toppled the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, and a fragile ceasefire with several armed ethnic insurgent movements is now at risk of unraveling, said Paul Sein Twa, an ethnic Karen activist. If the ceasefire collapses, communities could be forced to flee, risking the loss of their land, he said. \"The military has grabbed our lands in the past, and our worry is that it will happen again, reversing whatever we have achieved,\" said Sein Twa, who won the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize last year for his grassroots activism. \"Since the opening of the country in 2011, at least we had some democratic space in which to engage on policy matters. Now this is gone, and we risk facing more violence like before,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Myanmar authorities could not be reached for comment. Decades of ethnic conflict and military rule in Myanmar drove hundreds of thousands of people off their land and led to forced evictions and confiscations, according to a 2018 report by Human Rights Watch. Disputes over land have flared since the easing of political and economic restrictions began in 2011, as the reforms led to a rush of foreign investment and greater demand for land in a country where about 70% of the population relies on agriculture. Refugees returning to Myanmar have often found their land taken for a national park, military use or leased to palm oil concessions and rubber plantations under the 2012 Vacant, Fallow and Virgin (VFV) land law that earmarks land for commercial use. \"Given that 70% of the country's VFV lands are identified in upland ethnic areas, we can expect a bad situation to become even worse for these communities,\" said Jack Jenkins Hill, a researcher with advocacy group Tanintharyi Friends in Myanmar. \"The new military government will be desperate to shore up financial lifelines,\" he said, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 economic crisis and growing international sanctions. \"We can be sure there will be more land and resource grabs.\" Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy-led government had moved to address land issues in the country. While progress was slow, at least there was a legal process in place, said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. \"We are returning to a system of lawlessness, and ethnic people are hard put because they know that the military can seize their land with just a snap of their fingers,\" he said. Many people from ethnic groups also lack formal documents for their land, leaving them vulnerable to confiscations, said Sein Twa. \"Our forests, our land are part of our culture, our identity,\" he said. \"We will see our way of life disrupted again.\" – Thomson Reuters Foundation/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/philippine-cup-finals-game-results-ginebra-vs-tnt-december-6-2020","title":"Tenorio saves day as Ginebra nears PBA crown","date":"Dec 6, 2020 8:32 PM PHT","snippet":"LA Tenorio hits timely buckets at crunch time as Barangay Ginebra topples TNT to grab a commanding 3-1 lead in the Philippine Cup finals","body":"LA Tenorio came through down the stretch as Barangay Ginebra moved on the verge of the PBA Philippine Cup crown with a 98-88 win over TNT at the Angeles University Foundation in Pampanga on Sunday, December 6.

House committee on constitutional amendments chairperson Vicente Veloso told Rappler that this was why the panel members decided to put the Senate President as next in line should President Rodrigo Duterte be unable to perform his duties during the transition to federalism. Robredo is facing an electoral case filed by former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr, whom she beat by just 263,473 votes. \"What if say [on] February [2019], Bongbong Marcos wins and the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) says that the decision is immediately executory, then it would be Robredo this time who would be complaining. Now say 4 months after, Robredo’s motion for reconsideration wins, and again, Bongbong Marcos will be complaining?\" Veloso said on Tuesday, October 9.  \"My point is, this swing from left to right, from Robredo to Marcos, Marcos to Robredo, is just like a seesaw, creating instability which we framers of the proposed constitution cannot afford,\" he added.  Veloso explained this instability might encourage “military adventurists” to grab power from government.  \"When there is instability, adventurism comes into the picture. You cannot ignore the possibility that military adventurists would try to grab power,\" he said.  The provision on the life of succession is stipulated under Section 4, Article XVII on the Transitory Provisions of Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) No. 15, authored by Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and 21 other lawmakers. \"In case a vacancy arises by reason of removal, resignation, permanent incapacity or death of the incumbent President, the incumbent Senate President shall act as President until a President shall have been chosen and qualified,\" reads the second paragraph of Section 4.  Veloso, however, said the provision on skipping the Vice President in the line of succession during the transitory government is \"not set in stone.\" \"I, for one, am trying to reconcile the first paragraph and second paragraph. So for all you know, I will be among the congressmen who will be moving for the deletion of the second paragraph,\" said Veloso. The Robredo camp had slammed the proposal and its basis as \"outright ridiculous.\" The Supreme Court, acting as the PET, recently upheld that the ballot shading threshold – the minimum amount of shade on a ballot oval for the vote to be considered valid – is at 25%. Marcos wanted the PET to stick to a 50% shading threshold. But in the same decision, the PET also set aside the ballot shading in sorting out ballots. Instead, election returns (ERs) – the document reflecting totals from polling precincts – will now be used to determine how the votes would be credited to either candidates.  Robredo’s lawyer Bernadette Sardillo said the use of ERs will hasten the resolution of the case. The Vice President’s legal counsel Romulo Macalintal said the vice presidential electoral protest will still take several months to finish, as Marcos is contesting the results in 27 cities and provinces. Robredo had also filed a counter-protest, requesting a vote recount in 13 provinces. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/new-ride-hailing-apps-philippines-fares","title":"How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?","date":"May 24, 2018 8:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Aside from Grab and U-Hop, Filipino commuters can now choose from MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Hype, and Go Lag","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Do you know the new ride-hailing apps? With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge? New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the \"need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.\" The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city's transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don't have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn't charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Paulo Libertad, Owto's chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver's earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an \"SOS\" button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it's at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype's ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab 'illegally' charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs' fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba/james-57-topple-wizards-nba","title":"James pours in 57, toppling the Wizards to end losing skid","date":"Nov 4, 2017 1:22 PM PHT","snippet":"LeBron James makes his second-best scoring performance of 57 points while grabbing 11 boards and passing out 7 assists","body":"WASHINGTON DC, USA (UPDATED) –Four-time league MVP LeBron James poured in 57 points for the second-best scoring performance of his career as the Cleveland Cavaliers busted out of a slump with a 130-122 win over the Washington Wizards. James also delivered 11 rebounds and seven assists on Friday for the Cavaliers, who shot 56 percent from the field and improved to 4-5 on the season. The 32-year-old American sank 23 of 34 shots – including two 3-pointers – and made all nine of his free throw attempts in front of a crowd of 20,100 at the Capital One Arena in the US capital. \"I don't want to give myself a ceiling. I don't want to cap myself,\" said James, who recorded his first 50-point game since returning to his hometown Cavaliers. \"I want to be as complete a basketball player as I can be.\" \"Even rounding 33 I feel I am in the best shape of my career. I am out here, I might as well keep getting better.\" Derrick Rose added 20 points for the Cavaliers, who lost t3 games during their 4-game losing skid by double digits. Both teams were struggling heading into Friday's game as the Wizards only added to their woes, having now lost 4 of their last 5 games. Bradley Beal scored 36 points for Washington. John Wall had 13 points and 15 assists as the Wizards shot 53.6 percent from the field.  James, who is in his 15th NBA season, finished just 4 points shy of his career-high 61 set in 2014 against the Charlotte Bobcats.  But there is also something about playing the Wizards that seems to bring out the best in James. In February, James banked home the game-tying triple in the closing seconds of regulation and Cleveland went on to beat Washington 140-135 in overtime in a contest that some considered to be the league's 2016-17 regular-season game of the year. Wall and Beal told reporters earlier on Friday that they believe Cleveland purposefully dropped out of the top seed in the playoffs last season to avoid facing Washington in the early rounds. James played like someone who took that slight to heart. The Cavaliers forward scored 24 points and Cleveland shot 65.8 percent from the field in the first half for a 74-66 lead. 'On fire' \"Nothing that we did was going to work,\" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"The guy was on fire. That's what happens certain nights with great players.\"  Elsewhere, Kyrie Irving finished with 25 points as the Boston Celtics rallied from a double digit deficit to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 101-94 and extend their winning streak to 7 games. Irving scored 15 of his points in the fourth quarter. Forward Al Horford also rose to the challenge and finished with 20 points for Boston.   Paul George led the Thunder with 25 points, while Russell Westbrook had 19 points, 6 rebounds and 11 assists.  In Atlanta, James Harden had 29 points and 11 assists before sitting the fourth quarter as the Houston Rockets bombed away early from 3-point range to beat the Atlanta Hawks 119-104.   Harden was six of 11 on 3-point shots, and the Rockets took 47 of their 89 shots from behind the arc, making 16.   The Rockets had lost seven straight overall to the Hawks and hadn't won in Atlanta since 2012.  Elsewhere, Kristaps Porzingis had 37 points as the New York Knicks clawed their way back to .500 with a 120-107 win over the Phoenix Suns.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-sexual-harassment-case","title":"Taylor Swift in court as trial begins in groping case","date":"Aug 8, 2017 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"The singer alleges that radio DJ David Mueller grabbed her buttocks during a meet and greet before her concert in Denver back in June 2013","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – Pop superstar Taylor Swift was in court on Monday, August 7, as the trial began in a case pitting her against a DJ accused of groping her at an event. Eight jurors were selected Monday with Swift looking on in the courtroom, a court employee confirmed to Agence France-Presse. According to local media, she sat with her lawyers, dressed in a light top and dark blazer. Swift, 27, could take the stand to give details of the alleged assault during a meet and greet 4 years ago.  Swift says radio DJ David Mueller grabbed her buttock during a visit backstage at the Pepsi Center in Denver in June 2013 before a concert. Mueller was sacked two days after the allegations by his local employer, radio station KYGO.  He launched a lawsuit against Swift in September 2015, alleging that she should have called the police rather than his managers and that she had caused him to lose his job and salary. Mueller accuses Swift's aides of calling the radio station to demand his firing the day after the encounter, according to court documents. Mueller said in the lawsuit he was aware of an incident but said it was one of his friends who had touched her inappropriately and then bragged about it. Swift has counter-sued for sexual assault, saying she was \"forced to start a one hour concert before 13,000 fans while still in distress after being so inappropriately touched.\"  A photo published by the TMZ celebrity news website showing Swift posing between Mueller and his girlfriend is expected to be among the key pieces of evidence.  In the image, the DJ's hand is level with the pop-star's backside but it's not clear if he is touching her. Swift testified at a deposition that she is certain Mueller intentionally grabbed her. Mueller denies it and is suing the singer-songwriter for $3 million while Swift is seeking a symbolic $1 and a ruling that holds him responsible. The \"Shake It Off\" and \"Bad Blood\" singer argues that a verdict in her favor will serve as an example for other women who might fear coming forward in similar circumstances.  Opening statements are expected from Tuesday. The trial is expected to last about 9 days. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/fiba/fiba-3x3-u18-boys-7th-place-girls-improve-5th","title":"FIBA 3x3 U18 boys fall to 7th place, girls improve to 5th seed","date":"May 30, 2017 5:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Team Philippines FIBA 3x3 Under-18 boys fail to grab top spot but the girls shock spectators as they sweep the eliminations round","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Days after the Philippines ended its journey in the FIBA Under-18 World Cup tournament, head coach Anton Altamirano shared the team’s disappointment in failing to secure the top spot in the international event. The Philippines bid goodbye to its FIBA 3x3 U18 stint after falling short to host country Malaysia, 17-21, at Cyberjaya on Saturday, May 27. “It’s kind of disappointing because we only made it to the quarterfinals. I think we could’ve done better if only we didn’t lose to Malaysia,” said Altamirano. Losing to Malaysia paved the way for the Philippines' game with defending champion Qatar. According to Altamirano, the boys could have sealed the tourney with a better position if they didn’t go up against Qatar right away. “Qatar was the team we were avoiding. We played well against them but they were just too big and strong,” stressed the coach, who has mentored the FIBA 3x3 boys and girls campaign for 3 years. The Philippines clinched a silver medal last year but finished only 7th this time. Team Philippines was represented by Rhayyan Amsali, Michael Malonzo, Kris Pagsanjan, Hope Christian, and Andrew Velasco.

The girls, composed of Melody Cac, Kristine Cayabyab, Reynalyn Ferrer, Mayu Goto, almost got through the quarterfinals and finished in 5th place. “We’re proud of how they (girls) played. The basketball program for girls in the Philippines is really improving.

Dela Rosa made this clear on Wednesday, October 5, after a photo of two female police officers posing with Mark Anthony Fernandez went viral on social media after the actor was arrested for possessing marijuana.  “Personally, I don’t like that picture because as law enforcers… ano ba, nai-starstruck ka pa rin sa isang criminal offender? On the other hand, naiintindihan ko rin naman ang aking mga policewomen dahil nakalimutan siguro nila na sila ay pulis. Nangingibabaw sa kanila 'yung kanilang pagka-movie fan siguro or pagkadalaga or pagkababae na nakita nila 'yung actor na magandang lalaki,” said Dela Rosa in a chance interview at the National Police Commission headquarters in Quezon City. (Personally, I don’t like that picture because as law enforcers, what, you still get starstruck by a criminal offender? On the other hand, I understand our policewomen because maybe they forgot they’re cops. Maybe their being movie fans, single women, womanhood got the best of them because they saw this actor who’s good-looking.) Fernandez was arrested in Pampanga on Monday, October 3, after he was caught with a kilo of marijuana, which is illegal in the Philippines. He initially denied owning the contraband drug, but later said he used it to “fight cancer.” Fernandez tested positive for marijuana use. Fernandez faces charges for transporting, possessing, and using marijuana. “I have to remind them (policewomen) that they shouldn’t be doing that. That’s tantamount to conduct unbecoming of a police officer. You’re even posting on social media that you were starstruck by a suspect,” Dela Rosa said in a mix of English and Filipino.  He said he would refer the case to the PNP’s Internal Affairs Service to see if the two cops violated any police policies. Dela Rosa said that the viral photo should serve as a cautionary tale for police. The PNP has been saying that it plans to conduct anti-illegal drugs operations on celebrities following reports of a supposed “list” of local stars with links to illegal drugs. The PNP chief earlier said they might conduct “Oplan Tokhang” on celebrities, either at their homes or through their home networks. “Tokhang” the “knock and plead” operation, wherein cops knock on the doors of suspected drug users and pushers to convince them to change their ways. The term is derived from the Bisaya words “toktok”  (to knock) and “hangyo” (to plead). It’s an operation that began in Davao City when Dela Rosa was its city director and President Rodrigo Duterte was still the mayor. “Bawal 'yan, bawal (That's not allowed),” said Dela Rosa, after explaining he was worried his personnel would take photo ops with celebrities should they conduct “Tokhang” in their homes. “I don’t see anything wrong with it as their commander, but it looks bad especially for ordinary criminals because it seems as through we have double standards,” he added. Dela Rosa, a new-found “celebrity” himself since assuming the PNP’s top post, added in jest: “Pero ako personally, ha, 'yun nga sinasabi ko, naiintindihan ko ang kanilang pagiging starstruck dahil marami ring taong nai-starstruck sa akin.” (But personally, I’m saying I understand their being starstruck because a lot of people are also starstruck when they see me.)

Gastador had to replace Dinolan, who was favoring his left arm, but failed to convert the freebies. He, however, made up for it by sinking a layup to once again tie the game at 79-all. Tallo gave the Cobras the upperhand once again but a hard foul on Villafranca by Juju Bautista had the Jaguars nipping at the heels of the Cobras by just a point after Villafranca split his charities.

A video of the April 16 operation shows Alondra Luna Nuñez screaming as officers shove her inside a police vehicle in the central state of Guanajuato before flying her to a woman in Texas who thought she was her daughter. The images spread on social media and gripped Mexico. But the teenager was finally back with her real parents after a DNA test proved on Monday that she was not the daughter of the woman in Texas. \"Ask me all the questions you want tomorrow. Right now, I want to be with my parents,\" Luna said at the Guanajuato airport, where a crowd of journalists awaited her arrival. Her parents did not rule out taking legal action against the officials and judge who ordered police to take Luna and fly her to Texas. \"I want to enjoy being with my daughter. Thank you all for supporting us,\" her father Gustavo Luna told reporters. \"Right now, what I want is to speak with my daughter,\" he said. \"I think that all the authorities involved in this were wrong.\" Luna seemed to hold no grudge, saying she hoped the Texas woman, Dorotea Garcia, ended up finding her daughter. They spoke by phone. \"She told me to forgive her for everything she had done to us,\" Luna told reporters. 'Happy ending' The foreign ministry said in a statement that the case dates back to 2007, when Mexican authorities received a request for the return of a minor whose father brought her to the country from the United States. In March this year, US authorities told Mexican counterparts that the mother of the child had traveled to Guanajuato and had identified the girl as her daughter after an eight-year search. A Mexican judge subsequently asked the international police organization, Interpol, for assistance to get the girl, even though her real family insisted it was a case of mistaken identity, the ministry said. The DNA test showed that the woman who asked for the girl's return was not her mother. The woman, who has not seen her daughter for 8 years, had thought that Luna had the same scar as her daughter between her eyebrows. The foreign ministry stressed that it was \"just acting as a facilitator\" at the start of court proceedings and coordinated collaboration between US and Mexican authorities in the return of minors. The governmental National Human Rights Commission has taken up the case. Guanajuato's Governor Miguel Marquez, who was at the airport, praised the girl's courage during her ordeal. \"This has a happy ending. Fortunately, thank God, the family is reunited,\" he said. \"They didn't lose their heads. They stayed calm.\" – Gabriela Montenajo, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/india-ruling-party-faces-state-election-mauling","title":"India ruling party faces state election mauling","date":"Dec 8, 2013 4:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Initial tallies showed Congress, in power at national level for a decade, losing control of all four state assemblies up for grabs in Sunday's vote count","body":"NEW DELHI, India – India's ruling Congress party suffered an electoral humiliation Sunday, December 8, at the hands of the main opposition and an anti-corruption movement, in the last major test before next year's national polls. Initial tallies showed Congress, in power at national level for a decade, losing control of all four state assemblies up for grabs in Sunday's vote count, including in New Delhi where it was set to come a distant third. Sheila Dikshit, chief minister of the capital for the last 15 years, acknowledged Congress had been toppled after only half a dozen of the 70 seats in Delhi had been declared. \"We accept our defeat and we will analyze what went wrong,\" said Dikshit, one of the country's most powerful politicians. \"We thank the people of Delhi for having supported the Congress for 15 years.\" While the outcome is a boost for the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), analysts said the stunning support for an anti-graft party in the Delhi contest signaled a wider anger with mainstream politics. Elections in the four states – Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh – have been held at different points over the last month but the counting had been postponed until Sunday. Votes will be counted in the remote Congress-ruled state of Mizoram on Monday, December 9. While the full results would not be announced until much later, the electoral commission and Indian television said early tallies indicated the BJP would win by a landslide in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and was running neck and neck with Congress in Chhattisgarh. But the main focus was on New Delhi, where Congress was facing a wipeout. The electoral commission said on its website that the BJP had either won or was in the lead in 31 of the 70 seats, making it the largest party. But it predicted that the BJP would be deprived of an outright majority by the fledgling Aam Aadmi Party (Common People's Party), which had won or was ahead in counting in 29 seats despite only launching last year. Congress was on course to win just eight seats, according to the commission. Dikshit, India's longest-serving chief minister, was expected her to lose her seat to AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, a former civil servant. \"We have succeeded in altering the political discourse of the elections,\" Athishi Marlena, one of Kejriwal's top lieutenants, told the NDTV network. \"I think it's historic that a party that was formed just a year ago, a party which was written off till yesterday by the other two big parties, has made such a spectacular debut.\" Triumphant Aam Aadmi supporters who had gathered at the party headquarters could be seen waving brooms – the symbol of its pledge to clean up politics. BJP activists celebrated in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, dancing to the beat of drums, bursting firecrackers and waving the party's lotus symbol. Human Resources Development Minister Shashi Tharoor acknowledged the results were a wake-up call but questioned whether the corruption issue would be such a factor in the general election. \"Since we are looking forward to elections in five months' time in the entire country, I think there are legitimate questions whether this appeal can be replicated elsewhere,\" he said. The assembly votes mark the last major test before Congress and the BJP, fielding hardliner Narendra Modi as its candidate for the premiership, face off in the general election due by May. Analyst Amulya Ganguli said the chickens were coming home to roost for Congress after economic growth slowed to around five percent and following a series of corruption scandals. \"Had they managed to keep the economy buoyant, then that would have at least been a buffer against the numerous scams during their time,\" he said. The elections are also a test for Modi, who is popular with middle-class voters but whose reputation was tarnished by deadly anti-Muslim riots that occurred on his watch as Gujarat chief minister in 2002. Modi voiced delight on Twitter, congratulating the party's leaders in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for their \"wonderful performance\" and \"historic victory\". Modi, 63, will likely face Congress scion Rahul Gandhi, 43, whose family has given India three premiers, on the national campaign trail. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/palace-cites-online-survey-showing-support-for-garcia-suspension","title":"Palace cites online survey showing support for Garcia suspension","date":"Dec 23, 2012 7:56 PM PHT","snippet":"The survey shows that 61.27 percent of its respondents said Garcia deserved the suspension while 34.29 percent said it is a case of “power grabbing”","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Malacañang on Sunday, December 23, cited an informal survey conducted by Cebu Daily News (CDN) showing support for the government move to suspend Cebu Gov Gwendolyn Garcia.“We certainly encourage Governor Garcia to follow the rule of law.

More than 4,000 polling venues across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including a windmill, several pubs, a hair salon and a chip shop, opened their doors for a day of voting that ends at 2200 GMT. All eyes will be on the winter weather, with forecasts of near-freezing temperatures, rain and even snow that could affect turn-out in the first December election in nearly a century. Up for grabs are all 650 seats in the British parliament, which has been deadlocked since the 2016 referendum on EU membership that saw a majority vote to leave. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who took over from Theresa May in July after she was unable to get parliament to approve her EU divorce deal, is hoping to secure both a mandate and a majority. Johnson's Conservatives need just 9 more seats for a majority, which would allow him to push through his own Brexit deal with Brussels and take Britain out of the bloc by the end of January. Johnson said Thursday was a chance to end more than 3 years of political deadlock and uncertainty. \"Just imagine how wonderful it will be to settle down to a turkey dinner this Christmas with Brexit decided,\" he said in a final message to voters. \"This election is our chance to end the gridlock but the result is on a knife-edge,\" he said. Crossroads Looking to stop Johnson is the main opposition Labour party. Victory would make its 70-year-old leader Jeremy Corbyn the first Labour prime minister since Gordon Brown in 2010 – and the oldest first-time premier since Viscount Palmerston in 1855. Corbyn is proposing to renegotiate softer exit terms with Brussels within 3 months and put them to a new referendum, alongside an option to remain in the 27-member bloc, after a three-month campaign. A franchise extension would enable millions of EU nationals in Britain to vote in the referendum. Corbyn said Britain was at a crossroads and the election was \"truly historic.\" \"Vote for hope. Vote for real change,\" he said. The election features 3,321 candidates – from 18-year-olds to octogenarians – in constituencies covering windswept Shetland off northeast Scotland, to the Isles of Scilly more than 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) away off Cornwall, in southwest England. The first indication of the overall result will come in an exit poll at 2200 GMT. The first actual result is due from around 2300 GMT. The remainder will trickle in overnight. Johnson has hammered home his message to \"Get Brexit Done\" against a backdrop of voter fatigue at the election – the third in less than 5 years – and the tortuous Brexit process. But the EU itself has indicated the chances of securing a comprehensive trade deal before a December 2020 deadline is unrealistic. That would again raise the prospect of Britain facing a \"no deal\" scenario, plunging business and the British economy into fresh uncertainty. Corbyn, meanwhile, has had to brush off claims of indecision about his neutral Brexit stance, and claims of anti-Semitism within Labour. Questions have also been asked about the cost for his radical leftist program for massive public sector investment and renationalization of some key sectors. He has positioned Labour as the only defender of the UK's cherished state health care system that he alleges Johnson wants to sell off in a \"toxic\" post-Brexit trade deal with US President Donald Trump. Shock result? Pollsters YouGov last month predicted that Johnson's Conservatives would have a comfortable 68-seat majority but on Tuesday, December 10, indicated that projection been cut to 28. Brexit has turned traditional political allegiances on their head and shock results could be on the cards, with tactical voting expected along Leave/Remain, rather than party lines. Labour's so-called \"Red Wall\" in northern England – which mainly voted to leave the EU – is being watched closely for Conservative gains, as is north Wales, another traditional bastion of the left. \"There's more volatility than there ever has been before,\" said Chris Curtis, political research manager at YouGov, pointing to an increase in swing voters. \"At this stage, the most likely outcome is a Conservative majority,\" he told Agence France-Presse. \"However, a hung parliament is possible but also a much larger Conservative majority isn't something that we could rule out.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/game-results-ust-nu-march-9-2019","title":"UST turns back gritty NU for 2nd straight win","date":"Mar 9, 2019 6:06 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) After stunning La Salle, the UST Tigresses drub the NU Lady Bulldogs to grab  a share of 3rd place in the UAAP women's volleyball tournament","body":"  MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – After conquering defending champion La Salle, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Golden Tigresses sustained their hot run in the UAAP Season 81 women's volleyball tournament.  UST defeated a young but gritty National University (NU) squad in 4 sets, 26-24, 25-17, 23-25, 25-17, to grab a share of 3rd place on Saturday, March 9, at the Filoil Flying V Arena.  Rookie sensation Eya Laure put up another 20-point performance to lead the Tigresses while Sisi Rondina chipped in 16 points and 10 excellent receptions. Dimdim Pacres had a great end-to-end game with a double-double of 12 points and 15 excellent digs. UST head coach Emilio “Kung Fu” Reyes thinks their first back-to-back wins mean that the Tigresses have started picking up momentum. “Importante ’yung morale ng bata.

The new constitution, expected to be put to a referendum by the spring, would replace the basic law drawn up after Turkey's 1980 military coup. It seeks to establish for the first time a presidential system for ruling the modern republic created from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire. Critics have claimed the move is part of a power grab by Erdogan – Turkey's premier from 2003-2014 and then president – for one-man rule following a failed coup in July. But Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) say the presidential system would bring Turkey into line with countries such as France and the United States and is needed for efficient government. 'Two captains sink the boat' The proposed constitution is expected to lead to the creation of the posts of vice presidents and the abolition of the office of prime minister.  In a late address to the parliament, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, an Erdogan loyalist, said: \"There will be no prime minister, yes, no prime minister. We are not crazy for power,\" in comments applauded loudly by the ruling party lawmakers in the house. \"Two captains sink the boat. There must be one captain,\" he said. The debates on the 18-article new constitution began after the draft was agreed by a parliamentary commission. The two readings are expected to last around two weeks. There were protests from some quarters as parliament began its deliberations. Selahattin Demirtas, the jailed co-leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), slammed the debates from behind bars, the private Dogan news agency reported. He said the arrest of 11 members of the party for alleged ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) had stripped them of their chance to challenge the draft constitution and \"makes the debate and the vote controversial from the very start\". A rally outside the parliament building in Ankara against the change descended into violence after riot police used tear gas and pepper spray on the demonstrators. Police also fired water cannons to disperse protesters, pushing back with their shields those who returned to the fray. 'Checks on power' \"We don't want a system where only one man leads,\" demonstrator Abdullah Sundal told AFPTV. \"We will do everything in our power\" to stop the draft becoming law, he said. The AKP needs more than 330 votes – a 3/5 majority – for the bill to be submitted to a referendum for voters' approval. However, the November 2015 election left the AKP short of a super majority in parliament and it is relying on the support of the opposition right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the fourth largest in the legislature. The new constitution is opposed by the biggest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), whose deputy chairman Bulent Tezcan said it would restore powers \"to the palace\" taken away from the Ottoman Sultan a century ago. \"There'll be no censure motions, no vote of confidence, no parliamentary inquiries,\" fellow CHP lawmaker Deniz Baykal warned. But on Monday, AKP's parliamentary group deputy chairman Mustafa Elitas said he was expecting at least 20 deputies from the opposition CHP to cross the aisle to vote with the government. If  the measure is approved by parliament, a referendum is expected to take place within 60 days, indicating a date in late March or early April. Pro-government newspapers have predicted a thumping victory for the ruling party although other commentators have been more cautious about the results. 'Alarming' Under the proposed changes, there would no longer be a formal cabinet but there will be ministers, whom the president will have the power to appoint and fire. The president would be elected for a 5-year term and serve for a maximum of two mandates.  If Erdogan's existing time as president is not counted, it would mean in theory he could stay in office until 2029. Parliamentary elections would be held every 5 years – not 4 as at present – and on the same day as presidential polls. Both elections would be scheduled to take place on November 3, 2019. Along with a slew of terror attacks, the political uncertainty has been one of the factors pressuring the Turkish lira, which has lost 18 percent in value against the dollar over the last three months. The currency slumped to a new record low on Monday, a situation LCG senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya described as \"alarming\". And the upcoming constitution referendum \"could push the country toward a greater chaos and further weigh on its currency,\" she warned. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/davao-mar-roxas-visit","title":"Davao journos ask Roxas: Will you campaign in city too?","date":"Mar 12, 2016 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"It's not a question of grabbing votes from Rodrigo Duterte or Jejomar Binay, says Roxas of his campaign schedule, but about presenting his platform and plans for the country","body":"Liberal Party standard-bearer Mar Roxas had only been in Davao Region for a few hours but Davao City-based media immediately wanted to know: was he or wasn't he planning to hold a campaign rally in the city, bailiwick and center of support for one of his rivals, city mayor Rodrigo Duterte? It was among the first few questions asked of Roxas in a chance interview with reporters on Tuesday, March 8, on the sidelines of a visit to a cooperative-owned banana processing plant in Davao del Norte. The LP standard-bearer was first asked if he had activities in the cities itself, to which Roxas said he did with \"non-con\" groups, meaning supporters outside of political organizations. Prior to his visit to Kapalong, Roxas was also in Davao City for a radio interview over Radyo Bombo.  Roxas said he was “not yet” going to hold a campaign rally during this particular visit but said that he “eventually” would. The visit to Davao comes just a day after he attended an event in Makati City, bailiwick of presidential candidate Vice President Jejomar Binay.

Pag-aari ito ng sambayanang Pilipino, pag-aari ito ng ating mga kababayan. Sila ang nakatira dito. Kinabukasan nila ang ating ipinaglalaban at isinusulong. Kaya wala naman itong ibang dahilan kundi kausapin ang ating mga kababayan at ipepresenta sa kanila ang mga plataporma, mga programa.

They live here. It’s their future that we’re fighting for and pushing forward. So there’s no other reason behind my visits but simply to talk to our countrymen, to present my platform and programs. And I’m happy because of the warm welcome here.) Roxas visited 3 provinces in the Davao Region on Tuesday, attending forums with local leaders and gracing the founding anniversary of Compostela Valley province. If latest preference polls are to be believed, the region is overwhelmingly for Duterte (some 79% of those surveyed by Laylo).

With sweat dropping from every fiber of his body and a quadricep clearly hobbled, most his shots were blocked multiple times by the opponents' superior import. The rest of his teammates weren't any better, going one-on-one almost every play and taking ineffective shot attempts.  By the start of the fourth period, it was no longer a game. And it didn't take after long for the final buzzer to ring, signaling a 83-70 victory for Purefoods - their first in the 2015 PBA Commissioner's Cup - at the Cuneta Astrodome - the same arena where their previous championship dynasty came to an end. \"We're all about moving forward,\" said Purefoods head coach Tim Cone, whose team was eliminated by the Meralco Bolts the last time they were at the Cuneta Astrodome. \"We don't look back in our defeats and we don't look back at our wins. And that's what makes this team successful.\"  (RELATED: Meralco Bolts overcome slow start to down KIA) By the look of their performance, he's right. Purefoods was lethal against GlobalPort, led by their temporary import Marqus Blakely who put up 26 points, grabbed 18 rebounds, and swatted 7 shots.   \"He's like a warm blanket because we know him so well, we know what we can do with him, he's comfortable with all our defensive schemes,\" Cone said. \"He plays so much bigger than 6-5. He plays like he's 6-9.\" Blakely dislocated his shoulder during the game, but the team's trainers popped it back in and he was able to close out the contest. PJ Simon missed the game due to a back injury, while Marc Pingris was hounded by the same issue but still came off the bench to record 6 points and 6 rebounds.  Mark Barroca and Alex Mallari each played well, putting up a combined 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 assists. James Yap scored 9, and Justin Melton put up 8.  \"We're no longer in the mountain top, but if we want to get back to the mountain top, it's going to be through the defense we play,\" said Cone. On Friday, his words rang true to his players, who forced GlobalPort to 35% shooting from the floor.  \"Three or four times I think we held them to 24-second violations because we were able to sustain our defense,\" Cone said.  The Batang Pier were led by Leslie, who finished with 25 points on 22 shot attempts and 8 rebounds. Terrence Romeo scored 19 on 8-of-17 shooting.  \"It feels good to come out and get our first game. I can't remember the last time we won the first game of the conference. Hopefully that bodes well for us,\" Cone said.  Both teams countered punches in the first half, with Purefoods ahead only by five, 41-36, at the start of the third quarter. But that would quickly change as the Hotshots unleashed a 20-10 run to build a 15 point lead, and later went up by 18, 68-50.  GlobalPort got stuck in such a big hole due to their putrid offense, which yielded tons of contested midrange jumpers. With Leslie playing but banged up, the team also had no inside presence. Purefoods' lead was cut to 11 midway through the fourth, but they managed to rack up consecutive field goals - capped off by a thunderous alley-oop slam by Blakely from Barroca - to seal the contest. The Hotshots will be back in action on Tuesday, February 3, against the Alaska Aces. \"It's harder to play the runners-up than it is the champions,\" Cone said about his team's next opponents, who are coming off a finals loss to the San Miguel Beermen in the Philippine Cup. But Purefoods is dangerous as well.

All those guys have been drafted into the PBA and are playing at a higher level. In the current UAAP season, UE’s Roi Sumang rules the roost of point guards. Or does he? Is UE’s top gun part of the current top five point guards, or is he outside looking in? Using the average Player Efficiency (EFF) calculation, here are the the top five UAAP point guards as of August 1, 2014: **EFF = {[(points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks) – (turnovers + field goals missed + free throws missed)] ÷ # of games}  5. Dan Alberto (UE) – 8.3ppg, 2.0apg, 1.3rpg, 1.0spg, 2.3 triples per game, .563 3pt%, 8.3 EFF - Nope. It’s not a mistake. UE’s second-string playmaker has been more efficient that its starter and bona fide superstar, Roi Sumang. Alberto plays just 16 minutes per game, but he’s the team’s third-best scorer and sharpest three-point shooter. Don’t sleep on his 2 assists and 1 steal per outing, too. 4. Jamil Sheriff (UST) – 4.3ppg, 5.3rpg, 1.7apg, 1.7spg, .667 FG%, 8.3 EFF - How does a 5-foot-7 guy grab more than 5 rebounds per game in the most competitive collegiate league in the country? Beats me, but, hey, this guy is actually doing it. This Fil-Canadian won’t wow you with his scoring prowess (despite shooting better than 66% from the floor), but he does the little things, the dirty work, than enables a team to be competitive. Still, he sure as hell ain’t no Jeric Fortuna. 3. Nico Elorde (AdMU) – 7.0ppg, 3.8rpg, 4.5apg, 1.3spg, .750 FT%, 9.0 EFF - Elorde wasn’t projected to start this year. That was supposed to be Jerie Pingoy’s job, but we all know what happened, right? Elorde has really come into his own, though, running second overall in assists per game while also among the league’s top five in steals. Now if he can only make a three… (He’s 0/10 so far in four games) 2. Achie Iñigo (FEU) – 4.8ppg, 4.8rpg, 3.3apg, 1.0spg, 9.3 EFF - After the departure of both Terrence Romeo and RR Garcia, the point guard position was supposed to be FEU’s Achilles’s Heel, but, instead, Iñigo has done a bang-up job for coach Nash Racela. The former Letran Squire has really stepped up, grabbing rebounds, dishing dimes, and getting steals while leaving the scoring to Mike Tolomia and Mac Belo.  1. Gelo Alolino (NU) – 11.6ppg, 3.8rpg, 2.0apg, 1.8spg, 1.2 triples per game, .333 3pt%, .800 FT%, 11.4 EFF - Here’s an interesting fact: Alolino has upped his scoring, shooting, and steals numbers this year despite playing 7 fewer minutes per game for the Bulldogs. Now that, my friends, is efficiency. And where are the Dogs now? Right on top of the standings with three wins in four games. Until Sumang gets his act together, there’s no toppling Alolino at the peak of the UAAP’s PGs.

Kidd, after all, has had a history of personal and professional indiscretions, if not outright transgressions, that he has to be viewed not only from the prism of his having a job to do but also from the perspective of how he relates with other people, particularly his colleagues in his profession. Now, we’re not about to pontificate here, much less cast judgment on the character of a person like Kidd, a 10-time All-Star as a player and, some say surefire future Hall of Famer. But we feel there’s a need to look into the circumstances of his hiring by the Bucks, as well as his departure from Brooklyn, where he spent almost seven years of his prime as a player and earned those credentials to be considered as a candidate for the shrine in Springfield, Massachusetts.   Doing this would then give especially those who didn’t quite catch Kidd’s prime as a pro of 19 years a better perspective of what, who and how the 41-year-old six-time All-Pro evolved into the person that he is today, and how he figures to act in the days to come in Milwaukee.  Again, not to try to sound like a clairvoyant but if and when something happens, we’d be able to say, “Didn’t we tell you?” Kidd’s eventful, sometimes-twisting but short journey that eventually took him to Suds City didn’t follow the usual script that attends such a hiring.  In simple terms, he, with the help of his agent Jeff Schwartz who was said to wield “incredible” power and influence with the Nets’ majority owner Mikhail Prokhorov, earlier tried to grab full control of the basketball operations in Brooklyn, asking for a job title that would allow him to run the team and put him above general manager Billy King.   Zach Lowe, writing for Grantland, described the attempt as Machiavellian. “But Machiavelli was rational,” Lowe said. “Kidd would seem to lack any understanding of his place in the world if he truly believes himself worthy of the kind of dual role Doc Rivers, Stan Van Gundy, and (to a degree) Gregg Popovich worked their whole lives to get.  This was the equivalent of Jordan Crawford saying he might be better than Michael Jordan.” But if Kidd expected Prokhorov, the third-richest Russian according to Forbes with a net worth of $10.9 billion, to accede to his bidding, he got the surprise of his life when he was flatly denied.  To Prokhorov and his colleagues, the attempt at the power grab represented a sense of betrayal among them after having earlier given Kidd special treatment and certain concessions.   Back in December, when the Nets had a slow start, management seriously considered firing Kidd, who, fresh from his retirement with cross-town rival New York, was clearly having difficulty adjusting to the job on the bench.  But Nets officials, some of whom had wanted to bring in Lionel Hollins to replace Kidd, eventually decided to give their former star a chance. They were hoping that the star-studded roster, which included Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, the last two of whom the Nets acquired from Boston in a trade in the offseason, would eventually prove equal to its $100 million payroll, the highest in league history (that doesn’t even include $90 million in luxury tax payments), and enable Kidd to weather the early storm. On top of this, they also acceded to Kidd’s pleading to make Lawrence Frank the highest-paid assistant coach in the league, giving him an escalating six-year deal worth more than $6 million.  But just weeks after the season started, Kidd asked management to demote Frank, and although the team’s leadership did not agree with it since it believed Frank was doing a fine job, it eventually relented just to keep the peace and gave the impression it was a collective decision. Truth is, it was only Kidd’s, in order to placate “all his insecurities and need to place blame,” as one insider put it.  As part of his bluster, Kidd for a time declared he would personally pay the balance of Frank’s contract but he quickly backtracked, and ownership was left in the end to pay the balance.  With help from his veterans, however, Kidd did turn the Nets’ season around to push them to the No. 6 seed in the playoffs, where they beat Toronto in seven games in the first round but ultimately lost in five games to Miami in the second round. But Kidd had shown potential as a very good coach, making up for Lopez’s almost-season-long injury absence by turning the Nets into an efficient small-ball unit that maximized the three-point shot and forced numerous turnovers on defense. He demonstrated his creativity midway through the Toronto series by replacing Shaun Livingston in the starting lineup with Alan Anderson to space the floor, a move that proved crucial to the Nets’ first-round triumph.   He also impressed management back in December by “unilaterally” banishing Andray Blatche, the same big man whom the Philippine Congress naturalized to be able to play for Gilas Pilipinas in this coming August’s FIBA World Cup and the Asian Games, reportedly because of his poor conditioning and game preparedness. Kidd told the 6-foot-11 power forward-center to come back only when he was ready while the Nets cloaked the absence, which was a virtual suspension, as driven by “personal reasons,” but Kidd showed right there the strong leadership that the club wanted. If the Nets, however, thought they could parlay that leadership into many years of productive bench work, they were rudely surprised when Kidd and Schwartz came to Prokhorov last month and laid down what they wanted. Already, there were rumblings that Kidd was not happy with King as the primary orchestrator of Brooklyn’s personnel moves. Back in December and January, Kidd reportedly approached Prokhorov to express concerns about King’s performance, his commitment as well as his vision for the future. Though he never pitched himself for the job at that point, his displeasure with King supposedly escalated when Jason Terry and Reggie Evans were traded to Sacramento for guard Marcus Thornton. Kidd’s eventual power play gained momentum when Milwaukee, whose new ownership that bought the Bucks for $550 million last April included Marc Lasry, a former Kidd confidant and business partner, sought the Nets’ permission to talk to Kidd earlier in June, presumably about its head coaching post that was still occupied by Larry Drew. When the Nets did not respond quickly, Kidd and his team started their play for the Nets’ double job in earnest. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports said that Kidd’s hunger for more power and money had actually gone into overdrive when Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher, two former role players with no previous head coaching experience, were signed this summer into contracts that were substantially bigger than the Nets had given Kidd. While Kidd only got a three-year, $10.5 million deal, Golden State gave Kerr a four-year deal worth $16 million and the Knicks gave Fisher a four-year contract worth $20 million. This was on top of Van Gundy’s hiring by Detroit as both president of basketball operations and headman after being fired in 2012 by Orlando. “That got him – especially Fisher,” an official close to the situation said.

His less-than-savory history made teams wary of giving him a shot as head coach when it became apparent he was calling it a career – at least until he has proven himself – nor did it give Brooklyn the confidence to pay him more than his market value.   The Nets, however, were willing to take a chance on him despite a driving-while-intoxicated guilty plea that stemmed from a charge in 2012 when he joined the Knicks, leaving him suspended for his first two games as an NBA headman. This, of course, is on top of his career-long history of clashing with front-office executives and coaches, which has also led to his seldom having had a graceful exit from any team he had played with. This included his original drafting team Dallas where he won co-Rookie of the Year honors in 1995 with Detroit’s Grant Hill and where he clashed with fellow star Jimmy Jackson over a supposed love triangle that involved singer Toni Braxton, Phoenix, New Jersey, and Dallas again where he was thought to have bailed out to force his way into New York for his final season. “There have often been hard feelings and acrimony necessitating a move, or the cause of him forcing his way out,” Wojnarowski said. The list of less-than-wholesome incidents Kidd has been involved in while with the NBA is indeed long. Before the Nets traded Kidd back to Dallas in 2008, team officials believed he had faked a migraine to miss a game against the Knicks. When Byron Scott was fired by the Nets as headman in 2004, there was an unconfirmed notion that it was Kidd who worked for his ouster. Of course, who can forget that game against the LA Lakers in November, where Kidd asked Nets guard Tyshawn Taylor to bump into him on his way out in a substitution so he could spill his soda on the floor to cause a game delay and enable the Nets to map out a play with Brooklyn out of timeouts? Kidd was fined $50,000 by the league for that stunt, and another $25,000 for complaining about a lack of fouls called against Toronto in a 115-113 loss in their playoff series against the Raptors. And just while Kidd was near his peak as a player in January 2001, he was arrested and pleaded guilty to a domestic-abuse charge for assaulting his then-wife Joumana. He was ordered to attend anger management classes for six months and also completed the mandatory counseling. The couple, which has three children, filed for divorce in 2007, with Joumana claiming that Jason, among countless instances of abuse, “broke her rib and damaged her hearing by smashing her head into… a car.”  Kidd now has two children with his second wife Porschla, whom he married in 2011. But what definitely takes the cake thus far among Kidd’s list of indiscretions is his botched power grab in Brooklyn, and his subsequent play in Milwaukee that reportedly also involved, at first, full control of the Bucks’ basketball operations. Kidd reportedly didn’t plan to take over as president and coach right away, but was definitely intrigued by the “higher-paying, lower-workload life” of a top executive.  It was something that was initially met with derision by the basketball community not only because it essentially constituted another power grab, this time against Bucks GM John Hammond and his top deputy David Morway, but also because Kidd has not had any front-office experience whatsoever. “For an NBA figure with such a damaged personal reputation – never mind front-office experience – the possibility of Kidd being afforded this kind of power and responsibility is being met with downright mockery among NBA owners and executives,” Wojnarowski wrote. After the Bucks agreed to send two second-round picks to the Nets to allow Kidd to go to Milwaukee, the franchise then announced it was hiring Kidd as its new head coach, leaving Drew by the wayside of a process that neither he nor Hammond even had an inkling of until it broke on June 28, or exactly just three days before Kidd’s introduction was made. Bucks management tried to make an effort at damage control, with Lasry and partner Wes Edens admitting they made some errors in the entire process and were wrong in not bringing Hammond into the loop earlier.  “We were asked to keep it confidential,” Lasry said.   “In retrospect, that was a mistake. I would tell you that it was very much newness.  We’ve learned a lot in this process.  Our view, and it hasn’t changed from the beginning, is that all the basketball operations goes through John.  In this process, we learned we made a mistake.” But what about Drew, the biggest casualty in this entire episode thus far?  Kidd broke the coach’s code by interviewing for a job that had an occupant. Even Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson, who have much more cachet as coach than Kidd has, always made it a point to avoid discussing jobs that were not open yet. It’s a code of conduct that’s observed league-wide because no matter the competitiveness and the rivalries that inevitably arise among coaches, there remains a healthy respect. Kidd is being bashed for seizing an occupied job by obviously leveraging his relationship with an owner of the franchise. The unpredictability of the league’s hiring practices has made such stunts for richer contracts and more power, as pulled off by Kidd, possible, particularly when an owner like Lasry gives his consent to such a behavior. “This is business,” Kidd said matter-of-factly when asked about the swift turn of events.  “It’s business. That’s what it comes down to.” Kidd’s contract with the Bucks is for three years and an estimated $12-$15 million, and he later denied he had any plans of seeking a higher position like he did in Brooklyn or, at first, with his new franchise. He said he is confident that Hammond, whose contract runs up to the 2016 season, can do a good job.  “He is great.  He’s a leader,” he said.  “He understands the league.  He’s been doing it for a long time.  I trust him like no other.” The Bucks, meanwhile, swear they only want Kidd as coach, and not in the dual role he pursued in Brooklyn and, as was reported, initially in Milwaukee as well. Given the events that transpired, however, one gets the feeling that nothing can be certain with Kidd around, and the elements that allow power grabs, or at least coaching grabs, are also very much available.  Hammond and his ilk may be well-advised to keep their ears close to the ground and their eyes open even when their backs are turned. SHORTSHOTS – Rappler.com Bert A.

Based to data released by the Department of Transportation on Thursday, May 24, Barretto shared the same experience with the 29 who lodged complaints against local airlines from January to April this 2012. Baggage-related issues account for 7% to 16% of total complaints in the previous years. The bulk of complaints, or over 50%, were related to refunds.Refund issues only retreated to 45% this 2012 because cancelled and delayed flights spiked. See data from the Transportation Department below.   Bill of Passenger RightsThe number of complaints have been rising. In 2011, the total reached 83, higher than the 77 recorded in 2010.  Aside from ticket refunds, cancelled and delayed flights, and lost baggages, other persistent complaints were unfair practices or negligence of personnel, misleading advertisements, denied boarding and double charging of credit cards.  These have resulted in congressional hearings, prompting the Civil Aviation Board to conduct a review of passenger guidelines, and recently, an amendment of an existing regulation. Amendments to Economic Regulation (ER) No.7 require the immediate implementation of the following: In a press conference on Thursday, May 24, Transportation Secretary Mar Roxas said further improvements will be enshrined in a proposed Passenger Bill of Rights.  “Under the ER no.7 the compensation due to a bumped-off passenger will be increased but it does not reflect the lost economic opportunity,” said Roxas.“There was already a lost economic opportunity which can’t be compensated by just refunding the full amount of the ticket. What if the passenger had to take an exam or had to seal a deal or attend a funeral of a relative? The airline can’t just give a refund or another ticket because the passenger simply can’t attend the funeral on another day. There was already a lost opportunity,” Roxas pointed out.Roxas said the proposed Bill of Rights will be a department order but will be subject to public hearings next week. Priority bookingIn addition to the damages, the ER No.7 already requires local airlines to prioritize booking for the inconvenienced passengers for the next available flight. This provision, which applies only to passengers with promotional fares, requires airlines to just extend the same ticket for which the passenger was denied booking. Roxas said the local airline should book the bumped off passenger in the next flight available -- even if the flight is with another airline. Airlines are then required to inform their passengers that their “flights are not cancelled but moved only tomorrow.” He said public discussions will include efforts to \"redefine all extended delays,\" as well as a review of all the airlines’ advertisements.\"We will also clarify who will provide assistance to the elderly and the disabled. Is it the airline or the airport?” stressed Roxas.He invited passengers and consumers to attend the hearings, which will also be attended by airline representatives and airport officials. The Passenger Bill of Rights could be implemented before the third quarter of this year, said the transportation chief.Airlines will abideLocal airlines previously said they will abide by the revised rules on compensation package already in place under the CAB-led ER No.7  “Cebu Pacific believes that the amended ER no.7 received last May 21 is generally fair especially since it applies to both domestic and international carriers alike. We are currently reviewing our procedures and aligning them with the amended ER no. 7,” said Candice Iyog, the vice president for marketing and distribution of the local industry leader, in a text message. For Seair’s part, its president Avelino Zapanta, said the airlines were not surprised as they are in constant discussion with the board. “We have been discussing this with the board for a long time now.

It is a restraint of trade. They should allow the industry to operate the way they should,” he said, adding that Seair seldom practices overbooking since the carrier utilizes turbo-prop jets and Airbus A319s. Cebu Pacific, according to Iyog, said its denied boarding ratio is one for every 10,000 passengers.  “The global standard is one for every 1,000 while in a year ours is 1 for every 10,000 for all flights,” she said. - Rappler.com, with reports from Katherine Visconti  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/fiba/fiba-esports-results-philippines-indonesia-june-19-2020","title":"Mighty PH grabs 2-0 lead over Indonesia in FIBA Esports Open","date":"Jun 19, 2020 9:26 PM PHT","snippet":"Point guard Aljon 'Shintarou' Cruzin shines the brightest as Team Pilipinas shreds Indonesia to pieces by a combined 61 points","body":"MANILA, Philippines – From real life to virtual basketball, the Philippines proves too much for Indonesia. That was in full display in the inaugural FIBA Esports Open as Team Pilipinas ripped Indonesia to pieces by a combined 61 points in the first two games of their best-of-five series on Friday, June 19.  Point guard Aljon \"Shintarou\" Cruzin shone the brightest for the Philippines after posting 22 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds in the 56-29 Game 1 win and 23 points and 4 rebounds in the 64-30 Game 2 triumph. Cruzin ran roughshod over Indonesia, catching his defenders off guard with his nifty dribble moves to either attack the basket or shoot an open three-pointer. His best play of Day 1 came at the end of Game 1 after he pulled off a double crossover and slammed home a ferocious dunk over two Indonesia big men.  Team Pilipinas struggled early in Game 2 and fell to a 9-12 deficit but managed to turn the tides late in the first half behind the defense of small forward Custer \"Aguila\" Galas, a former NBA 2K Asia Tournament champion. Creating an avatar that resembled four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallance, Galas served as the defensive anchor for the Philippines as he finished with 17 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals.  Going into the final quarter of Game 2, Team Pilipinas already built an insurmountable 42-18 lead en route to the 34-point victory.  \"From the start, the order for us was shoot to kill, from the first quarter to the fourth quarter,\" team captain Philippe \"Izzo\" Alcaraz Herrero IV, who had 3 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals in Game 2, said in Filipino.  Power forward Clark \"Clark\" Banzon had 11 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds, and 3 steals in Game 2, while shooting guard Rial \"Rial\" Polog Jr added 10 points, 4 assists, and 4 steals in the win.  The games were played in the ProAm mode of NBA 2K with five-minute quarters.

Lucia outclassed their respective foes to punch their second win in the 2020 Philippine SuperLiga Grand Prix tournament on Saturday, March 7 at FilOil Flying V Centre in San Juan City. The Blaze Spikers continued to ride on a strong start to their title defense campaign as they swept Chery Tiggo, 25-17, 25-22, 25-21. The reigning queens banked on import Katherine Bell, who unloaded 19 out of her 20 points from attacks while Ces Molina scored 15 points and had 5 of her squad’s 7 aces. Petron mainstay Aiza Maizo-Pontillas had 9 points as Remy Palma tallied 5 markers.   Coming from a strong performance in the opening set, the Blaze Spikers ended up knotted with Chery Tiggo at 18 in the 2nd frame before they unloaded 5 straight unanswered points, capped off by back-to-back kills from Molina. Although the Crossovers momentarily held a slim 11-8 separation in the 3rd set, the Blaze Spikers quickly trimmed their deficit and Bell later delivered one from the backrow to give Petron the upperhand, 19-16, before Aiza Maizo-Pontillas provided the finishing touches. Tatjana Bokan, who scored 33 points in Cherry Tiggo’s debut win against Marinerang Filipina, carried the offensive load with 21 points.   F2 Logistics edges Cignal Despite the absence of head coach Ramil de Jesus and veteran Aby Maraño, tournament favorite F2 Logistics still got their second win of the conference over Cignal, 25-23, 25-23, 22-25, 25-15. Import Lindsay Stalzer led the scoring for the Cargo Movers with 26 points while Fil-Hawaiian spiker Kalei Mau added 19 markers to topple Cignal, which fielded veteran skipper Jovelyn Gonzaga as starting libero. The Cargo Movers asserted their dominance from the get-go as they used a 4-0 run capped off by Stalzer’s attack to extend their lead 19-12 in the 1st set.  Cignal fought back and cut the lead to just one, 21-20, but Mau and Stalzer neutralized the late surge fueled by Simon to secure the set. The HD Spikers gave the Cargo Movers another scare in the 2nd set, where they evened the score at 23. But a costly service error from May Luna cut off Cignal’s momentum as Baron sent back Liannes Castaneda Simon’s attack to avert a total collapse.  Tides turned in the 3rd set as the HD Spikers got the lead, 17-14, all thanks to their Cuban import and the additional firepower brought by Fiola Ceballos.  Mau, however, led F2’s fightback and scored 3 straight points to give the lead back to their side 18-17. Cignal held their ground and halted Stalzer’s late comeback efforts to survive another set.  The Cargo Movers quickly shrugged off their 3rd set mishaps and pulled away in the 4th as Alex Cabanos extended their lead to double-digits, 21-11, after back-to-back  service aces. Simon fired 26 markers while Ceballos added 10 points for Cignal, which missed the service of starting libero Jheck Dionela.   Tubino, Sta. Lucia outclass Marinerang Filipina Sta Lucia leaned on Royse Tubino’s scoring barrage to spoil Hana Cutura and the Marinerang Filipina in 4 sets, 25-19, 21-25, 30-28, 25-20. The Realtors neutralized the 29-point performance of Lady Skippers import Hana Cutura as veteran skipper Tubino fired 24 points while import Sheinah Joseph and MJ Phillips chipped in 19 and 15 points, respectively, for the Realtors to remain unbeaten after two games. The Lady Skippers used an 8-0 run to get back in the game and trimmed Realtors’ lead to just one, 20-19, before Tubino sparked a counter 5-0 rally to avert a meltdown in the opening set. Sta Lucia found itself clinging on a slim 21-19 lead in the 2nd frame after MJ Phillips hammered down a kill.  Judith Abil, though, came through the clutch for Marinerang Filipina and scored 3 of the last 6 points to snatch away the set from the Realtors.  The error-laden 3rd set went back and forth as Tubino and Cutura exchanged bombs late, but the veteran hitter of Sta Lucia found some help from Philips and Joseph to put the extended set in their control. Both squads tightly tangled in the 4th before Tubino and Joseph paired up once again to give the Realtors a comfortable 23-17 advantage, just enough to later deal the Lady Skippers a 0-2 start in the conference. The former University of the East standout Abil added 11 points for Marinerang Filipina. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/fiba-3x3-world-tour-berth-up-for-grabs-chooks-president-cup","title":"FIBA 3x3 World Tour berth up for grabs in President's Cup ","date":"Mar 9, 2019 4:53 PM PHT","snippet":"The champion of the 2019 Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3 President's Cup gets to represent the Philippines in the biggest 3x3 club tournament in the world","body":"        MANILA, Philippines – The stakes just got higher in the 2019 Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3 President's Cup.  Besides having a pot prize of P 1,000,000 for the champion and two tickets to the first ever Asia-Pacific Super Quest for the top two placers, the winning team in the first conference will gain an automatic berth to the FIBA 3x3 World Tour – the biggest 3x3 club tournament in the world. And it's because the International Basketball Federation has promoted Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3 to Quest level. \"For the last 3 legs, all of you have showed the world what Filipino 3x3 basketball is all about,\" said league owner Ronald Mascariñas during the opening of the 4th tour of the league in SM Megamall on Saturday, March 9.  \"Each and every one of you have poured your blood, sweat, and tears in trying to prove to the world that we deserve to be on the world stage,\" he continued. \"Seeing this, FIBA has been in awe with the action we have been bringing.

The critically acclaimed film on Sunday, February 24 snatched the coveted best picture Oscar to wrap up the Academy Awards – a bit of an upset over Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, which had been the heavy favorite. The top prize was the third statuette of the night for Green Book, which earned a total of 5 nominations. Mahershala Ali won the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of pianist Don Shirley, who strikes up an unlikely friendship with driver Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (best actor nominee Viggo Mortensen). The film also won for best original screenplay. \"The whole story is about love. It's about loving each other, despite our differences, and finding out the truth about who we are – we're the same people,\" said director Peter Farrelly. Green Book bested 7 other films for top honors: Roma, superhero flick Black Panther, Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, offbeat royal romp The Favourite, musical romance A Star Is Born, and Dick Cheney biopic Vice. The film – co-written by Vallelonga's son, Nick – explores race relations and identity as Shirley embarks on the tour and is forced to rely on his initially racist, ill-mannered Italian-American driver. Mortensen put on 45 pounds (20 kilograms) to play Vallelonga, a family man whose opinions evolve as the film unfolds. The two men learn from each other as they confront stereotypes about themselves and others. Shirley and Lip remained friends – they both died in 2013. The feel-good movie is named after The Negro Motorist Green Book, an annual guidebook that provided African-Americans advice on safe places to eat and sleep while travelling during segregation. An audience favorite, it racked up a number of accolades in the run-up to the Oscars, including a best musical/comedy film award at the Golden Globes and the top prize from the Producers Guild of America. Ali received numerous statuettes as well as his Oscar, including a Golden Globe, a Bafta and a Screen Actors Guild award. 'White savior movie'  But while the film has proven a crowd-pleaser, it has been embroiled in controversy since its premiere. Shirley's relatives, including his brother, have objected to the storyline, saying they were never consulted and have denounced the film as a \"symphony of lies.\" Shirley's niece, Carol Shirley Kimble, blasted the movie as a \"depiction of a white man's version of a black man's life.\" The film also became part of a wider debate in the United States about race, with many describing it as yet another \"white savior movie\" told through the lens of its white protagonist. \"The Green Book is a black story and for a white man to steal that legacy and name for a film that has little or nothing to do with The Green Book is unacceptable,\" Oscar-winning director Roger Ross Williams said in a Facebook post. \"We have always had our stories and our history stolen from us and told through the lens of whiteness and this film is Hollywood’s latest example.\" Vallelonga has defended his work, saying it was based on stories his father told him about the tour. He also says Shirley advised him before his death not to speak to anyone else about his project. \"We were aware of the certain tropes, like the white savior trope – the white guy saves the black guy – as well as the black savior trope – the black guy saves the white guy,\" Farrelly told Newsweek in November. \"We were careful not to make this film either of those.\" But then Farrelly and Nick Vallelonga attracted negative headlines themselves – the director for an apparent dirty practical joke he used to pull on sets, and Vallelonga for an anti-Muslim tweet. Both apologized – and it seems that Oscar voters have forgiven them. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-september-21-2018-evening-edition","title":"Itogon landslide, Nene Pimentel on Mocha Uson, Grab fares | Evening wRap","date":"Sep 21, 2018 9:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening wRap with Chito dela Vega","body":"Today on Rappler: Rescuers ordered to leave as fresh landslides threaten Itogon.

Desakan itu disampaikan dalam aksi demonstrasi yang dilakukan di Alun-Alun Utara kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Ada ratusan pengemudi yang terlibat dalam aksi unjuk rasa. Mereka mengawali aksi dengan berjalan kaki dari Jalan Malioboro. Selain berorasi, mereka juga memampang berbagai poster berisi kecaman terhadap taksi berbasis online. “Operator taksi mati, malah pengemudinya mati duluan,” kata Koordinator Aksi Komunitas Pengemudi, Sutiman di Alun-Alun Utara Kota Yogyakarta pada Jumat, 15 Februari. Dia mengatakan para peserta aksi baru separuh dari total pengemudi taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta. Sebagian pengemudi taksi lainnya tetap beroperasi agar pemberian layanan terhadap penumpang tidak terganggu. “Tapi, kalau tidak ada kemajuan, (kami) akan all out turun semua,” kata dia. Saat ini, tercatat ada 20 operator taksi di Yogyakarta. Dengan armada mencapai 1.025 unit, masing-masing operator mengoperasikan sekitar 60 unit kendaraan. Sementara, jumlah pengemudi mencapai 2.500 orang. Sutiman mengatakan sejak marak beroperasinya taksi berbasis online, pendapatan para pengemudi taksi konvensional turun drastis. Taksi Pamungkas Primkoppol, tempat Sutiman bekerja misalnya, mewajibkan setiap pengemudi menyetor Rp 270 ribu per hari. “Tetapi, sekarang paling banter sehari mendapat Rp 150 ribu,” kata dia. Perolehan per hari itu belum termasuk untuk keperluan membeli bahan bakar kendaraan, makan dan upah yang dibawa pulang ke rumah. Akibatnya, banyak pengemudi berhutang setoran pada perusahaan. Tiap perusahaan taksi menetapkan batasan berbeda untuk hutang setoran pengemudi. Jumlahnya beragam, dimulai dari Rp 300 ribu hingga Rp 500 ribu. Jika hutang setoran melebihi batas, maka pengemudi dilarang beroperasi. Sulit beradaptasi Sebenarnya sebagian besar operator taksi konvensional di Yogyakarta sudah mulai menerapkan aplikasi online untuk menggaet pelanggan. Tetapi, tak semua pengemudi menerapkan untuk mencari penumpang. “Susah (menggunakannya),” kata Sarwidi alias Kacung, pengemudi Taksi Sadewo pada Jumat, 17 Februari. Taksi Sadewo kata dia juga sudah menerapkan aplikasi bernama Taxies. Aplikasi yang dipasang di telepon genggam itu juga dimanfaatkan oleh dua operator taksi lainnya yakni Indra Kelana dan Pandawa. Tetapi, bagi lelaki 49 tahun itu, jangankan untuk mengoperasikan fiturnya, menggunakan telepon genggam layar sentuh pun dia kesulitan. 10 tahun bekerja menjadi pengemudi taksi, dia terbiasa mengandalkan radio panggil yang terpasang di kendaraan untuk mendapat penumpang. Hal itu semakin diperparah dengan menjamurnya taksi berbasis online seperti Grab Car dan Go Car. Pasalnya, sejak beroperasi di Yogyakarta membuat penghasilan mereka anjlok drastis. Penumpang memilih menumpang taksi online yang tarifnya lebih murah. Sering kali ia tidak mendapat penumpang. Padahal, Sarwidi harus mengumpulkan uang setoran senilai Rp 280 ribu setiap harinya kepada perusahaan. Selain menerapkan aplikasi berbasis telepon genggam, ada juga perusahaan taksi yang menawarkan undian berhadiah bagi penumpang. Tetapi, toh strategi itu tak cukup menarik penumpang. Faktor tarif tetap menjadi daya tarik. Ketua III Organisasi Angkutan Darat Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta yang membidangi unit taksi, Taryoto, mengatakan salah satu alasan harga taksi online bisa murah karena mereka tidak mengurus persyaratan seperti izin trayek, pajak dan uji KIR. “Sementara, kalau kami di taksi argometer pakai itu,” ujar Taryoto. Gubernur Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono X mengatakan kendaraan berplat hitam dilarang beroperasi sebagai angkutan umum. Untuk mengatasi persoalan itu, ia berjanji akan berkomunikasi dengan Kementerian Perhubungan di Jakarta, Senin pekan depan. “Wewenangnya bukan di saya,” kata Sri Sultan. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/china-first-gold-rio-shooting","title":"China grabs its first Rio gold in women's 10m air pistol","date":"Aug 7, 2016 11:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Zhang Mengxue gets China off and running in the gold department after the country won two silvers and 3 bronzes on opening day","body":"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Zhang Mengxue got China off the gold medal mark at the Rio Games on Sunday, August 7, the Olympic debutant winning the women's 10m air pistol title.

These include rental cars, coupon taxis, and the cheaper metered taxis. But this number is not enough for the tens of thousands of passengers arriving at NAIA's 4 terminals. In 2014, MIAA recorded 46,418 passengers arriving daily at NAIA. The average number of metered taxi and coupon taxi users daily, however, were only at 10,777. MIAA general manager Jose Angel Honrado said that the airport will need to have more taxi units available, especially since the number of arriving passengers daily has gone up to 50,210 in 2015. \"We increased passenger load, but our supply of transportation units is not growing,\" Honrado said. More vehicles needed To address the problem, Honrado said the MIAA, in coordination with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), are considering allowing app-based transport network vehicle services like Uber and GrabCar to pick up passengers at the airport. Honrado added that they have also asked the LTFRB to accredit more metered taxis inside NAIA, since passengers prefer these to the more expensive fixed-rate coupon taxis and rental cars. Currently, unaccredited white metered taxis are allowed to pick up passengers at the arrival areas of NAIA Terminals 2 and 3 during peak hours.  In the past, regular taxis were only allowed to pick up new riders if they also brought departing passengers to the airport. Angara, vice chairman of the Senate tourism committee, earlier said the lack of available transport services at the airport may affect tourism in the country. Lawmakers have pointed out that the shortage of available metered taxis at the airport – much cheaper than the fixed-rate airport cabs – have forced desperate passengers to agree to exorbitant rates from rental car operators. Angara earlier filed Senate Resolution 1702 to investigate the issue of overcharging taxi drivers. \"It's good that there's a demand for transport services from the airport. But we have to match that by increasing the supply of available taxis,\" Angara said. Traffic, infra projects to blame During the hearing, MIAA outlined several factors behind the shortage of available taxis for arriving passengers. At the top of the list was the worsening traffic in Metro Manila and ongoing construction of the NAIA expressway. Honrado said that because of heavy traffic, it takes 2 to 6 hours for taxis to return to the airport to pick up more passengers. In a 12-hour period, taxis make only about 3 or 4 trips, Honrado said. Angara, however, said the ongoing infrastructure work aggravating traffic are only \"short-term problems that will soon be fixed.\" \"In the long term, we still don't have enough taxis serving our passengers,\" he said. Honrado said MIAA is already in talks with Uber and GrabCar to discuss how to set up guidelines for the drivers and how the airport authority can monitor trips of passengers using the app-based services. The MIAA chief said they are still waiting for Uber's proposal. Meanwhile, Honrado said GrabCar has already proposed setting up an iPad at the airport that passengers can use to book trips. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/democrats-take-house-republicans-senate-us-elections-2018","title":"Democrats favored to take House, Republicans to hold Senate","date":"Nov 2, 2018 8:09 AM PHT","snippet":"All 435 seats in the House are up for grabs on November 6, while 35 seats in the 100-member Senate are at stake. Americans will choose new governors in 36 states.","body":"WASHINGTON DC, USA – As the US midterm election campaign enters the final stretch before the vote on Tuesday, November 6, many races are too close to call but most polls have Democrats seizing control of the House of Representatives – and Republicans clinging on to the Senate. President Donald Trump is ratcheting up the rhetoric and campaigning furiously as he seeks to hold on to the Republican majorities in the two chambers of Congress. All 435 seats in the House are up for grabs on Tuesday while 35 seats in the 100-member Senate are at stake. Americans will choose new governors in 36 states. Republicans currently have a slim 51-49 hold on the Senate, where Democrats have a tough hill to climb with 26 Democratic seats on the ballot, while Republicans must only defend 9. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to take control of the House they lost in 2010, and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi predicted this week they would do so. \"Democrats will carry the House,\" Pelosi said on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" while also forecasting victory in the Senate. Political forecasting outlet FiveThirtyEight.com gives Democrats a 5 in 6, or 84.5%, chance of gaining control of the House but only a 1 in 7, or roughly 15%, chance of winning the Senate. As election day approaches and with turnout a major factor, Trump has sought to drive Republicans to the polls and rekindle the enthusiasm of his successful 2016 presidential bid. \"I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket because this is also a referendum about me,\" he said at a rally last month in Mississippi. \"Pretend I'm on the ballot.\" Anti-immigration rhetoric Trump has scheduled 10 campaign rallies over the next 5 days in 8 states – Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Trump has dialed up the rhetoric on immigration, issuing dire warnings about caravans of Central American migrants heading to the US border with Mexico. Claiming the caravans include \"very bad thugs and gang members,\" Trump has ordered 5,000 active-duty troops to the border and said he is considering sending up to 15,000. \"This isn't an innocent group of people,\" Trump said Thursday, November 1. \"This is an invasion.\" Trump also posted a political ad on his Twitter account on Wednesday, October 31, that shows a Mexican man boasting about killing police officers and includes the caption \"Democrats let him into the country.\" Democrats accused the president of seeking to inflame his supporters with his anti-immigration appeals. \"This is fear mongering,\" Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN. \"This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long.\" Control of the Senate will come down to a handful of races, in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, according to political analysts. Tight Senate races In Arizona, two women – Democratic Representative Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Representative Martha McSally, a former air force fighter pilot – are battling to replace Senator Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who is not running for re-election. 538.com currently gives Sinema a slight edge. In Florida, incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson is involved in a tough re-election battle with Republican governor Rick Scott. 538.com has Nelson with a small lead. In Missouri, 538.com gives incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill a 3-in-5 chance of holding off a stiff challenge from 38-year-old state attorney general Josh Hawley. In other closely watched races, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota is trailing in most polls and incumbent Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada is locked in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen. In reliably Republican Texas, Senator Ted Cruz is facing a surprisingly competitive challenge from rising Democratic star Beto O'Rourke but most polls give the edge to the Republican incumbent. Two races for governor have drawn widespread attention. In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams is seeking to become the first black woman to become governor of a US state. She got a helping hand on the campaign trail Thursday from Oprah Winfrey. And in Florida, the African-American mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, is in a bitter battle with a Trump acolyte, Republican Representative Ron DeSantis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/billy-bush-confirms-revisionist-trump-lewd-comments","title":"Billy Bush confirms 'revisionist' Trump's lewd comments","date":"Dec 4, 2017 8:28 PM PHT","snippet":"The former 'Access Hollywood' host breaks his silence to confirm he and 7 other people witnessed President Donald Trump boasting about grabbing women by their genitals","body":"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush broke his silence Monday, December 4, to confirm he and 7 other people witnessed President Donald Trump boasting about grabbing women by their genitals. Bush accused Trump of engaging in \"revisionist history\" amid reports the president was questioning the authenticity of a recording featuring the lewd comments leaked just a month before the November 2016 election. \"He said it,\" Bush wrote in a New York Times opinion piece about Trump's \"grab them by the pussy\" comment made on a hot mic in an Access Hollywood bus in 2005. \"And we laughed along, without a single doubt that this was hypothetical hot air from America's highest-rated bloviator,\" said Bush, who was fired from NBC's Today after the tape surfaced last year. Offering an explanation about why he did not take action upon hearing the crude boasts of assault, Bush added: \"There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act. He was performing. Surely, we thought, none of this was real.\"  However, he added, \"we now know better,\" referring to women who have come forward to accuse Trump of unwanted sexual advances.

'Just words'? At the time of the tape's release, Trump dismissed the comments as \"just words\" and \"locker room talk,\" and denied the sexual assault allegations, threatening to sue his accusers after the election. The New York Times and The Washington Post reported in recent days that Trump had supporters and at least one senator that it may have been faked, and that the voice was not his. Bush, a nephew of former president George H.W. Bush, said he believed the women accusing Trump. \"President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history... \"This has hit a raw nerve in me,\" Billy Bush said. \"I can only imagine how it has reopened the wounds of the women who came forward with their stories about him, and did not receive enough attention.\" Bush noted that at the time of the recording, he was only in his first year of co-anchoring NBC's Access Hollywood, while Trump was \"the network's biggest star\" due to his role on The Apprentice.  \"To these women: I will never know the fear you felt or the frustration of being summarily dismissed and called a liar, but I do know a lot about the anguish of being inexorably linked to Donald Trump,\" Bush added. \"You have my respect and admiration.

More than 18,000 elective posts are up for grabs in next year's national and local elections, according to the Commission on Elections (Comelec). Based on Comelec Resolution 10002, which was signed on October 13, there are 18,083 positions open in next year's polls. It is an update to the earlier report of the poll body – via Resolution 9982, which was signed on August 18 – indicating there are 18,069 positions open in next year's polls. Based on the Comelec calendar, August 31 was the \"last day to allocate elective seats for Member, House of Representatives and other local elective positions.\" There were, however, some district creations and cityhood conversions approved even after the Comelec deadline. On May 9, 2016, the country will be electing a new president and vice president, 12 senators, and officials for each of the 238 legislative districts, 81 provinces, 145 cities, and 1,489 municipalities. In a Philippine Star report, Comelec chairman Andres Bautista said that they are ready and prepared for the candidacy filing on Monday. \"This is the unofficial start of the election,\" he claimed. LGU creation/conversion The number of congressional and local positions increased from 17,984 in the 2013 elections to 18,010 in 2016. Next year's elections include new elective posts for: The additional Cebu and Batangas districts and the cityhood of General Trias were approved by Malacañang after the signing of the earlier Comelec resolution, hence were not included in the initial report. For the 2013 polls, 4 new districts were created, and 6 towns were converted to cities. Newsbreak earlier reported that these new areas are created by politicians to increase the number of political turfs possible for warring political clans in the region. Creating new LGUs then becomes a sort of conflict-resolution tool, though only temporary. Junk foreign citizenship An additional feature to be seen in the COC forms are the candidates' renouncement of their foreign citizenship. In Resolution 9989, the Comelec said the COC shall state, among other things, that the candidate “executed a sworn renunciation of foreign citizenship\". The candidates are also asked to attach a copy of the renunciation affidavit. The amendment is based on the August 18 ruling of the Supreme Court (SC) in Arnado vs Comelec and Capitan, which clarified that candidates who lost and then reacquired their Philippine citizenship “may now run for public office” subject to two conditions. One of these is that they should “make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenships before any public officer authorized to administer an oath prior to or at the time of filing of their COC.” The citizenship of candidates is a hot-button issue for the 2016 elections, brought to the fore by questions over Senator Grace Poe's Filipino citizenship. Poe, who had rennounced her US citizenship, is seeking the presidency. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/laguna-liberal-nacionalista-coalition-2016","title":"In Laguna, it's NP-LP vs UNA","date":"Oct 9, 2015 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Incumbent Governor Ramil Hernandez, a member of the Nacionalista Party, says they’ve only decided on endorsing Mar Roxas and that the vice presidential endorsement is still up for grabs","body":"LAGUNA, Philippines – He is used to facing a sea of yellow but on Thursday, October 8, it was a sea of blue that Liberal Party (LP) Manuel Roxas II faced in Calamba City during the oath taking of the Nacionalista Party (NP) in this province. The two parties have coalesced – at least in the province of Laguna – for the 2016 national elections. The NP is part of a broad LP-led coalition formed for the 2013 mid-term elections. The future of that coalition, however, remains unclear as parties continue deliberating on which presidential bet to support for 2016. Roxas arrived in Calamba City Thursday afternoon with Las Piñas Representative Mark Villar, son of NP president and former senator Manny Villar. TESDA Director General Joel Villanueva, who is set to run for the Senate under the LP, was also present for the oath taking. The NP-LP coalition in Laguna, among the most vote-rich provinces in the PHilippines, will be fielding incumbent Governor Ramil Hernandez as its provincial standard-bearer for 2016. For the national race, however, the NP has yet to decide if it will be coalescing with the LP or if it will be supporting Roxas in 2016. “That depends. We have to support our members. It depends [on who they want] to support,” Villar told reporters, when asked who the NP would be endorsing for president in 2016. \"This is for the Liberal and the Nacionalista uniting for the candidacy of Gov Hernandez,\" added Villar, when asked if his presence meant the NP would be supporting Roxas' candidacy as well.  In speeches during the event, both Hernandez and Roxas thanked the LP's Edgardo San Luis – who, Roxas said, is a \"close friend\" of the President – for giving up his gubernatorial dreams to pave the way for the coalition. San Luis was the ruling party's bet in the 2013 elections but he lost to former Laguna Governor ER Ejercito, who was, however, later disqualified in 2014 for overspending during the 2013 elections. Hernandez then took over as governor. The NP-LP Laguna coalition was launched a week after the opposition United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) launched its down slate in the same city. UNA will be fielding Ejercito. Speaking before his supporters, Hernandez hit Ejercito for allegedly spreading lies about him. Hernandez also accused Ejercito of stealing and mispending the province’s funds. Roxas and...  Laguna is not the only province where the NP and the LP will be coalescing locally. In a chance interview with reporters, Roxas said Davao Oriental will have the same arrangement. “Ang mahalaga rito nakita natin ang pagkakaisa ng NP at LP sa ilalim ng Daang Matuwid kung saan ay itinataguyod natin ang mga batayang prinsipyo ng Daang Matuwid na matapat at malinis na pamamahala,” said Roxas. (What’s important here is that we’re seeing the NP and LP uniting under ‘Daang Matuwid’ where we will continue the principles of Daang Matuwid – of clean and principled governance.) Even as NP politicians in Laguna pledge support for Roxas, they remain undecided on who to support for vice president. The LP on Monday, October 5, announced Camarines Sur Representative Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo as its vice presidential bet. But the NP has a unique problem: 3 of its members – incumbent Senators Antonio Trillanes IV, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. – are all running for vice president. Trillanes has declared support for Senator Grace Poe, while Cayetano and Marcos are both hoping to run alongside Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who has yet to announce his 2016 plans. “It’s a very unique circumstance, it’s very unique, yung nangyari (what happened). Wala pa kaming (We still don’t have a) party stand,” said Villar when asked who the party would endorse for vice president. Hernandez said the NP leadership gave its Laguna officials the go-signal to pick their own presidential bet for 2016. “Binigyang laya kami sa Laguna ng gusto naming samahang presidente (They gave us the freedom in Laguna to choose our presidential bet),” said Hernandez. The Laguna governor said they would be making a decision on who to endorse for vice president “soon” but added “priority” would be given to the 3 NP senators seeking the vice presidency. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/cesafi-usc-warriors-uv","title":"CESAFI: USC Warriors down UV to earn Finals berth","date":"Oct 2, 2015 4:32 PM PHT","snippet":"Charles Pepito scores 23 and grabs 14 rebounds to lead USC to the CESAFI Finals for the second season in a row, while USJR tops SWU to keep their hopes alive","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines – The University of San Carlos (USC) Warriors barged into the finals for the second straight year of the CESAFI men's basketball tournament by prevailing over the University of the Visayas (UV) Green Lancers, 79-75, in overtime Thursday, October 1 at the New Cebu Coliseum. At the same time, the Warriors also avenged the loss that they suffered at the hands of the Green Lancers last September 20, 43-74, which had them tasting their lowest output of the season. There seems to be no stopping USC's power forward Charles Pepito as he collected his fifth best player of the ballgame laurel with another double-double performance of 23 points, as he went 11-15 in field goals, and collected 14 rebounds. He also accounted for 3 steals. In the other semifinals game, the University of San Jose Recoletos (USJR) Jaguars kept their title chances alive by outsmarting defending champion Southwestern University (SWU) Cobras, 81-75. The Jaguars got their much needed power from Kevin Rey Villafranca whose double-double of 22 points and 12 rebounds also accorded him the best player honors. He also had 2 blocks. While the USC is already assured of a finals ticket regardless of the outcome of their last semifinals game against the USJR Jaguars, a win by the latter and a win by the UV Lancers against the SWU Cobras will put them in a tie. However, it will be UV who will advance to the finals by virtue of a simple tie because USJR had lost to UV, 77-87, in their semifinals meeting. Or a triple tie scenario could ensue among USJR, UV and SWU should the Green Lancers lose and USJR win, the defending champion Cobras could advance to the finals provided that they win against the Green Lancers by at least 12 points. This means that CESAFI fans can expect another exciting games this Saturday especially with the USC Baby Warriors and the UV Baby Lancers contesting the third place honors in the juniors division. USC prevails over UV in OT In what could be a preview for the finals and in a game that had the top 1 and top 2 teams vying for a finals ticket, it is not surprising to see the game deadlocked six times and the lead change hands several times in the first half alone. However, at the start of the second half, with the Green Lancers once again tying the game at 39-all on a layup by Jun Kent Manzo III, UV then surged to a 7-point lead which they held at the end of the third quarter, 52-54. The final quarter, however, saw the Warriors eat up the Green Lancers lead and once they had the advantage on their side on a basket by Cameroonian import Shooster Olago at the 6:20 mark, did not relinquished it. The Green Lancers was not playing in their top form with their own import Steve Akomo committing four goaltending violations, star playmaker Leonard Santillan having trouble connecting with the net not to mention losing ball possession twice and Jerome Napao not making his charities. Despite that, they have Alfred Codilla and Arvie Cabanero to thank for letting them stay in the game. Trailing by just two points with 39.9 seconds left, 68-70, all seemed lost for UV when Francisco Arong missed his drive but Manzo, who has been very consistent in leading the Green Lancers, appropriately kept them alive with a basket that tied the game at 70-all. USC failed to score in the return play and thus the extension. Both teams were even at the start, but Pepito gave the USC Warriors the lead for good at 79-74 with 17.9 seconds left. All the Green Lancers could manage was split charities from Napao which allowed the Warriors to march on to the finals. SWU title chances fade Not about to give up despite being undermanned, the defending champions SWU Cobras ended the first half in their favor with a 4-point advantage at 37-33. They tenaciously held on to this lead with two-time most valuable player Mark Jayven “Macmac” Tallo and Juju Bautista combining their efforts but the Jaguars still managed to sway the game's momentum to their side with baskets from Villafranca, Jaybie Mantilla, Juan Miguel Gastador, Nelvin Navarra and Ralph Jude Dinolan. Despite the Cobras threatening at just a point behind on Tallo's basket with 5:47 left in the ballgame, the Jaguars stuck to the lead. The Cobras closed in once again at just 3 points behind on Jovanie Luz's basket but a triple play by Gastador sealed the win for the Jaguars.

He will be missing two games for FEU. La Salle dominated in the first half largely thanks to their 35-20 edge over FEU in rebounding. The Tamaraws began picking up steam in the third, trimming a 35-26 halftime deficit to 37-33 two minutes in. Midway in the third, Mike Tolomia tied the contest for only the second time in the game, 44-all, with a turnaround jumper as FEU relied on its defense to keep La Salle on a short leash. But Teng was not to be stopped as he scored 4 straight points to give the Archers some cushion, 48-44. La Salle could have easily padded on the lead had they made their free throws in the ensuing possessions but FEU was able to get some baskets to go until they finally grabbed hold of the lead heading into the final frame, 52-51 - also only for the second time at that point - on a split from the line by Russel Escoto. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/philippines-and-indonesia-are-the-new-tigers-say-analysts","title":"Philippines and Indonesia: the new 'tigers'","date":"Oct 8, 2012 9:35 AM PHT","snippet":"Market Watch christened the Philippines and Indonesia as \"The New Tigers\" or economies that have been overlooked in the past and are now \"poised to drive future growth and grab more economic power\"","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Step aside economic powerhouses of the past, and get ready to share the spotlight. In a special report, business news site Market Watch christened the Philippines and Indonesia as \"the new tigers\" or economies that have been overlooked in the past and are now \"poised to drive future growth and grab more economic power.\" \"In an economically vibrant Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines stand out as the region’s 'New Tigers' with the potential to leave a bigger imprint on global growth for years to come while the developed world struggles with excess debt and traditional regional heavyweights China and India lose momentum,\" said the report. Market Watch said it selected Indonesia and the Philippines because of several shared characteristics: Once plagued by inefficiencies and corruption, the Philippines has been ignored by investors in the past. But recently, several analysts have given the country their vote of confidence, heralding it as the next breakout nation, the strongest and safest place for funds in the region, and Asia's bright spot. According to Market Watch, neighbors Indonesia and the Philippines have come full circle. Once borrowers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both recently became lenders.  This 2012, they each pledged USD$1 billion to IMF's crisis fund mostly for wobbly European countries, after relying on the same body to bail them out during the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, right after Asian economies stalled in their original quests to become 'Tiger' economies.  The borrower-to-lender transition is only one example that shows how both countries are righting their economic ships. Investors are encouraged to keep their eyes on the Philippines and Indonesia as the countries set sail, especially as traditional economies sputter and slowdown. Why Philippines may finally take off The mood in the Philippines is upbeat, explained Market Watch. After a lackluster 2011, the country has one of the fastest growth rates in Southeast Asia. While inflation and high food prices remain a concern in other Asian countries, the Philippines has avoided that problem. The country's average inflation is at the low end of the central bank's 3% to 5% target, coming out to just 3.2% over the first 9 months. And an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on inflation and food prices showed that, while the retail cost of rice increased in 10 other developing Asian countries, the price of the staple food actually decreased nearly 1% in the Philippines between 2010 and 2011.  Under President Aquino's government, the budget deficit was cut, and he promised to bring it down to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2013 from 3.9% when he took office in 2010. The article noted that while some view Aquino's fiscal moves as prudent, others believe he is too cautious with spending -- a vital ingredient for fueling a developing economy. Still, Market Watch said, \"With low debt and a government working hard to get its financial position in order, the Philippines represents the opposite of Europe.\" The local stock market has also become more attractive amid uncertainty in former safe havens. Though relatively small and expensive by Asian standards, the Philippine Stock Exchange has grown an impressive 24.4% year-to-date. An investment upgrade for sovereign debt issues is in reach now more than ever. \"Any concern about the small size of the Indonesian and Philippines markets has been put aside in the past few years by investors in part seeking safety from European debt turmoil by buying into 'stable stocks and stable markets,'\" Khiem Do, head of Asian multi asset at Barings Investment Management, told Market Watch. The Philippines has been relatively sheltered from the global economic slowdown. Filipinos abroad continue to pump money back into the local economy in the form of remittances, which are estimated to account for 9% of GDP. Though growth has slowed, each year remittances hit another record high. Market Watch pointed out that a prospect that is even brighter than remittances is the homegrown call center industry. After all, the Philippines boasts of a young, ready-to-work, English-speaking population -- perfect employees for the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. \"Revenue from the industry, which employs almost 650,000, accounts for about 5% of GDP. At the current annual growth rate of about 25%, analysts estimate industry revenues will top remittances within 5 years,\" wrote Market Watch. People are constantly praised as the Philippines' best asset. Market Watch pointed out that the Filipino people have the potential to help the country unlock tourism as a key to future growth. Challenges ahead The country seems ready to make a new name for itself in the global arena but several challenges threaten to hold the country back. Market Watch points to a few: low infrastructure spending, red tape for potential growth sectors like mining, a higher cost base for manufacturing and not enough foreign investments. Not solving those issues will stifle the country's next high growth industries. “The key reason tourism is underperforming in the Philippines is infrastructure,” Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai told Market Watch. \"A bigger tourism sector would help absorb labor in its swelling population, as it nears 100 million. Rapid population growth has not been matched by infrastructure expansion. Aging roads and inadequate airports have frustrated economic development and made getting around difficult for visitors,\" said the news site. Big-ticket infrastructure projects have been delayed as the government takes extra measures to insure transparent and fair bidding. For years the country has needed new infrastructure and the rollbacks exacerbate existing problems, like the capital's notorious traffic jams. Southeast Asia broker CLSA told Market Watch that since the 1990s, \"infrastructure spending in the Philippines has averaged around 1.8% of gross domestic product — well below the regional average and the World Bank’s target of 5%.\" Market Watch also highlighted mining as an industry that could help raise the Philippines' economic prospects. \"Beyond tourism, mining is another potential growth driver for the Philippines. The country is rich in minerals including copper, gold and nickel, but development of the mining industry has been stalled by political resistance and layers of red tape,\" said Market Watch. \"Those obstacles are likely to push the meaningful development of the country’s mining sector out by at least 5 to 10 years,\" it added. The Philippines is the 5th most mineral-rich country in the world thanks to its large supply of gold, nickel, copper, and chromite. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau estimated that US$840 billion worth of mineral wealth lies untapped beneath the ground. The Aquino administration has tried to provide mining firms with new clear guidelines only to receive a backlash of negative comments from industry players. \"Regardless of which industries the Philippines seeks to develop, international backing will be crucial,\" said Market Watch. International funding may not be too far off with investors eyeing the country with so much renewed interest. However, the country has been praised for its potential before, only to fall flat. From its reputation as \"the Pearl of the Orient,\" the Philippines dropped in international esteem until it was known as the \"Sick Man of Asia.\"  Now the country has the tools it needs to be a standout economy: low debt, a stable government, mineral wealth, a strong stock market and a large youthful population. It just has to unleash them. - Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/top-gun-helmet-alien-spaceship-for-sale-hollywood-props-auction","title":"'Top Gun' helmet and 'Alien' spaceship for sale in Hollywood props auction","date":"Jul 16, 2020 2:25 PM PHT","snippet":"Maverick's fighter jet helmet, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber, Rocky's boxing gloves, and an 11-foot Alien spaceship expected to fetch half a million dollars will be up for grabs","body":"Maverick's fighter jet helmet, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber, Rocky's boxing gloves, and an 11-foot Alien spaceship tipped to fetch half a million dollars will go up for auction in Los Angeles next month.

Her organization has been helping the LGU ensure that their community follows the lockdown rules.  She died on Tuesday, April 21, possibly of COVID-19 though test results have not yet been released.  I write this in tears. I lost a friend, and the last words I could understand her saying to me were, “Ikaw ha, bakit mo ako pinabayaan?” Kliyente ko na ang Informal Settler Association nina Helen nung nagpa-practice pa ako ng law. They wanted to buy the land that had been their home for more then a couple of decades already. Dahil disputed pa sa courts yung ownership ng lupang kinatitirikan ng kanilang mga bahay – and because I could never get the laws required to unlock their land through the legislative mill – squatter ang tawag sa kanila doon.Despite our macho culture, it was usually the mothers who really ran the community associations. And Helen was the epitome of a typical urban poor community leader. Hardnosed and practical, but also eternally optimistic. Pragmatically political, but also very emotional. And often, blindly loyal to a fault. I could read the sentiments on the ground just by spending time with Helen, or other mothers like her.Ang dami naming pinagsamahang laban nina Helen. Meron kaming mga laban na pinanalo, pero marami rin kaming talo. At marami ring hindi pa tapos na laban. Together we fended off land grabbing and land scamming syndicates, community fires, and even local drug pushers.Not so long ago, a mysterious fire almost burned down their community. Security guards were trying to seal off the area even before the ashes cooled. We had to rebuild from scratch. Helen lost her already sick husband soon after.A drug pusher killed her son. A dispute over payment, it was said. I could never bring his killer to justice. Her being an organized hardcore Duterte Supporter couldn’t help either. Even at the height of tokhang, his protectors made sure that he was arrested on minor charges, and after bail relocated to run his trade from a new safe location. Even today, while under ECQ, the police tell me that his drugs still somehow find their way into the community.I had lost touch with Helen over time. Politics had gotten in the way of our friendship. But she was my friend.Last Sunday, I was checking up on how her community was holding up under the ECQ. I wanted to feature their association as a sample of how our urban poor communities were handling the new normal, and I wanted to highlight their actual situation, and show off best practices. You see, it was clear to us here on the ground that despite all our local government and volunteer’s efforts to enforce the quarantine and provide relief, social distancing was almost impossible in the overcrowded and squalid communities. It was then that I found out about Helen being sick. (READ: Thousands of Metro Manila’s poorest left out as deadly coronavirus spreads)She was exhibiting all the symptoms related to being COVID-positive and had been self-medicating for almost a week. By the time I saw her, she had already been told to go back home by 3 hospitals. They were overloaded, she wasn’t a tested positive, and she seemed to be doing okay. To make sure that her family stuck to the lockdown protocols, her neighbors had even set up their volunteer control point just outside her window. It was from there that I was able to talk to her, banter, and even film her a bit. She seemed strong and upbeat, despite being visibly sick. Even I thought that she was better off at home, rather than risk staying in the overcrowded, probably virus-infested hospitals. But she was a prime candidate for our newly set-up community testing facility. (READ: 'Walang-wala na': Poor Filipinos fear death from hunger more than coronavirus)We had her tested Monday, the very next day. She was the first patient from our district to go through the new testing facility. But apparently, by then, it was already too late. It was a different Helen I saw in the waiting area. Visibly leaning on her daughter for support, and barely able to speak from shortness of breath. She was expedited through the testing process, and immediately transported to QCGH for hospital care. (READ: EXPLAINER: What to expect from the Philippines' expanded coronavirus testing)Yesterday morning, I was informed that she had just expired. Since the test results will not yet be available for a couple of days at least, her cause of death is listed as acute pulmonary failure due to probable COVID-19. There will be no time to mourn, or bury her. She will be cremated at the first available slot in the city crematorium.And we still have no idea how she got infected. Or even if it is really the virus that got her.Her family had already lost a son and a father. Yesterday they lost their mother. Helen was a squatter when I first met her. She died still a squatter.Working closely with the urban poor, to whom day-to-day living is already a struggle, gets one used to death and frustration. Often, it is only from the patient optimism and resilience of the mothers that one can draw stregnth.One makes a lot of enemies when one tries to help the poor make their lives better. But those are enemies one can see.This is now a different enemy. It is silent and undetected. It has no color. And it is loose in our densely populated slums.Helen won't be the last mother, or father, or son, or daughter that it takes away from us.I fear for our communities. I fear that we may have failed them. – Rappler.com Jose Christopher \"Kit\" Belmonte is Quezon City 6th District Representative."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/pope-admits-snoozing-while-praying","title":"Pope Francis admits to snoozing while praying","date":"Nov 1, 2017 10:39 PM PHT","snippet":"The head of the Roman Catholic Church confesses he sometimes falls asleep while praying and claims saints too have been known to grab some Holy shut-eye","body":"VATICAN CITY, Holy See – Pope Francis has confessed he sometimes nods off while praying and claims saints too have been known to grab some Holy shut-eye. \"When I pray, sometimes I fall asleep,\" he said in an episode of a Catholic TV2000 television program published Tuesday, October 31, on Youtube. \"Saint Therese did it too,\" he said in reference to a 19th-century French nun, adding that Christians were called to feel like children lying in their fathers' arms – a place conducive to napping, he implies.

Widely circulated security camera footage appears to show three uniformed soldiers grab Sirawitch Sereethiwat on a busy street outside his university on Wednesday evening, January 20. The student, who has been a perennial thorn in the military's side since it seized power in 2014, is seen frog-marched into a white car and driven away in front of stunned bystanders. He spent the night in military custody and was charged Thursday at a Bangkok police station with violating a junta ban on protests and political gatherings, Pawinee Chumsri, of Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, told Agence France-Presse. In a video clip filmed Thursday at the police station Sirawitch, also known as Ja New, said he was blindfolded, slapped and kicked while in military custody. \"He was abducted and physically assaulted,\" Pawinee said, repeating the allegations. \"This is an enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention. It's illegal.\" Three other students – all members of the New Democracy Movement – were also arrested when they visited the police station and face action in a military court. The four have been charged with violating the junta's ban on public gatherings by organising a trip to a controversial multi-million-dollar park built by the military that has been dogged by corruption allegations. The group has embarrassed the military with protests and brazen social media campaigns in defiance of the junta ban. Outside of their activities there have been relatively few high-profile anti-coup protests across Thailand with the military tightening its chokehold on the country. A junta spokesperson confirmed the arrest but denied the allegations of assault. \"He was treated leniently and in accordance with the law, there was no violence,\" Colonel Winthai Suvaree told reporters, adding that the activists have \"refused to cooperate\" with authorities.  Winthai accused Siriwitch of trying to \"provoke the authorities\", adding: \"I don't know the real reason for this.\" People who oppose the junta are routinely accused of being in the pocket of self-exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who sits at the heart of Thailand's political rupture. Thaksin and his parties have won every Thai election since 2001, facing two coups and the removal by the royalist courts of three premiers in that time. His sister, Yingluck, was booted from office by a court ruling days before the May 2014 coup. The military says it had to intervene to restore peace and order after mass protests against Yingluck's government. Analysts say the military wants to be in control of the country during the twilight years of the reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is 88 and in poor health. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/pba/talk-n-text-beats-globalport-ranidel","title":"Talk 'N Text moves to first place with win over Globalport","date":"Mar 1, 2015 5:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Ranidel De Ocampo explodes for 25 points on 6/9 3-point shooting as Talk 'N Text grabs ahold of solo first place in the Commissioner's Cup standings","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ivan Johnson and Ranidel de Ocampo conspired for 60 points as the Talk ’N Text Tropang Texters regained the top spot in the standings with a 96-88 victory over Globalport Batangn Pier in the 2015 PBA Commissioner’s Cup on Sunday, March 1 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.  Import Johnson posted a double-double of 35 points and 20 rebounds as he took over in the final frame to ward off a gritty Globalport squad.

As with most narratives, there is a grain of truth beneath this framing: millions of Filipinos living in the provinces have indeed been deprived of government resources for decades.

Are MRT/LRT riders really the ones depriving people in the Visayas or Mindanao their fair share? Unconditional cash transfers Let’s start with who’s going to get all that money from the MRT fare hikes: Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya has publicly admitted – but the President and other commentators conveniently fail to note – that the additional revenues from the fare increase will actually be funnelled to the few dozen individuals who hold securities or claims to the revenue stream of the MRT Corporation, the Ayala-Sobrepena-plus consortium formed to build and run the MRT.  This is because the Ramos government – in yet another of the scores of “sweetheart” deals that the Aquino administration refuses to rescind – guaranteed the Sobrepeñas and all those who ended up owning MRT Corporation securities that, no matter what the conditions, the state will ensure that they will collectively get an estimated US $2.4 billion dollars – a 15% return on investment – over 25 years even if they only shelled out US $190 million of their “own” capital, while the government borrowed the remaining $500 million needed, to build the MRT. How else might we think of this as anything other than a multibillion peso dole not to all Metro Manilans but to particular Metro Manilans (or particular Metro Cebuanos, maybe even New Yorkers or Londoners) who hold MRT Corporation securities? What else could this be but a kind of “unconditional cash transfer” to a handful of individuals living in particular enclaves in Metro Manila – or in Park Avenue or Kensington? But this hundred-billion subsidy to particular families is actually only the tip of the iceberg. Public handouts to the mighty – the opposite of the so-called “trickle-down” effect promised by economists but mocked by Pope Francis – do not all come in the form of onerous deals. The gushing-up effect Think of the hundreds of billions that have spent on highways, ports, and other infrastructure in Metro Manila and across the country that primarily help the real estate, the mining projects, and the other business ventures of the Sys, the Ayalas, the Pangilinans, and other investors collectively. Or think, even more generally, of the hundreds of billions spent on “public goods” that appear to benefit only the lower classes but which, sociologists and geographers have pointed out, actually end up largely as subsidies not just to particular capitalists or sectors, but to the entire capitalist class.  This observation now seems counter-intuitive, but imagine, for example, if we had no public transport system at all. How could firms ensure that their workers get to work and produce profits for them? Wouldn’t each firm have to set aside capital to buy its own fleet of buses or to give its workers extra money to ride private buses to work because, otherwise, workers would not be able to come to work and produce profits?   Imagine there were no public schools: Each capitalist would have to spend part of his profits either running his own school to teach workers reading, writing, and other competencies needed for them to do their work – or topping-up their wages for them to go to private schools.  Every single peso that capitalists “save” from not having to pay for their own fleet of buses or their own schools either because the state – using tax revenues extracted from wealth produced by workers – provides these services for them, or because they have succeeded in forcing workers to directly absorb these “costs of reproducing labor” by keeping down wages – adds up to a massive, uncalculated but no less real subsidy from workers to the bourgeoisie: a class composed of a few thousand individuals living in posh Dasmariñas Village and other enclaves in the rest of the country and abroad. They – not MRT/LRT riders or “Metro Manilans” in general – are the real “favored offspring.” Why, then, do officials and some pro-government economists living in Dasmariñas Village insist on maligning MRT/LRT riders when the amount trickling down to the MRT/LRT pales in comparison with the amounts gushing up to business and industry? Why do they direct so much scorn on MRT/LRT riders – who are supposedly “non-poor” anyway since most earn more than the official “poverty threshold” of around P2,000/month per capita – while staying mum about their “non-poor” neighbors and the fabulous dole-outs they get from the state?   (Dasmariñas Village residents who really believe only those who earn less than around P2,000/month are “poor” ought to be challenged to live on P2,500/month, or even P15,000/month, then asked if they’d consider themselves “nonpoor” after even just one month).  Pitting the lower classes against each other Now echoed by many ordinary citizens, this attack on the commuting class should be seen in the context of the longstanding efforts by our elite to achieve and reproduce hegemony by deploying what sociologists call the “symbolic violence” of the state. This refers to the power to make people see their “selves” in terms other than class (as “Metro Manilans” or as “Cebuanos”), see the social world as divided along non-class lines (between “Metro Manilans” or “Cebuanos” or between “poor” or “non-poor” rather than between capitalists and workers or between the propertied and the property-less), perceive these divisions in terms of mere difference rather than antagonism, and therefore see their interests as being in harmony with the interests of the exploiting classes. In plainer terms: using their power to shape people’s “common sense” in the hope that they will see their exploiters not just as actual or potential “partners” but also as worthy leaders, promoting everyone’s interests and not just their own. Our elites’ ability to make people see the world in these terms, however, has long been hobbled by their unwillingness to grant material concessions to subordinate groups and their inability to see the collective interest in promoting public services such as public transport (i.e. for easing traffic, improving productivity, and fighting climate change). Unable to rally people behind a positive vision that promotes universal interests, they could only rely on the hoary strategy of pitting the dominated against each other, mobilizing the grievances of Cebuano workers or Ilocano farmers and setting up Manileño workers as their enemy, so as to make us turn against each other and prevent us from coming together. This explains this tack of focusing on the alleged taking of resources by the so-called “non-poor” MRT/LRT rider from the “real poor” while obscuring the hulking share of resources seized by the bourgeoisie: an attempt to goad slaves to keep fighting each other for a larger share of the scrapsthat fall off the master’s table. Paradoxically, this attempt to pit us against each other seems to be succeeding in part because of the elite’s very success in eroding public services that don’t directly benefit them: Forced to fend for themselves to pay for school, health care, transport, etc., more individuals belonging to the middle and lower classes feel more alone and insecure than ever, more convinced that they’re moving up (or at least not falling down) onlybecause of their own hard work, and even more bitterly resentful of any scraps thrown at others. Neoliberalism breeds more support for neoliberalism.  Towards a different station But where will this dog-eat-dog, every-man-for-himself, Cebuanos-versus-Manilenos “common sense” promoted by our elites take us if not a future in which the poorest stay unemployed in the barrios or the slums, the employed push and elbow each other in decaying, suffocating trains, while even the rich remain stuck, unmoved and unmoving in their shiny Porsches? In short: to a society no less, or even more, immobile and vicious than what we have today. There is another destination. As shown by those rising luxury condos and palatial mansion that greet us as we emerge from the bowels of Ayala or Buendia station, by the ballooning net worths of the Forbes’ Richest Filipino Families, and by their expanding fleet of private jets and Hummers, Filipino workers in the country and abroad are producing more than enough wealth to provide not just quality, dignified and free public transport system for all in Metro Manila but also quality, dignified and free public services for all even in the provinces—free not because workers are poor and pitiful and therefore deserving of the charity of the rich, but free because we have already paid for them with our blood, sweat, and tears. But, as workers’ groups like the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino have rightly pointed out, we’re not going to get this for as long as those who do not produce wealth, they who never take the train or buses, are the ones holding power. We can only get it when those of us who do take the train are also the ones who decide where our society is going. – Rappler.com  Herbert Villalon Docena is a sociologist by profession."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/ginebra-beats-meralco-slow-start","title":"Ginebra bucks slow start against Meralco for 2nd straight win","date":"May 24, 2014 9:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Zaccheus Mason came up big for Ginebra, scoring 32 while grabbing 19 rebounds to lead the Gin Kings to a win over the Meralco Bolts and a 2-0 record","body":"MANILA, Philippines - The arena wasn't packed and the crowd wasn't as rowdy. The atmosphere was generally calm and steady with occasional bursts of thrill.  This wasn't a big playoffs game with huge implications. But it was part of the little things, the baby steps of Barangay Ginebra San Miguel towards the kind of team they envision for themselves.  Starting off slow, cold, and even seemingly lost at times, Ginebra found their rhythm in the second quarter and repulsed the Meralco Bolts, 95-82, on Saturday, May 24 at the Mall of Asia Arena to claim their second consecutive victory in as many games in the 2014 PLDT Home Telpad PBA Governors' Cup.  Grabbing the upper hand right off the gates, the Bolts raced to a 12-2 tally early in the first before they were chased down by the Gin Kings to come to within a point, 13-12.  But Meralco's good mood on offense was not to be hindered as they pushed on for a 28-18 lead to end the first.  For head coach Jeff Cariaso, this game, and that first quarter shakiness, are all part of Ginebra's learning curve.   \"It's really obvious when I say this but every game is different. Even when you're in a series, it's different,\" Cariaso explained. \"What I like about tonight is us going through a hard time early in the first quarter. We persevered.\" And persevere they did, giving the Bolts a dose of their own medicine with a 28-point second frame-production, all while clamping down defensively to douse water on Meralco's hot shooting and keep them at just 15 points.  It was at the 4:40 mark of the second that Ginebra took the driver's seat, 36-35, on a Greg Slaughter bucket. Before the Bolts could find their bearings, Mac Baracael followed up with a big left corner trey, 39-35, as his team went on to end the half on top, 46-43.  Baracael eventually finished the game with 11 points on a perfect 3-of-3 from beyond the arc, while the 7-foot Slaughter racked up 22 markers along with 10 boards, 3 assists and 4 blocks.   Although able to keep in step with Ginebra, the Bolts failed to regain control as they muffed easy baskets and struggled against the defense of guys like LA Tenorio, Dylan Ababou and Emman Monfort.  The usually high-scoring Tenorio finished only with 4 points and 4 assists. But in spite of his unusual silence so far in the Governors' Cup, Cariaso said he doesn't think the speedy playmaker is in a slump.   \"I don't think he's struggling. I think he played well against Gary David today. He was our chaser,\" Cariaso explained.  He said Tenorio was able to limit David's production to just 12 points in this game when he could have easily dropped 30. Cariaso noted that David's points came mostly from inside as he tried to exploit his height advantage on Tenorio for offensive rebounds.   \"We took away his strength. His strength is to go outside and LA did a good job in what we call chasing him and defending him and making it hard for him to shoot.\" At halftime, Cariaso said he emphasized consistency on defense to his players, pointing out that Meralco was able to stay in the game due to Ginebra relaxing every few possessions.   His team responded and by the fourth quarter, Ginebra had already established a rhythm that was practically unbreakable, even though Meralco made some runs.   \"What I'm most proud of is today we just stuck with the system,\" Cariaso said. \"We didn't change the way we play or how I want them to play and somehow, some way we found a way to keep it close and then eventually ran away towards end of the third and start of the fourth.\" Ginebra maintained their intensity in rebounding from their first win over Globalport, collaring down 57 rebounds and 18 offensive ones in this game, which translated to 12 second chance points.  An improvement in their execution of the triangle was also noticeable, especially in limiting their previous 21 turnovers to only 12 in this game - a fact Cariaso was particularly happy about.   Import Zaccheus Mason topscored for the game with 32 points and 19 rebounds. His counterpart at Meralco had 26 markers and 11 boards.  Cliff Hodge and Jared Dillinger contributed 19 and 11 points, respectively.  The Bolts still couldn't crack the win column as they remained winless in 3 outings.  Ginebra, meanwhile, will continue putting one foot in front of the other.  \"Our goal is to be better every day, be better every game,\" Cariaso said. \"So I think tonight we were better against a better team all around. We needed to play this way.\" Scores Ginebra 95 - Mason 32, Slaughter 22, Baracael 11, Ellis 9, Aguilar 4, Tenorio 4, Caguioa 4, Monfort 3, Reyes 2, Helterbrand 2, Mamaril 2, Ababou 0.  Meralco 82 - Williams 26, Hodge 19, David 12, Dillinger 11, Hugnatan 8, Ildefonso 2,  Caram 2, Wilson 2, Timberlake 0, Salvacion 0.  Quarter scores: 18-28; 46-43; 68-61; 95-82.  - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/nba-rockets-snap-blazers-win-streak","title":"NBA: Rockets snap Blazers' 5-game win streak","date":"Jan 21, 2014 4:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Chandler Parsons scored a season-high 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and seven assists as the Houston Rockets breezed past the Portland Trail Blazers 126-113 on Monday.","body":"HOUSTON, Tex. - Chandler Parsons scored a season-high 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and seven assists as the Houston Rockets breezed past the Portland Trail Blazers 126-113 on Monday.

I once had a conversation with a young adult who asked why we can't just shut up about labels, about gayness, about race.  \"Can't we forget about all of that and just be people?\" \"Sure, it's easy for you to say that as a white and straight-looking lesbian. You are not subject to what gay people of color experience on a daily basis,\" I said.  I don't think she knew what I meant, and it is hard to explain this until you breathe bias and stereotypes every day. Labels empower people. By claiming the taunts \"Bakla!\" and \"Tomboy!\" and calling ourselves by those names, we render these words powerless, and therefore they can no longer be used against us.  By my using the term \"lesbian\" to describe myself, a relatively feminine woman in the occasional skirt, I erase the notion that lesbians are only very masculine cross-dressers. If I say I'm a homosexual, I delete the stigma of that word, its medical disorder connotation, its innate negative implications.  If I apply all these formerly derogatory terms to myself, my marriage, and my family, everyone can readily see that all this time they have been insulting and negatively viewing an ordinary person like me, and they have been discriminating against my relationship with my wife blindly, unknowingly impacting our daily lives. My reality allows me the luxury to blend into society and live my life invisibly. I have the comforts that do not require me to stand up for myself to demand equality. I live around many gays and lesbians who have always felt that speaking up about homosexuality is beneath them and they just want to live their lives.  That is both understandable and respectable. I really have nothing solid to gain in sticking my neck out and correcting misconceptions and exposing inequalities. But I still do it, the way I've done since I decided that instead of this umbrella of doom surrounding homosexuality, I was going to be proud of myself. Out and proud In 2000, I came out on national TV in a show featuring Manila lesbian life. I wasn't around for the barrage of calls my mother got the next day, asking if what I brazenly declared was true. Why did I have to be so loud about it, they asked. Why did I have to be so proud of what was still largely treated as a personal defect? I'll tell you why.  For the quarter-hour segment where I spoke, I was visible as a young and pretty lesbian who loved herself and her partner in plain sight. For my 15 minutes of personal shame (where I was mostly preoccupied with my squeaky voice and bad outfit), possibly thousands of young girls and closeted lesbians saw that loving another woman does not have to be this dirty, embarrassing secret.  We don't have to end up as someone's unmarried aunt who has a \"best friend.\" Quietly, they might have told themselves, hey that's me, and I can love myself too! I can declare my love for my partner, and the world will not end! I was not a trailblazer. My courage only arose from many others before me who were out and proud. The older lesbian advocates had so much more to lose. The loud, colorful trannies and barely clothed gay men risked their own lives every time they showed their fabulous selves to the world. You see, we are not proud just so we can bother you. We don't have parades and gatherings to embarrass ourselves and make you feel uncomfortable. We truly are proud of ourselves and who we love because we know there is nothing wrong with it aside from the world's biases.  We don't make a statement to grab attention or to put ourselves in bad light but because our invisibility has kept us quietly discriminated for far too long.  What silence means  Further silence is an acceptance of these inequities. Further invisibility supports the notion that we can be gay but only if we behave, only if we conform, only if we dress like you and act like you, and don't make too much noise.  Does conformity have to be the guarantee that we won't be hurt and ridiculed? This logic is baffling, and humanity can do so much better. In other words, asking us to not make a scene implies that you'll love us only If you don't see us. We'll only be tolerated if we don't exist.  But if you don't see us, how do you know that we're around, that our struggles are yours and our families are your families? If nobody comes out, how will employers know that they will lose talented workers if they condone bias and discrimination? If nobody is brave, how will young people know that that they don't need to stifle their own nature to be loved?  Let's be grateful for the bold, brazen, and brave ones. After all, it's the sharp and courageous among us who break the rules, who show us a different way of thinking, and eventually change minds. They clear and widen narrow paths, tirelessly and often with much resistance so that everyone else can see the light. - Rappler.com  Shakira Andrea Sison currently works in the financial industry while dabbling in several unrelated projects and interests.

In a potentially dramatic shift in diplomatic roles, the European Union now aims to join heavyweight China in trying to galvanize the world into implementing the landmark 2015 agreement – but minus the planet's second biggest carbon polluter. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang are vowing to forge ahead with the Paris agreement without the US when they meet in Brussels Friday morning. Juncker denounced as \"seriously wrong\" US President Donald Trump's shock announcement Thursday, June 1, to pull out of the deal that his predecessor Barack Obama and Chinese leaders had been instrumental in brokering. Echoing earlier remarks from his boss, EU commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Canete, pledged continued \"global leadership\" on climate change. Trump's \"announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership,\" Canete said.  \"Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way,\" the Spanish commissioner said on the eve of the summit. In talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Li said it was in China's own interest to press ahead \"steadfastly\" with the Paris deal, and urged other countries to do likewise. China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the notorious choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US, the second biggest polluter, are together responsible for some 40 percent of the world's emissions and experts had warned that it is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to have any chance of succeeding. But Canete said the EU will work with existing partners and forge new alliances, including with the world's largest economies as well as the many US citizens, businesses and communities that support the Paris agreement. 'Significantly intensify' The Paris agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures \"well below\" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to \"pursue efforts\" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Juncker has noted that it would take three or four years to exit the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had tried in vain to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit a week ago. A draft joint summit statement seen by Agence France-Presse said the EU and Chinese leaders will stress \"their highest political commitment\" into implementing all aspects of the Paris deal.  \"The EU and China consider the Paris Agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development,\" the nine-page draft said.  They vow to \"significantly intensify\" their political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate change and clean energy to help the world shift to an economy based on low greenhouse gas emissions. Hoping to make the climate fight a \"main pillar\" of their bilateral partnership, including economic ties, the two underlined that their cooperation will fuel job creation, investments and economic growth, the statement said. In announcing the pullout, Trump said the Paris pact was a bad deal that may or not be renegotiated, adding it punished the United States and was too easy on China, India and Europe. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/captain-america-us-box-office-lead-jungle-book","title":"'Captain America: Civil War' grabs US box office lead, overtakes 'The Jungle Book'","date":"May 9, 2016 5:02 PM PHT","snippet":"'Civil War' overtakes 'The Jungle Book' in the US box office, grossing $181.8 million in its opening weekend","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – The latest rock-'em-sock-'em Captain America film has vaulted past Disney's The Jungle Book at the North American box office with a strong debut weekend take of $181.8 million, industry data showed Sunday.

Namun, pemerintah secara resmi baru memberlakukan pelarangan ini pada Kamis, 17 Desember, ini. \"Apapun namanya, pengoperasian sejenis, Go-Jek, Go-Box, GrabBike, GrabCar, Blu-Jek, Lady-Jek, dilarang,\" kata Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Djoko Sasono, Kamis.  Sontak, pelarangan ini menimbulkan amarah masyarakat utamanya di ibu kota yang selama ini telah bergantung pada moda transportasi seperti Go-Jek, GrabBike, dan Uber. Seorang netizen bernama F. Frico membuat petisi yang ditujukan pada Jonan agar meninjau ulang larangan pemerintah terhadap layanan ojek dan taksi berbasis online. “Layanan transportasi berbasis daring (online) sangat dibutuhkan saat ini, selain praktis juga dapat membantu mengurangi kemacetan yang sudah semakin tidak terkendali,” tulis Frico dalam petisinya di Change.org. Jika kamu merasa sependapat dan ingin mendukung petisi ini, kamu bisa klik di sini. Menurut Frico, jika alasan pelarangan ojek dan taksi online adalah karena tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai operator angkutan umum, seharusnya ojek tradisional juga dilarang. “Sejak dahulu mereka sudah tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai angkutan umum,” tambahnya. Selain melalui petisi, penolakan juga terjadi di media sosial. Bahkan mantan Wakil Presiden Indonesia Boediono juga ikut mengemukakan kekecewaannya atas keputusan Menteri Perhubungan. Sementara Presiden Joko “Jokowi” Widodo juga mempertanyakan keputusan Jonan dan berjanji akan memanggil menterinya tersebut. Tagar #SaveGojek pun sempat menjadi trending topic Twitter pada Jumat, 18 Desember, yang juga diikuti dengan #SaveGrabBike dan #SaveUber. Seorang pegawai swasta, Gloria Kezia, yang sering menggunakan fasilitas taksi online, mengatakan bahwa keputusan ini tidak masuk akal. “Yang benar saja dong, pemerintah. Kenapa sih memangnya? Itu kan sangat membantu masyarakat yang enggak punya uang buat naik taksi, sedangkan yang lebih murah fasilitasnya tidak memadai. Mau nyaman harus mahal, ada alternatif kenapa malah dilarang?” ujar Gloria kesal. Sedangkan menurut seorang pengguna setia ojek online, Dara Alia, pelarangan tersebut hanya sekadar gertakan biasa. “Alah, paling itu ‘gertak sambal’ saja.

But I digress.  These days, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t know the Avengers, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Batman, Wonder Woman or, heck, even Thanos.   Comic books and the characters who populate their pages have become so pervasive in our modern pop culture that we see their likenesses on cellphone covers, t-shirts, fast food kiddie meals, umbrellas, public transport, car windows, shampoo bottles and grocery items.  These super-heroes star in some of the most eagerly awaited – and, for film studios, among the most financially rewarding – motion pictures.  The San Diego International Comic Book Convention (or SDCC) morphed from a smallish gathering of comic book fans to a veritable pop culture mecca. For a long-time comic book fan like me, the near-ubiquity of comic book-based pop culture items is a breath of fresh air.   I still remember a time when most people I knew considered comic books as “niche,\" or perhaps even a sub-culture, relevant only to a small group of your stereotypically bespectacled geeks (yes, I wear corrective eyeglasses) who wear only “geek-shirts” (no, I wear \"regular clothes\" most of the time and don’t even own a super-hero themed t-shirt).   Back then, \"geek\" and \"nerd\" were derisive terms.   The popularity of Marvel and DC super-heroes nowadays also helps resuscitate what was, just a few years ago, a struggling comic book industry.  However, this popularity can be a double-edged sword. This comic book resurgence, powered as it is by the popularity of the Avengers and the Justice League, tends to create a myopic view of comic books and comic book fans. The Big Bang Theory’s Amy Farrah Fowler best summed up this narrow view when she declared comic books as “picture books about flying men in colorful underwear.\" Some people I know believe this stereotype. Some have asked me why I (a grown man pushing 50) still read comic books. They view comic books as lesser than novels because “it has drawings and very few words.\"  Others argue that comic books are the height of escapism since they “deal exclusively in fantasy and science-fiction.\" Still, others say “comic books are just for kids.\" These assessments are not entirely unfair.   Many comic books do feature characters who fly and/or wear skin-tight spandex costumes. Comic books, by their nature, combine words, drawings and lettering to tell stories. Many of these stories involve fantastical elements – and I don’t just mean super powers and anatomically-improbable physiques. And super-heroes in general do cater to a relatively younger set (I, for one, started reading comic books when I was in grade school). But these views do not, by any means, paint a complete picture of what comic books are and how they have evolved over the decades. If I may again borrow a quote from The Big Bang Theory, comic books “employ story-telling through sequential art, a medium that dates back to the cave paintings in Lascaux, France.\"  Art has always been a defining feature of comic books, and comic book art these days are downright amazing.  Take a look at the fully-painted books created by the award-winning Alex Ross, or the photo-realistic quality drawings done by Stanley “Artgerm” Lau, Inhyuk Lee, and Shannon Maer, or the haunting and textured works by Gabriele dell’Otto, Andrea Sorrentino, and Francesco Mattina.   Comic books are a medium – not a genre – of story-telling. Many of them deal with very serious issues.   Comic book creators have been known to use super-heroes as literary foils in their bouts with very serious, real-world topics. Grant Morrison’s classic Batman: Arkham Asylum (A Serious Place on Serious Earth) and Sean Murhpy’s tour-de-force, Batman: White Knight / Curse of the White Knight, effectively uses the Dark Knight and his arch-nemesis, the Joker, to explore the nature of sanity.  Fan-favorite Chris Claremont exposes the dangers of zealotry and racism in X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills and Days of Future Past (co-written with John Byrne).  There are also many comic books that do not even feature super-heroes.   Take Neil Gaiman’s critically-acclaimed The Sandman, which ponders the secret of dreams and dreaming.Or Joe Kubert’s Fax from Sarajevo, about the horrors of the 1990s genocide in the former Yugoslavia and a family’s indomitable spirit of survival. James Tynion IV’s Something is Killing the Children is primarily a horror comic book but has, as its undercurrent, musings about how children can be more attuned to the world than adults.   And Jeff Loveness’ Strange Skies Over East Berlin, about an American spy’s terrifying and otherworldly discovery in Cold War-era Germany, also serves as a treatise on the nature of truth and the lies people tell themselves to cope with trauma. There are comic books which experiment with story-telling techniques and narrative structure. Benjamin Percy’s Year Zero provides a fresh take on a zombie apocalypse by using multiperspectivity. Zac Thompson and Lonnie Nadler’s Undone by Blood or The Shadow of a Wanted Man effectively uses meta-textual narrative. Jonathan Hickman’s acclaimed Dawn of X / Powers of X tweaks the concept of \"frame story\" and the \"predestination paradox\" in re-starting the X-Men storyline. I am excited by the fact that recent years have seen a plethora of excellent independent publishers, which release so many amazing titles. Boom Studios, Image, AWA Upshot, TKO and Vault Comics provide creators freer reign over content.  These publishers have been able to produce impressive, beautiful, even disquieting stories like Jeff Lemire’s chilling, Twilight Zone-esque masterpiece Gideon Falls; Garth Ennis’ haunting Sara, about how an all-female Soviet sniper regiment during World War II found their identity and in the midst of war; Sina Grace’s quirky and moving Ghosted in L.A., which is both a love letter to the City of Los Angeles and an exploration of friendship, identity, and the things that make it difficult for people to move on; and Ram V’s exquisite These Savage Shores, a vampire story that serves as an allegory for English colonial rule in India. All of these are as beautifully written as best-selling novels. This is in itself a feat, since writing for comic books demands a unique story-telling discipline and an economy of words. Writer, artist and letterer have to work closely to ensure that everything fits in a limited number of pages while maintaining narrative integrity and ensuring the story flows well enough to keep the readers’ attention. Comic books are stories about people. They are about life, love, despair, hope, desire, friendship and family. They explore the human experience, the everyday moments, the age-old mysteries, and the grand, cosmic questions of being, of time, and of the beginning – and end – of all things. Yes, some of the characters in these pages can fly. Some of them are immortal, or can control minds. Some of them even wear colorful skin-tight spandex. But we should not confuse the forest for the trees. When a beautifully written story and amazing art come together in a cohesive whole, it grabs hold of you, moves you, and stays with you long after you've read them – whether it’s about Wonder Woman saving the planet, or your everyday woman changing the world.   That, to me, is what makes a good story. A story worth reading and sharing with others. And that’s why a grown-up (like me) still reads comic books. – Rappler.com Get your comic book favorites on Lazada with this voucher code!

Sujith Wilson was the second toddler in 4 months to grab nationwide attention after falling into the 30-centimeter (one-foot) diameter pipe while playing near his home in Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu state on Friday.  \"The body was retrieved using special equipment and he was in a decomposed state,\" district official S. Sivarasu told journalists. He added that a post-mortem examination would be carried out to determine the cause of death. A thermal camera had been used to monitor the child's temperature while oxygen was supplied through a pipe. Rescuers said the toddler was unconscious but breathing until Sunday morning, but they had been unable to check his condition since then as he had slipped further down.  Workers used an oil drill to dig a hole parallel to the well, but the rig broke down around 10 metres (33 feet) from the boy because of the rocky ground. Attempts to use robotic devices to lower ropes to latch onto the boy's wrist failed on Saturday. Politicians had started a vigil at the site and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leader Rahul Gandhi offered their \"prayers\" in Twitter statements as national attention focussed on Tiruchirappalli. It is the latest in a series of incidents involving children falling into disused wells in rural India. In June, a two year-old boy died after spending 4 days trapped inside one in Punjab state. In 2006 the rescue of a six-year-old made international headlines when he was recovered safely in Haryana state after being stuck in an 18-metre (60-foot) well for 48 hours. The wells are very common across rural India as they are a key source of water for farmers and domestic users. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/tesda-says-filipinos-do-not-want-work-construction-anymore","title":"Filipinos don’t want to work for construction anymore","date":"Jun 7, 2019 2:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Over 2 million jobs are up for grabs as the government pushes for more infrastructure problems.

Urdaneta said Tesda allocated a big chunk of its scholarship funding for construction-related courses. However, the agency struggles to fill up a class. “For you to have a cost effective program, you need 20 trainees. Sometimes, only 10 enroll, and if ever we reach 20, some already leave and get employed elsewhere,” Urdaneta said. She said Filipinos prefer enrolling in courses related to hospitality and tourism, rather than the much needed construction skills. President Rodrigo Duterte himself flagged the problem back in February. “Eh ‘yang ‘Build, Build, Build’, medyo atrasado nang konti. Walang trabahante (Build Build Build is a bit delayed do to a lack of workers),” Duterte said. The Department of Trade and Industry previously said the shortage of construction workers reach as high as 2.5 million.  The government intends to spend some P8 trillion for infrastructure projects. (IN CHARTS: PH employment rises in April over 'Build Build Build') The surge of infrastructure projects reduced unemployment.

Gene Pilapil, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, pointed out the consequences of the Con-Com's newly modified transitory provisions on Tuesday, July 17. \"This could only be described as a reverse power grab or a sort of impeachment-via-new-constitution, and is utterly contemptuous of the electoral, hence democratic, mandate bestowed on her (Robredo) by the 1987 Constitution,\" he told lawmakers and Con-Com members present. Pilapil was referring to the provisions that call for the election of a Transitory President and Vice President once the new constitution is ratified. This was a recent modification by the Con-Com made upon the request of Duterte because he claims he wants to resign upon the new charter's ratification. The two transitory leaders would be given all the powers of the president and vice president and their election would cut short Duterte's and Robredo's term. Pilapil said this is unfair to Robredo whose term could be cut short simply due to Duterte's whims. \"But even worse than Duterte’s, is the term of Vice President Leni Robredo, who is dragged into this stunt, and whose term will also be cut short by request of Duterte,\" said Pilapil. The provisions also disenfranchise the 14 million Filipinos who voted for her, he said. They bar her from fulfilling her role as the President's successor upon his resignation. Pilapil pointed out that Robredo has \"no plan to abandon her mandate\" and is \"actually the constitutional successor of the 1987 Constitution if the president decides to resign.\" 'Grocery list' The academic expressed indignation that the Con-Com did not question Duterte's recommendations, given its consequences. \"Mad as this stand of the president, especially on the VP, madder still is the Con-Com agreeing to this cavalier suggestion of constitutional strangulation of democratic mandates,\" he said. Pilapil's statement was staunchly against the Con-Com's draft charter which he called a mere \"grocery list\" of institutions. He particularly scoured the Con-Com for not laying out a more detailed transition plan and leaving this to the \"all-powerful\" Federal Transition Commission to be headed by the Transition President. \"No wonder the Consultative Committee finished its constitution two weeks ahead of President Duterte’s SONA: it passed this crucial, dirty, and most difficult job to someone else,\" said Pilapil. Previously, Con-Com chairman Reynato Puno, when asked if the committee would limit or provide a check on the powers of the Transition Commission, said the powers given to it are similar to powers given by previous constitutions to previous transition commissions. However, the previous constitutions did not set up a federal system of government which entails sweeping structural changes. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/npa-congratulate-fighters-death-lumad-mampaundag","title":"NPA congratulates fighters for killing Lumad father, son","date":"Feb 14, 2018 9:11 PM PHT","snippet":"The New People's Army-Southern Mindanao Operations Command claims that Datu Banandjao Mampaundag engaged in 'land grabbing, theft and extortion, grave abuse, and a host of other human rights abuses'","body":"DAVAO CITY, Philippines – The New People’s Army (NPA) in Mindanao has confirmed that it is responsible for the death of a Lumad father and son in Davao del Norte earlier this month. The NPA-Southern Mindanao Operations Command (NPA-SMROC) said in statement that Datu Banandjao Mampaundag and son Jhonard Mampaundag were killed by fighters upon its orders.  NPA-SMROC congratulated the fighters, claiming that the Mampaundags were responsible for atrocities in Talaingod. “The NPA-SMROC congratulates Red fighters and operatives in carrying out the standing order against CAFGU leader Banadjao Mampaundag and his son Jhonard,” said Rigoberto Sanchez, the spokesperson of the command. The victims were “shot to death” on the morning of February 4, according to the military, which had pointed to the NPA as behind the killings. The Mampaundags had just been trained in December 2017 as active auxiliaries of the military to participate in counter-insurgency operations. Two months later in February, Datu Banandjao was among those leaders who participated in a gathering of indigenous peoples in Davao City, where President Rodrigo Duterte told them to prepare to relocate from their communities to temporary shelters. But the NPA said Datu Banandjao “was no hero or benevolent tribal leader of Talaingod.” According to Sanchez, the father was a “longtime CAFGU member and rabid recruiter of the notorious Alamara paramilitary forces under the payroll of the 10th Infantry Division-AFP.” “He was responsible for crimes against the people such as land grabbing, theft and extortion, grave abuse, and a host of other human rights abuses,” he added. Fellow tribal members of the victims recently warned the NPA that if communist rebels continue to take lives, then they would likely retaliate. The NPA, however, insisted that the killings were part of its quest for “revolutionary justice.” The NPA said Mampaundag and his son had been warned to desist from engaging in criminal activities and participating in the military’s counter-revolutionary operations. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/brain-own-world-wide-web-words","title":"Your brain has its own World Wide Web of words","date":"Aug 26, 2016 7:45 AM PHT","snippet":"[Science Solitaire] To say that language is a mere accessory is like saying your head is just something nature grabbed for you to wear but that you would be perfectly fine walking around headless","body":"                   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/uhop-tnc-accredited-ltfrb","title":"Ride-sharing shuttle service U-Hop gets LTFRB accreditation","date":"Mar 17, 2016 10:44 AM PHT","snippet":"The Filipino-developed service uses the same app-based booking system model of Uber and Grab, but U-Hop offers a shuttle service that can seat up to 7 people at a time","body":"MANILA, Philippines – More than 6 months after it first applied for accreditation, Filipino-developed ride-sharing service U-Hop has been approved by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

Who were the plotters behind the brazen power grab attempt?","body":"(Editor's Note: This story on \"EDSA 3\" – the uprising that protested the arrest of ousted president Joseph Estrada in April 2001 and attempted to reinstall him – was first published by Newsbreak in May 2001. The mobilization involved members of the Iglesia ni Cristo.) MANILA, Philippines – On Sunday morning of April 29, 2001, key leaders of the pro-Estrada movement met in the Estradas’ residence at Polk Street in Greenhills, San Juan, to finalize plans for a march to Malacañang in the coming days. One suggestion was for the opposition female senatorial bets, led by Jamby Madrigal, who is campaigning on a youth platform, to lead the throng from Ortigas to Mendiola. The rest of the pro-Estrada women leaders, including Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago, would carry a rosary and pray while marching. (The senatorial election was scheduled a month later, in May 2001, and the pro-Estrada senators were running under the banner of Puwersa ng Masa – Editors) It was to have a sobering effect on the angry multitude, but a dramatic one at that, according to a senior police intelligence official whose mole attended that meeting. But what if the mass turned into a mob? Where would that leave – what else? – Puwersa ng Masa? No unified command In the end, 6 dump trucks were rented to ferry the agitated Estrada loyalists from Ortigas to Sta Mesa, Manila, flanked by tens of thousands of urban poor residents who had been hardened by years of rough battles with demolition teams. The rest of the agitators at EDSA stayed in their Expeditions or camped out in posh safehouses, as they monitored the street fight through their cell phones. All the propaganda notwithstanding, it is difficult to determine coherence in the so-called power grab plan by the Estrada forces. The Estrada bloc was as unwieldy at EDSA as it was in the first months upon Joseph Estrada’s assumption of the presidency. If there was a plot to use military force in the endgame, it could only have been known to a few. The history of destabilization plots is a history of compartmentalization. And the uncanny pattern of all the plots staged in this country, post-Marcos, is a pattern of plotters abandoning their troops in the end. There were 4 layers that dominated the EDSA protests: • Senatorial candidates such as Juan Ponce Enrile, Gregorio Honasan, and Panfilo Lacson Jr, who had built-in connections with the police-military establishment and a track record of failed coup plots • The Puwersa ng Masa, whose principal agenda is to win big in May • The organized mass in the rally site, which had various command centers with diverse interests: the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) of Eraño Manalo, El Shaddai of Bro. Mike Velarde, Ang Dating Daan of Bro. Elly Santiago, Philippine Movement Against Poverty (PMAP), and local politicians led by General Santos City Mayor Adelbert Antonino, as well as the Estrada sons, JV and Jinggoy • The unorganized Estrada supporters. On the third day of the protests, a soldier associated with Honasan approached an Army battalion commander who once joined one of the coups against the Aquino government. The offer was straightforward: P1 million for a battalion commander, P500,000 for company commander, and P50,000 for enlisted personnel. The battalion commander immediately reported this to the chief of staff, according to a colonel who personally knows the commander. Honasan’s secretary, too, had called up unit commanders based in Metro Manila at the height of the protests, according to the same source. The commanders were asked to return the call of the senator, and these commanders reported the call to Camp Aguinaldo. “What Greg and Ping committed was 100 officers,” says a former RAM leader who remained loyal to the government. A police officer was monitored to have made various phone calls to Ronald Lumbao, PMAP president, prodding him to prepare for a march to Malacañang. Honasan, Lacson, and Enrile were also monitored in various meetings with some of the organizers of the Edsa rally, which included an INC leader. Beyond all the calls, meetings, and mega-agitation at EDSA, what exactly was the plan? Initial target: Crame Four days before Estrada’s arrest, PMAP mapped out a two-fold protest action: first, to stop the police from picking up Estrada in Greenhills by mobilizing 10,000 people there; and second, to bring at least 20,000 people to Camp Crame and stage daily vigils in front of the camp. The hope, of course, was for the group to swell and choke the gates of the National Police headquarters. Maybe then, events would take their natural course. But police blockades were everywhere on the day Estrada was arrested. PMAP could not even muster 500 people to bring to Polk Street. In an interview, 3 PMAP organizers say they were repulsed at all corners in Greenhills and Crame, thus the hurried decision to go to EDSA. Did they not plan to go to EDSA from Day One? “Why should we? That’s not our EDSA,” retorts one of the PMAP organizers, a former leftist. The radio broadcast by the INC-controlled dzEC and Cable TV Net-25 came simultaneously, however, because INC had committed even before Estrada’s arrest to help dramatize the plight of the ex-president. How to deal with INC? Edicio de la Torre, a former Estrada government official, recalls that in various meetings at Polk Street after the filing of the plunder charges against Estrada, the INC and El Shaddai were mentioned as the backbone of any protest that could come out after the arrest. It was expected that Mayor Antonino, the local politician closest to Estrada, coordinated the moves of pro-Estrada mayors and governors who brought their constituents to Edsa. It was Antonino who was in charge of the same task at the height of the impeachment trial against the ex-president. In fact, Antonino was supposed to be part of the negotiating team with the Arroyo government had talks pushed through, according to De la Torre. But that’s going ahead of the story. On the third day of the protest, the crowd reached a high of 100,000, and the following day, PNP Director General Leandro Mendoza reported to the President that 70% of that came from the INC. How to deal with the INC? The President hedged. Some of her advisers were predisposed to dismiss any option of back-channeling with a religious bloc that had obviously conspired with sectors out to oust her. Thus, Army tanks rolled over the streets housing the dzEC radio station. “We had to show them that government is still working,” quips a police officer. On Saturday, April 28, Arroyo presided over 4 meetings in Malacañang. The last for the day ended at 1 am, and dispersal was discussed. While in principle she was completely against it, the reality was such that the option had to be tackled, says a military aide. “One count lang yan, ma’am (That's only one count, ma'am),\" one of those present at the meeting quotes Armed Forces of the Philippines boss General Diomedio Villanueva as telling Arroyo. Villanueva explained that if only the crowd at EDSA started moving to other areas, it would be easier to disperse them in transit. In the meeting, Mendoza said that the police and military could deploy tanks as a show of force on EDSA. “Pang-harang lang (Just as a blockade),” Mendoza is quoted by the source as saying. But when it was Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes’ turn to talk about his own proposed option, he asked that all the civilian and military staff in the meeting be ordered to leave the room. Closed-door meetings Earlier that day, Reyes had met with Honasan on neutral ground. The senator said the meeting was just meant to “open the lines of communication” between the two sides. No agreement was reached, no demands were raised by either of them. By that time, the leadership in the police and the military were convinced that Sunday night, April 29, would be D-Day. In Malacañang that day, Arroyo and Reyes held a closed-door meeting with Air Force chief Lt. Gen. Benjamin Defensor, brother of Senator Santiago. Defensor had earlier been reported to have been recruited by the other side, although this must have been a psy-war move on Honasan’s side. Taking no chance, Arroyo asked Defensor to stay in Malacañang the entire night. There were efforts, too, to open lines with the alleged power-grabbers. Reyes, Interior Secretary Jose Lina, and Secretary Perez were to be the “unofficial” negotiators. In the Estrada camp, the negotiators were to be Antonino, former Senator Ernesto Maceda, and Enrile. Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Vidal was to arrive also that day to broker a meeting between the President and Estrada. A Palace official had asked the camp of Horacio “Boy” Morales, an Estrada ally, to broker talks with Enrile, according to De la Torre. But obviously the government abandoned the plan. The power grab uncovered by government was sketchy: The crowd was to march to Malacañang and force their entry with the help of armed men composed mostly of civilians and members of the Guardian brotherhood loyal to Honasan. The trigger that the Estrada force was waiting for was a gunshot from the other side during dispersal operations. Even PMAP organizers admit they had expected massive resistance from Ortigas to Mendiola. Instead, they were met with weak barricades, they tell Newsbreak. In so many words, they complain that government had allowed them, with least resistance, to reach Malacañang. Thus, their own conspiracy theory: That perhaps government had baited them into moving to Malacañang so they could be crushed right before the seat of power.  But D-Day did not come on Sunday. The noise and the flurry of intelligence reports about a strike that day was vintage RAM: It was a trial balloon to see how well prepared government was for the situation. Negotiations with Manalo While preparing for the attack, government reached two major decisions: Disperse the rally the following day, Monday, and declare a state of emergency, according to two Palace insiders. The state of emergency was the subject of intense debate among the President’s closest advisers, and was eventually shot down. At the National Security Council meeting Monday, Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr broached the idea of talking to INC leader Manalo, considering the PNP report that the bulk of the crowd at EDSA were INC members. Some Cabinet secretaries opposed the idea, Pimentel recalls. “I told them that good governance is not only the observance of the law...that there were other factors that should be considered if one is to govern well,” Pimentel says. Arroyo listened to the debate. A few hours later, she dispatched Pimentel, Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr, and Justice Secretary Hernando Perez to meet with Manalo. By 2 pm, even before the dialogue was to end, Net-25 had stopped its live coverage of the EDSA protest. There are two versions of what was agreed upon during the meeting: Perez said Manalo had asked about the likelihood of a house arrest or even another jail for Estrada. The government panel explained that this was up to the court but that they would make sure Estrada is moved to a better cell. The version of the Estrada camp is a bit fantastic. Both sides reportedly agreed on a house arrest, for the plunder case to be archived in the future, and for Arroyo to become acting president. Still, it was evident that part of the compromise was Estrada’s transfer in the future to the Veterans Hospital, where yet another bungalow is being constructed for him and son Jinggoy. A Camp Aguinaldo source confirms that the Army’s engineering brigade will build the bungalow. This time, Estrada can have a view of the hospital’s golf grounds. What went wrong? The INC pullout from EDSA Monday afternoon allowed the government to relax its guard. Arroyo boasted to the media that a power grab had fizzled out; later in the night, she visited her leftist supporters camped out in Mendiola, as if to send them a message that the threat was over and that they could leave. And most of them did.  At a command conference in Camp Aguinaldo that night, the assessment was that the threat had died down, and that the remaining possibilities were bombings and assassinations by the power-grabbers. A few hours later, Malacañang came close to collapse. It was witness to the biggest anti-government rally around it in 3 decades. Still, no soldier or cop defected to the other side. “Up to last Monday they were still recruiting; they had forgotten that soldiers do think,” says retired general and presidential adviser Eduardo Ermita. “They had no cause, and no soldier would sacrifice his career for something that’s doomed to fail,” he says. Why did it come to this then? De la Torre describes the sentiment that drove people to EDSA as “100 days of panggigigil (suppressed emotions).” It had been 100 days after all since Estrada’s ouster. Political strategist Angelito Banayo says the government did not anticipate a backlash from the arrest because the surveys showed Arroyo with a high approval rating at the time. “She and her advisers are hardcore scientists....They look at figures and decide based on numbers,” Banayo adds. With what happened, Arroyo’s security problems will continue until the end of her term, according to Banayo. But even Puwersa thought that in the end, Estrada’s arrest would have a negative impact on its campaign. “It was only Butz Aquino who was so upbeat about the prospect of a pro-Puwersa vote in case of Erap’s arrest,” says an aide of Angara. Banayo agrees. “My reading of the situation then was that Erap’s fortunes would diminish as soon as the cases are filed and that this would impact on the (Puwersa) candidates.” Thus when the crowd swelled at EDSA, the politicians allied with Estrada smelled victory. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/thailand-thug-street-wisdom","title":"In Thailand, a thug’s street wisdom","date":"Jul 18, 2015 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Here are nuggets of wisdom from General Prayut Chan-o-cha, the head of the army who grabbed power last May 22, ostensibly to stop Thailand from spiraling into the darkness","body":"Yet, the bookstore owner’s narcissism does have some modicum of intelligence.

This is the media’s job. Your job isn’t just to relay facts or criticize. It isn’t!”  “You have to understand me. Whatever I did, I did with good intentions, and past events are done with. You guys just keep digging up graves and selling them. Don’t do that! It’s done and over with.” “Can’t you guys cooperate with the authorities? Do you even know how? Do you? You don’t!”  “The media was taught to say facts, criticize, and warn. The government and the PM are public figures, so you guys think that you can just yell at me? Do I have to endure everything, and speak politely all the time? Are you just gonna force me to do that?”   “I already said myself that I wasn’t elected.

When Vince McMahon spoke with Stone Cold Steve Austin on the inaugural edition of his podcast on the WWE Network, among the topics in their conversation was the handling (or lack thereof) of young talents who were busting their butts and putting their bodies on the line to get over with fans. One such talent was (Very) European superstar Cesaro, known to independent wrestling fans as Claudio Castagnoli, who regularly wows WWE crowds with nearly-inhuman feats of old-school strongman strength and springy energy from a relatively wiry frame. When Austin put McMahon on the spot as to why talents like Cesaro aren’t getting featured more prominently, all McMahon had to say about it was he needed to connect. He apparently wasn’t connecting because he was Swiss. His words, not mine. I can write a thousand columns on why I believe Vince McMahon is out of touch with his own product and his own fanbase, and while I would really, really love to right now (it’s what I do), this is not the time and place. What matters is that Cesaro has been working hard since that day to try and grab McMahon’s metaphorical “brass rings”—the trite symbolism of making it, in any industry—and this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW could be a culmination of all that effort. Cesaro came back out to answer John Cena’s United States Championship Open Challenge after getting his big chance thrown out last week, care of Kevin Owens, and he just brought it. If you needed something to keep you believing in the WWE product, this was your sign, because every now and then they’ll throw us a bone before they dangle the fruit farther away from our mouths again. This, like last week’s affair, was a match that didn’t need to wow crowds from the beginning with ridiculous, finisher-esque moves. It was just a match in which both men came in with a mission, understood the stakes, and actually fought for those stakes, in the process making everyone watching believe what they believed. Nobody gave up, nobody wanted to give up until Cena decisively and believably put Cesaro away. Oftentimes, that’s the simplest story you can tell. In pro wrestling, simple is almost always the strongest. If you’re a WWE fan, if you’re a John Cena fan, if you’re a Cesaro fan, if you consider yourself a fan of good professional wrestling at all, please go out of your way to find this match. Watch it. Bookmark it. Remember it when it’s time for the final analysis, when it’s time to sing the praises of either man. Remember it to remember that Cena is not the dud loud crowds insist he is, never in this day and age, and that Cesaro is a talent so phenomenal that today, we’re really only waiting for those who hold the gun to finally pull the trigger.

(IN PHOTOS: La Salle gets even with rivals Ateneo) Jason Perkins had 18 points to go with 10 rebounds, including the clutch jumper that paved the way for his team's victory.   \"Very well fought between the two sides, which was what was expected,\" DLSU head coach Juno Sauler said after the game.  La Salle, which also received 11, 10, and 9 points from Julian Sargent, Robert Bolick, and Prince Rivero, respectively, wins their sixth straight game to tie Ateneo and FEU atop the league standings at 6-2.  \"I'm not thinking of the standing at this point and the streak,\" Coach Sauler added.   Spearheaded by two Nico Elorde triples, Ateneo trimmed the La Salle lead to four in the third quarter, while also putting a stop to Teng's scoring in the early goings of the period.  However, Perkins started to heat up, putting up five quick markers that played a huge role as DLSU increased their edge back to seven, 56-49.  The Blue Eagles remained hot for the remainder of the period, while the Green Archers started to misfire on offense. Thanks to five straight points by Von Pessumal, the game was tied at 61. With their lead gone, DLSU slowed down on offense and managed to properly swing the ball for trips to the like and an open layup for Julian Sargent.   Entering the fourth period, La Salle was up by five, 66-61.  After the two teams exchanged baskets to open the fourth quarter, turnovers by La Salle provided easy points for Ateneo, which eventually took the lead, 72-71. With under three minutes left and DLSU ahead only by three, Ravena managed to draw a foul on Teng and made both shots.  The Green Archers countered by going to Sargent, who hit a corner 3-ball, 81-77. However, Ateneo managed to tie the game again at 81 thanks to Ravena and Ponso Gotladera's buckets. After which, Teng went to the line and converted one FT. Not long after, Perkins converted a tough fallaway J to push the lead to three, 84-81.  After Ravena missed his running layup, Perkins was sent to the charity stripe where he made one shot. Chris Newsome then took the handle coast to coast and scored, 85-83, La Salle.   After Teng pushed the lead back to four at the charity stripe, Newsome converted a tough 3-ball from the top of the key with three seconds to go. Almond Vosotros then got fouled, running the clock in the process, and made one free throw.   The Blue Eagles were then unable to get the rebound, sealing the loss.  Newsome finished with 15 points for Ateneo, while Elorde had 14.  The first quarter was controlled by Teng, who scored his first 15 points in the first 10 minutes of play.  La Salle did a good job early of limiting the Blue Eagles to just one shot on offense, not allowing their rivals to get easy second chance scoring opportunities.  A big triple by Pessumal in the second quarter was crucial as it allowed ADMU to get within single digits after DLSU threatened to run away with the game.  Perkins also made his presence felt late in the second period, putting up six straight points to keep the Green Archers ahead. However, Ravena came alive in the second quarter, where he totaled 15 markers, including making the final 3-ball before the halftime break to keep the deficit at eight, 44-36. DLSU shot 32 FTs to ADMU's 24, and outrebounded their rivals, 44-43.

It’s proof, if any were needed, of the extent to which the country’s military leaders are willing to subvert the COVID crisis to their own ends. The new charge carries a maximum three-year prison sentence. But an amendment to Myanmar’s penal code instituted by the junta on February 14 permits the army to detain people without having to go to court. Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested on February 1 along with other members of the NLD government which had been re-elected in a landslide in December. She was charged with possession of illegally imported walkie-talkies. But the decision to level this additional charge of breaching COVID restrictions is consistent with the way the military has used the pandemic to gain and cement power after the coup. This should alarm both democrats and public health officials the world over. Colleagues at the International State Crime Initiative, Neve Gordon and Penny Green, have described how some governments “exploited the COVID-19 crisis” to introduce policies such as increased surveillance and emergency security measures that “undermine democratic principles and violate the civil and political rights of both citizens and migrants”. You can hear more about the events which led up to Myanmar’s military coup in the second episode of our new podcast, The Conversation Weekly – the world explained by experts. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. A key justification for the coup presented by the military is the claim that last November’s national election was substantially unfair. The election was run amid rising COVID-19 infections throughout the country. Myanmar was extremely vulnerable to COVID-19, and was hit particularly badly – with one of south-east Asia’s highest death tolls. But in this health crisis, military supremo Min Aung Hlaing saw political opportunity. As the virus took hold and the election approached, it was clear that Aung Sun Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party was on track for another win. But Myanmar’s COVID-19 spike coincided with the start of the official campaign period, leading to restrictions on campaigning – an outcome regarded as giving an advantage to the incumbent government. Ongoing conflicts between the military and ethnic minority groups prevented the electoral commission in some parts of the country from undertaking elections – there were similar issues in 2015 and vacant seats were later filled at byelections. Aung San Suu Kyi rejected the military’s calls to postpone the election as likely to lead to a political crisis in a country where past elections have commonly been cancelled, manipulated or ignored. Weak institutional capacity, a hangover from decades of military rule, also contributed to making alternative voting methods such as mail-in balloting unfeasible for widespread use. As expected, Aung San Suu Kyi’s government was re-elected with a landslide, while the military’s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), received less than one-tenth of the available seats (constitutionally, a quarter of the parliament’s seats are reserved for the armed forces so are not contested at elections). Admittedly, the military was not alone in expressing concern about conducting a general election amid the pandemic. Some ethnic minority parties and independents were concerned too. But they largely came to terms with the way the election commission conducted the poll and accepted its outcome. The military subsequently claimed widespread electoral fraud, often framing criticisms as concern for public safety. It argued the election should not have gone ahead during the pandemic and needed to be rerun right up until undertaking the coup. Once the decision to launch the coup was taken, the military again used COVID-19 to add a sheen of constitutionality to its power grab. Myanmar’s president, Win Myint, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid and accused of breaking COVID-19 rules during the election campaign. Since the February 1 coup, the pandemic has also been a regular feature of the generals’ proclamations. COVID-19 has featured prominently in state media in the days following the coup, including in Min Aung Hlaing’s “Notification No. 1” which included a pledge that was really a veiled warning: “Prevention of the current outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic will be effectively carried out with momentum.” On the face of it, during a pandemic, this appears to be a sensible way to proceed. But in post-coup Myanmar this underlines the junta’s intention to use anti-COVID measures to empower the military in preventing public gatherings and protests. The charges against Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior NLD figures are manifestations of the same cynical approach to the virus. Using COVID-19 as a justification for the arrest of civilian leaders and to limit public demonstrations undermines trust in government measures worldwide to tackle COVID-19. It effectively reframes these measures as potentially sinister tools to increase government control, rather than as necessary public health controls. In doing so, Myanmar’s military has not only damaged the country’s progress towards democracy, but also arguably undermined global efforts to tackle the pandemic. – The Conversation|Rappler.com Ronan Lee is an Irish-Australian Visiting Scholar at  Queen Mary University of London's School of Law and the International State Crime Initiative.

The sequel also ensnared another $10.1 million from overseas markets, bringing its global total to $118.5 million. That's not a disastrous figure given how much coronavirus has upended the movie business, but it does represent a steep 67% drop domestically and is a far cry from the grosses of pre-pandemic blockbusters. Stateside, Wonder Woman 1984 has earned $28.5 million. The superhero sequel, which is currently getting some social media backlash for not rising to the level of its beloved predecessor, is being simultaneously released on HBO Max in a bid to bolster the WarnerMedia streaming service and as a concession to a global health crisis that's left the theatrical distribution landscape severely diminished. The company has issued some vague numbers touting Wonder Woman 1984's popularity on HBO Max, but little in the way of hard data.  It did announce that Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins will reunite for a third film in the franchise, a sign that it believes the Amazonian warrior is a vital part of its plans for growing its DC cinematic universe. Beyond Wonder Woman 1984, Universal and Dreamworks Animation's The Croods: A New Age pulled in $2.2 million in its sixth week of release. That pushes the animated sequel's domestic haul to $34.5 million and its global total to just under $115 million. The film is being released due to a pact between the studio and major exhibitors such as AMC and Cinemark by which the movies can get released premium video on-demand with two weeks of their theatrical debuts. In return, struggling theater chains get a cut of the digital revenues.  Universal also released News of the World, a western that reunites Tom Hanks with his Captain Philips director Paul Greengrass. The film grossed $1.7 million, pushing its domestic total to $5.4 million. Netflix bought the international rights to the movie this winter. Hanks stars as a Civil War vet who must return a young girl who was captured by natives to her remaining family. Lionsgate's Fatale, a psychological thriller with Hilary Swank and Michael Ealy, grossed $700,000 in its third weekend of release. That brings its total to $3.1 million. Focus' Promising Young Woman, which like News of the World and The Croods sequel is part of its parent studio Universal's deal with exhibitors, picked up $660,000 in its second weekend. Its domestic total now stands at $1.9 million. Promising Young Woman has scored a great deal of buzz for its provocative look at sexual violence and revenge and has earned awards chatter for star Carey Mulligan's performance. Disney and Pixar's Soul has been streaming on Disney Plus over the holidays, but it has been made available in theaters in overseas markets such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. The animated story of a middle school music teacher whose soul gets separated from his body grossed $16.5 million in its second weekend of release. That pushes its total to $32.5 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/smart-bro-lte-pocket-wifi-delivery-grabmart","title":"Get a Smart Bro LTE Pocket WiFi delivered to your doorstep via GrabMart","date":"Jun 12, 2020 2:58 PM PHT","snippet":"In just 2 hours, you can get a new pocket WiFi","body":"[Editor's Note: Smart Communications makes the internet accessible to even more people by partnering with GrabMart, ensuring that your new Smart Bro Pocket WiFi gets delivered to you in 2 hours.

Early Wednesday, March 18, Vice Mayor Romulo Peña set up a makeshift office along the hallway of the old Makati city hall building, as he insisted on performing his duties as the lawful acting mayor of the city. His position is recognized by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Ombudsman following the suspension of Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr on Monday. Binay, however, insists that he remains Makati mayor because of the appellate court's order stopping his suspension. At the new Makati city hall building, he even signed official documents and met with city councilors, who also expressed their support for him. Peña, however, believes that the law is on his side – even if Binay continues to hold office and discharges his duties. \"Siya, hawak na niya ang poder, lahat ng pisikal nandoon sa kanya. Pero ang di niya mahahawakan, eventually, magka-catch up sa kanya ang katotohanan na may rule of law,\" he said. (He holds the power, all the fiscals are with him. But what he cannot control is that, eventually, the reality of the rule of law will catch up with him.) Peña said he would abide by the decision of any higher authority, but that at the moment, he recognizes only the order of the DILG. To disregard this order would be a \"dereliction of duty,\" he added. \"It will be a dereliction of duty if I will not abide by the ruling. Kawawa naman tayo kung masasampahan tayo ng kaso dahil hindi tayo sumunod sa ruling. Hindi naman tama iyon,\" he said. (I'd be in trouble if I'm charged in court because I didn't obey the ruling. That's not right.) Peña also stressed that he was not attempting to grab power from Binay. \"Hindi ko ginusto ito. Under my designation, kapag walang mayor, ako muna ang pansamantalang hahali. Kung sakaling maayos iyon, dalawang kamay ibabalik namin sa kanila. Hindi ito parang gina-grab ko ang power,\" he said. (I didn't ask for this. My designation says, if there's not mayor, I temporarily take the position. If that issue is fixed, we will return the post to them with both our hands. It's not like I'm power grabbing.) He added that he will not stop discharging his duties as acting mayor because he has not received any directive from the DILG ordering him otherwise. On Monday morning, the DILG served the 6-month preventive suspension order issued by the Ombudsman against Binay. Peña was immediately worn in as acting mayor. About two hours later, the Court of Appeals (CA) issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) stopping the suspension.That the TRO came late, and therefore had \"nothing to restrain,\" forms the basis behind the opinion of the DILG, the Ombudsman, and the justice department that the CA order was rendered \"moot and academic.\" Flaws in interpretation Binay's legal counsel, however, argued that only the courts have the power to decide on the interpretation of the TRO.Other lawyers also pointed out that the TRO sought to stop the suspension itself, not the service of the suspension order, and that suspension is a continuing act that may be stopped even after notice had been served. Asked about this, Peña said he would rather leave the matter to his lawyers. But he said that he saw \"flaws\" in the Binay camp's defense. \"Hindi abugado, pero nakikita ko mga flaws, marami akong nakikita. Napag-aaralan na 'yan unti-unti and they're buying time,\" he said. (I'm not a lawyer, but I see a lot of flaws. They are studying them and they're buying time.) City hall transactions At the old city hall, Peña's aides have set up a wooden table and plastic chairs to serve as the acting mayor's makeshift office.  Peña admitted that because of the confusion in the interpretation of the CA resolution, some Makati residents are still hesitant to come to him in his capacity as acting mayor. He said he hopes to resolve this as soon as he gets documents and directives from the DILG bolstering his claim to the top post. \"In the event na makuha na namin ang papeles para sa akin na mapoproteskyunan ako nang maayos, ie-encourage na namin silang lumapit sa amin,\" he said. (In the event that we get the documents that will properly protect me, we'll encourage constituents to approach us.) \"Then we will impose [on the people] that they should come to us here at city hall,\" he added. Peña also called on Binay to voluntarily step down to avoid the confusion in the city. \"It's high time for Binay to step down, not because I want his position, but because it's what the law says,\" he added. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/brock-lesnar-ufc-return-schaub","title":"Brock Lesnar UFC return rumors spark Schaub challenge","date":"Jan 12, 2015 7:16 PM PHT","snippet":"'Doing fake wrestling is not the same as being in the UFC. You're playing grab ass, [and] you know if you're going to win or lose,' heavyweight Brendan Schaub warns Brock Lesnar","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Heavyweight fighter Brendan Schaub threw verbal jabs at Brock Lesnar for the circulating mumblings that he will make his much-awaited return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) this year. With his current World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract due to expire three months from now, there have been numerous speculations that the 37-year-old Lesnar might consider a homecoming to mixed martial arts (MMA). Under the UFC banner, Lesnar (5-3) had seven bouts over nearly four years, but he saw his professional fighting career interrupted by diverticulitis, a common digestive disease which involves the formation of pouches within the bowel wall. The former NCAA Division I wrestler knocked out Randy Couture to capture the heavyweight title at UFC 91 in November 2008 and successfully defended the belt twice before losing the gold-plated strap to Cain Velasquez at UFC 121 in October 2010. Lesnar had his final promotional match in December 2011, suffering a technical knockout loss to Alistair Overeem at UFC 141. After announcing his departure from the sport, Lesnar returned to professional wrestling in April 2012 and inked a lucrative limited-appearance deal with WWE, where he is now reigning as its world heavyweight champion. The rumors about Lesnar’s comeback heightened in February 2014 when UFC president Dana White indicated that the 6-foot-3 behemoth expressed his interest in competing once again. Meanwhile, close friend and on-screen manager Paul Heyman hopped onto the frenzy this past August when he disclosed that Lesnar monitors UFC fight cards regularly and believes that he could beat any opponent in the division. According to numerous reports, officials within WWE are already expecting Lesnar to make his MMA comeback as the impending free agency approaches. Although Lesnar’s return to the world’s premier MMA organization remains conjecture, Schaub stressed that he is more than ready to welcome the former champion back with open arms. “If he comes back to the UFC, I would 100 percent send him packing back to the fake wrestling,\" Schaub said in an interview on The Jason Ellis Show. The 31-year-old native of Aurora, Colorado also asserted that Lesnar’s absence would take a toll on him since he has not strutted his wares in a high-level competition while plying his trade in WWE. “Doing fake wrestling is not the same as being in the UFC. You're playing grab ass, [and] you know if you're going to win or lose. Yeah, it's hard on your body, great. He hasn't been competing and training like I have,” he stated. Schaub (10-5) has dropped four of his last six outings, including the first-round stoppage setback to Travis Browne at December’s UFC 181. Aside from Schaub, Shane Carwin voiced out his willingness to come out of retirement to square off with Lesnar in a rematch. Overeem and Frank Mir likewise issued their respective challenges to the ex-UFC heavyweight kingpin. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/gadgets/apple-iphone-12-without-charger-smart-waste-reduction-move-or-clever-cash-grab","title":"Apple's iPhone 12 comes without a charger: a smart waste-reduction move, or clever cash grab?","date":"Oct 18, 2020 5:06 PM PHT","snippet":"It's worth considering whether Apple's main incentive is simply to cut costs, or perhaps push people towards its own wireless charging devices","body":"Apple has released its new smartphone, the iPhone 12, without an accompanying charger or earbuds. Users have harshly criticized the company for this move and will have to purchase these accessories separately, if needed. While some see it as cost-cutting, or a way for Apple to profit further by forcing customers to buy the products separately, the technology giant said the goal was to reduce its carbon footprint. This is the first time a major smartphone manufacturer has released a mobile without a charger. Earlier this year, reports emerged of Samsung considering a similar move, but it has yet to follow through. But even if abandoning chargers is a way for Apple to save money, the action could have a significant, positive impact on the environment. Australians, on average, buy a new mobile phone every 18-24 months. In Australia, there are about 23 million phones sitting unused – and therefore likely a similar number of accompanying chargers. Just as single-use shopping bags contribute to plastic waste, unused and discarded electronic appliances contribute to electronic waste (e-waste). Just over a decade ago, Australia started to ban single-use plastic bags, starting with South Australia. Today, every state and territory in Australia has enforced the ban except New South Wales – which intends to do so by the end of 2021. Since South Australia implemented its ban in 2008, state government estimates suggest it has avoided 8,000 kg of marine litter each year – and abated more than 4,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits for the environment have been clear. So, why are we so hesitant to do the same for e-waste? E-waste includes different forms of discarded electric and electronic appliances that are no longer of value to their owners. This can include mobile phones, televisions, computers, chargers, keyboards, printers and earphones. Currently there are about 4.78 billion mobile phone users globally (61.2% of the world’s population). And mobile phone chargers alone generate more than 51,000 tonnes of e-waste per year. On this basis, the environment would greatly benefit if more users reused phone chargers and if tech companies encouraged a shift to standardized charging that works across different mobile phone brands. This would eventually lead to a reduction in the manufacturing of chargers and, potentially, less exploitation of natural resources. Citing an increase in e-waste and consumer frustration with multiple chargers, the European Parliament has been pushing for standardized chargers for mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers, smart cameras, wearable electronics and other small or medium-sized electronic devices. This would negate the need for users to buy different chargers for various devices. Of course, there’s no doubt phone companies want people to regularly buy new phones. Apple themselves have been accused of building a feature into phones that slows them down as they get older. Apple responded by saying this was simply to keep devices running as their batteries became worn down. But even if this is the case, Apple’s decision to ship phones without chargers would still reduce the use of precious materials. A smaller product box would let Apple fit up to 70% more products onto shipping pallets – reducing carbon emissions from shipping. However, it remains to be seen exactly how much this would assist in Apple’s environmental goals, especially if many consumers end up buying a charger separately anyway. Apple equates its recent “climate conscious” changes to the iPhone 12 with removing 450,000 cars from the road annually. The company has a target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030. It’s worth considering whether Apple’s main incentive is simply to cut costs, or perhaps push people towards its own wireless charging devices. These concerns are not without merit. Apple is one of the richest companies in the world, with most of its market capital made with hardware sales. Without a shift to a standardized plug-in charger, a wireless charging boom could be an environmental disaster (even though it’s perhaps inevitable due to its convenience). Wireless charging consumes around 47% more power than a regular cable. This may be a concern, as the sustainability advantages of not including a charger could come alongside increased energy consumption. Currently, the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) sector is responsible for about 2% of the world’s energy consumption. Perhaps one solution to the dilemma is device trade-in services, which many companies already offer, including Apple and Samsung. Apple gives customers a discount on a new device if they trade in their older model, instead of throwing it out. Similar services are offered by third parties such as Optus, Telstra, MobileMonster and Boomerang Buy Back. Ultimately, however, the best solution would be for tech giants to agree on a universal plug-in charger for all small or medium-sized electronic devices, including mobile phones. And hopefully, just as we all now take reusable bags to the grocer with us, in a few years we’ll be able to use a common charger for all our devices – and we’ll wonder what all the fuss was about. – The Conversation/Rappler.com Editor’s note: This story is a roundup of articles from The Conversation’s archives.

The ninth Democratic presidential debate, held in the ultra-fashionable Duggal Greenhouse in the Brooklyn Naval Yard boasting stunning views across to Manhattan, comes just 5 days before the key New York primary. The former secretary of state holds a 13.8-point lead over the Vermont senator in the New York polls and needs a big win in the primary next Tuesday, April 19, after losing 7 of the last 8 contests to her leftist rival. The debate got off to an acrimonious start with Sanders questioning Clinton's judgment in voting for the 2003 Iraq war, supporting trade agreements that had cost US jobs and for taking donations from big money interests. \"Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does,\" said Sanders. \"But I do question her judgment. I question her judgment going into the war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country and disastrous trade agreements.\" Clinton hit back, accusing Sanders of waging a \"phony attack.\" \"Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life, that was a first,\" she said. \"Questioning my judgment, well the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator,\" she said. The Brooklyn-born Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, needs to capitalize on his momentum to beat Clinton in her adopted home state and keep alive his dream of wresting the nomination from the Democratic frontrunner. His passionate call for a political revolution has galvanized young people and he spent Wednesday, April 13, addressing an enormous crowd in New York's Washington Square at an event his campaign said attracted as many as 27,000 people. But mathematics are in Clinton's favor. The former New York senator has won a commanding 1,790 delegates compared to 1,113 for Sanders, putting her on course to scoop the 2,383 needed to secure the party's ticket for the White House, where she last lived as first lady from 1993-2001. 'Talk about judgment' It sets the stage for a showdown at the debate, moderated by CNN and local channel NY1 in the borough where Sanders was born – before America entered World War II – and which Clinton has made her campaign headquarters. The debate got off to a heated start as 68-year-old Clinton and 74-year-old Sanders exchanged far more acrimonious blows. Clinton criticizes her opponent for not being specific on how he would implement his promise of a political revolution, usher in free college education and break up America's largest banks. \"If you go and read Senator Sanders' long interview with the Daily News, talk about judgment and the kind of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks,\" she said. She is also likely to highlight his poor record on gun control after a Connecticut judge ruled Thursday that families of the victims of a 2012 shooting at an elementary school can sue the gunmaker whose rifle was used. Sanders has been pilloried by Democrat opponents for telling the New York Daily News in an interview that he did not support the lawsuit. Clinton has welcomed the ruling and backs the families' fight against \"irresponsible gunmakers.\" Experts warn that Sanders may need to expand beyond his stump speech to score points against the seasoned debater, considered on paper one of America's most qualified candidates for the presidency in a generation. Clinton, who has been in the unfortunate position of agreeing with many of Sanders's statements, is expected to emphasize her credentials, go on the attack against Sanders and offer more incremental – but realistic reforms. A significant haul of 247 Democratic delegates are up for grabs in the New York primary, where minorities and wealthy Democrats are likely to favor Clinton, although polls suggest that Sanders has narrowed her lead. The state also attributes 44 superdelegates and the rules, which allow only registered Democrats to vote, are likely to favor Clinton. Sanders has performed best in primaries that are open to independent voters. With Republican frontrunner Donald Trump potentially facing a contested nomination and Clinton a tighter national race than she would have liked, New York may play its most decisive role in decades in a presidential election. – Jennie Matthew, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-wrap-21-mei-2015","title":"Indonesia wRap: 21 Mei 2015","date":"May 21, 2015 7:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Kini kamu bisa pesan ojek dengan aplikasi GrabBike, Panglima TNI Moeldoko bagikan 55.000 jam tangan hadiah pensiun, dan Umar Patek kibarkan Merah Putih.","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — TNI kembali tenggelamkan kapal asing, Bank Dunia tawarkan bantuan untuk Indonesia, dan apa hadiah pensiun Moeldoko untuk prajurit TNI?   Bank Dunia tawarkan $11 miliar untuk Indonesia  Terpidana kasus terorisme Umar Patek alias Hisyam bin Alizein menjadi sukarelawan sebagai pengibar bendera Merah Putih pada upacara Hari Kebangkitan Nasional (Harkitnas) di Lembaga Pemasyarakatan (Lapas) Porong, Sidoarjo, Jawa Timur, Rabu.

Nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh since Myanmar launched a brutal crackdown on insurgents 6 months ago that the US and UN have called ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that term, saying it was responding to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army in late August.  But critics accuse the military of using the insurgent attacks to launch disproportionate, scorched-earth \"clearance operations\" as a pretext to push out the loathed minority. The new Amnesty report, \"Remaking Rakhine State,\" uses satellite imagery and interviews to point to a rapid increase in military infrastructure and other construction since the start of the year that researchers say amounts to a \"land grab.\" \"The new evidence and the rebuilding that Amnesty has documented in our latest research shows that the Myanmar authorities are building over the top of the very places the Rohingya need to return to,\" Tirana Hassan, Amnesty's crisis response director, told AFP ahead of the report's release on Monday. \"In some instances there has been the destruction of existing homes.\" Though admitting the images only paint a partial picture, the rights group says structures for security forces, helipads and even roads have been built in and around torched Rohingya properties. Satellite imagery of one village called Kan Kya on the outskirts of Rakhine's Maungdaw town taken two months after the August attacks shows a settlement scarred by fire. But by early March buildings could be seen on the revamped land. Amnesty believes they are part of a new base for security forces.  Similar building activity was also detected in Inn Din village, where Myanmar has admitted that its security forces took part in the killings of 10 Rohingya residents in September.  Rakhine state has been largely sealed off from rights groups, the media and UN investigators. Myanmar and Bangladesh were supposed to start repatriating Rohingya refugees in late January but many are reluctant to return to a place without guarantees of basic rights and safety. The report also highlights concerns that abandoned Rohingya land will be set aside for ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and other non-Muslim groups in the area, and that alterations to the landscape will erase evidence of alleged atrocities by the military. Zaw Htay, a government spokesman, rejected the claims, and said the government was not basing military forces in residential areas but that police stations were part of village construction plans. \"It's not true that we are deploying the military among houses and among villages,\" he said, adding that bulldozing is necessary to work on burned land. \"As this region is behind in development, we are rebuilding systematically.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/well-armed-jihadists-raise-fears-of-new-war-in-syria","title":"Well-armed jihadists raise fears of new war in Syria","date":"Mar 2, 2013 6:32 PM PHT","snippet":"Victory in Syria's civil war is still up for grabs, but some rebel commanders fear that even if they do oust President Bashar al-Assad they will then have to take on Islamists they accuse of seeking to hijack their democratic revolution","body":"DEIR EZZOR, Syria - Victory in Syria's civil war is still up for grabs, but some rebel commanders fear that even if they do oust President Bashar al-Assad they will then have to take on Islamists they accuse of seeking to hijack their democratic revolution. Leaders of the rebel Free Syrian Army in the eastern oil hub of Deir Ezzor are in a quandary, because Islamist fighters are well financed, well armed and disciplined, and their contribution to the cause is indisputable. \"There aren't many of them, but they have financial and logistical support that we don't have, and will certainly never have,\" says one FSA commander, Abdel al-Salam Tabsah. \"They receive money from abroad and have the best arms... making them the best soldiers, and we should rely on them to be able to overthrow Assad,\" he adds. Everyone who comes to fight Assad is welcome, he declares, but quickly follows that by saying \"all the foreigners joining (Syria's jihadist) Al-Nusra Front are Islamic extremists and have an erroneous interpretation of Islam.\" Little is known about Al-Nusra Front, a group with roots in Iraq that has become a formidable fighting force in the anti-Assad war. But the International Crisis Group has said that for Al-Nusra, overthrowing Assad represents \"only half the battle; success would come only once the entire regime was replaced with an Islamic state following Salafi principles.\" The objectives of Islamists were abundantly clear on Monday, February 25, when jihadists of the Hamza unit in Deir Ezzor paraded through the streets to celebrate their upgrade to brigade from battalion. \"We will fight for Syria to be controlled by Islam,\" Abu Mohammed shouted through a loudspeaker, as a fellow fighter distributed pamphlets about jihad and martyrdom. \"What we want is that, after the fall of Assad, Syria will be an Islamic country.\" That doesn't set well with FSA commander Abu Ammar. \"The Islamic brigades operating in this and other Syrian cities have as their principal objective the creation of an Islamic state,\" he said. \"But what the FSA wants is to turn Syria into a new Turkey where moderate Islam reigns, far from the extremism of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Here we are fighting to expel one dictator, and what we are not going to permit is to have another dictator imposed on us,\" he said. Tabsah added, \"What we're afraid of is that Al-Nusra will take over the country after the fall of the Assads. I hope that they will head off to another country looking for jihad but, if not, I'm afraid we will have to fight to expel them.\" Ironically, non-Islamist rebels in Deir Ezzor might end up fighting some of their own neighbors if it comes to that. Locals are signing on with Al-Nusra because it is offering them a wage, something the FSA is unable to do. Abu Ammar said the \"jihadists from abroad come seeking martyrdom, whereas the locals (fight) for money. Many of them have families to feed, and they will join whoever pays them a wage.\" On Thursday, February 28, the United States announced it would provide direct aid to the rebel fighters in the form of food and medical assistance, but not the weapons they hoped for, as well as $60 million in funding for the political opposition. Opposition National Coalition leader Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib took a jibe at the West when he spoke of fears weapons might fall into the hands of extremists. \"A lot of people, particularly the media, pay more attention to the length of fighters' beards (an allusion to jihadists) than to the shedding of children's blood and regime bombardments,\" he said. Whether any of the aid will make a difference in Deir Ezzor is still to be seen, but one thing seems certain: FSA commanders are very much concerned by the scale of death and destruction, and they are also nervous about the beards. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/argentina-rwanda-seek-un-security-council-seats","title":"Argentina, Rwanda seek UN Security Council seats","date":"Oct 17, 2012 3:29 PM PHT","snippet":"The UN General Assembly votes Thursday, October 18, to elect five new non-permanent members to the Security Council, with Argentina and Rwanda widely expected to win seats, while three others are up for grabs","body":"UNITED NATIONS - The UN General Assembly votes Thursday, October 18, to elect five new non-permanent members to the Security Council, with Argentina and Rwanda widely expected to win seats, while three others are up for grabs. Buenos Aires and Kigali are essentially a lock to take their places on the 15-member council, as no other countries in their respective regions have declared any intention to vie for a spot on the most powerful UN body. There is, however, competition in Asia -- with South Korea leading the charge -- and the so-called Western European and Others Group, in which Australia and Finland are the frontrunners over Luxembourg. For the Asia-Pacific seat, South Korea has the clear advantage over Bhutan and Cambodia. Seoul has highlighted its participation in 19 peacekeeping operations since it joined the world body in 1991. Cambodia in contrast has not led an active campaign, diplomats said, while Bhutan has no formal diplomatic ties with any of the council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. \"It is not a very good starting point\" for the remote Himalayan nation, one diplomat said. In the other group, Australia and Finland are seen as having the edge over Luxembourg, a founding member of the European Union. Australia -- which has already sat on the council four times -- has lobbied intensely for the place. Finland has had two terms. Luxembourg, Bhutan and Cambodia have never been on the council. Nations must garner 129 votes, or two-thirds of the 193-nation General Assembly, to be elected. Surprises are rare but can happen -- in 2010, Canada was shocked when it lost out to Portugal and Germany. The five countries chosen will on January 1 begin a two-year term. They will replace Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and South Africa. The five other non-permanent members are Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Morocco, Pakistan and Togo. Their terms will be completed at the end of 2013. Only the five permanent members have veto-wielding power. Last year, Pakistan's election raised fears of a conflict on the council with its longtime rival India, but the two South Asian states served together without difficulty -- and voted together often on issues such as Syria. This time, Argentina would serve alongside Britain, but their longstanding dispute over the Falkland Islands is not expected to be a factor in the council's deliberations. If predictions are accurate, according to one diplomat, the emerging BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- will lose influence on the council, with India and South Africa leaving. Even though the permanent five will maintain their predominant influence, each new member will bring with it its allies and issues of concern. Rwanda, accused of interference in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has the support of the United States, and South Korea should play an active role in debates on North Korea. Argentina has a particular interest in Haiti, where it has sent hundreds of peacekeepers. - Andre Viollaz, Agence France-Presse"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/coleen-garcia-encounter-ex-cop-road-rage-incident","title":"Coleen Garcia details encounter with ex-cop in road rage incident","date":"May 22, 2017 1:41 PM PHT","snippet":"'He reached both his hands out and scratched my face, trying to grab me and pull me out so that he could beat me up, too!' says the actress, recounting her experience","body":"MANILA, Philippines – On social media, actress Coleen Garcia shared that she was involved in an encounter with a supposed ex-cop, who threatened her and her driver while she was heading home from work.

He also pulled out an item from his bag, which she said looked like a flashlight.  What saddened and frustrated her, she wrote, was that the police were there and saw what happened. All they did was ask her if she wanted to iron things out at the police station.  Coleen said: \"Guys, seryoso, sawa na ako sa (seriously, I'm tired of the) police station. Please lang. So I opted to drop it instead, but not after taking photos of his plate number and his ID. Watch out for this man.

And even though she has since been reunited with her son, neither she nor her husband have been allowed to physically touch him without gloves as they undergo an extended period of quarantine. \"It's hard,\" says Vanesa Muro at her home in Madrid, the worst-hit area in Spain, a country where more than 10,000 people have died from the virus, the highest number outside Italy. \"He grabs your finger, the poor little thing and holds on to the plastic, not on to you. But at least that's another day over, you have to think of it like that otherwise you get depressed,\" says the 34-year-old. She had been preparing to have the baby by caesarian section on March 16, but everything changed when her grandmother, who the couple had been seeing every day, caught the virus. She later died. On March 12, she and her husband tested positive and he rushed her to Madrid's La Paz University Hospital but he was not allowed in, \"so he left me at A&E\", she told AFP. They decided to operate the next day. 'Longest 90 minutes'  \"I felt a whole mixture of feelings, it was horrible,\" she says – fear of infecting the baby, nervous about going through it without her husband, and the bizarre sense of being operated on by surgeons completely covered in protective suits. Back home, her husband was also struggling, knowing she was in surgery but not knowing what was going on. \"It was the longest 90 minutes of my life,\" says Oscar Carrillo. In the end, baby Oliver was born safely, weighing 3.6 kilograms (7 pounds, 9 ounces). He was put straight into an incubator and kept away from all the other babies until he was tested and found to be free of the virus. Following 48 hours recovering in hospital in almost total isolation, with the staff entering the room as little as possible because of a lack of protective equipment, Muro was allowed to go home, but had to leave her baby behind. \"It seems silly but even though he was 7 floors below me, he seemed closer to me there than when I was home,\" she says. 'Memory of a nightmare'  It was only 10 days later that the couple, wearing gloves and masks, were allowed to take him home. \"Hey little champion, we're going to go home now,\" were the first words Muro said to her son during their emotional reunion. \"It was like he'd just been born that day.\" For Arantxa Fernandez, a psychologist at the hospital, it was also a very special moment, \"the most beautiful I've ever experienced in my professional life,\" she told AFP. Throughout the process, Fernandez would send the couple photos and videos of Oliver while he was still in hospital, offering the pair support that they describe as \"vital\". Although they have spent 14 days in quarantine, there are no testing kits to confirm they are free from the virus so they are still wearing gloves and masks. \"I still haven't touched my son without gloves... we are just dying for the quarantine to end so we can touch him, kiss him,\" says Carrillo as his wife gives Oliver a bottle, safety measures in place. And the new parents are not able to turn to their families for support. Even though Muro's parents live very close, Spain's lockdown means it feels like they are living miles away, Carrillo says. \"It's hard but we'll get through it,\" says Muro. \"In no time, he'll be a month old and we'll be back out on the streets. \"He will get to know his grandparents and aunts and uncles.

LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said that previous discussions with the transport network companies revealed that Uber no longer has the funds and manpower to continue operations beyond Sunday, April 8, the set date of its transition to Grab. \"We would require Uber to close down because how can we assure the riding public of their safety and their convenience if it is only in compliance with the order that their apps be up but without a support system?\" Lizada said in a voice message sent to reporters Saturday night, April 7. She made the statement after the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) released an order that temporarily stops Grab's acquisition of Uber. This means that the Uber app should still be up and running beyond Sunday, or until the PCC completes an \"in-depth review\" of the deal. \"If there is a road crash and [a passenger] would like to file their complaint, who will respond if there is no one onboard? Their apps might be up but is the back system in place? Is the full support in place?\" Lizada said. On Friday, April 6, the PCC issued the order directing Uber and Grab to continue their respective operations until it completes its review of the deal. The order also provides interim measures that seek to protect the riding public and drivers of Grab and Uber during the review process.  Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC's order, but this will not be immediately executory as they will be given a chance to explain their side.

For the first time, billiards, futsal, wrestling, and wushu will be contested as regular sporting events after having been demonstration sports for a couple of years. This means that medals won in these events will now be counted in the overall medal tally. The rest of the sporting events to be contested in the secondary division are archery, arnis, athletics, badminton, baseball, basketball, boxing, chess, football, gymnastics, sepak takraw, softball, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, and volleyball. The same events will be contested in the elementary division except for archery and boxing. This year, 3 other sports are being introduced as demonstration events – dancesports, pencak silat, and aero gymnastics. Medals won in these events will not be counted in the overall medal tally. Competition for most of the sporting events will kick off Monday, April 24, although gymnastics and football have already started their eliminations even before the opening ceremonies, which will be graced by President Rodrigo Duterte. Who will bag the most medals? The National Capital Region Athletic Association (NCRAA) is once again the favorite to run away with the overall title. But this year, they are expected to be heavily challenged by perennial 3rd placer Western Visayas Athletic Association (WVRAA) (Region VI), which is enjoying the \"homecourt\" advantage as this year's host. Last year, WVRAA placed 3rd with a medal haul of 35 golds, 35 silvers, and 39 bronze medals. They trailed overall champion NCRAA which finished with 104-57-48 and second placer Southern Tagalog Calabarzon Athletic Association (STCAA) (Region IV-A) which had a medal tally of 40-43-59.

Rookie of the Year favorite Stanley Pringle finished with 17 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists, and made a number of plays down the stretch that sealed the win for his club. Second-year star Terrence Romeo opened the second conference with 19 points - most of which coming from open jumpers off his impressive ball-handling skills - 6 assists, and 5 rebounds. \"Actually, honeymoon stage kami nang import… yung locals wala akong problema,\" GlobalPort head coach Eric Gonzales said after the game.  (Actually, we're still on our honeymoon stage with our import… when it comes to the locals, I don't have a problem.)  \"Thankful ako nag-deliver [si Leslie].\" (I'm thankful that he delivered.)  KIA import PJ Ramos didn't disappoint in his highly-anticipated debut. Doing most of his damage from the post and free throw line, the 7-foot-2 and 3/4 import recorded 41 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 blocks, and went 11-of-13 from the charity stripe.  Outside of Mark Yee, who put up 15 points on 6-of-10 shooting, Ramos didn't receive much aid from the rest of his teammates.  \"Hindi naman kaming malaking team [na may] malaking player (We're not a big team with big players). So we need to work hard in the backcourt,\" Gonzales said about his Batang Pier, who opened the game forcing turnovers from the opposition thanks to their high-pressure press defense.  Gonzales admitted the defensive tactic was inspired from the defense the Alaska Aces displayed in their seven-game finals series against the San Miguel Beermen. \"Nakakatulong siya (it helps), so why not do it?\" he said.  While Ramos lit up the scoreboard early in the game, his teammates failed to provide the necessary additional firepower. LA Revilla and Reil Cervantes went just 3-of-15 from the field in the first 12 minutes, and ended the game with a combined 15 points on 6-of-30 shooting.  The Batang Pier extended their lead up to 22 in the second quarter, and maintained their advantage at double figures until midway through the final period.  A basket by Cervantes cut KIA's deficit to nine, 90-81. A few possessions later, one of Ramos' multitude of field goals (15 overall) in the post trimmed the Batang Pier's edge down to seven, 92-85.  The bleeding stopped for GlobalPort when Stanley Pringle, who froze Ramos with a hesitation move in the paint, dished a pass to a wide open Jewel Ponferada, who subsequently threw down a dunk. Not long after, Pringle was left open on a fastbreak to seal the game for his club, 96-85.  The Carnival shot just 38% from the field while GlobalPort hit 51% of their attempts. Constant double and triple teams thrown at Ramos led to open shots from long range for KIA, but they went just 7-of-30 from downtown.   The Batang Pier scored 18 points off KIA turnovers and outscored them 21-8 in the fastbreak points.   KIA has now lost 11 straight games in their maiden PBA season. Their last win came on the opening day of the Philippine Cup on October 19 when they beat the Blackwater Elite.  GlobalPort and KIA will be back in action on Friday, January 30. The Batang Pier will aim to go 2-0 as they go up against the Purefoods Star Hotshots, while the Carnival will aim to snap their losing streak against the Meralco Bolts, who are currently taking on Barangay Ginebra San Miguel.  Scores: GLOBALPORT 100 - Leslie 33, Romeo 19, Pringle 17, Miranda 8, Semerad 6, Ponferada 5, Isip 4, Nabong 4, Pinto 2, Baclao 2, Buenafe 0, Taha 0, Caperal 0, Jensen 0, De Ocampo 0  KIA 89 - Ramos 41, Yee 15, Cervantes 8, Ighalo 8, Revilla 7, Buensuceso 6, Sanga 2, Alvarez 2, Thiele 0, Poligrates 0, Padilla 0, Pascual 0, Dehesa 0, Burtscher 0, Custodio 0 Quarter Scores: 32-22, 56-42, 79-67, 100-89  - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/football/world-cup-mexico-downs-cameroon-officials-flop","title":"World Cup: Mexico downs Cameroon as officials flop again","date":"Jun 14, 2014 5:02 AM PHT","snippet":"Oribe Peralta grabbed the only goal after 61 minutes but Mexico will consider themselves unlucky not to have been more comfortable winners after Giovani Dos Santos had two goals ruled out for dubious offside decisions","body":"SAO PAOLO, Brazil - Mexico beat Cameroon 1-0 at a rain-drenched Natal on Friday in a World Cup Group A match scarred by more refereeing blunders. Oribe Peralta grabbed the only goal after 61 minutes but Mexico will consider themselves unlucky not to have been more comfortable winners after Giovani Dos Santos had two goals ruled out for dubious offside decisions in the first half. On both occasions, it was former Tottenham striker Giovani Dos Santos who was the victim. In the 11th minute, the Villarreal player found the target with a sweet, stabbed volley from a cross by Porto's Hector Herrara but his effort was ruled out by Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan On the 30-minute mark, a Dos Santos header from a corner by Miguel Layun was also not allowed to stand. In between, Cameroon skipper Samuel Eto'o had a goal chalked off for offside although this time the referee made the right decision. The blunders came just a day after Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura controversially awarded a penalty which set Brazil on their way to a 3-1 win over Croatia. Eto'o had Cameroon's best chance of the first half after 21 minutes but narrowly went wide of the post. Early in the second period, Mexico had a golden opportunity when Peralta was clean through on goal, but he fired the ball straight at Charles Itandje in the Cameroon goal. Peralta deservedly put Mexico in front just after the hour mark. Dos Santos's shot was parried into his path and the Club Santos Laguna striker slotted in from close range. Cameroon's Benjamin Moukandjo had a chance to rescue a point in injury time but his header was well-saved by Guillermo Ochoa. Mexico next face Brazil in Fortaleza on Tuesday with Cameroon taking on Croatia the following day. - Rappler.com"}]}
