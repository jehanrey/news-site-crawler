Dengan layanan tersebut, kamu bisa “menyewa” mobil beserta pengemudinya selama lima hingga sepuluh jam untuk mengunjungi berbagai lokasi wisata di Pulau Dewata tersebut. Untuk menggunakan layanan tersebut, kamu hanya perlu menentukan titik jemput yang kamu inginkan dan memilih layanan UberTRIP. Sebagai informasi, pilihan UberTRIP tidak akan muncul apabila lokasi penjemputan yang kamu tentukan berada di luar Bali. Khusus untuk layanan UberTRIP ini, Uber menentukan tarif minimum sebesar Rp300.000 untuk perjalanan selama lima jam atau kurang. Apabila setelah lima jam pengguna masih ingin menggunakan layanan tersebut, mereka harus membayar biaya tambahan Rp1.000 per menit. Menurut pantauan Tech in Asia, harga Rp300.000 untuk perjalanan selama lima jam memang harga standar penyewaan mobil Toyota Avanza di Bali. Harga tersebut sudah termasuk ongkos sopir dan bensin, persis dengan yang dihadirkan UberTRIP. Pulau Bali sendiri dipilih sebagai lokasi pertama peluncuran UberTRIP di Indonesia karena banyaknya wisatawan yang menggunakan layanan Uber di sana dan membutuhkan layanan “sewa” mobil untuk berkeliling ke beberapa tempat sepanjang hari. (BACA JUGA: Layanan taksi online musim hujan: Yang mana lebih murah?) Menurut Uber, enam dari 10 pengguna Uber di Bali merupakan wisatawan, dan mereka berasal dari sekitar 71 negara yang berbeda.

But with the arrival of ride-hailing apps Uber and Careem, Hani now travels with ease across the vast city of 25 million – notorious for its dusty streets and polluted air. The use of the smartphone applications has taken off in Cairo, so much so that Uber says the Egyptian capital is one of its fastest growing markets. But not everyone is happy. Taxi drivers have been protesting against them for weeks as they lose more and more clients to the rival services. Many commuters have taken to social media to share their experiences. \"I took a taxi with my children, and the driver lit a cigarette. I asked him to stop, but he said there is pollution everywhere and made us get out on a bridge,\" Egyptian singer Samia Jaheen tweeted. Commuters like Hani say they are tired of conventional taxis and see the new options as a welcome change. \"I think and my friends also feel that these apps have made life easy,\" said Hani, who uses Uber or Careem at least twice a week. \"Some use Uber even to send their children to school.\" Hani's frustration with taxis is common in Cairo, where a typical ride in a traditional black or white cab tests the patience of most people. Journeys often start with the driver ruminating over whether to take the trip, and then they often suggest a price or ask \"how much will you pay.\" 'They've snatched our bread' The suggestion of turning on the meter is often a non-starter for drivers. On the other hand, many of them are rigged to make fares more expensive. After a deal is agreed, a hair-raising ride ensues as the taxi accelerates past trucks and minibuses, swerving at the last moment to avoid potholes and bumps. In summer, when temperatures soar around 40 degrees Celsius (over 100 Fahrenheit), most drivers refuse to turn on their air conditioners, and some ask for more money to do so. At the end of the ride, many drivers will say they do not have change after taking their payment. Taxi drivers are up in arms as commuters unsurprisingly flock to Uber and Careem. For weeks they have been demonstrating against the two ride-hailing services.  \"They've snatched our bread. We roam for hours without finding customers,\" said Adel, 48, who drives a taxi to supplement his earnings as a technician. The father of 3 said he spent about 6,000 euros ($6,600) just to get a taxi license. He said most cabbies avoid using meters because of low prescribed fares. \"A car that runs daily costs money... we need to increase the meter rate. It's unfair to the driver,\" an agitated Adel said. Mahmoud Lotfy, who drives his brother's taxi, said conventional cabs should be operated by companies in a similar way to ride-hailing services. \"In this way, a driver who commits a mistake can be held accountable,\" he said. Uber, which began operations 5 years ago in San Francisco and is now operating in about 60 countries, and the United Arab Emirates-based Careem are meanwhile winning new customers daily. Safety, comfort, cleanliness \"Safety, customers' comfort and cleanliness is what Uber brought,\" said Ahmed Mahmoud, an Uber driver. Mahmoud makes more than 8,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,022) per month, an earning well above the average monthly salary of 3,000 pounds ($383) for a mid-level government employee. \"Uber in Egypt offers work opportunities for over 2,000 drivers a month. More than 40% of drivers were unemployed prior to joining Uber,\" said Abdel Latif Wakid, director of operations of Uber in Egypt. Careem, which operates across 20 cities in the Middle East, has also made inroads in Egypt. But the apps have met opposition. In February, two videos published by newspapers caused a stir. The footage shows taxi drivers posing as passengers hailing Uber cars and then handing them over to traffic police on allegations their vehicles were unregistered. A senior traffic official told AFP the two companies were operating \"illegally\" as their cars were not in the category of passenger transport vehicles. Hossam Ossama, an owner of a limousine service that partners with Uber, said 70% of his fleet of about 500 cars is privately owned. Three of his cars were briefly confiscated, he said, arguing that his company was legally entitled to work since it paid taxes. \"We are in contact with the authorities to explain our mode of operation,\" he said. On Wednesday, a cabinet statement said a ministerial panel had been formed to look into the status of the two ride-hailing services. – Tony Gamal-Gabriel, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-chief-quits-trump-advisory-group-after-uproar","title":"Uber chief quits Trump advisory group after uproar","date":"Feb 3, 2017 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Outraged Uber riders and drivers form #DeleteUber movement and forces Uber boss, Travis Kalanick, to step down from Trump group","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick on Thursday, Feb 2, US time, quit US President Donald Trump's business advisory group as a movement grew to dump the ride-sharing service because of the collaboration. \"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda, but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees, a copy of which was obtained by AFP. Kalanick said in the email that he spoke briefly with Trump about the president's recent executive order restricting immigration, and to tell him he would not be able to participate on his economic council. The group was established last year and includes Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk. \"There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\" Kalanick said in the message to Uber workers. \"Immigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country's success and quite honestly to Uber's.\" Outraged Uber riders and drivers have raged against Kalanick and the service for what they saw as him teaming with Trump, whose orders and appointments have triggered protests here and abroad. A #DeleteUber campaign picking up speed on social media urged people to dump the service and switch to rival Lyft, which saw its popularity soar.

Transport inspectors \"raided Uber's offices in Amsterdam and confiscated documents,\" the Dutch public prosecutor's office said in a statement. \"Uber uses the UberPOP app to book taxi rides with drivers who do not have a permit to operate as a taxi,\" it said, adding \"it is illegal to offer a taxi service without a permit.\"  Prosecutors in April announced they had opened a criminal probe into Uber after Dutch judges in December banned UberPOP from taking bookings via its smartphone app. So far Uber has been hit by 450,000 euros ($506,000) in fines for running UberPOP, Tuesday's statement said. \"It is believed that UberPOP continues to operate,\" and that it is therefore breaking the law, it added. Uber uses mobile phone apps to put customers in touch with drivers who then take them where they want to go at prices lower than those of traditional taxis. But despite its massive popularity, Uber is facing increasing limits on its activities and a barrage of legal challenges spurred on by a furious taxi lobby, who say Uber drivers should be regulated the same way as normal cabs. Uber said it would \"continue cooperating with the Dutch authorities in the investigation into UberPOP,\" Dutch news agency ANP said. Uber added that the Dutch cabinet and parliament were currently working on a legal revision on the law that bans UberPOP from Dutch roads. \"We are looking at further modernising the current legislation that will lead to more jobs and give consumers a choice,\" Uber said. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-flying-car-prototype-photos-uber-elevate-2018","title":"Uber's 'flying taxi' prototypes shown off at Uber Elevate","date":"May 9, 2018 11:43 AM PHT","snippet":"Commercialization of the flying taxis may begin around 2023, and can be summoned on-demand just like a ridesharing car","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – It's not a bird, nor a plane. But Uber's new prototype vehicle, known as the eCRM-003, unveiled Tuesday shows off its vision of the future of transportation – a \"flying taxi\" that aims to alleviate urban congestion. A model of Uber's electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle concept (eVTOL) – a cross between a helicopter and a drone – was displayed at the second annual Uber Elevate Summit in Los Angeles. \"Our goal is to radically improve global mobility,\" said Uber Aviation product chief Nikhil Goel. Goel said the all-electric flyer can achieve speeds over 300 kilometers (200 miles) an hour with a range of 100 kilometers (60 miles) on a battery charge. \"We fly a lot so we can prove to the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and the public that these aircraft are safe,\" he said. Uber has become a global force in transportation with its ridesharing service, but is also working on autonomous vehicles and other forms of transport. Uber plans the first demonstration flights for Los Angeles in 2020 and commercialization of the flying taxis in 2023, saying these could be ordered on demand just like a ridesharing vehicle. Eric Allison, who heads Uber's Aviation programs, said the flying vehicles are part of an overall strategy allowing people to do without personal cars. \"The rational choice for transportation will be less and less to own and drive a car,\" Allison said. \"We want to price it so low, it'll be irrational to drive your car.\" Here are 3 other concept vehicles seen at the event:  The first flying taxis will be designed with a pilot, according to Allision, but over time can be developed as autonomous vehicles. At the conference at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles, Uber showed films and models of a futuristic city with such vehicles, seemingly inspired by the film Blade Runner. The concept includes \"skyports\" that would serve as hubs for the aerotaxis. Several other companies along with Uber are trying to develop similar kinds of aerial devices.  Uber operations director Jeff Holen says the obstacles to  the new transport mode are mostly around regulations of air space, adding, \"The technology exists... we can solve this today.\" – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/uberpool-how-to-traffic-metro-manila-uber-philippines","title":"UberPOOL in PH: How Uber's carpool feature works","date":"Jun 10, 2016 9:41 AM PHT","snippet":"UberPOOL will be available in the Philippines June 15. Here's how it works","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Manila's traffic situation has commuters frustrated and often spending hours on the road daily. Could options from popular ride-sharing apps like Uber offer a solution?  On June 15, Uber is uberPOOL – a ride sharing feature that they've launched in other countries and they say has been proven to cut down on the number of cars on the road. During a press conference on Wednesday, June 8, Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua and Uber policy research analyst Amy Smith told the media about the company's upcoming service. If you'll be using the feature, here are some things you should know about uberPOOL. What it is: You'll be able to share your ride and fare with one to 3 other people who are headed in the same direction. Riders who choose to use the feature should expect to either pick someone up on the way to their destination or for someone to be in the car that picks them up. Uber will calculate a route so that the person you pick up is nearby and the detour won't take more than a few minutes, but riders who use the service should still expect the drive to take a bit longer than usual. Like the other options, uberPOOL will show up as an option on the app. Users must enter their destination before requesting a ride, because the price of the ride is given upfront. You can also choose to share your ride with only one to two people or up to 4 people. Pricing Uber says that uberPOOL costs 25% less than a regular uberX, making that the cheapest feature they offer. As soon as you enter your destination and choose how many people you want to share a ride with, the fare will be calculated. Fares per trip are set at 25% less than uberX rides because the cost is split between riders. It's possible for a driver to pick up a passenger using uberPOOL, pick another one up in the middle of the drive, drop off the first passenger, then pick someone else up, and so on.  Uber has another ride sharing feature called uberHOP, where riders can request a ride, walk to a designated pick-up point, and share the ride with 5 other people. uberHOP is different because it's limited – it's only available at certain times in Makati, Bonifacio Global City, and the Ortigas area. uberHOP also takes in up to 6 passengers, compared to uberPOOL's maximum of 4. Both features will be available when uberPOOL launches 6 am on June 15 in Manila, though pool won't be available in Cebu yet. Other commute options in Manila At the conference, Laurence was asked about the difference between uberPOOL and the UV Express, popularly known as the \"FX,\" a public transport service that uses Tamaraw FX cars that can seat at least 5 passengers. In response, he said that the difference is in the waiting time: \"You don't have to wait in a particular stop. There is no planning ahead, it just happens... It doesn't require people to change their behavior. If you're used to getting a door-to-door experience from the office to your house or from the mall to your office, then it's gonna be the same thing.\" Uber's taxi app competitor in the Philippines, Grab, hasn't launched their carpool feature, GrabHitch, in the country yet. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority launched a carpooling app in May called \"Friend Trip,\" which helps Facebook friends heading to the same area share a car.

Pemerintah memutuskan untuk mengizinkan keduanya tetap beroperasi, dengan syarat memenuhi beberapa izin. “Kami beri masa transisi dua bulan,” kata Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan di Jakarta pada Kamis, 24 Maret. Selama itu, Uber dan Grab diminta untuk memenuhi tiga syarat yakni: Semuanya, menurut mantan direktur PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) ini, sesuai dengan Undang-Undang No. 22 tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. Dengan demikian, operasi Grab dan Uber akan sesuai dengan hukum di Indonesia. Dilarang ekspansi mitra bisnis Selama masa transisi yang berakhir pada 31 Mei 2016 mendatang, kedua perusahaan asing ini dilarang menambah rekanan bisnis. “Dilarang menambah mitra pengemudi dari badan layanan transportasi, atau pun perorangan, yang tidak sah,” kata Jonan. Menteri Komunikasi dan Telekomunikasi Rudiantara mengatakan akan ada sanksi bagi mereka yang bandel, ataupun belum memenuhi syarat pada 1 Juni mendatang. Sedangkan Kementerian Koordinator Politik, Hukum, dan Keamanan akan mengawasi, dan memberitahu perusahaan mana yang masih membandel. “Kalau dibilang tutup, nanti saya tutup,” kata Rudiantara. Komisaris Uber Technology Indonesia Donny Sutadi menyatakan keputusan ini cukup adil. “Kami akan menyanggupi semuanya tepat waktu,” kata Donny. Selama masa transisi ini, Uber dan Grab tetap dibolehkan untuk melanjutkan kegiatan bisnis mereka. Demikian pula GrabBike dan Go-Jek. Jamin kelancaran pengurusan izin Sementara itu, Menkopolhukam Luhut Pandjaitan menjamin keamanan dan kelancaran perusahaan ini selama mengurus izin. “Kalau ada ketakutan nanti prosesnya diperlambat sana-sini, kami sepakat akan mengamati dengan cermat,” kata Luhut. Selain itu, pihak Uber dan Grab yang menemui kesulitan dapat menyampaikan keluhan langsung pada Kemenhub ataupun Kemenkominfo. Luhut menegaskan, masalah ini sudah selesai, dan tak perlu campur tangan Presiden Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo. “Presiden cukup memberikan arahan, selesai secara berkeadilan. Kami (menteri) tahu apa yang harus kami lakukan,” kata dia. Pemerintah tak urus tarif Terkait tarif, Jonan menegaskan tak akan ikut campur. Menurut dia, Uber dan Grab yang berada dalam kelompok kendaraan sewa, tak diatur tarifnya oleh pemerintah. “Ya kalau lebih murah, taksi bisa memperbaiki diri,” kata dia. Sedangkan, kata Jonan, masalah bisnis merupakan wewenang Organisasi Angkutan Darat (Organda). Selain itu, ujarnya, ada saja taksi mahal yang tetap diminati oleh penumpang. “Keduanya ada di lahan berbeda. Taksi berplat kuning ada izin trayek dan lain-lain. Mobil rental tidak. Ini jalan saja,” kata Jonan.

A court ordered Uber to stop its UberPOP service, which allows non-professional drivers to register with Uber via a mobile phone and offer trips in their own cars at half the price of a regular cab. \"Drivers who transport people for payment without a license are breaking the law,\" said the decision from the Hague-based Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal. Uber could be fined up to 100,000 euros, and drivers could face fines of 10,000 euros for continuing to work, up to a maximum of 40,000 euros. A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it \"will continue to offer UberPOP.\" Monday's decision \"is simply the first step in a long-running judicial battle,\" the San Francisco-based company added. UberPOP is one of several services offered by the online taxi startup, which appealed a Dutch government decision in September to have it banned. Uber said that it was merely offering a \"car-sharing service.\" But the judges sided with government on Monday, pointing out that Uber receives a 20% commission for each trip. Uber launched UberPOP as a pilot project in Amsterdam between July and September. In late November, Uber extended the service to The Hague and Rotterdam. Several drivers were arrested in Amsterdam in October and fined 1,500 euros. Drivers were also arrested on the first day of operations in Rotterdam. Uber has expanded at breakneck speed since it launched in 2009 and is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries. But its rapid growth has caused tensions, especially in Europe where rival taxi companies have protested that Uber cars are not subject to the same regulations. A tribunal in Paris, France, will decide on Friday, December 12, whether Uber's services constitute unfair competition to traditional taxi drivers.

The LTFRB, however, immediately clarified that the suspension stands despite the pending appeal. Uber's motion was eventually junked within the same day. In an interview after rejecting the appeal, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told Rappler that they would rule on Uber's defiance in a separate hearing. For now, the transport groups hope that the case will bring equal treatment, saying that taxis, buses, jeepneys, and vans are apprehended without tolerance. Before this legal offensive, other transport groups flagged the LTFRB's supposed \"special treatment\" for TNCs as the board allowed some 120,000 drivers to ply the roads even though most of them do not have adequate papers.

An Uber motorbike which collects passengers from their office or home could prove popular with commuters.  But UberMOTO will be up against both Singapore-based Grab, which began offering a Bangkok motorbike service alongside its cabs last year, and the tens of thousands of regular motorbike taxi drivers who jealously guard their patches. \"I'm really excited to say Thailand is the first country to launch a two-wheeled motorcycle product in all of our cities,\" Douglas Ma, Uber's head of Asia expansion, told reporters.

Both Uber and Grab Taxi have shaken up the taxi industry in Bangkok, providing an alternative to the capital's often mercurial cabbies who routinely decline fares or refuse to use their meters. The company will initially roll out the bikes in 3 commercial districts and said the fares should be cheaper than regular motorbike taxis. Uber will focus on Thailand but does not rule out launching similar services in other traffic-clogged Asian megacities like Jakarta and Manila. \"This is the first time we're doing it in any market in the world, so our hope is to develop it and innovate it,\" Ma told AFP.  \"If it makes sense, absolutely we want to look at other markets.\" Ma declined to say how many motorbike drivers the company had already signed up but said it was in the thousands.

Like in other global transactions that the PCC has handled, the commission said it will look into the operations of Grab and Uber in the Philippines as basis for the thresholds. \"If the transaction is notifiable, Grab and Uber are not allowed to consummate the deal without PCC approval,\" the commission said. \"If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns.\" Should anti-competitive concerns arise, the PCC said Grab and Uber may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or prevent negative effects on market competition. The PCC may launch a motu proprio review or open a case that may disentangle or block the deal, should Uber and Grab decline to submit transaction details. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/uber-survives-ltfrb-hearing-more-time-defend-accreditation","title":"Uber survives LTFRB hearing, gets more time to defend accreditation","date":"Aug 2, 2017 5:38 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber is off the hook for now","body":"MANILA, Philippines – In a show cause hearing on Wednesday, August 2, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) gave the transport network company (TNC) 5 more days to explain why they should retain their accreditation. This comes after Uber allegedly defied the agency's July 26 order which states: \"No further acceptance of additional accreditation of TNVS [Transport Network Vehicle Service providers] and/or activation of their accounts into the respondents' respective systems shall be allowed effective immediately.\" In their defense, Uber representative Joseph Castillo said they interpreted the order as still allowing them to accept new drivers without accrediting them. (READ: LTFRB orders Grab, Uber to deactivate drivers registered after June 30) Pointing to their order, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said that accepting new drivers was also forbidden by the order. \"The language of the order is very clear. We need to put a stop to the false expectations [of] the public that they can still get themselves accredited, and worse, get their account activated so they can run on the road as [TNVS],\" Delgra said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada added that even accreditation can be done as they used the Uber website themselves to troubleshoot accreditation. Lizada said they were able to activate 3 accounts from July 31 to August 1. Uber asked if the LTFRB was able to book a ride through the dummy accounts, to which Lizada said they did not try. Lizada added it was enough evidence that it was indicated in the application that their accounts were \"activated\". \"What I find difficult to comprehend is that they can add vehicles into their accounts inside the confines of their room...I wonder how many operators are now putting vehicles in their respective accounts because this can be another way of vehicles circumventing [the LTFRB orders],\" Lizada said. When asked by the LTFRB for their side, Castillo declined to comment, requesting to be briefed further about the dummy accounts first. Castillo said they have yet to check their system to determine how many applicants they have accepted since July 26. The hearing comes while the LTFRB is engaged in talks with Uber and other transport network giant Grab in regulating ride-hailing services. Delgra urged Uber to be \"patient\" until a resolution is reached. \"On good faith, we created the technical working group to get equilibrium for supply and demand…we hope that Uber will be patient enough to wait, [to] be compliant.

Dengan layanan yang mirip dengan Go-Food dan GrabFood ini, kamu bisa meminta seorang pengemudi Uber untuk membelikan makanan dengan ongkos kirim S$3 (sekitar Rp 30 ribu). Saat ini, telah ada lebih dari 100 restoran di Singapura yang bergabung dengan layanan tersebut. Meski harus menggunakan armada mobil untuk mengantar makanan, UberEats mengklaim kalau mereka bisa menyelesaikan setiap pesanan dalam waktu kurang dari 35 menit. Dengan kehadiran UberEats di Singapura, rasanya tidak mustahil kalau Uber pun akan menghadirkan layanan yang sama di Tanah Air. Seperti memberi isyarat akan hal tersebut, minggu ini Uber menghadirkan promo pengantaran makanan di Denpasar dan Surabaya dengan nama uberMARTABAK dan uberRAWON. Masih terbatas di restoran tertentu  Bagi para pengguna Uber di Denpasar, kamu bisa memesan martabak dari Djambow Martabak pada 30 Mei hingga 2 Juni 2016, antara pukul 18:00 dan 21:00 WITA. Pemesanan bisa dilakukan dengan menekan pilihan uberMARTABAK yang ada di bagian kanan bawah aplikasi Uber. Setelah itu, kamu hanya perlu memasukkan lokasi tujuan pengiriman pada bagian “Pick Up Location”. Apabila beruntung, pengemudi Uber akan mengantarkan martabak langsung ke lokasi kamu. Hal yang sama juga bisa dilakukan oleh para pengguna Uber di Surabaya pada 31 Mei 2016, pukul 09:00 hingga 13:00 WIB. Bedanya, untuk di Kota Pahlawan tersebut, kamu akan menemukan pilihan NguberRAWON. Uber nantinya akan mengantarkan rawon dari Wok’n’Tok Restaurant pada para pemesan yang beruntung. Terus berupaya gaet pengguna baru  Selain menghadirkan uberMARTABAK dan uberRAWON, Uber pun memberikan perjalanan gratis bagi para pengguna baru mereka di Denpasar, Surabaya, dan Bandung. Para pengguna Uber di Denpasar bisa menggunakan kode promosi UBERDJAMBOW untuk mendapat perjalanan gratis senilai Rp 75.000. Sedangkan untuk kamu yang berada di Surabaya, kamu bisa memasukkan kode promosi SURABAYA723 untuk menikmati perjalanan gratis menggunakan Uber senilai Rp 50.000. Bagi para pengguna Uber di Bandung, kamu bisa memanfaatkan perjalanan gratis senilai Rp 111.000 dengan kode promo UBERBDG1TAHUN. Selain itu, Uber pun menyelenggarakan kompetisi “Jelajahi Bandung bersama Uber” yang akan berlangsung mulai 1 hingga 7 Juni 2016 di Kota Kembang tersebut.  Apabila promo uberMARTABAK dan uberRAWON ini berjalan sukses, sepertinya Uber punya alasan yang kuat untuk menghadirkan promo serupa, atau bahkan langsung meluncurkan layanan UberEats di ibu kota. Adanya layanan uberMOTOR juga menjadi nilai plus untuk mengantar makanan di Jakarta, sehingga proses pengantaran jadi lebih cepat. Hal ini tentunya akan semakin memperketat persaingan dengan Go-Food dan GrabFood yang sudah hadir terlebih dahulu. —Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-ipo-may-2019","title":"Uber steers toward blockbuster IPO as road looks rocky","date":"Apr 11, 2019 12:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber's IPO could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber could become a $100 billion company with a massive share offering that will be a bellwether for tech startups looking toward Wall Street. Media reports said the ride-hailing giant is seeking to raise some $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year. That could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal said details of Uber's initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May. The IPO comes after a lackluster response to last month's market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber. Lyft shares rose on the first day of trade and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were down more than 10% from the $72 offering price. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said Uber recently provided documents showing a potential price range of between $48 and $55 a share, implying a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report. \"Even a valuation in the $90 billion to $100 billion range would represent a healthy premium to the latest private valuation (some $76 billion) in August 2018,\" said Matt Kennedy of the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. \"Uber will definitely be pegged to Lyft. So they can't be too aggressive on valuation, given where Lyft is trading. Though it's possible that some of the pressure on Lyft is related to investors looking to pick up Uber instead.\" Analysts warn both Uber and Lyft will need strong growth to justify their lofty valuations, and face multiple challenges to their business model which has disrupted traditional taxi services and relies on drivers to be independent contractors. The ride-hailing firms are also investing in other \"last mile\" transport options such as electric bikes and scooters, and in the long run are looking to autonomous vehicles as a way to reduce dependence on private cars and reshape urban landscapes. Unicorn stampede Uber is the latest, and will be largest of the so-called \"unicorns,\" or venture-backed startups worth at least $1 billion, to look to Wall Street listings to expand their capital base. But some of the early enthusiasm about this unicorn herd has waned and there are hints that private investment rounds may have been priced too high. Pinterest, a virtual bulletin board that connects people with interests including food, fashion, travel and lifestyle, plans to trade under the symbol PINS on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinterest unveiled its IPO price range with an estimated valuation of some $11 billion, below the $12 billion in its most recent private funding round. Other big tech firms which could join the stampede include the business collaboration startup Slack and big data firm Palantir. (READ: After Lyft, here are 6 other tech companies planning for an IPO) Aswath Damodaran, a New York University business professor specializing in corporate valuations, calculated Lyft to be worth around $16 billion, below its the more than $20 billion at its IPO price. Uber released financial data earlier this year showing it lost $865 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The San Francisco-based firm reported revenue of $3 billion, a 25% increase from a year earlier.

Here's what you should know about him","body":"(UPDATED) Expedia chief Dara Khosrowshahi is credited with turning the company into a global travel services behemoth, winning admiration from employees on the journey. Uber is hoping he will now slip into the driver's seat at the controversy-battered ride-sharing service and steer it along a similarly glorious route. (READ: TIMELINE: Uber's woes leading up to Travis Kalanick's resignation) Uber said it has officially hired Khosrowshahi late Tuesday, August 29, and that the executive will be at Uber's headquarters in San Francisco for an 'all-hands' gathering to meet workers at the controversy-battered company.   Earlier, Expedia board chairman Barry Diller appeared to confirm the choice in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. \"As you probably know by now, Dara Khosrowshahi has been asked to lead Uber,\" read a copy of a memo from Expedia board chairman Barry Diller to Expedia employees included in an SEC filing. Khosrowshahi is known as an experienced top executive, willing to speak his mind and to advocate for women getting equal pay and leadership opportunities. His most recent Twitter post, seen below, criticizes US President Donald Trump for his response to a white supremacist rally that turned deadly in Charlottesville. I keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly. https://t.co/WlxTkRfC71 — dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) August 16, 2017 \"I keep waiting for the moment when our Prez will rise to the expectations of his office and he fails, repeatedly,\" Khosrowshahi said in the tweet, which included a link to a story about the Trump controversy. Born in Iran, Khosrowshahi immigrated to the United States with his family as a child and became a citizen here. Expedia shares have climbed more than five-fold during the 12 years Khosrowshahi has been in charge of the travel services internet firm. \"I don't doubt his skills and his background in finance and hospitality, which is going to be very important,\" said Tim Bajarin, president of Silicon Valley technology analyst firm Creative Strategies. \"The only thing we don't know is his ability to navigate some of the difficult settings around internal disciplinary issues and code of conduct that he will inherit.\" Need for discipline  Khosrowshahi will have to address conflicts with regulators and taxi operators, a cut-throat company culture, sexism and board members feuding with investors over Kalanick.  Kalanick was the driving force behind Uber, taking a spur-of-moment idea and turning it into the world's most valuable venture-funded tech startup. But his brash personality and freewheeling management style, which some argue set a tone inside the company, made him a liability as well as an asset to the global ridesharing giant, and in June he stepped down as chief executive. Good chief executives typically ramp up discipline and accountability in employee ranks upon taking charge at companies, so that would likely be among steps taken by Khosrowshahi at the Uber helm, according to Bajarin. \"He is going to have to be highly aggressive in disciplining the company to stay on message and, more importantly, to stick within whatever the codes of conduct are,\" the analyst said. Khosrowshahi has consistently scored well at website Glass Door, where executives and companies are anonymously rated by employees past and present, suggesting he might able to parent workers without alienating them. And, since Uber's board members including Kalanick need a consensus to offer him the job as chief, he could have backing if he butts heads with those resentful the founder was pressured to step down. Is it enough? Khosroshahi's strong background in travel and transportation should be a benefit when it comes to guiding Uber through its next phase of growth, according to Bajarin. Khosrowshahi's experience includes jobs managing finance and strategy, having worked in executive positions at IAC/InterActiveCorp and the investment firm of Allen & Company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Khosrowshahi, 48, was born in Tehran to a prominent family behind a conglomerate with interests in food, trade, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and more.  His family immigrated to the United States prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1978. He attended college here, earning a university degree in electrical engineering. Expedia is based in the city of Bellevue, near Seattle. \"If Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing – he's devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure, it will be with my best wishes,\" Diller said in a letter included with a filing notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that Khosrowshahi had been offered the job as chief of Uber.

We appreciate your patience during this transition timeframe if there may be any service disruptions,\" the ride-hailing firm added later on its website. In the immediate term, Grab noted that \"nothing will change and operations will continue as normal.\" Current Uber users' account information, however, will not be shared with Grab. \"If you are new to Grab, we will still need you to register your account with us to start riding,\" Grab said. The firm added that fares would remain the same, with a dynamic surcharge applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. As for firms that use Uber as company transportation, Grab said: \"Uber for Business services for employees of local and global companies will not be supported for trips taken in Southeast Asia after the transition. Uber rides outside of Southeast Asia will still be supported through existing Uber for Business agreements.\" Grab had announced on Monday that it is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies.

The Philippine government has since suspended the processing of TNVS applications twice, after issues on the scope of regulation as well as complaints from taxi operators who argued there was \"unequal application\" of rules.

Terms of the investment give what was already one of the largest venture-funded startups a valuation, or implied value, of $62.5 billion, according to the company. The deal comes as Saudi Arabia strives to diversify its economy away from reliance on oil production to include more entrepreneurship, open markets, and productivity. The new funding also helps Uber's global expansion, including in the Middle East and North Africa, which the company sees as among its fastest-growing regions. In addition to the investment, which will boost Uber's cash holdings to more than $11 billion, the head of the Saudi fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, is joining the Uber board. \"We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,\" Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a statement. \"Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.\" Rumayyan said in a statement that the fund \"is excited to have completed this important strategic investment with Uber, an extraordinary company with an inspiring mission.\" He added that the plan fits with the kingdom's Vision 2030, the blueprint for diversifying its economy away from oil. According to Uber, the company is committed to investing $250 million in the region, which includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Qatar, and Morocco. In Saudi Arabia, around 80% of Uber's riders are women, the company said, explaining that the service can help improve mobility for women, who cannot drive in the country and typically avoid public taxis. Egypt tightens reins Egypt in March said it will regulate ride-hailing services Uber and Careem after they sparked protests by taxi drivers in Cairo over allegations the smartphone apps bypass regulations. Cab drivers contend that not only are they losing clients to Uber and Careem, but the two services use vehicles that are unregistered for ferrying commuters. Egypt's Cabinet said the authorities would take steps to regulate the two ride-hailing services. Uber and Careem drivers would \"have to pay taxes\" and their apps would need to establish a \"suitable framework for traditional taxi drivers to join them,\" the Cabinet maintained. San Francisco-based Uber has expanded to hundreds of cities worldwide, despite complaints from established taxi operators and regulators. Eyes on oil Saudi Arabia's push to diversify away from oil comes amid a significant global oversupply. OPEC, which pumps about a 3rd of the world's crude, has contributed to the chronic problem, led by kingpin Saudi Arabia. Some OPEC ministers expressed hope that the oil market would improve in the second half of the year after prices took a beating from abundant supplies as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prepared to open its biannual meeting Thursday, June 2, in Vienna.

Just a day after announcing that they will be \"recruiting and activating drivers\" to \"provide service in the gap left by Uber's abrupt withdrawal,\" the service is already trading jabs with the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Arcade City says in an online press release: \"We forgive the LTFRB for ordering Arcade City to 'cease operations' before they understood what Arcade City is and is not, specifically how Arcade City is different from Uber.\" On August 16, the LTFRB issued a cessation order, where it said that it considers Arcade City as another transport network company (TNC) and told them to stop bookings on the platform.     Arcade City contends that it \"does not provide 'pre-arranged transportation services for compensation' and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company.\" LTFRB's memorandum on TNCs defines the term as an \"organization whether a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an internet-based technology application or digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.\"  Arcade City explains further that while drivers may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, \"Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers.\" Arcade City calls the system a new \"peer-to-peer model of ridesharing\" – both riders and passengers find one another on the app, but Arcade City doesn't set the rates like Uber or Grab does. Instead, according to their press release, \"drivers are free to set their own rates.\" Essentially, Arcade City is an open market, where buyers (riders) and vendors (drivers) strike deals.  How does it make its money? Arcade City takes 10% of the rides paid through the app according to a May 2016 article by U.S. website Vice. It also described Arcade City as the \"black market Uber that runs on Facebook.\" For a time, Arcade City connected riders and drivers via the Facebook group \"Arcade City Austin/Request A Ride\" before it relaunched its app. The Facebook group is still online, where Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David (pictured below) is one of 3 administrators.  \"Let's play,\" David says in his re-posting of Arcade City's statement to the LTFRB: David is a former Uber driver in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, who has been vocal against his distaste for corporate authority.  In an interview with cyrptocurrency site Coin Telegraph, David said that while government regulation is definitely an issue for drivers, an even bigger issue has been \"drivers being mistreated by the distant corporate HQ.\"  \"Uber and Lyft are run by nerds in San Francisco. To them, drivers are just numbers. The fares that determine drivers' livelihood are just levers to push and pull to maximize profit. The driver uproar and mass protests following last week’s rate decrease tells me this is the perfect time to launch a decentralized alternative,\" said David, making references to Uber fare decreases in 2016 and his decentralized alternative Arcade City.  Mirroring the current situation in the Philippines, Arcade City emerged in Austin, Texas after Uber and Lyft withdrew. The two ride-sharing companies exited in May 2016 after disagreements on regulations, but finally returned in June 2017. During their hiatus, Arcade City built up their ridesharing network that they say now has 43,000 members. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/investors-load-funds-uber-freight-october-2-2020","title":"Investors load $500 million into Uber's trucking business","date":"Oct 3, 2020 7:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber says it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation","body":"Uber on Friday, October 2, said an investment group led by Greenbriar Equity is pumping $500 million into its trucking unit.

Uber Freight matches truckers to shippers in much the way the ride service connects passengers with drivers in the so-called on-demand economy. While Uber's ride service has suffered due to people hunkering down or being reluctant to get into cars with strangers due to COVID-19 risk, the freight unit, which launched in 2017, has grown. \"We have led the industry with technology, transforming dated and analog processes to ensure that both shippers and carriers are equipped to succeed in a rapidly changing industry,” said Uber Freight chief Lior Ron. Uber said it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation. \"We are excited to support Uber Freight in the next stage of its development,\" said Greenbriar managing partner Michael Weiss. \"We believe that carriers and shippers will be increasingly attracted to the convenience and simplicity that Uber Freight offers in a complex marketplace.\" Greenbriar has been involved in the logistics sector for decades and brings expertise that Uber Freight can tap into, Weiss added.

The company says it has 500,000 users","body":"PARIS, France – After a spate of violent protests and the arrest of two bosses, Uber finally suspended its controversial low-cost UberPOP private driver service in France on Friday, July 3, six months after it was banned. \"Uber has decided to immediately suspend UberPOP in France,\" the US company said in a statement, adding that it was waiting to see the outcome of a legal appeal against the ban, due by September. UberPOP puts customers in touch with private drivers at budget prices. The company says it has 500,000 users.  The service has angered taxi drivers who say it represents unfair competition because the UberPOP drivers do not face the same regulations and pricing restrictions as professionals. A nationwide taxi strike turned violent last week, with cars set alight and reports of UberPOP passengers being attacked.  The decision to suspend the service \"follows the acts of violence of the past two weeks,\" said Uber in the statement. UberPOP was made illegal in January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and the service continued to operate.  Uber has filed two complaints with the European Commission against the law, which it is also challenging in France's Constitutional Court. Two bosses of Uber France -- director general Thibaud Simphal and western Europe director Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty -- were arrested this week and will go on trial on September 30. They have been charged with \"misleading commercial practices, complicity in the illegal exercise of the taxi profession and illegal use of private data,\" the Paris prosecutor said. That followed a major nationwide strike by 3,000 taxi drivers the week before that brought road traffic to a standstill and caused chaos at airports and train stations.  The protests gained added publicity when rock star Courtney Love tweeted her frustration from one of the traffic jams, saying protesters were whacking vehicles with metal bats and \"ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage.\" \"I'm safer in Baghdad,\" she wrote. Uber said it would consider getting official private hire licences for its UberPOP drivers -- requiring them to have 250 hours of training and follow strict rules on the age and size of their vehicles. \"UberPOP was a significant source of revenue for more than 10,000 people,\" said the company in its statement.  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls welcomed the suspension saying it \"showed that the firm position of the government had paid off\".  \"We have always said that we are not against Uber... but there must also be rules,\" said Valls. There was a more guarded response from taxi unions. \"The announcement is satisfactory. However, we remain vigilant and very suspicious,\" said Severine Bourlier, secretary general of the National Union of Taxis.  \"Uber is accustomed to this kind of manouevre and they are capable of creating similar applications under another name.\" – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/uber-not-perfect","title":"Uber is not perfect, and we should not be afraid to point that out","date":"Aug 16, 2017 5:41 PM PHT","snippet":"If we continue to push for 'solutions' that only benefit a fraction of the public, then we continue to be part of the problem","body":"Of course people are mad. After several years of dependency on Uber and Grab as an alternative to our decrepit public transport system, recent events have rendered Metro Manila’s middle class commuters stranded – literally and figuratively. Uber has been suspended by the LTFRB for defying an order to stop accrediting more drivers, leading patrons to take part in the newfound – and very pricey – bloodsport that is grabbing a super-surged Grab, or trudging along in Dickensian queues for trains, jeeps, and buses. If you’ve long felt safe in the knowledge that you can get from Point A to B with the least amount of suffering, having that taken away from you can only make you feel cheated and wronged. On social media alone, just saying anything remotely negative towards ride sharing apps is a death wish; whole droves of netizens will shame you for even daring to think these apps are anything but a godsend. Moreover, the LTFRB has been cursed out and disparaged more than ever, labeled as enemies of technological progress.  What the madding crowd fails to acknowledge, however, is that this issue has more than one villain. We tend to take the good vs evil concept too simplistically, content with the idea that if one is bad (LTFRB), then the other must be good (Uber), and that at the end of this issue, only one must prevail. But let’s face it: as messed up as the LTFRB may be (and its incompetence, at this point, is well documented), Uber is also very much a culprit in this chaos. It is one thing to disrupt the norm to do things better; it is a whole other thing to circumvent an order on the pretense of being a disruptor, and at the expense not only of frazzled commuters, but of Uber drivers and the loved ones they financially support.  Uber is not being hard-headed as some kind of power-to-the-people, Robin Hood-style derring-do. Uber kept accrediting drivers because it is a business, and its financial success depends on having as many drivers as possible plowing the streets. If Uber truly was interested in people’s wellbeing, as its marketing strongly suggests, then it would not have put the livelihoods of Uber drivers in danger. Yes, these drivers are not technically under Uber’s employ the way employment is normally understood – a loophole that reveals disruption’s dark side – but the company is still willfully ignoring the fact that many of these drivers depend on the app as their sole source of income, and are putting these men and women on the chopping block ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, many Uber patrons gloss over the company’s bullheadedness and this brazen exploitation of technicalities, because it is all too easy to just focus on how the app benefits their commute in the short term.  If there is any party citizens should be siding with on this issue, then, it is neither the LTFRB nor Uber. It should be with the public. And the public is certainly not limited to middle class commuters who could afford to shell out a few hundred pesos a day to travel faster and more comfortably than others. Our energies would be far better directed not at idly demonizing a long-problematic agency, or defending a company that essentially sees us as bags of money, but at clamoring for an honest-to-goodness middle ground, where public transport is greatly augmented through sustainable, accessible tech.  If we continue to push for “solutions” that only benefit a fraction of the public, then we continue to be part of the problem. Yes, fixing the catastrophe that is the Metro Manila commute is easier said than done, but we have to suck it up and understand that addressing serious issues entails a lot of time and effort and cooperation. It is not going to be easy; that’s just how it is, and the sooner we accept this and get the process going, the sooner we can see results that actually help for the long haul.  The culture of disruption remains welcome, and clearly inevitable. But entities that thrive on it are neither foolproof nor absolute, and the last thing we need disrupted is our ability to call out bullshit when we see it. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/before-uber","title":"What was your life like #BeforeUBER?","date":"Jun 21, 2017 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Everyone has an Uber story.

Uber is trying to to overturn employment tribunal findings which could pave the way for tens of thousands of its drivers in Britain to receive the national minimum wage and paid holiday time. The US firm's lawyers said the \"agency model\" – with Uber acting as an agent between self-employed drivers and passengers – has been used in the private hire industry \"for many years\", and this had not been properly taken into account by the tribunal. Uber's lawyer Dinah Rose said the company was not \"unusual\" in the industry, but \"the Uber app enables it to operate on a much larger scale than traditional minicab companies\". A prior tribunal had found that former Uber drivers Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar had been its \"workers.\" Rose claimed that the \"only legally proper conclusion\" from the tribunal's findings \"was that the claimants were not employed as workers\". The company has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital. Outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, hundreds of \"precarious workers\" attended a demonstration organized by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents Aslam and Farrar. \"Today's action is the articulation of the legitimate rage of the precarious workers and the exploited workers of the UK,\" said IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee. Speaking outside court, Farrar said people had told him to \"work somewhere else\" if he did not like working with Uber, \"but the problem is the problems are repeated across the economy\". Farrar said the case was more important than just the outcome for himself. \"There is a lot at stake.

Confirming a Reuters report, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Board Member Aileen Lizada told Rappler that Go-Jek executives will fly to the Philippines and meet with the agency on Tuesday, April 24, to discuss how the company can operate here. \"They would like to personally introduce themselves and probably they will ask for the requirements [for transport network company (TNC) accreditation]. We will listen to what they have to offer,\" Lizada said. TNCs provide pre-arranged transportation services using internet-based applications or a digital platform, connecting passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles. Back in December 2017, Go-Jek chief technology officer Ajey Gore told Reuters in an interview that his firm is planning to set up operations in the Philippines early this year, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow in the next few months. Go-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, was established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service. It then evolved into an on-demand mobile platform, providing transportation, logistics, mobile payments, and food delivery, among others. In February this year, the dominant Indonesian ride-hailing firm was able to raise over $1.5 billion from investors like BlackRock and Google. More local ride-hailing firms Other than Go-Jek, Lizada said there are two more local firms that have expressed interest in operating as a TNC: Cebu-based taxi-hailing platform MiCab and new ride-hailing firm Owto. \"Owto and MiCab are applying for [TNC accreditation], while U-Hop and Grab are applying for renewal of accreditation,\" Lizada told Rappler. She added that the LTFRB is set to grant TNC accreditation to Hiro, another local ride-sharing firm. (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?) The LTFRB earlier accredited GoLag Incorporated, Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated, and Hype Transport Systems Incorporated. The entry of these new ride-hailing companies comes on the heels of the sale of Uber's Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) earlier warned that Grab's buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the local ride-hailing market. \"The accreditation of new TNCs is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,\" said the PCC. The PCC is currently reviewing the local implications of the Grab-Uber deal. The antitrust watchdog had also ordered Grab and Uber to explain why the latter shut down, despite the commission ordering it to continue operating while the review is ongoing.

We round all of these up in our timeline below of Uber's troubles leading up to resignation of its head honcho. Included are several incidents involving the Philippines: August 16, 2013 - A group of Uber drivers in the US file a class-action lawsuit, claiming that their status as independent contractors instead of official employees is a misclassification – a status that leaves them bereft of full-time employee benefits. The case is ongoing as of June 2017.  December 2013 - An Uber driver hits a family on the road, killing a young girl and seriously injuring her mother and brother. Uber is sued by the family, but the company fights back on the basis that the driver wasn't officially booked at the time of the incident, meaning he technically wasn't an Uber driver during that period.   January 2014 - Techcrunch and Valleywag confirm that some Uber employees intentionally booked thousands of rides from competing ride-sharing services – only to cancel them and mess with their operations.  August 2014 - The Verge exposes an Uber secret project called Operation SLOG designed to spy on, and lure drivers away from competitor Lyft.  October 2014 - Uber's espionage on riders is exposed by Forbes, which discovered their \"God View\" and \"Creepy Stalker View,\" which tracked the trip of users.

Di samping itu, dukungan layanan konsumen dan kualitas aplikasi Uber juga akan menjadi tantangan yang berat untuk disaingi. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia.

It also announced Los Angeles will join two other previously revealed \"UberAIR\" pilot schemes in Dallas Fort-Worth, Texas, and Dubai. California and Texas are the US states with the largest number of cars. \"Uber's participation in NASA's UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) Project will help the company's goal of starting demonstration flights of uberAIR in select US cities by 2020,\" the ride-sharing company said in a statement. Uber wants to \"explore other collaboration opportunities with NASA\" with a view to open \"a new market of urban air mobility,\" it added. The first demonstration flights are expected in 2020, moving into commercial operations by 2023 – in plenty of time for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The flights will have a pilot during initial flights, but could be automated in the future, spokesman Matthew Wing confirmed to AFP. An UberAir journey between Los Angeles' airport and the Staples Center arena, for example, would take 27 minutes – three times less time than the same journey by car.  The promotional video posted above illustrates that the app would work in a similar way to the current set-up for ordering a car ride. In July, they also released a video explaining the concept of the service: But the planned electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLS) \"differ from helicopters in that they are orders of magnitude quieter, safer, more affordable, and more environmentally-friendly,\" the company said, adding that journeys will be priced competitively with a standard Uber trip. The vehicles will take off, land and recharge upon a network of \"vertiports\" installed on top of parking garages, on existing helipads or on unused land around road interchanges. Deloitte's Pascal Pincemin said at the Paris Air Show flying taxis will not be commonplace until 2050, as their reliability will need to be established first. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/pengemudi-uber-berunjuk-rasa","title":"Pengemudi Uber berunjuk rasa, ini 14 hal yang mereka tuntut","date":"Aug 21, 2017 2:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Manajemen Uber Indonesia dinilai mengabaikan kesejahteraan pengemudi","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Sekitar 500 pengemudi Uber motor berunjuk rasa di Patung Panahan, Senayan, Senin 21 Agustus 2017.

With many netizens complaining of the inconvenience, we wait for whether or not today's hearings will bring forth a resolution. Morning Commute Alexa: Train 8:19 am – After queueing up the stairs, I finally got to the MRT station proper. Unfortunately, my Beep card had around P10 so I had to line up once more to reload my card. 8:27 am – Two trains passed before I could finally get in one. The train was as stuffed as a tin of sardines, but I squeezed myself in. 8:49 am – I  got down at Ayala station. Since all the malls were still closed, I walked all the way to the first destination – Clock In, the co-working space in Ayala Triangle. It took me 20 minutes. Alecs: Taxi 8:07 am – Farmer’s Market Cubao. This is it! Our checking-in selfie to start the day. The first to reach Ayala Triangle in Makati wins. I started by walking to Gateway since I could see a number of cabs around that area. 8:12 am – Five cabs passed me, all carrying passengers. When I finally hailed down an empty cab, the driver rolled down his window and asked where I'm headed. “ Kuya, Ayala Triangle po. Sa Makati.” He pulled a face, shook his head no, and drove away. It’s not surprising. Not long after, another cab passed by “ Saan po kayo (Where are you going), ma’am?” I gave the same answer. He paused, looked at me, and said, “Ma’am, traffic na po. Da gdag P30 (It's traffic already. Add P30).” I politely declined but he insisted it’s only fair because it’s rush hour traffic. I still said no. He looked at me head to toe – twice – and said: “ Sige na nga po. Sakay na po kayo (Ok. Please get on).” Maybe he liked the look of my boots. 8:16 am – Not long after we left our pickup point, the car’s rear-view mirror broke and fell, hitting the driver while he was driving! I didn't know how to react, but it was funny as hell. It took a while for the driver to stick the mirror back to its original place. 8:36 am – It looked like the driver knew a shortcut. We entered this very narrow alley. It’s so small that this was the first time I ever noticed it. It led us to a back street parallel to EDSA. 8:47 am – As we passed the Boni Station MRT, my driver saw another taxi driver he recognized. My driver rushed forward, cutting through the lanes so he could position his taxi beside his friend’s. He rolled down his window and waved. His friend did the same. The passenger in the other taxi and I looked on, confused. They even had a little chat while cars behind us honked angrily. 9:00 am – Touch down at Ayala Triangle! I’m not the first but the ride was comfortable and amusing. Based on the meter, my ride was worth P176.50, and I paid exactly that. Vern: Angkas 8:10 am – I was pretty confident that I'd be the one who would get to Ayala Triangle first. I booked a bike quite quickly and the Angkas app said it would be at the pick-up point in 5 minutes. 8:18 am – The bike I rode had no plate number but no matter, I guess – we're off! 8:23 am – We get to Bonny Serrano corner EDSA and there were quite a few bikes waiting at the stoplight with us. It was oddly comforting to see so many people start their day the same way – they were my fellow commuters, only in separate vehicles. My biker/driver commented on the heat. Being exposed to the elements was definitely a downside to motorcycles. 8:56 am – My biker missed my stop, but he let me off across Ayala Triangle. I crossed the street to get to the meeting point and I was still the first one to get there! My trip cost P177. Amanda: Bus 8:12 am – I caught the first South-bound bus on EDSA that I saw. It was standing room only by the time I got on. I squeezed myself into one side, taking care not to push my backpack onto the face of the lady sitting in front of me. She was obviously irked at the invasion of her personal space, but I think she knew neither of us had a say in the matter. 8:19 am – The conductor started asking people where they were getting off and collecting their fares. I paid P26 to get off along Ayala Avenue in Makati. There was an old Pinoy movie playing on the TV but no one was watching. Everyone just looked tired and it was only early morning. 8:22 am – No one wanted to end up at the back of the bus as the conductor tried playing human Tetris with passengers, asking them to move further into the bus so more passengers could get in.. The people ignored him or pretended not to hear. The conductor lost his temper – \"K ung ayaw mo umatras, mag-taxi ka (If you don't want to move, take a taxi).” I moved across the aisle to avoid becoming the subject of his anger. 8:30 am – The couple in the seats in front of me got off! Yay seats! 8:45 am – The bus inched in front of Starmall. The driver was waiting for passengers, I think. At this point, I thought that the bus might become sardine-packed again by the time we get to Ayala. 8:51 am – The irritated conductor yelled out for passengers getting off at Boni. The bus wasn't allowed to stop on Boni apparently, but they were going to try to flout the rules. The conductor instructed the driver to stop a few meters away from Boni so Boni people could get off. “ Maglakad na lang kayo ng konti (Just walk a little),” he told them. 8:55 am – The bus driver stepped hard on the brakes because of a swerving car, I think. The irritated conductor let out a curse, “Putang ina ‘tong mga Uber na ‘to (This Uber son of a bitch).” 9:09 am – Bus stopped at Ayala Triangle where I was supposed to get off but unloading was not allowed! I needed to get down at the next stop. 9:12 am – I got off at Paseo and used one of the underpasses. It was a short walk but going up and down the stairs was tiring. 9:30 am – I arrived at Clock In. I looked harried and sweaty, definitely not presentable! Afternoon Commute Alexa: Train 2:30 pm – After another 20 minute walk to get to the MRT Ayala station, I managed to get inside a train easily. However, I felt like I was in a sardine tin again as people shoved their way to get in. 2:40 pm – The MRT stopped at the Guadalupe station. Again, even if it wasn’t rush hour, there were still a good many people trying to make their way in. 2:50 pm – Finally arrived at the Shaw Boulevard station. My plan was to walk from Shangri-La to Pearl Drive because there was a free bus to get to Estancia from there. However, it rained hard all of a sudden and I had to find shelter in a building and wait for the rain to subside. 3:00 pm – I missed my bus. The next one would arrive in an hour! I had no choice but to walk all the way to Estancia because there was no FX going there. 3:30 pm – Finally got to Estancia by walking. Alecs: Taxi 2:09 pm - I got a cab fairly easily on the first try. 2:30 pm - I was at the Guadalupe bridge where cars were piling up but traffic seemed to be moving. I’d been stuck in traffic here for 3 hours before so this w still fine. 2:45 pm – A few blocks away from Estancia, it rained. Thank God I was inside a car. 2:50 pm – I reached Estancia at exactly 2:50 pm and paid the cab P124. Vern: Angkas 2:19 pm – I had a meeting in the office at 3 pm, but I should be able to beat the traffic on a motorcycle, right? My ride showed up 11 minutes after I booked it. This biker didn't have any masks left and he had music blasting from his phone! We're off, weaving through traffic and listening to hits by Parokya ni Edgar and Bruno Mars. 2:50 pm – It started raining! The heat was fine, but rain was another story. I let out a curse as fat raindrops hit my helmet. My rider parked at a gas station where many other bikers were taking shelter from the sudden downpour. I explained that I was running late for a meeting and he put a raincoat on me, fixed the helmet on my head, and we headed out again. 2:59 pm – I look like a mess, but I got to the office just in the nick of time. My trip cost P90. Amanda: Bus 2:15 pm – I got on the bus passing Crossing Ibabaw. It was still roomy; no one was standing. Fare going to Crossing was P14. We hit traffic on the flyover to EDSA. 2:46 pm – I got down at Crossing, just as it started to drizzle. I walked to the jeepney stop across Shangri-la mall and settled myself inside the jeep as the drizzle got stronger. The jeep was already full but the driver believed that we could fit one more person in. Potential passengers came and peeked in, but no one seemed to want to squeeze into the few inches of space that the driver was determined to fill. 2:59 pm – Someone finally took that sliver of a seat and the jeep finally left. I paid P8, which I thought was standard minimum fare. The driver asked me where I was getting off and I told him my destination, which was not so far from the jeepney stop. He insisted that the fare going there was P15. I asked him why. He said, far or near the fare was P15. \" May pila kasi,\" one passenger explained. Sigh, jeep logic. 3:10: pm – I finally got off at Estancia. I was sweating buckets even if it was a dark and cloudy trip. Evening Commute Alexa: Train 5:45 pm – I left Estancia for Manila to catch an 8 pm show at the CCP. If you think I had the advantage by leaving so early, think again. 6:21 pm – I got to Shangri-La to catch the Shaw train. I had to walk again because the number of people trying to get a jeep made it impossible for me to catch a quick ride. It didn’t help that it was also raining. I felt like I walked more than I rode the MRT today. 6:30 pm – Got to the MRT station and I wanted to cry when I saw the long lines before me. It was still raining hard so I tried not get to soaked while waiting in a line that extended beyond the stairs. 6:40 pm – Finally got inside the MRT bound for Taft. 7:00 pm – I got to the Taft station and walked again to switch to the LRT. 7:12 pm – Two trains had passed by and the line was getting longer 7:24 pm – Finally got into train bound for Vito Cruz. 7:38 pm – After arriving at Vito Cruz, I had to walk to a jeep terminal to get to CCP. I began to worry that I might not be able to make it to my show. 7:54 pm – Finally made it to CCP with barely any time to spare! Alecs: Taxi 7:15 pm – I usually didn’t leave the office at this hour because I knew traffic was hell, especially along Shaw Blvd., EDSA, Makati – okay, practically everywhere! Good luck to us. 7:25 pm – It had been 10 minutes and it looked like I was far from finding a taxi. The traffic I saw in front of me had barely even moved! I only saw 3 cabs, all with passengers inside. This wasn’t a good sign. 7:30 pm – I began to wonder if I could even get a cab here, and I was sure if I did get to hail one, the chances of rejection was very high. Suddenly I saw it: an empty cab! I rushed towards it and asked the driver if he could drop me off at DLSU, Manila. He paused for a while. I silently prayed, “Please, please say yes.” When he looked at me and said yes, I was so happy and I felt so lucky! I was expecting to be turned down by at least 7 taxis before one would accept me. 7:40 pm – The driver, Kuya Joey, loved to talk. I didn’t converse with the first two drivers I encountered today, but Kuya Joey seemed fun. I asked him why taxi drivers often declined passengers. He said, we were not only paying for the fare going there but also paying for the driver’s efforts. He explained how difficult it was to be a driver stuck in traffic. Driving was extremely tiring, he said, and the meter was still running even if the taxi wasn’t moving. Gas was a main factor, too – fuel was still being consumed even while the car was practically parked in traffic and if this went on for hours, the fare of the passengers would be barely enough to cover the amount of gas spent by the driver. 8:45 pm – We reached DLSU! One hour and 15 minutes! I didn’t know which surprised me more, that we reached Manila from Pasig this quickly, or that the ride itself didn’t even feel as long as it actually was. I told Kuya Joey I had a pretty good day and that I felt lucky that things went my way. He said, because of this, this too was his lucky day. The ride was worth P245 but I gave him P300 and told him to keep the change. Vern: Angkas 7:17 pm – It's been drizzling on and off, but I need to head to Wildflour in Makati for dinner with a friend. I booked a ride and wait. 7:31 pm – What was initially supposed to be a 5-minute wait turned into 14. I think my driver missed a turn and ended up much further away, so I cancelled that ride and tried to book another one. 7:34 pm – My new rider asked me to cancel the ride because his motorcycle broke down. 7:55 pm – After a lot of waiting, I ended up walking to a Starbucks near Shaw Boulevard and was able to book a ride from there. 8:06 pm – There was a bit of traffic tonight, but that's expected since it was a Friday and it rained all afternoon. 8:21 pm – We're on EDSA and it's raining slightly, but we were breezing past the cars that were stuck in traffic because of a road accident up ahead. 8:36 pm – On Paseo de Roxas, there were a lot of cars and a lot of stoplights. In hindsight, the driver should have stuck to EDSA to avoid all these red lights. 8:49 pm – I was hungry and dizzy but I finally got to Wildfour. My last trip of the day cost P131. After dinner, I ended up hitching a car ride home – I'd had enough motorcycles for one day. Amanda: Bus 7:21 pm – Traffic was heavy and the jeeps were not moving. I took the opportunity to board the jeep of my choice. 7:30 pm – I was still stuck on the spot where I boarded the jeep. 7:39 pm – The jeep was just about to cross its first intersection. The driver and I chatted a bit. He was regretting taking his jeep out, saying he only did so because he saw that an old lady needed a ride. 7:51 pm – The jeep went off our supposed route. I had no idea where we were passing but at least we were moving. 7:56 pm – We were stuck in traffic again. With no signs of moving, I caved in and decided to get something to eat and let the traffic ease up before I tried again. Late Night Commute Alexa: Train The trains would close at 10:30 pm and since there’s no Uber, I had no choice but to get a taxi or use Grab. There were no empty taxis so I ended up getting home around midnight because of the bad traffic on Roxas Boulevard. I had to pay P320 for the Grab taxi. Amanda: Bus 9:00 pm – I walked to Shaw boulevard to take a jeep. Traffic had loosened considerably. 9:06 pm – The jeep stopped at a traffic light. The exhaust from the truck next to us had  wafted into our jeep. Thankfully, I had a face mask on hand. 9:10 pm – I got off the jeep and made my way to the bus stop. 9:15 pm – I boarded the bus in front of Starmall. It was full, but not standing-room full. I paid P16. 9:45 pm – The bus finally approached EDSA-Buendia. Some people got off and there were more empty seats. 10:03 pm – The bus stopped at Ayala Triangle. A lot of people got on. So near yet so far! I didn’t know why the bus was moving so slowly! 10:15 pm – The bus came to a full stop right in the middle of the road just as it rounded the corner into Buendia! I was so close to my stop! I looked out the window and saw that a van trying to park was blocking the way, holding everyone up. 10:17 pm –  I FINALLY got off at my stop, Buendia-Mayapis. I got a trike from there to get home, but even the trike got caught in a traffic jam. 10:25 – Touchdown home! – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/softbank-uber-deal","title":"SoftBank seals deal for large Uber stake","date":"Dec 29, 2017 5:33 PM PHT","snippet":"The two firms did not provide details of the valuation but a source says the investment was based on Uber's worth of $48 billion, down from $71 billion earlier this year","body":"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Uber and SoftBank announced a deal on Thursday, December 28, allowing the Japanese tech titan to take a large stake in the US ridesharing giant, making a hefty cut in the valuation of the biggest venture-backed startup. SoftBank will acquire 15% of Uber's equity at a discount of 30% from its most recent value, according to a source familiar with the terms of the deal. The new investment, which will be finalized in January, is part of an effort by Uber to move past a series of scandals and missteps and reform its board structure as it gears up for a 2019 public share offering. A source familiar with the deal said SoftBank had reached agreements with investors to achieve its target of a 15% share. The two firms did not provide details of the valuation but the source said the investment was based on Uber's worth of $48 billion, down from $71 billion earlier this year. \"We look forward to working with the purchasers to close the overall transaction, which we expect to support our technology investments, fuel our growth, and strengthen our corporate governance,\" Uber said in an emailed statement. A separate statement from Rajeev Misra, chief executive of SoftBank Investment Advisers, said, \"We are appreciative of the support from Uber's shareholders in the successful tender offer and look forward to closing the overall investment in January.\" \"We have tremendous confidence in Uber's leadership and employees and are excited to support Uber as it continues to reinvent how people and goods are transported around the world,\" he added. The source said SoftBank's total investment in Uber will amount to $7.7 billion including a $1 billion infusion announced earlier this year. $54 billion 'blended' value The earlier investment was made at the higher valuation and the share repurchases at a lower value, leaving a \"blended\" valuation for Uber at $54 billion, according to the source. The investment is part of the effort by SoftBank to become a major player in the global tech world with a massive $100 billion fund, much of it targeted for Silicon Valley startups. At Uber, new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has vowed to fix the company's work culture and business practices, after taking over earlier this year from ousted founder Travis Kalanick. Even as Uber has seen unprecedented growth by expanding to dozens of countries, it has been hurt by missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic work atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. The SoftBank deal is expected to put an end to litigation among stakeholders and clear the way for new board members, further loosening Kalanick's grip. Uber however still faces numerous challenges including rulings from regulators that it unfairly competes with taxi operators, with London authorities having pulled its license. Uber is also seeking to become a major player in autonomous cars, and has agreed to buy and adapt vehicles from Volvo to begin operating self-driving taxis. But it faces a trail from former Google car unit Waymo alleging Uber executives stole trade secrets. The ridesharing group's website says it has operations in 616 cities in 77 countries and some 16,000 employees. In most cases Uber drivers are treated as independent contractors. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/uber-loses-employment-case-britain","title":"Uber loses employment rights case in Britain","date":"Nov 10, 2017 7:39 PM PHT","snippet":"The London employment court rejects Uber's appeal against an October 2016 ruling in a case that is being closely watched for the wider implications for Britain's booming 'gig economy'","body":"LONDON, United Kingdom – US ride-hailing app Uber on Friday lost a landmark case in Britain that would give drivers the right to paid holidays and the national minimum wage, lawyers representing the claimants said. The London employment tribunal rejected Uber's appeal against an October 2016 ruling in a case that is being closely watched for the wider implications for Britain's booming \"gig economy\". \"Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset,\" Paul Jennings from law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite said in a statement. \"The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so-called gig economy,\" he said. Uber said it will appeal the ruling. \"The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal,\" Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager, said in a statement. \"Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control. We've also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover,\" he said. Uber drivers are paid for each ride and the firm insists they are self-employed, choosing when, where and for how long they drive. 'Brutally exploitative'  However, James Farrar, who brought the test case with fellow former driver Yaseen Aslam, has called Uber's business plan \"brutally exploitative\". They are supported by the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) trade union, which also represents couriers, cleaners, foster carers and security officers. \"These companies are making a mockery of supposed employment rights,\" the union's general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said in a statement. Ahead of the ruling, an Uber spokesman told AFP that whatever the result, it \"will not necessarily be the end of the process and we expect either side would appeal\". Any challenge would go to the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider a similar case involving the company Pimlico Plumbers, which is appealing a ruling that one of its former plumbers was entitled to employment rights. Uber meanwhile is currently fighting a decision by London authorities not to renew its license, owing to public safety concerns. The company has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital. – Rappler.com   UBER LOSES.

As the antitrust authority, our lens is always focused on the market – in this case, we are reviewing the potential effects on competition in the merger between Grab and Uber,\" the PCC said in a statement on Monday. The antitrust watchdog noted that it is \"aware there are many factors that led to the shutdown of the Uber app.\" \"This development may have rendered the review conditions to be less than ideal, however, this move shall not derail the motu proprio review,\" it added. (READ: Does PCC understand Grab-Uber deal? Grab says operations can't be 'separate') The PCC also wants Grab and Uber to explain why the latter shut down, despite the commission ordering it to continue operating while the review is ongoing. \"The parties are given until April 17 to explain why they have failed to continue operating the platform, as required in the Interim Measures Order,\" said the PCC. The commission's order contradicted that of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB), which ordered Uber to end operations before April 16. When the PCC previously ordered Uber to continue running beyond April 8, Grab had said it would shoulder the cost of the extension but only until April 15. Little room for newcomers The PCC now plans to fast-track the completion of its review, \"given how it is imbued with public interest.\" \"When a big player buys out its competitor, there will be many economic and legal factors that need to be scrutinized,\" the commission added. (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Explain 'illegal' P2-per-minute travel charge) The PCC went on to reiterate that Grab's acquisition of Uber's assets creates a potentially distorted market for ride-hailing. \"Grab's buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,\" said the commission. \"Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to network effects. This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base,\" it added. The PCC said it would take that into consideration during the review to level the playing field. \"In the end, the PCC stands with the passengers to protect them from the perils of monopoly,\" it concluded.

Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber's latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. \"Today's acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,\" said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. \"The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.\" Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab's board as part of the deal, said: \"This deal is a testament to Uber's exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.\" Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber's losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-safety-features-driver-habits","title":"Uber's new road safety features focus on improving driver habits","date":"Sep 9, 2016 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Manila is one of the 5 cities outside the US where the transport app has rolled out new features designed to curb unsafe driving behavior","body":"MANILA, Philippines – On Thursday, September 8, Uber updated its app with 3 new features in the Philippines geared towards safety and ride experience: daily reports to drivers that show their braking and acceleration habits; a system that detects instances when the driver is using his smartphone instead of placing it on a dashboard mount; and speeding alerts. In the Philippines, around 25% of Uber drivers now have these new features as Uber rolls out the updates gradually. These features were initially tested in the US in January 2016, ahead of a complete roll-out months later, in June. Beyond the US and the Philippines, Uber has also implemented the changes in 4 other Asia-Pacific countries: Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and India – high-volume regions for the transport app. Why did their roll-out selection process prioritize volume? That's because the volume presents an opportunity to collect a lot more driving data faster, according to Dorothy Chou, Uber's Head of Public Policy for Safety, Privacy and Security in an online video conference held on Friday, September 9.  \"1.25 million people die every year on the world's roads,\" said Chou, citing a World Health Organization report. Given Uber's position as one of the most popular transport apps, Chou believes they have the talent and the manpower to bring that number down. The more data they collect, the faster they'll be able to build better safety features. The app already has a few safety features in place such as driver screening, ride-tracking via GPS (a button that allows you to share the route of your trip with anybody you want to), and a driver rating system that keeps driver behavior in check. The new features build upon that, with a focus on \"unsafe driving behavior\" specifically harsh braking, rapid acceleration, distracted driving, and overspeeding.  Unsafe habits To address the issues of harsh braking and rapid acceleration, Uber now provides a daily scorecard to drivers showing the total number of times they braked and accelerated, which of those instances were harsh and rapid. These habits count towards their overall rating and is compared to the averages in the driver's city. Essentially, it's a gamification feature. Your driving behavior is being monitored. Want to score high? Ease up on the hard braking and acceleration, which Chou said are indicators of tailgating and aggressive driving.  \"It's about encouraging drivers to adopt safer [driving] practices,\" said Chou, adding that 40% of driving-related complaints are related to hard braking. Distracted driving Another scenario that elicits passenger complaints is when a driver holds and uses a phone in one hand while driving with the other. Uber now monitors this behavior too. The company has pinpointed the movement patterns that indicate and differentiate between in-hand phone use and mounted use. During the testing phase, Uber cross-checked these patterns by sending a message to the affected passenger, asking for visual confirmation.  Combining the pattern data with the validation from the passengers, Uber believes it now has what they need to accurately identify this specific example of distracted driving. So now, when the app detects in-hand phone use, it tells the driver that his practice is unsafe and suggests the use of a phone mount. Stressing the importance of changing this habit, Chou cited a study by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute that said that physical distraction (fiddling with the radio, holding a phone) is far riskier than cognitive distraction (talking to someone while driving). Using a phone mount lessens the physical load on the driver, and thus, is safer, according to the study. Speed alerts The third and last feature in the recent update alerts drivers when they're going past the speed limit. While it's been rolled out, the feature is still more on a pilot stage, Chou admits. Right now, Uber only has speed limit information on the highways, but will gradually include roads both major and minor.  Wrapping up the briefing, Chou says that these new features will be constantly  analyzed to see how effective they are and how they can be improved. The specific features may change but what's clear is that the driving data that Uber possesses – and possibly those collected by other transport apps as well – can very well shape a safer driving landscape for all of us. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/uber-carpool-move-people-fewer-cars","title":"Uber's carpool service aims to move more people in fewer cars","date":"Jun 15, 2016 12:41 PM PHT","snippet":"uberPOOL aims to provide passengers with cheaper fares while using fewer cars – its contribution to help ease Metro Manila's traffic woes","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Transport network company Uber on Wednesday, June 15, launched its newest carpooling service that aims to provide on-demand rides to its passengers, while using fewer cars in a bid to avoid worsening the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  The newest uberPOOL service allows passengers to share their rides with up to 3 other people heading to the same destination, and pay fares that are typically 25% cheaper than the company's cheapest service, UberX.  Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said riders only need to select the uberPOOL option on the app, select their destination, and choose how many people they want to share the ride with. The system then calculates a route to pick up and drop off the passengers.   Because it is a ride-sharing service instead of a point-to-point service, it may take a bit longer for passengers to get to their destination. But Cua said that the benefits outweigh a few minutes of waiting. (READ: UberPOOL in PH: How Uber's carpool feature works)  \"It does change a little bit of behavior, but we do think overall, in the bigger scheme of things, that additional 5 to 10 minutes is worth the effort. It's not too big of an inconvenience, and it will help in taking cars off the road,\" Cua said in an interview during the service's launch at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) compound in Quezon City. Cua said the latest service is the company's solution to Metro Manila's traffic woes, which cost the Philippines P2.4 billion a day in productivity losses. Experts have also pointed to the boom of car sales as one of the causes behind the gridlock in the metro.  Currently, 40 cities around the world have the uberPOOL service. Since it was first launched in 2014, Uber said more than 100 million rides have been taken using the service.  Aside from providing cheaper fares for passengers, Cua said the new service would also benefit drivers and the environment. Since passengers share rides, drivers would have less idle time waiting for passengers. Fewer cars would also be needed on the roads – which, in turn, would cut harmful carbon dioxide emissions. Based on its estimates, Uber said that its carpooling service has saved about 1.8 million gallons of gas and 16,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions in the first 4 months of 2016 alone. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez also expressed his support for uberPOOL, noting its contribution to helping ease congestion in Metro Manila. He also clarified that there will be no new franchises issued for the new carpooling service. \"UberPOOL will use UberX cars. This is not a new franchise. All those that were authorized already will be using the same authority, so no authority, no new license will be issued,\" Ginez said. Meanwhile, Cua assured passengers that sharing their rides with others won't compromise their safety. He said that all Uber users are validated because they are required to provide their credit card information and mobile number, among others, before using the ride-hailing service.  \"Drivers on Uber cannot just pick passengers off the street. When you register, you have to have a credit card, mobile number, email. So everything is tracked. And besides that, we have a support system in the backend. If a passenger has a complaint, they can email and we respond very quickly,\" he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/uber-app-pay-per-ride-chauffeur-service","title":"What's a trip like on Uber's pay-per-ride chauffeur service?","date":"Feb 20, 2014 6:49 PM PHT","snippet":"Rappler's Michael Josh Villanueva and Chay Lazaro try out Uber, Metro Manila's new app-based, pay-per-ride chauffeur service","body":"   MANILA, Philippines – Why drive a car when you can just share \"everyone’s private driver?\" Uber, a new app-based chauffeur service offers a new way of looking at commuting. The San Francisco-based startup set up shop in Metro Manila last week with a unique proposition. They get you a car and personal driver, but you only pay per use. The idea is not only innovative but green, and with the impending “carmageddon,” timely. Private cars spend most of their lives parked, while shared cars are more utilized. The concept of a shared economy hugely impacts congestion and the environment. Uber Regional Manager Michael Brown said these are values that are very important to the company – “to innovate in order to make transport less expensive, to reduce congestion in cities, and to make transport more environmentally sane so we don’t ruin our planet.” The concept behind the new service is simple and familiar. You do everything on the Uber app (available on iOS and Android) – sign-up, order a car, track the car, contact the driver, and rate the experience. But Uber shouldn’t be confused for a taxi. On its network is a mix of high-end cars, “everything from a Mercedes E Class to a Toyota Camry.” Imagine a premium car, black, without any branding and with a leather interior. Of course luxury comes at a price. Brown says the price of an Uber is about 1.25x the cost of a taxi but that's a conservative estimate. Expect your Uber ride to cost up to 2x of what you'd normally pay for a cab ride and about 1.3x the cost of app-based taxi booking services like GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi. Frills aside, Brown said other key differentiators of his company are “convenience of payment and the accountability” that Uber brings to transport and safety. Booking a car and a driver   The most tedious part of the process is signing up, a 5-minute process which entails having to key in your credit card details and verifying your email address.  The good news is you only have to do it once. Next time you launch the app you’ll immediately see a pin with your current location and the estimated wait time. Click on “set pickup location” which loads another screen where you can either get a “fare quote” and/or “enter a promo code” before you finalize your order by clicking on “request pickup here.”  Soon you’ll move on to another screen that says “driver confirmed and en route” with a real time map for tracking the car. You’ll also get the driver’s name, plate number, and contact number and options to call and message the driver himself.    I did like how easy it is to use the app. I use app-based taxi booking services all the time and it’s never as straight forward as this. Soon after our booking was made, the driver was texting and calling to make sure he got the exact pick-up point. I also liked the split fare option, which allows you to invite a second passenger to share the ride and costs with. On this trip I shared a ride with my car-pool buddy and colleague Jessica who immediately after I clicked on split fare, got an invite on her iPhone. I had very few expectations from this ride because I wasn't very familiar with the app. In fact, I only installed it because Josh wanted to try the \"Share the Fare\" feature. All I knew was that it wasn't going to be the usual taxi and that we what we were waiting for was a Toyota Camry. The ride We travelled from SM Megamall in Ortigas to Katipunan in Quezon City on a black Toyota Camry. Our trip covered a distance of 12.59 km and took 27 minutes and 3 seconds.   What can be disappointing for some customers is the driver's lack of route knowledge. This is acceptable or may even be better if you're headed in a familiar destination and prefer to direct the driver to take your preferred route. However, if you're going somewhere for the first time you’ll both end up lost. Post-ride thoughts  Because I wasn’t the final stop I didn’t know how much the total fare was. But as soon as Jessica was dropped off we both got emails informing us that our credit cards were deducted half of the actual fare. From SM Megamall to Katipunan via EDSA, Kamias and Xavierville, our total fare cost just under P330. The same route on a regular taxi costs us P180 on average. We could have saved an extra P20 had we not decided to split the fare. If you plan on regularly using Uber to carpool (which you can up to 4 people), we recommend you don’t use the app’s sharing feature and work out the costs internally. Each passenger added to the split fare list is charged P10. After the ride is over you are asked to rate your driver. If you give him 3 stars and below you’ll be asked what didn’t work, with the option to pick arrival time, driving, car quality, professionalism, and trip route as factors.  Despite their company motto, Uber isn’t for everyone, at least for now. The biggest barrier to universality is the credit card requirement. Brown said the company is looking into other forms of payment. “Ultimately we want people to ride and are looking into other payment gateways to make Uber universally accessible,” he said. A company that prides itself in its ability to innovate, Uber is also looking into solving the “last 100-meter problem” with even better mapping solutions to help connect drivers with riders.    While our 30 minute wait, and not so route-savvy driver signal that the company is still going through birthing pains, the idea is one worth looking into. The service is perfect if you don’t have a car and/or driver and want to travel in style to a party, business meeting or some other important event, or if you just feel like you deserve a travel upgrade but don’t want to spend on a car just yet. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-us-dismiss-india-suit","title":"Uber asks US court to dismiss India rape suit","date":"Apr 7, 2015 11:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber B.V., a Netherlands-based entity with no US operations and which isn't part of the suit, is the company the alleged assailant had a contract with, asserts Uber US","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The United States branch of ridesharing company Uber asked a US court Tuesday, April 7, to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the alleged victim of a rape and assault case in New Delhi, India.  Reuters reported the woman sued the US service in a federal court, claiming insufficient safety procedures were in place.

Uber launched a motorbike taxi service - UberMotor, to compete with Grab and Go-Jek, which is widely used by Indonesian commuters. The drivers of UberMotor wear a black jacket representing their company, as well as a helmet with the Uber logo on it – similar to Grab or Go-Jek drivers. I tried to hail UberMotor at around 9 am in Kuningan City in South Jakarta on April 13, a day after it launched, but I couldn't find any drivers through the app at that time. The app showed there were no motors available. Cheaper Later that evening, I successfully ordered an UberMotor near National Monument from Monas to my home. The trip was a 5-kilometer ride, and surprisingly cost me only \"Rp 3.500\" or $0.26. The fare stunned me. Can you buy anything with that price? It was especially a shocker compared to GrabBike's minimum fare: Rp 10.000 ($0.76). Acording to Uber's official website, the base fare is Rp.1.000 ($0.076) and it charges customers another Rp.1.000 per km and and Rp100 ($0.0076) per minute. Payment options are also different. I can pay my UberMotor fare with cash or credit card, while GrabBike and GoJek only accepts cash. It seems that UberMotor has the upper hand with its local rivals GoJek and Grab, however because it is so new, it might take you more than 10 minutes to request a UberMotor.Long wait  I waited for 15 minutes for UberMotor, and I could not find any driver when I tried the app at the first time. Meanwhile, it takes me less than 5 minutes to grab a motorbike using Grab. \"I think there are only 200 drivers today,\" the UberMotor rider told me. He said that he worked for GoJek before. Uber's expansion to motorbikes I believe, is a benefit to Indonesian commuters. They now have more choices. However, other motorbike or taxi drivers must be unhappy with the added competition – especially taxi drivers who held a protest against ride-hailing apps in Jakarta last month. The protest turned violent, with some cab drivers attacking GoJek drivers. What has been your experience with UberMotor? Would you try it out?

Uber, an app that allows customers to hail private rides via their phones, has proved popular in Jakarta, a metropolis plagued by monster traffic jams but with scant public transport.  However Jakarta authorities say that Uber is operating illegally as it has no public transport permit and does not pay tax.  Uber, however, insists it is not a public transport company, but a technology firm, which does not own or operate vehicles or employ drivers.  A task force impounded the vehicles in two operations this month and last, the Jakarta transport office said. \"It's only 30 cars compared to thousands of cars they have, but I want people to learn a lesson that this is wrong,\" head of the office, Andri Yansyah, told AFP.  Yansyah said the car owners would have to go to court, pay a fine and sign a document stating they would not join any company such as Uber until it followed local regulations.

Last month 18 vehicles owned by Uber drivers were impounded in Jakarta, with the city's mayor declaring the US-based taxi app illegal. Uber claims it plays by the rules in Bandung, as elsewhere, and has been given an overwhelming \"thumbs up\" by passengers and drivers so far. \"It’s why we are also disappointed that the government of Bandung has declared that it is banning Uber,\" the company said in a statement. Despite the opposition it's faced, Uber still plans to set up a foreign investment company in Indonesia, and has a representative office in Jakarta. The smartphone-based ride service has sparked angry protests worldwide, with some taxi associations taking legal action while others have demanded the arrest of Uber operators and executives.

A regional court in Frankfurt ruled that the San Francisco-based firm, which allows passengers to summon cars using an app on their smartphones at prices that significantly undercut rival taxi companies, is banned from operating in Europe's biggest economy. Uber was defiant even though it faces a fine of 250,000 euros ($328,000) every time it flouts the ban. \"We're still operational in Germany,\" it said in a statement. The Frankfurt court issued its ruling last week, but it was only made public on Tuesday. Uber has been operating in 5 German cities, including Berlin and Frankfurt, since early 2013. But it has come under fierce opposition from local taxi companies, which have invoked court injunctions with some success. Under the Frankfurt court's ruling, the ban is now nationwide. It will not, however, affect UberBlack, the firm's limousine service that uses professional chauffeurs. \"Uber will appeal and, if necessary, use all legal means at its disposal,\" it said. Following the Frankfurt ruling, \"we are examining ways of changing the service,\" said the head of the group's western European operations, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty. He said the group was unfazed by the latest development. \"We fought the same battle one and a half years ago\" in the United States, he told AFP. Expanding Uber is now present in more than 100 US cities, with 24 added to the list just last week. It operates in 42 countries, with a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region. But its move into Europe has encountered opposition from taxi companies, including protests from London cabbies and legal injunctions in France, Germany and Spain. The company announced last week that it intended to move into the German cities of Stuttgart and Cologne. Its spokesman Fabien Nestmann said the number of app users had risen 5-fold since the start of 2014, without providing any concrete data. The German taxi federation BZP welcomed the court ruling, insisting that the legal permits required under German law \"are not an end in themselves, but in order to safeguard quality and customer protection\". \"We're not frightened by new market players. But competition can only function if the same legal conditions apply to everyone, including new market players,\" BZP said. \"Internet services do not operate outside the law.\" - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/uber-not-cool-jakarta","title":"Über not cool in Jakarta","date":"Aug 21, 2014 11:01 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":"Jakarta is the latest to target Uber, an app that has sparked protests from taxi drivers in several countries as it allows customers to hail private rides through their phones.

Joseph Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer from April 2015 to November 2017, allegedly tried to hide the October 2016 data breach, which affected some 57 million Uber riders and drivers, and was only revealed in November 2017. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data without telling riders or drivers who had their information compromised. Aside from obstruction of justice, Sullivan was also charged with misprision of a felony, which meant he knew of the breach and tried to hide it. Sullivan faces up to 5 years in prison for the obstruction charge, and up to 3 years for the misprision charge. Speaking to The Verge via email, Sullivan’s spokesman Bradford Williams said there was “no merit” to the charges against his client, noting Sullivan is “a respected cybersecurity expert and former Assistant U.S. Attorney.” Sullivan is currently the chief security officer at Cloudflare.

Uber Technologies has pushed back against European and US labor advocates' demands for better driver compensation with some success, calling for a \"third way\" of combining flexible on-demand work with more limited benefits than traditional employees receive. The agreement in Britain classifies Uber drivers as workers who are entitled to fewer rights than those classed as employees, who are also guaranteed sick pay and parental leave. Uber in California last year pushed and won a similar compromise on drivers' status. In a case led by two former Uber drivers, a UK employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as paid holidays, prompting Uber to appeal all the way to Britain's top court, which ruled against it in February. Uber said at the time it would consult with drivers whilst lawyers said it could take several months for the details of the ruling to be worked out at a further employment tribunal hearing. Meanwhile, more cases could be filed. On Tuesday, Uber said UK drivers would receive some added benefits, including paid holiday time, be enrolled in a pension scheme and receive no less than the minimum wage, which stands at an hourly 8.72 pounds ($12.07) for those aged 25 years and over, after they accept a trip request. \"This follows the recent UK Supreme Court ruling, which provides a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status while continuing to let them work flexibly,\" Uber said. Drivers will not receive minimum wage during the time they spend waiting for a passenger. That portion, known as cruising or dead-heading, can account for as much as a third of the time drivers spend behind the wheel with the app turned on, according to several US studies. UK and US labor activists have called on Uber to pay drivers from the moment they log onto the app and are available, but Uber has said it could not control what drivers did during that time and whether they were actually working. The Silicon Valley-based company said its drivers in London, by far its largest market in Europe, earn 17 pounds an hour on average and the flexibility to choose if, when and where they work will be retained. Uber has faced opposition from traditional taxi operators and unions who criticised the app for undercutting existing players, leading to protests and regulatory and legal challenges which have forced the company to pull out of some markets. France's top court in 2020 recognised the right of an Uber driver to be considered an employee while European Union regulators are considering new rules to protect gig economy workers. California lawmakers last year implemented a bill that would have forced gig economy companies to treat their workers as employees, leading Uber to put forth its \"third way\" ballot proposition, which voters approved. That cemented app-based workers' status as independent contractors while offering some benefits, including minimum pay while riders are in their cars, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance. In California, Uber has financed at least some of the added benefits by increasing prices for riders. Tuesday's announcement could impact others in the gig economy, where millions of people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis. \"Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives,\" said Uber's Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/friday-feels-190-million-pesos-later-uber","title":"#FridayFeels: P190 million later","date":"Sep 1, 2017 8:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber is back, but what has the government done to fix the terrible traffic?","body":"(Sing to the tune of \"Seasons of Love\") One hundred and ninety million pesos from UberOne hundred and ninety million hours on the roadOne hundred and ninety million pesos from UberBut we're still stuck here, the traffic's still slow. – Rappler.com Artwork by Ernest John FiestanText by Marguerite de Leon #FridayFeels is a cartoon series by the Rappler Creatives Team.

In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

Such discussions highlighted some of the most pressing #CommuterProblems – and it also created confusion among Filipino netizens.  On Thursday, August 13, automotive journalist James Deakin alleged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) of being \"so unreasonably hard on Uber.\" This comes after the Philippine government’s call for a nationwide clampdown on unregistered Uber and GrabCar vehicles, after licensed taxi operators protested unfair competition.  “They are starting their own service called premium taxi, which is just another racket and another inept way of reinventing the wheel! This is appalling,” Deakin said in his original Facebook post. His post quickly went viral, scoring over 3,000 likes and 6,000 shares as of Saturday, August 15.  LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez responded also through Facebook, clarifying that “the allegation that Premium Taxi was created to compete with Uber and GrabCar is without basis in fact and in law.” Ginez also stressed that the DOTC and LTFRB are not putting Uber and GrabCar out of business, but merely asking the two to apply for franchise. Deakin then wrote an open letter to the LTFRB and DOTC, saying he is not against the Premium Taxi service but only concerned that it may “replace” or “compete unevenly” with Uber. He also edited his original Facebook post: “In the spirit of fairness to the LTFRB, I have edited (at their request) the term ‘starting their own service’ to ‘starting a new service’ so that it is clear to all that it does not belong to them as operators, but solely as regulators. Hope this clears things up. The rest of the rant is a matter of opinion.” Misinformation? The debate, however, is yet to rest. On Saturday, lawyer Yves Gonzalez shared on Facebook screengrabs of his online discussion with Deakin regarding Uber and LTFRB. Gonzalez, a former traffic official of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), said that as an Uber customer, he wants the latter to comply with the government's requirements. “But the disinformation that has spread recently regarding Premium Taxi has been grossly unfair to the government regulators, taking into consideration how accommodating they have been to Uber and the like,” Gonzalez added. “The ball is in Uber's court now to comply with the 'historic' progressive regulations they hailed back in May 2015.”  Gonzalez emphasized the fact that while GrabCar has been able to follow LTFRB's accreditation procedures, Uber has not done so.    Meanwhile, Deakin pointed out that the government should should not treat Uber operators like \"criminals,\" especially since they still have August 21 to meet LTFRB's regulations.     The LTFRB itself also clarified that the Premium Taxi category is not new and is not owned by the board. Here is a timeline of events:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-ltfrb-uber-suspension-lifted","title":"LTFRB lifts Uber suspension","date":"Aug 29, 2017 5:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber can operate in the Philippines again after the company paid a P190-million fine and provided compensation to its drivers","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Uber is back.

Drivers hired for rides using their privately-owned cars via the UberPop application \"lack the administrative authorization to carry out the job, and the activity they perform constitutes unfair competition,\" the court ruled. The Spanish court also ordered telecom companies and payment service providers to block Uber, which both reserves taxis and processes payments via smartphone applications. The ruling was a \"precautionary measure\" adopted while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association. Similar legal challenges from traditional taxi services have proliferated elsewhere, as the cheaper Uber option has lured passengers away.  In a communique responding to the judgement, Uber said it \"will continue to respect Spanish law,\" but vowed to examine all its options to deal with ruling it described as \"sudden and unusual\". Founded in 2009 in California, Uber has become a popular transportation alternative to traditional taxis. Uber charges a commission for each ride, but fees charged by the service's drivers are generally significantly lower than normal taxis.  Riders are also able to rate service provided by individual drivers – who in turn rate the behavior of their customers. Individuals on either side of the transaction whose ranking fall below a certain level are banned from the scheme. Uber last week announced its valuation at $40 billion (32 billion euros), twice its worth 6 months ago. It is now operating service in more than 200 cities across 45 countries. But legal clashes and controversy have begun clouding Uber's horizon. Dutch judges on Monday, December 8, banned UberPOP service from taking bookings in the Netherlands, and threatened the company with fines of up to 100,000 euros ($123,000) in case of infringement, saying unlicensed drivers were breaking the law. In contrast to its initial response to the Spanish ruling Tuesday, a defiant Uber reacted to the Dutch decision Monday with a statement saying it \"will continue to offer UberPOP.\" Monday's decision \"is simply the first step in a long-running judicial battle,\" the San Francisco-based company added. A court in Paris is to decide on Friday whether Uber's services constitute unfair competition to traditional taxi drivers. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have also filed complaints against Uber. In Germany, a court in Frankfurt threw out an injunction against Uber in September. Uber was able to resume operating legally in Germany pending a final ruling on a complaint by the taxi federation.

The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber \"should reformulate its written cultural values because it is vital that they reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.\" It said this should be based on \"values that are more inclusive and contribute to a collaborative environment, including emphasizing teamwork and mutual respect, and incorporating diversity and inclusiveness as a key cultural value, not just as an end in itself, but as a fundamental aspect of doing good business.\" The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination, and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. Uber has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture. It also faces questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/hearing-impaired-uber-driver-beethoven-initiative","title":"Hearing-impaired Uber driver recalls rare instance of discrimination","date":"Oct 13, 2016 8:28 PM PHT","snippet":"With over 1,500 trips under his belt, Mike – one of the drivers under Uber's 'Beethoven Initiative' – recalls the one time a passenger made him feel bad about his disability","body":"MANILA, Philippines – His name is Mike Eballa. He's a \"partner-driver\" for ride-sharing giant Uber. He's been one for 5 months to the day with 1577 trips under his belt and a 4.5/5 rating. Like many other Uber drivers, he believes that the tech company has been of great financial help to him.  There is one thing though that might surprise passengers a bit: He's hearing-impaired. Over the course of 5 months, things have been pretty smooth sailing for the 39-year-old driver – save for one instance.  At a media event held at Uber's office, Thursday, Oct 13, Mike recalled that one time when he was made uncomfortable about his hearing disability. Picking up a group of young individuals in Manila, Mike overheard his passengers snickering about his condition. Mike is hearing-impaired and not completely deaf. He heard the group pointing out the disability in a way that he didn't feel too great about. He kept silent though, and opted not to confront.  Mike is just one of the hearing-impaired Uber drivers in the Philippines now. Uber's \"Beethoven Initiative\" is designed for him and others like him. According to Uber, 6 in every 1,000 households in the Philippines have a household member who is deaf. The condition makes it hard for individuals to find work. In the Philippines, Uber says that 120,000 locals have difficulty finding work because of the disability.   The \"Beethoven Initiative\" is essentially a set of features that make it easier for the driver and the passenger to communicate. These are:  The last item in the list was how Mike's offending passengers found out that he was hard-of-hearing.  Safety concerns Lawrence Cua, Uber's general manager for the Philippines, says that the program is also a directive towards being completely non-discriminatory towards hearing-impaired drivers who want to make a buck on their platform. Cua says they don't discriminate between an individual who's only slightly hearing-impaired and one who's completely deaf.  Cua also acknowledges concerns regarding the safety of espousing such an open platform.  \"Studies have shown all over the world, drivers who are hearing-impaired actually have fewer accidents than regular drivers. That's a statistical fact. They are more attentive, they tend to be more focused on the driving – and that actually leads to safer rides overall,\" Cua said. Cua also presented several references to support his statement: The \"Beethoven Initiative\" features officially rolled out a month ago in the Philippines. In the US, it was first launched in 2015, and is currently available in 400 cities worldwide. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-grab-deal-southeast-asia-operations","title":"Uber selling Southeast Asia operations to Grab – report","date":"Mar 9, 2018 10:19 AM PHT","snippet":"Reports say the deal will also give Uber a 20% to 30% stake in Grab","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber is selling parts of its Southeast Asia operations to local rival Grab, getting a piece of the action in the process, according to US media reports.

Grab, which launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia's rapidly expanding market, which is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore investment firm Temasek.

The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contained no specific pricing or timing for the market debut for Uber, which according to media reports was expected to raise some $10 billion. Uber's valuation in its latest private investment round was more than $70 billion, but reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. The filing noted that Uber offers ridesharing in some 700 cities but has bolder ambitions to reshape how people and goods are transported with operations such as meal deliveries, freight, and electric bikes and scooters. \"Our mission is to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion,\" the document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"We revolutionized personal mobility with ridesharing, and we are leveraging our platform to redefine the massive meal delivery and logistics industries. While we have had unparalleled growth at scale, we are just getting started.\" Uber said it operates on 6 continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totaled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a \"placeholder\" amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. Trouble with Lyft The move comes after a lackluster market debut for Uber's US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 10% of its value since its IPO last month. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over in 2017 as part of an effort to reform a corporate culture marred by misconduct and other scandals, said Uber has taken steps to restore its brand and credibility. \"Taking this step means that we have even greater responsibilities -- to our shareholders our customers and our colleagues,\" Khosrowshahi said in a letter announcing the IPO. Uber and Lyft both are predicting that ride-hailing will gain even more traction with autonomous vehicles, allowing more people to give up private cars and freeing up more urban space. \"We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies will enable a product that competes with the cost of personal vehicle ownership and usage, and represents the future of transportation,\" Uber's filing said. Challenges down the road Uber is the largest of the \"unicorns\" or venture backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the \"sharing economy\" which is based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Analysts have warned that Uber and Lyft face a difficult road to profitability amid challenges from regulators and established taxi operators around the world. Some question the business model of using independent contractors as drivers -- a system which the companies say is more flexible and leads to entrepreneurial spirit. Uber's revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. \"Investors should be ready for a lot of volatility\" in Uber, said Scott Rostan, a former investment banker who is currently an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina. \"In my opinion if you are buying into Uber or Lyft you're buying into a belief this is going to revolutionize transportation in the future. But a good business doesn't necessarily mean a good investment.\" Rostan added that both firms will be seeking to step up growth and that \"i it turns into a market share fight between Uber and Lyft, profitability is going to be tough.\" Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that the ride-hailing firms will face competition from other autonomous driving firms including the former Google car unit Waymo. \"Lyft's IPO was supposed to be a watershed moment for the highly anticipated 2019 tech IPO class,\" Ives said in a research note. \"With Uber, investors will soon have a second option to make a bet on the future of mobility and transportation with the clear market share leader, while competitor focus will likely also zero in on Waymo/Google.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/uber-paperwork-ipo-report","title":"Uber filed paperwork for IPO, says report","date":"Dec 8, 2018 2:28 PM PHT","snippet":"The move, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes a day after Lyft launched the process to take the company public with a stock offering","body":"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Ride-share company Uber quietly filed paperwork this week for its initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday, December 7. The move comes one day after rival Lyft launched the process to take the company public with a stock offering. The Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said that Uber could go public as soon as the first quarter, while Lyft is targeting its market debut for March or April 2019. Uber, which operates in over 60 countries, is in a race with Lyft to be the first to enter the market. Company CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had mentioned since joining Uber in late August 2017 that he was hoping for an IPO in the first half of 2019. Uber is already the largest of the venture-backed \"unicorns\" valued at more than $1 billion, which until recently was considered rare without tapping stock markets. In mid-October, the Journal reported that JPMorgan had been chosen along with Credit Suisse and Jefferies Group for its IPO next year, which could value Uber as high as $120 billion. If its valuation tops $100 billion Uber's IPO would be the biggest ever in the tech sector, and worth more than the combined value of the three big automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. An IPO of such magnitude would especially be a mark of investor confidence for Khosrowshahi, who replaced the controversial Travis Kalanick, pushed out the door by investors anxious over a string of scandals. Khosrowshahi has vowed to fix the company's work culture and business practices after a series of missteps and scandals over executive misconduct, a toxic work atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices.

These statements peppered a pile of massive cardboard boxes that appeared along 5th Avenue, Bonifacio Global City last Friday, November 17. This wasn’t a hugot wall dedicated to unrequited love – these words and emojis were people’s thoughts about traffic in Metro Manila. The sentiment is unanimous – it’s a hassle, a waste of time, and money. “Everyday I commute going to work, and like most people I get bombarded by jeeps here, cars there, taxis everywhere. It takes such a long time to go to work,” said David, 22. Together with his friend, he stayed for a while at the installation to try the cardboard cars similar to those featured in Uber’s film, \"Boxes.\" Boxes depicted the chaos of a city overflowing with boxes – a hilarious yet realistic metaphor for the congestion we experience on our own highways here in Manila.  “Traffic is very time-consuming, especially for us students. Instead of us having the energy to do homework and review when we get home, we feel drained,” says Mae, a 20-year-old who studies at Far Eastern University. According to an independent study commissioned by Uber, Filipinos in Metro Manila spend up to 402 hours every year just stuck in traffic. All that wasted time is equivalent to almost P100,000 lost income. (READ: How much time and money do we waste sitting in traffic and looking for parking?) That’s why others are doing their best to stay optimistic about the situation – and to constantly seek solutions. 26-year-old Franz, who posted his response in Hangul, says that traffic helped him to learn the Korean language. “I stay in traffic a lot so I end up having more time to practice. Instead of channeling your frustration into something negative, you turn it into something positive,” he said. Franz pointed out that improving public transportation is the best way to solve traffic in Metro Manila. But his friend, Michael, added that immediate solutions are just as important. “I would say urban planning (can solve traffic) but that would take a longer time and it's too complex. So the fastest way is to use Uber – ridesharing – for the meantime. And even if urban planning has been improved, I think ridesharing is still a very valuable solution,” Michael said. Athlete Jeron Teng, who also dropped by, agreed that ridesharing services like Uber offer a much better alternative to wasting time on the road. “For an athlete like me, ridesharing is more convenient. Sometimes after practice I would rather relax and share a ride than drive or look for parking,” he said. Aside from sharing their thoughts on traffic, participants in the installation also learned how they can do their part to ease congestion in the city, through ridesharing.

If only we had the luxury of not having bumper-to-bumper traffic and parking issues, then maybe life would be a little less stressful. And perhaps these problems wouldn’t dictate our everyday decisions.  During a recent Twitter conversation on Rappler, we asked how these two problems–traffic and parking–have affected our daily lives and productivity, and what possible solutions can be adapted.  Readers also shared their ‘horror’ stories on how much time they’ve spent on the road and what they wish they could’ve done with that time instead. It’s very true that heavy traffic can take away time from loved ones. Missing birthdays or being late for important family events can be caused by road problems. And there were those who talked about their everyday woes as they go to and from work. Apart from their not so pleasant experiences on the road, people also shared what they think is causing traffic along Metro Manila roads and possible solutions.  Imagine how our roads would be if motorists stayed in their designated lanes, parked in proper parking spaces and followed traffic rules?  You can’t deny that Metro Manila is congested and because there are so many people who need to get around, the volume of vehicles on the roads have increased as well. Would it be possible to solve this with a more efficient public transportation system? How to #UnlockManila? Metro Manila has so much potential to become a great city to live and thrive in. But problems like heavy traffic and lack of parking can impede its growth and development.   That’s why we need to work together to #UnlockManila’s true potential. Available solutions such as ridesharing is a prime example of how people can work together in order to make a difference and be a part of the solution.   Fewer cars on the road and more people sharing rides with one another can bring us one step closer to improving the lives of motorists and commuters alike.   What other solutions come to mind when issues such as traffic and lack of parking are raised? What do you think about ridesharing? Keep the conversation going and share with us your thoughts below. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/softbank-no-final-agreement-uber","title":"Japan's SoftBank: 'No final agreement' on Uber","date":"Nov 14, 2017 2:07 AM PHT","snippet":"The statement comes after Uber said it had entered an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and investment group Dragoneer on what it termed a 'potential investment'","body":"TOKYO, Japan – Japanese tech giant SoftBank Tuesday said there was \"no final agreement\" on an investment in Uber and warned it could pull out of a potential deal if the terms were unsatisfactory. The statement came after Uber said it had entered an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and investment group Dragoneer on what it termed a \"potential investment.\" Uber unveiled the deal after former CEO Travis Kalanick and an influential investor reportedly buried the hatchet after a long feud. But the Japanese firm voiced caution, saying: \"While the SoftBank Group side is considering an investment in Uber, there is no final agreement at this stage. \"If conditions on share price and a minimum of shares are not satisfactory for the SoftBank Group side, there is a possibility the SoftBank Group may not make an investment,\" the statement added. The Japanese group, founded by billionaire tycoon Masayoshi Son, expressed an interest several months ago in investing around $1 billion in Uber for a stake of at least 14%. A deal would be positive for Uber, which is seeking to turn the page after recent repeated scandals, among them workplace sexual harassment allegations. Meanwhile, SoftBank has been diversifying through investment for several years, and has ventured into sectors outside its core mobile technology business – completing deals with the likes of French robotics firm Aldebaran and e-commerce with Chinese giant Alibaba.   It is sending tremors through the tech world with a its massive new Vision Fund – a venture capital fund with $100 billion coffers intended for startups and expected to dominate the industry so thoroughly it is playfully referred to as a \"gorilla\". SoftBank shares were down 0.75% on the news with Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Centre, saying that investors were underwhelmed with the news. \"It's good that SoftBank is always positive towards investing in fast-growing companies. But if you look at its earnings report, net profit was not growing even while operating profit was up,\" Sengoku told AFP.  \"You cannot expect quick returns on your investment when net profit is not growing,\" added the analyst. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/uber-explainer-ltfrb-suspension","title":"WATCH: How Uber got suspended and why it matters","date":"Sep 1, 2017 9:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Who was wrong in the Uber saga?

The LTFRB is an attached agency of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), under the executive branch. President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman said the LTFRB is only doing its job. \"As per LTFRB, Uber systems unduly challenge its rules and instructions. The issue here is striking a balance between innovation and laws, and regulations that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has to implement as part of its administrative function in regulating common carriers,\" said Abella. But Malacañang also acknowledged the \"positive and beneficial services\" provided to commuters by TNCs like Uber. \"We do empathize with the traveling public. It affects everyone, including us sometimes,\" said Abella. Malacañang is leaving it up to the DOTr to resolve the issues between the LTFRB and Uber, but appealed for a solution to be arrived at as soon as possible. \"We wish the LTFRB and Uber situation should be completed as soon as possible, it should be addressed, it should be resolved as soon as possible,\" said Abella. On the position of lawmakers, like Senator Grace Poe, that the LTFRB should have just fined Uber in order to spare the riding public from inconvenience, Abella said the proposal has \"merit\" but stopped there. \"We do need to understand that the one in charge is LTFRB so we go by that,\" he said. Poe, chairperson of the Senate public services committee, had slammed the LTFRB for its \"cruel\" and \"absurd\" decision.

The move sparked online outrage on social media, as well as reactions from senators, who said the commuting public stood to suffer from the \"cruel\" suspension. With the LTFRB's order, commuters using ride-hailing apps are now turning to Uber's main competitor, Grab, whose operations continue despite also being tangled in the regulation issue with the LTFRB. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) But why was Grab not suspended?  Grab's accreditation expired last July and has not been renewed, but Grab has so far complied with the LTFRB's orders to stop accepting and accrediting new drivers – the rule that Uber supposedly violated. Grab also immediately submitted to the LTFRB its masterlist of peer drivers when the government board wanted to set a June 30 cutoff for drivers whose permits would be considered. Uber dilly-dallied, on the the other hand.  Rappler takes a look back at previous orders the LTFRB issued, and how the two TNCs responded to the orders.   July 21, 2016 – Moratorium on processing new driver applications The LTFRB releases Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other TNCs. The order stops the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles. But Grab and Uber would later admit they continued to accept new drivers despite this order, citing strong passenger demand. \"Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers... we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],\" Grab country head Brian Cu would later say.     July 11, 2017, order For defying its order to stop accepting new drivers, the LTFRB imposes a fine of P5 million each on Uber and Grab. Both companies comply with the order.   The LTFRB also orders both companies to remove all drivers with expired or no permits. Grab stops activating new drivers only on July 17, while Uber stops on July 18.   July 26, 2017 order  The LTFRB orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered in their systems after June 30, 2017.  It also orders both companies to provide a master list of all their drivers as of June 30, 2017. At the time of the issuance of the order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says they have only received Grab's list. Uber communications head Cat Avelino says they will submit theirs on July 27.   August 1, 2017 show-cause order On August 1, the LTFRB issues a show-cause order to Uber, after it finds the TNC has continued to accept new drivers into its system despite being ordered to stop doing so last July 26. The board says Uber may lose its accreditation because of its action. Uber's accreditation expires in August, while Grab's expired last July 3 but hasn't been renewed. Uber, however, denies the findings of the LTFRB, saying it has already suspended activations since July 19.    August 14, 2017 suspension order Nearly two weeks after it issued a show-cause order, the LTFRB suspends Uber's operations for one month.  The board cites Uber's post on its Twitter account last August 1, where the company said that applications for vehicles were \"being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.\" \"The Respondent's official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,\" the LTFRB says. Uber posted a clarification on its Twitter account on August 2, saying it was also unable to accept applications for new vehicles. In its order, the LTFRB says Uber has accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27. The suspension order takes effect on Tuesday, August 15. Uber also releases a statement on its suspension of operations starting 6 am. (READ: Uber apologizes to LTFRB for 'misunderstanding') The order affects some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living.  Some 52,000 Grab vehicles remain operational.

We also want the LTFRB to clearly define the 'predatory actions' of Uber which warranted the suspension,\" Villanueva said in a statement. Suspension is too much? Poe said the penalty is not commensurate to the \"administrative\" violation committed by Uber. Instead of suspension, the senator said the LTFRB should have introduced an \"innovative\" solution without harming riders.  \"The issue is not about roadworthiness but one that involves a mere administrative violation. Why can't the LTFRB be innovative in coming up with an appropriate penalty that is fair and that will not prejudice the riding public? Is there no other less crippling penalty at our disposal? Thirty days is a long time,\" Poe said. \"Could not the LTFRB just consider imposing a fine commensurate to whatever violation Uber has committed? Or at worst, just consider suspending the units that the agency said were accredited much later after having determined their identities?\" she added. Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto also thinks imposing a fine or suspending only the units \"with so-called licensing deficiencies\" would have been better. \"If the intent is to punish, then do it in a way that will hurt Uber, the company, and not the tired and harassed riding public,\" he said. \"So instead of suspension, can the penalty be in the form of a fine? If legally feasible, make it in the 7 figures again, as a painful reminder to comply with regulations.\" Recto added: \"Uber can take a hit. A fine in the millions of pesos is more of a pinch for a global conglomerate which grossed $20 billion last year. It is not a big haircut, just the pulling of a few strands.\" While the LTFRB acknowledged the concerns of the riding public, the board said it was confronted with the issue of striking a balance between innovation and laws governing public transport services. (READ: Uber to LTFRB: Don't impose ancient rules on technological innovations) But the LTFRB said Uber's actions were \"not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation, but it is about unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country, thereby compromising sound business practices.\" Aside from imposing the one-month suspension, the LTFRB warned that Uber would be held responsible for all accredited vehicles found accepting passengers during the suspension period. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-driverless-car-service","title":"Uber launches groundbreaking driverless car service","date":"Sep 14, 2016 6:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Four of the Ford Fusion hybrids with their ungainly rooftop load of technology will be deployed to select customers on Wednesday, with the company showing at least a dozen more ready to put on the streets","body":" PITTSBURGH, USA – Uber launched a groundbreaking driverless car service on Wednesday, September 14, jumping ahead of Detroit auto giants and Silicon Valley rivals with technology that could revolutionize transportation.  In an ambitious experiment, a fleet of cars equipped with lasers, cameras and other sensors – but with no one's hands on the wheel – were to be deployed by the web-based ride service on the challenging roads of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, steering themselves to pick up regular Uber passengers who are used to being fetched by cars driven by humans. Four of the Ford Fusion hybrids with their ungainly rooftop load of technology will be deployed to select customers on Wednesday, with the company showing at least a dozen more ready to put on the streets. The cars and their supporting technology have been trained on the city's complicated grid for less than two years, but demonstration rides ahead of the launch showed them very able to handle most situations -- as able as many drivers. Still, the first riders will be joined by two company technicians to make sure everything goes right, one sitting behind the wheel, with hands at the ready to take over in sticky spots, while the other monitors the car's behavior. The move has put Uber ahead of the rest of the auto industry in getting such cars out for the general public. The major automakers all have driverless car development programs, as do tech giants Alphabet (Google) and Apple.  What allowed Uber to get to the front of the pack was not auto engineering but rather its ability to accumulate and crunch massive amounts of data on road and driving conditions collected from the billions of miles driven by Uber drivers. \"We have one of the strongest self-driving engineering groups in the world, as well as the experience that comes from running a ridesharing and delivery network in hundreds of cities,\" said Uber founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick in a blog post Wednesday. The introduction of driverless cars challenges Uber's image as an app-based service of the \"gig economy\" that gave millions of car owners around the world the chance to make money ferrying passengers without taxicab licenses or other permits.  Uber's vision now suggests a world of taxis on call by app with no drivers at all.  \"Self-driving is core to Uber's mission,\" Anthony Levandowski, Uber's vice president of engineering, said. That would be far away, Uber officials stress. Kalanick says the main aim is to create safer roads.  \"Self-driving Ubers have enormous potential to further our mission and improve society: reducing the number of traffic accidents, which today kill 1.3 million people a year; freeing up the 20 percent of space in cities currently used to park the world's billion plus cars; and cutting congestion, which wastes trillions of hours every year,\" he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/paymaya-uber-uncarded-commuters","title":"'Uncarded' commuters can now use PayMaya for Uber rides","date":"Jun 14, 2016 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'Today, PayMaya has once again changed the game for digital payments by pioneering a unique partnership with Uber,' PayMaya Philippines president and CEO Orlando Vea says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – PayMaya Philippines, the digital financial services unit of PLDT Incorporated and Smart Communications Incorporated, has partnered with Uber Technologies Incorporated to give \"uncarded\" commuters a cashless payment option for their Uber rides.

The carpooling function will match passengers in the same area traveling in the same direction, enabling them to split the fare by sharing the car.

Pendapat saya ini juga diamini oleh banyak orang. Perubahan yang begitu drastis dari logo sebelumnya. Logo ini terlihat membingungkan, lebih mirip huruf O ketimbang huruf U. Desain latar belakangnya yang bergaris-garis terlihat “jadul” dan terkesan dibuat oleh amatir. Namun, sepertinya lama-lama saya akan terbiasa. Sama halnya seperti orang-orang yang sudah terbiasa dengan rebranding yang dilakukan Airbnb. Kamu ingat meme sindiran terhadap logo baru Airbnb? Dimana dalam meme tersebut logo ini dihubung-hubungkan dengan alat kelamin wanita? Berikut meme tersebut: Mengerikan, bukan? Tidak juga. Semakin orang melihatnya, semakin mereka terbiasa dengan logo tersebut. Mereka melupakan meme tersebut. Bisnis Airbnb tidak hancur karenanya. Dan saya yakin hal yang sama akan terjadi pada logo UBER. Badai pasti berlalu. Kesalahpahaman besar yang terjadi di sini. Logo yang diperdebatkan oleh orang-orang bukanlah logo asli UBER. Itu logo aplikasi mereka. Logo asli UBER tak banyak berubah. Bahkan kini lebih mudah dibaca: UBER juga berjanji akan menghadirkan tema-tema aplikasi yang unik, tergantung negara di mana aplikasi itu berada. Saya tak sabar menantinya. Kita cenderung terlalu tergesa-gesa menghakimi usaha rebranding hanya dari pemberitaan awalnya saja, dan seakan lupa bahwa UBER telah mempertimbangkan banyak hal sebelum membuat logo tersebut. Seperti yang dijelaskan oleh CEO UBER, Travis Kalanick, dalam blog resmi perusahaan ini: \"Salah satu perubahan besar kami dalam beberapa tahun terakhir ini adalah UBER tak hanya mengantarkan orang-orang; kami juga mengantarkan makanan, barang, dan mungkin lebih banyak hal lainnya di masa depan.  Karena mungkin akan terbagi menjadi beberapa aplikasi dengan logo yang berbeda-beda, kami perlu suatu pendekatan untuk menghubungkan semuanya. Logo ini adalah kerangka yang akan mempermudah kami jika sewaktu-waktu ingin mengembangkan logo yang berbeda untuk produk baru.\" Jadi UBER akan bersikap bijaksana untuk tidak terlalu menghiraukan kemarahan orang-orang terhadap desain baru mereka. Satu lagi pelajaran yang bisa kamu ambil dalam menjalankan suatu perusahaan: Ya, sudah sepatutnya kamu mempertimbangkan saran atau masukan dari pelanggan, meski terkadang sebuah desain atau keputusan bisnis yang kamu buat akan menuai pro dan kontra. Namun, sudah menjadi tugas kamu untuk memilih mana yang terbaik bagi perusahaan kamu. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia.

Ride-sharing services are always going to be upper- and middle-class-only solutions in the developing world, in the same way that Starbucks is a luxury available only to the top two brackets of our population. The people who can afford to spend 300 pesos a day on transportation tend to come from the same 3–5% of the population who are most likely to have credit cards and mobile data plans. No one in the C, D, and E economic brackets can afford to spend over 30% of their household income on transportation  – that’s over 90% of the country. The effect of this economic gap is interesting when you compare it to the ride-sharing situation in San Francisco. According to my ride history, I took over 3 dozen Ubers while visiting the Bay Area, and in most cases, the driver owned their vehicle. In the Philippines, the majority of Uber and GrabCar drivers are employees of the car’s owners, many of whom are subject to the same “boundary” agreements as regular taxi drivers. One of my recent GrabCar drivers related a very familiar set of daily requirements from his employer: Once the car had accrued 2,500 pesos in earnings for the day, the driver would earn 90 pesos for each booking above that. In practice, he would make about 500–800 pesos per day over a 10-hour, 18-trip shift. If the 2500-peso minimum isn’t reached however, the driver makes nothing. As the government-imposed deadline for Uber’s licensing in the Philippines looms, my transportation situation and the livelihoods of thousands of car owners and drivers hang in the balance. On August 11, the LTFRB has declared that all Uber and GrabCar cars will be apprehended on the road if the service and the operators aren’t properly licensed. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) I am reminded of the oft-repeated joke that “licensing” is what it’s called when a government “takes away your right to do something and then sells it back to you.” Admittedly it’s a reductive way to look at the situation, but it’s hard to beat such a colourful soundbite. Under the new licensing plan, platforms like Uber and GrabCar will need to apply to be Transport Network Companies (TNCs), and their individual vehicle operators will have to apply to be franchisees. Both the networks and the individual operators will need to register their businesses with the BIR. Accompanying these announcements was some rhetoric about the government’s continued commitment to public commuter safety, buses-falling-off-skyways and MRTs-crashing-through-barriers notwithstanding. (READ: LTFRB to Uber: No one is above the law)  Uber’s legal status has been questioned a number of times in the 59 countries it currently operates in. In May 2015, Italy banned the UberPop service as being “unfairly competitive.” In June 2015, police arrested the Uber country directors for France and charged them with “enabling taxi-driving by nonprofessional drivers, among other crimes of entrepreneurship.” The $50B company seems more than capable of defending itself however, as their recent campaign and resulting victory against New York Mayor Bill de Blasio indicates. On the west coast, meanwhile, there’s an ongoing debate about whether Uber drivers are in fact employees of the company and thus entitled to health insurance and other benefits. To your average Filipino, the notion seems almost quaint — the regular taxi fleet operators here aren’t exactly renowned for giving their drivers any employee benefits. At the heart of all this is the notion that traditional industry is being disrupted by technology, and regulation is racing to keep up with innovation. The same thing happened to information and entertainment in the late 90's and early 2000’s respectively, and is currently happening in the finance sector with the cryptocurrency revolution. There’s no question that ride-sharing solutions are providing compelling alternatives that are both environmentally-friendly and cost-effective, and it’s not clear whether these additional licensing requirements will make our respective Uber or GrabCar rides any safer than they already are.

Operators of Uber, and competitor GrabCar will be apprehended starting Friday, August 21, if they are unable to secure the necessary franchise or provisional authority from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), chairman Winston Ginez said in a text message on Tuesday, August 11. It was in October 2014 when LTFRB stopped apprehending unregistered online ride-sharing providers, following an outcry from commuters. This paved the way for the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and LTFRB to create new transport categories, legalizing the new public utility vehicle (PUV) players. Accreditation issues In May this year, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. But after 3 months since its implementation, there are still TNVS operators who have not applied for TNVS accreditation. Despite their non-compliance with the regulations, the private vehicles accredited by Uber and GrabCar are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise, the LTFRB chairman said. “Though the regulations were issued in May, only GrabCar applied for accreditation as of today. But despite its accreditation as a transportation network company (TNC), GrabCar's partner vehicles are yet to apply for franchise with LTFRB,” Ginez said. Individual GrabCar operators will have until August 20 to apply for TNVS franchises and continue their operations. Starting August 21, the LTFRB said it will start apprehending unregistered TNCs and TNVS operators.

The ruling has been appealed in court and would only impact Uber drivers in California. But if the case ends up applying to Uber's global operations, it could potentially take away one of the underpinnings of its business model, which considers drivers independent contractors. The commission's order was included in the appeal filed by Uber in California Superior Court in San Francisco. State hearing officer Stephanie Barrett wrote that while Uber claims to be a \"neutral technological platform\" for independent drivers, it sets most of the terms of employment. Uber and its management team \"are involved in every aspect of the operation\" including vetting prospective drivers and terminating them if their rating levels are low, the hearing officer wrote. Because of this, Barrett wrote, Uber must \"indemnify an employee for all that the employee necessarily expends in the discharge of the employee's duties.\" Berwick had requested the reimbursement of tolls and others expenses incurred while driving. But if all drivers are classified as employees, it could require Uber to pay hefty amounts for social security, workers' compensation and other charges.

The head of the kingdom's Department of Land Transport said it has banned Uber's use of unlicensed \"black plate\" vehicles, which link customers with private drivers, citing safety concerns and a lack of regulation. \"We are not banning the use of the Uber application, but we are banning the use of black plate vehicles, because they are illegal,\" Teerapong Rodpraert, Director-General of Land Transport Department told AFP. \"We have held talks with Uber twice including yesterday (Tuesday). We must consider passenger safety because the taxi driver must have a public driving licence and a criminal records check with our department,\" he said. In Thailand, black plates are meant to be used for private vehicles but Uber's application has allowed individual fare-paying customers to connect with a registered private driver under their \"UberX\" brand.  A slightly more expensive option allows users to locate cars with green plates, which are used by taxi and limousine services and driven by people with licences to take passengers.  The ban does not apply to licensed cars, Teerapong said.  UberX is a significant part of the firm's Thailand business – although the company would not be drawn on how much of its revenues come from regulated journeys. Nonetheless the Uber smartphone app was still taking bookings for both green and black plate cars in Bangkok on Wednesday.  Uber is as adored by start-up watchers for its stellar rise as it is loathed by the established taxi industry for undercutting prices.

The company, which has 3.5 million customers and 45,000 drivers in the British capital, has now overturned Transport for London's (TfL) refusal to renew its operating license around the issue of unauthorized drivers. The San Francisco-based firm was permitted to continue operating in London during the appeal process. Despite pointing to Uber's \"historical failings,\" judge Tan Ikram on Monday said Uber was \"a fit and proper person\" to hold a private hire vehicle operator's license in the capital. He noted that Uber had sought to explain how breaches had taken place and how they would be remedied. Jamie Heywood, Uber's general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said Monday's decision was a recognition of the company's \"commitment to safety.\" Heywood admitted that Uber's behavior over the problem of unauthorized drivers had been wrong. \"It was not what we would do now. It was inadequate, we could have done better,\" he said. TfL, which is chaired by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, acknowledged on Monday that Uber had implemented a number of changes to improve passenger safety. \"Public safety is paramount, so TfL was absolutely right not to renew Uber's license last November after identifying failures that directly put passengers in danger,\" said Khan in response to the news. \"I am pleased that Uber have admitted that their response to very real concerns about passenger safety was inadequate, and since then Uber has made improvements. \"I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers.\" The transport authority had argued in November that some Uber trips across London had taken place with unlicensed, suspended, or dismissed drivers. And it contended that there was a \"pattern of failures,\" including the use of unauthorized drivers on other Uber drivers' accounts, allowing them to pick up passengers. In court, the judge said Uber had tightened up review processes over issues of document and insurance fraud. \"Uber does not have a perfect record, but it has been an improving picture,\" Ikram added. \"The test as to whether Uber are a 'fit and proper person' does not require perfection. \"I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,\" the judge said. Uber's London operation has suffered previous license suspensions in addition to protests from the capital's traditional black cab drivers. Monday's decision was meanwhile slammed by an industry group representing those black cab drivers. \"The judge himself has recognized that Uber has more to do, noting that [Uber] is 'not perfect' but 'improving' and has 'reduced incidents,'\" the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said in a statement. \"He is playing Russian roulette with the safety of Londoners and I fear it's only a matter of time until the next incident.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-volvo-xc90-prototype-drone-delivery","title":"Uber eyes drones for food delivery, unveils new autonomous car","date":"Jun 13, 2019 11:50 AM PHT","snippet":"The Volvo XC90 prototype will be 'capable of fully driving itself,' according to an Uber statement","body":" WASHINGTON, USA – Uber said Wednesday it plans to speed up restaurant meal delivery by using drones for its Uber Eats service, in the latest effort by the ride-hailing giant to disrupt the transport sector. At its Uber Elevate Summit, the company said it had regulatory approval to begin tests of delivering food by drone in the region of San Diego, California. \"Our goal is to expand Uber Eats drone delivery so we can provide more options to more people at the tap of a button,\" said Luke Fischer, head of flight operations at Uber Elevate. \"We believe that Uber is uniquely positioned to take on this challenge as we're able to leverage the Uber Eats network of restaurant partners and delivery partners as well as the aviation experience and technology of Uber Elevate.\" For logistical reasons, the drones will not deliver directly to customers, but to a safe drop-off location where an Uber Eats driver will complete the order. In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States. Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald's, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. The drone service is part of Uber's move to the skies as it seeks to develop an aerial ride-sharing network tied in with its smartphone app to help people avoid traffic congestion on the ground. Uber said the drone service will provide data that will help manage its air network, and eventually allow the aircraft to operate autonomously. New autonomous car Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars. The Volvo XC90 prototype will be \"capable of fully driving itself,\" according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. \"Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,\" said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, to produce \"tens of thousands\" of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. Volvo said it will use a similar autonomous base for the introduction of its first commercially available autonomous drive technology in the early 2020s. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some \"easy\" trips may be made autonomously. Uber also unveiled the latest versions of its electric bikes and scooters that round out its shared transportation system. – Rappler.com Have your food delivered using this foodpanda voucher code to get P200 off your meal."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/when-uber-shuts-down-not-all-drivers","title":"Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us","date":"Mar 28, 2018 9:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Because of sheer volume, not all former Uber drivers will be onboarded by Grab on April 8","body":"In a press briefing on Wednesday, March 28, Grab Philippines Head Brian Cu said that they have started the so-called onboarding process of Uber drivers since Monday, March 26.

Meanwhile, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada assured the commuting public  that fares will not be raised with Grab’s acquisition of Uber. “Grab cannot increase its fare on its own. We know their range. We monitor them. Any request for fare hike goes through a hearing, where commuter side is heard, where NEDA (National Economic Development Authority) helps us. Grab knows how serious we are with violations as we fined Uber before,” Lizada said on Wednesday. Cu added that the increase in Grab's available drivers will also mean demand will be met better. “With the increased supply base, it’s easier to allocate, meaning surge will not be as frequent as it used to be,” he said. Although fares right now may not increase given the merger, Grab Philippines and Uber earlier submitted petitions to increase fares due to the tax reform law. The hearing is set on April 3. Only option Lizada also said that Grab will not monopolize the transport network vehicle services industry. She said that other potential transport network companies have submitted applications to the LTFRB before but they are just waiting for them to complete their documents. “If you say that there is no competition, soon there will be. Owto, Lag go, and Hype had applied to be TNCs,” she said. Once all requirements have been submitted, Lizada said the regulatory board will deliberate if they will be accepted. Confusing Many Uber drivers were confused by the situation.   At Grab’s onboarding site in Quezon City, Ruggo Rivero and Olga Diaz said they only found out that the Uber app will shut down on Monday. “It was very confusing for us. We only knew about it two days ago. As partners, we would have appreciated if we knew about this earlier given that Uber has not been meeting its target profits,” Rivero said in a mix of English and Filipino. With limited time in their hands, Rivero said he had to give up a day of driving just to finally process his papers. “I could’ve driven now as surge pricing is higher but here I am now.” However, Rivero sees a light at the end of the tunnel with better income coming from his driving. “Well, I guess I’ll be earning more with Grab than with Uber. Olga earns more than I do [when she drives for Grab]. But at the end of the day, for us it’s all about service,” he said. On Monday, March 26, Uber announced that it decided to sell its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab.

The company has 21 days to appeal and will be allowed to operate until those 21 days are over.  The report said that the company's renewal application was rejected because “Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility” in terms of reporting serious criminal offenses, securing medical certificates and doing background checks – incidents that Uber has historically gotten in trouble for.  Another reason cited by London's transport authority is the ride-hailing company's use of Greyball, a controversial software used by Uber to evade authorities and regulatory bodies.  London Mayor was quoted  by The Guardian as saying that all companies needed to \"play by the rules.\" In the Philippines, the company clashed with the LTFRB, and was subsequently slapped with a month-long suspension that was lifted with a P10-million fine.

Langkah ini seperti yang telah Uber lakukan untuk layanan UberPOOL .  Sebelumnya, pengguna UberMotor membayar biaya layanan setelah perjalanan selesai. Kini, pengguna bisa melihat biaya perjalanan sebelum bepergian. Cara pembayaran baru ini serupa dengan yang dilakukan Grab dan Go-Jek. Dengan memberikan biaya di muka, Uber telah memperhitungkan seluruh faktor yang mempengaruhi biaya perjalanan, seperti biaya dasar, biaya jarak per kilometer, biaya per menit, termasuk biaya tambahan saat banyak permintaan (surge/dynamic pricing). Sebelumnya, perhitungan dynamic pricing dilakukan saat perjalanan. Dengan adanya skema baru ini, Uber akan menginformasikannya sebelum perjalanan dimulai. Dengan kata lain, pengguna punya “kuasa” untuk menyetujui atau menolak total biaya tersebut. Perubahan perhitungan ini tentu beralasan. Melalui siaran pers, UberMotor menyatakan ingin memberikan kejelasan harga yang akan dibayar pengguna.  Misalnya, informasi biaya perjalanan Rp10.800 akan lebih jelas bagi pengguna ketimbang informasi bahwa “tengah berlaku harga ramai 1,5x lipat”. Berlakunya perhitungan baru ini akan menghilangkan tanda petir sebagai ikon berlakunya dynamic pricing. Pengguna pun bisa mendapat kejelasan harga tanpa perhitungan rumit dan biaya yang “membengkak” . Ubah tujuan di tengah perjalanan Selain itu, kamu juga bisa mengubah tujuan dan menambah beberapa lokasi perhentian saat tengah melakukan perjalanan dengan UberMotor.  Fitur ini yang jadi pembeda layanan UberMotor dari dua kompetitornya.  Namun, perubahan ini juga akan berdampak ke total biaya yang akan dikenakan ke pengguna. Saat kamu mengubah tujuan atau menambah titik perhentian, perhitungan biaya yang dilakukan diawal tidak akan berlaku lagi. Sebagai ilustrasi, kamu memesan UberMotor dari Grogol menuju Cawang. UberMotor akan memberikan harga di muka kepada kamu. Kamu pun menyetujuinya dan akhirnya melakukan perjalanan dengan layanan UberMotor. Namun, saat sampai di Semanggi, kamu ingin mengubah tujuan ke Cikini. Kamu pun masuk ke aplikasi dan mengubah tujuan akhir menuju Cikini. Uber akan menghitung ulang perjalanan kamu. Perhitungan diulang dari titik awal pemesanan ke titik tujuan yang baru, yaitu dari Grogol menuju Cikini, bukan Cawang.  Perhitungan harga dari Grogol-Cawang pun akan terhapus. Perhitungan ini dilakukan berdasarkan jarak (per kilometer) dan waktu (per menit) ditambah harga ramai (dynamic price) jika permintaan sedang tinggi. Selain perubahan cara pembayaran, UberMotor juga menerapkan skema pembayaran baru dengan tarif minimal Rp5.000. Sebelumnya, tarif minimal Uber adalah Rp1.000.  Perhitungan biaya lainnya adalah Rp 1.000 untuk biaya per kilometer, Rp100 untuk biaya per menit, dan Rp5.000 untuk biaya pembatalan. Soal perhitungan biaya di muka, UberMotor memang mengekor dua pesaingnya. Namun, di sisi lain, ia pun memberikan keunggulan lain lewat fitur perubahan tujuan yang tidak dimiliki kompetitornya.  Menarik untuk disimak apakah Grab dan Go-Jek bakal mengambil langkah serupa. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/uberdua-dua-tahun-pencapaian-uber-indonesia","title":"Uberdua, merayakan dua tahun pencapaian Uber di Indonesia","date":"Sep 30, 2016 5:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Apresiasi Uber kepada para pengguna dan mitra-pengemudi di hari jadinya","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Terlepas dari kontroversi taksi online yang masih marak berkembang, Uber Indonesia baru saja merayakan hari jadinya yang kedua.

In exchange for the Uber China assets, Uber and its Chinese partners will receive shares equivalent to 20% of Didi Chuxing, a statement said. The combined Chinese firm will be valued at $35 billion, Bloomberg News reported. Since Uber launched its China operations little more than two years ago both companies have spent billions of dollars on subsidies for drivers and passengers in China, as well as trading vitriolic accusations, as they fought for dominance in the potentially lucrative market. But now the companies' founders will swap public acrimony for seats on each other's boards, with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick joining Didi's board of directors, and Didi's founder Cheng Wei getting a seat at Uber's top table. In the Didi statement Cheng said the two firms \"have learned a great deal from each other over the past two years in China's burgeoning new economy.\" Earlier this year Uber said it lost $1 billion annually in China, and Didi was thought to be dropping similar amounts of money. A lengthy post on Kalanick's verified Facebook page Monday called Uber's battle in China a \"big, bold idea\" and \"one of the most rewarding experiences I've had as an entrepreneur.\" \"Most people thought we were naive, crazy – or both\" because the firm was \"a young American business entering a country where most US internet companies had failed to crack the code,\" he said. His at times elegiac farewell praised the company's China team as \"the smartest and most entrepreneurial sons and daughters of China\" who were \"nobly serving\" China's cities. But he went on: \"As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as much as following your heart.\" A sustainable business was \"only possible with profitability,\" he said, and the merger would free up \"substantial resources,\" while Uber will become Didi's largest shareholder. He signed off the post \"with much UberChina love.\" The deal comes days after Chinese authorities announced new rules governing ride-sharing, making clear for the first time that they may operate legally in the country. The new rules will also forbid ride-sharing platforms from operating below cost, possibly restricting their scope to offer subsidies. Rides in major cities with Uber and Didi have often cost significantly less than regular cab fares due to the payments, and many drivers work for both companies at the same time. One user on China's Twitter-like Weibo service lamented the merger, saying: \"This is meant to tell us that ride-sharing is now legal and we are going to raise the price.\" One Didi driver was reluctant to believe the merger Monday. \"If it is true, the allowance offered by Didi or Uber now will certainly decrease.\" the man, surnamed Su, told AFP. Monopoly murmurs Didi, which claims almost 90% of the China ride-hailing market, said last month that it had recently raised $7.3 billion – $1 billion of which came from Apple – in one of the world's largest private equity financing rounds. As part of the merger, Didi Chuxing will also take a stake in Uber, with reports saying it will invest $1 billion, valuing the US firm at $68 billion. Uber has become one of the world's most valuable startups as it has expanded to more than 50 countries. But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Its China business partners include internet search giant Baidu and state-owned Citic Securities. Didi's backers include e-commerce titans Alibaba and Tencent, along with China Life, the country's biggest life insurer. Analysts noted that the deal would create a massive single company with near-monopoly power in China. Commentaters on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform called for an anti-trust investigation into the tie-up. \"Come and suck the Chinese people's blood together!\" wrote one user. Others saw it as a capitulation by Uber in the face of an overwhelming local rival. \"Uber knows when to fold them in China, after being engaged in an incredibly expensive ride war with Didi there,\" technology journalist Kara Swisher wrote on her recode.net site. \"Cutting the massive losses in China and turning it into a more solid investment\" would clear the way for an expected Uber public stock offering next year, she added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/johnoy-danao-uber-driver-experience","title":"WATCH: Musician Johnoy Danao talks about his Uber-driving experience","date":"Jan 14, 2016 12:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Singer-songwriter Johnoy Danao recounts his 3-month stint as an Uber driver","body":"  MANILA, Philippines – Many live music fans are accustomed to seeing folk singer-songwriter Johnoy Danao in gigs in and out of the metro – he's a very well-known figure in the performing circuit.

Danao's stint with Uber was short-lived because the demands of driving and performing took their toll on him. However, his experience allowed him to examine – and understand – the odd, yet varying dynamics between driver and passenger. It is entertaining and awkward at the same time, he says, because there are days when he gets recognized, and there are others when he is virtually invisible. \"When you're a driver, parang you don't exist sa passengers,\" he says. \"Kahit anong pinag-uusapan nila, hindi nila sine-censor, over the phone.

Erdogan's comments, in a late night speech on Friday, June 1, in Istanbul, came after the government agreed new rules that are expected to severely complicate Uber's operations in Turkey. Drivers of Istanbul's yellow taxis have over the last months waged an intense campaign to have Uber banned, saying the company is eating into their business without having a proper legal basis for work. \"This thing emerged called Uber or Muber or whatever,\" said Erdogan. \"But this issue is now finished. It's over now.\" \"Our Prime Minister (Binali Yildirim) made the announcement. We have our system of taxis,\" he added. Yildirim's government last month issued a directive sharply hiking fines and threatened blacklisting for companies whose vehicles illegally work as taxis. The official taxi drivers association said at the time the measure would be a major threat to Uber, if it was properly enforced by the traffic police. Erdogan said that while Uber may be popular in some European countries, Turkey was different. \"Why did it (Uber) emerge? Because it was in Europe. But what is Europe to me? We will take the decision ourselves.\" His comments come 3 weeks ahead of keenly-contested presidential and parliamentary elections. Many Istanbul taxi drivers – though not all – are strong Erdogan supporters and the main taxi associations back him. The 17,400 official yellow taxis in Istanbul are a pillar of the city's often patchy transport system, but critics say that poor quality service and overcharging have given Uber an opportunity. The yellow taxi drivers, on the other hand, slam Uber as \"pirates\" who are swallowing their incomes in an already tight market. Uber has said it is committed to working in Turkey and insisted it is operating within the law. \"We want to work in cooperation with all the relevant stakeholders to improve transportation options in Turkey and we are committed long-term to Turkey, to the end, as a loyal partner,\" it said in a rare Turkish statement this week.

It's about 'Uber-ising' currency, about not having a central bank that decides the price,\" said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at credit insurer Euler Hermes, referring to Uber, the ride-hailing app that has set the cat among the pigeons in the taxi sector in recent years. \"Yes, it's exactly that: it bypasses a central regulatory authority. That's the genius of this invention,\" agreed Yves Choueifaty, founder of the Paris-based asset management firm Tobam, which this week launched the first European fund investing in bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not regulated, but is traded on specialist platforms. It has no legal exchange rate and no central bank backing it. Launched in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software written by someone using the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is controlled and regulated by its community of users.  Investors are already referring to it as \"digital gold\", as the bitcoin soared to a new record high of more than $8,000 this week, a staggering rise in value from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year.  \"We have no need for central banks,\" said Yves Choueifaty, suggesting that institutional investors may be behind the recent sharp gains, even if insisted that there was \"no bitcoin bubble.\"  The growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention: the CME Group of Chicago, one of the world's biggest exchanges, has decided to launch a bitcoin futures marketplace. And prestigious US universities are offering courses in blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrencies are based.  'Dollarization 2.0' Virtual currencies could also prove attractive to economic players in countries such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, whose fiat currencies have been ravaged hyper-inflation. Caracas, for example, has had to issued a new 100,000-bolivar bill, when just a year ago, the biggest-denomination banknote was 100 bolivars.  \"Think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country – such as the US dollar – some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0,\" said the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, recently. Economists also suggest the bitcoin could be of interest to developing countries where individuals often find it easier to access the internet than traditional bank accounts.  Nevertheless, central banks and the big financial institutions are concerned that virtual currencies can be used for illicit purposes and are highly speculative by nature.  \"It's the exact definition of a bubble,\" the head of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, warned recently in comments that immediately sparked an uproar on social media among bitcoin's supporters.  The head of the French central bank or Banque de France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, warned in the summer: \"People are using the bitcoin today are clearly doing it at their own risk and at their own peril.\"  'No intrinsic value' Nobel laureate, Jean Tirole, also insisted that the current bitcoin boom was a \"bubble\".  \"It's something that has no intrinsic value,\" he told Agence France-Presse on the sidelines of a conference in Paris this week.  \"It could collapse from one day to the next. I would be completely against French banks, for example, investing in bitcoin.\"  Euler Hermes economist Subran called on the financial authorities to make potential investors more aware of the risks.  \"There's a lot of money to be made. And a lot of money to be lost,\" he said.  \"We're seeing more and more people wanting to venture there, but they're not fully aware of the risk.\"  Bitcoin has regularly suffered abrupt falls, for example, in cases of friction between the members of the community who oversee it and the members who produce it, when the regulatory authorities issue any warnings, or if there are data hacks.  But more often than not, bitcoin quickly makes up any losses and some investors are predicting it will soon top the $10,000 level. Back in 2011, it had struggled to pass $1. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/travis-kalanick-resigns-uber-ceo","title":"Travis Kalanick resigns as Uber CEO","date":"Jun 21, 2017 1:54 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick steps down as chief executive of the company after pressure from investors amid controversies","body":"MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick has stepped down as chief executive officer of the pioneering ride-hailing service, as the company reels from legal woes and controversies over its company culture. Kalanick's resignation on Tuesday, June 20, was triggered by after pressure from the company's top investors, the New York Times reported Wednesday, June 21. This was later confirmed by Uber to multiple US news outlets. The investors, the report said, made the demand to Kalanick in a letter entitled \"Moving Uber Forward,\" which said the company must have a leadership change and that he leave. \"I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,\" Kalanick said in a statement to the Times. The Uber board, meanwhile, said in a statement to the paper that Kalanick made a \"bold decision\" signifying his \"devotion and love for Uber.\" \"By stepping away, he's taking the time to heal from his personal tragedy while giving the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history,\" referencing the recent death of his mother in a boating accident last May. He will still remain part of the company's board of directors, the report added. He had earlier announced on June 13 that he will be taking an indefinite leave of absence, as the tech company is embroiled in a series of controversies over its leadership and company culture. Uber, which is the world's richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination. It also faces questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Earlier this month the group, based in San Francisco, parted ways with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had reportedly been linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. A week earlier Uber said it had fired 20 people after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior and bullying. Uber also this month released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses. The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber \"should reformulate its written cultural values\" to \"reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors\". – with reports from Agence France-Presse / Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/uber-luncurkan-layanan-ojek-online","title":"Uber luncurkan layanan ojek online","date":"Apr 13, 2016 8:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Tarif dasar uberMOTOR Rp 1.000 per kilo meter dan Rp 100 per menit","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Penyedia jasa transportasi online, Uber, kini memiliki variasi layanan baru.

In a Facebook post making the rounds online, Deakin said LTFRB and DOTC \"are starting their own service called premium taxi, which is just another racket and another inept way of reinventing the wheel!\"  And now the truth comes out. No wonder the LTFRB and DOTC are so unreasonably hard on Uber. They are starting their own... Posted by James Deakin on Wednesday, 12 August 2015 LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez replied on his Facebook page, clarifying Deakin's allegation which sparked intense online exchanges. Below is LTFRB's unedited reply: On May 8, 2015, the Department of Transportation and Communications ((DOTC) Issued Department Order No. 2015-11 creating new modes of transportation vehicles such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Airport Bus, Transport Network Vehicle Service (e.g., Uber and GrabCar) and Premium Taxi. The purpose of said policy issuance is to improve mobility of our people and provide high quality transportation services to our commuting public.  Pursuant to the DO, LTFRB held on July 24, 2015 a consultation among PUV operators, primarily taxi operators, regarding its draft Memorandum Circular to implement the roll out of Premium Taxi. The Notice of Public Consultation and the operating conditions for a Premium Taxi was published in major newspaper of general circulation, posted in LTFRB website and LTFRB Citizen Enforcer account in Facebook.  The allegation that Premium Taxi was created to compete with Uber and GrabCar is without basis in fact and in law. Premium taxis are of higher end since only sedans with engine displacement of 2.0 or higher will be accepted. No SUVs, AUVs and vans will be accepted. Thus, the cars that are acceptable are Toyota Altis 2.0, Toyota Camry, Benz, and the like. Notably, our neighbor Asean cities such as Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur and Singapore have Premium Taxis many years ago. It is high time that we offer the same kind of high quality and modern taxis to our people.  Unlike Uber and GrabCar, premium taxis are marked vehicles with common color (black), will sport YELLOW plates (unlike Uber and GrabCar, etc). Other operating conditions of Premium Taxi include: (1) a qualified operator is required to have minimum of 25 units each to ensure that only financially capable operators will be granted franchise; (2) they have taxi meters; (3) they have top lights identifying them as Premium Taxis; and (4) they can pick and drop passengers through street hail unlike Uber and GrabCar that can only be booked through online application. The goal of rolling out Premium Taxi is to provide alternative taxi transport to more discerning and higher end taxi passengers who are willing and ready to pay higher fare for better service. The target clientele of Premium Taxi are domestic and international tourists, professionals, millennials, and the like. The application for Premium Taxi under the draft MC will be open and transparent as it will undergo three stages: pre-qualification (legal, technical and financial), selection and application for franchise.  DOTC and LTFRB, in apprehending UNREGISTERED Uber and GrabCar vehicles, DO NOT and WILL NOT put Uber or GrabCar out of business. We just want them to apply for and be granted with franchise by complying with the Dept Order and MCs that were issued three (3) months ago. It is worthy to mention that after DOTC and LTFRB issued the governing rules for Uber and GrabCar to operate legally in the Philippines, Uber hailed the Philippines as a tech-forward country.  While in other countries Uber is either fighting government regulators or its drivers being apprehended and fined heavily by police authorities, the Philippines, through DOTC and LTFRB, was the first country in the world to issue comprehensive regulations to make its operations compliant with our public service laws. This was despite the lobbying of taxi operators for DOTC and LTFRB not to allow the operations of Uber and GrabCar in the Philippines. In fact, Uber urged other countries, such as Thailand, to use the Philippine regulation as basis of their own regulation of TNCs and TNVS. (Philippine regulation on TNCs to be used as a basis in Thailand.  Yet, despite that the Philippine regulations became effective on May 30, 2015 or more than two (2) months ago, Uber has not yet applied for accreditation. Its partner vehicles continue to ply our streets and engage in public land transportation without the requisite franchise. Though DOTC officials reached out to Uber officials urging them to comply with the registration regulations, Uber just kept on promising that it will file its application. Thus, in fulfillment of our sworn duty to implement our public land transportation law, DOTC and LTFRB gave Uber and its partner vehicles and the partner vehicles of GrabCar (which is LTFRB accredited already) until August 20 to apply for and be granted a franchise.  To paraphrase former Mayor Fred Lim, the law should apply to all or to no one at all. Simply put, no one is above the law. The Philippine government ordered a nationwide clampdown on unregistered online ride-sharing service providers like Uber, after licensed regular taxi operators protested unfair competition. Operators of Uber, and competitor GrabCar will be apprehended starting Friday, August 21, if they are unable to secure the necessary franchise or provisional authority from the LTFRB.  In October 2014, LTFRB stopped apprehending unregistered online ride-sharing providers, following an outcry from commuters. This paved the way for the DOTC and LTFRB to create new transport categories, legalizing the new public utility vehicle (PUV) players. Uber is a ride-sharing service where users can take advantage of an app to request rides, as well as track where their reserved vehicle is coming from. Users of the service pay using their credit cards, with the rate calculated by a measure of distance and time spent on the road. – Rappler.com Join MovePH's Twitter Conversation on Friday, August 14, at 4:30 pm.

Berikut 5 poin penting dalam panduan komunitas Uber sebagai anjuran tata cara baik untuk mitra-pengemudi maupun penumpang. Saling menghormati Kuncinya adalah, perlakukan setiap orang seperti bagaimana kita ingin diperlakukan oleh orang lain. Pengemudi dan sesama penumpang harus saling menghormati, menunjukkan sopan santun, dan tidak mengeluarkan kata-kata kasar. Sebagai penumpang, sebaiknya kita menjaga kenyamanan dan kebersihan kendaraan yang kita tumpangi, salah satunya dengan cara membawa sampah saat kita turun di tempat tujuan. Hal ini juga berlaku ketika kita menggunakan fitur UberPool. Sesama penumpang harus saling menghormati, salah satunya dengan cara tidak terlalu berisik sehingga mengganggu kenyamanan penumpang lain. Memberikan privasi bagi penumpang dan pengemudi Berbincang dengan pengemudi atau sesama penumpang memang tidak dilarang, namun kita tetap perlu sadar bahwa setiap orang membutuhkan privasi. Jangan menanyakan hal-hal yang sifatnya terlalu pribadi sehingga membuat perjalanan menjadi tidak nyaman. Selain itu, di dalam Uber tidak diperbolehkan melakukan aktivitas seksual, baik antara pengemudi dan penumpang maupun dengan sesama penumpang, apapun alasannya. Utamakan keselamatan Uber memang dilengkapi berbagai fitur yang menjamin keamanan, namun kita tetap harus waspada terhadap segala kemungkinan. Penumpang dan pengemudi wajib mengenakan sabuk pengaman atau helm saat sedang berkendara, dan penumpang dilarang untuk memaksa pengemudi melanggar lalu lintas. Pengemudi juga diminta untuk tidak menggunakan ponsel ketika berkendara, apapun alasannya. Jika butuh melihat GPS, sangat disarankan pengemudi memiliki dock khusus untuk meletakkan ponsel. Anak-anak dilarang berkendara sendiri Sejak awal, Uber telah memiliki peraturan bahwa hanya mereka yang telah berusia 18 tahun yang bisa membuat akun. Oleh karena itu, jika anak Anda menggunakan Uber harus selalu ditemani orang dewasa.  Jika penumpang memaksa untuk menitipkan anaknya berkendara dengan Uber tanpa pendamping, pengemudi berhak untuk menolak penumpang tersebut. Jangan lupa beri masukan Setiap akhir perjalanan Uber, penumpang akan diminta untuk memberikan rating dan saran atas kualitas pengemudi. Penumpang disarankan untuk memberikan nilai seadil-adilnya dan tidak ragu untuk menuliskan masukan serta kritik apapun. Jika pengemudi dianggap melanggar salah satu ketentuan yang berlaku, penumpang tidak perlu sungkan untuk melaporkan kejadian tersebut sehingga dapat segera ditangani. Hal ini juga berlaku untuk pengemudi yang merasa dirugikan oleh penumpang. Pengemudi bisa melaporkan kejadian tidak menyenangkan agar dapat ditindaklanjuti segera oleh pihak Uber. Konsekuensi yang akan diberikan untuk pengemudi maupun penumpang beragam, tergantung pada pelanggaran yang dilakukan. Seorang pengemudi bisa dicabut izinnya, dan pengguna juga bisa dihapus akunnya sehingga tidak dapat memesan layanan Uber lagi. —Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-charged-misleading-drivers-20mn-settlement","title":"Uber to pay $20-M to settle charge it misled drivers in US","date":"Jan 20, 2017 12:39 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber exaggerates its income potential in certain cities, according to the US Federal Trade Commission","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that the ride-sharing company exaggerated claims about driver pay and new car financing, US regulators said on Thursday, Jan 19. The money paid by San Francisco-based Uber Technologies will be used to provide refunds to affected drivers in the United States, according to the Federal Trade Commission. \"Many consumers sign up to drive for Uber, but they shouldn't be taken for a ride about their earnings potential or the cost of financing a car through Uber,\" FTC bureau of consumer protection director Jessica Rich said in a release. An FTC complaint accused Uber of exaggerating income potential in certain cities to attract new drivers, and making the terms of its vehicle-financing program appear more attractive than they were. Uber had claimed that uberX drivers' median annual incomes topped $90,000 in New York and $74,000 in San Francisco, when the actual amounts came to $61,000 and $53,000 respectively, the FTC said. The complaint also contended that while Uber claimed that its Vehicle Solutions Program provided the best financing options available, drivers received worse deals on average when it came to interest rates and leasing terms. While negotiating the settlement, Uber held firm that its approach to calculating incomes differed from the FTC's, saying the company had no intention of deceiving prospective drivers. Uber has recently stopped using an outside partner for financing vehicles in favor of an in-house program to better oversee the process. \"We're pleased to have reached an agreement with the FTC,\" an Uber spokeswoman said in an email response to an Agence France-Presse inquiry. \"We've made many improvements to the driver experience over the last year.\" Along with having to pay $20 million, Uber is barred from misrepresenting driver pay or terms for the financing of leasing vehicles, according to the FTC.

Widodo decided to cut his trip short by canceling the San Francisco leg of his trip, and said he will instead send his ministers to take care of business and complete his meetings there. The meetings, aimed at increasing foreign investment, include appointments with fund managers and Silicon Valley executives including from Google and Apple's Tim Cook. Among the prominent figures and business people that will speak in behalf of Indonesia will be Nadiem Makarim, a young Harvard graduate and the founder of what might be called the Uber of the motorcycle world.  Who is Makarim? Makarim has been described as the personification of the young professional that Jokowi, as the president is known, is looking for to boost the country’s creativity sector. The 31-year-old Makarim in 2011 founded Go-Jek, a play on the Indonesian word ojek, or motorcycle taxi. The service has become wildly popular in Jakarta’s traffic-choked streets. Go-Jek won the Global Entrepreneurship Program Indonesia in 2011. The young entrepreneur was also selected by the Geneva-based New Cities Foundation as one of the world’s nine outstanding urban innovators in 2015. He has spoken to hundreds of global urban leaders about their success in tackling some of the greatest current urban challenges. Poor man's Uber While motorcycle taxis are ubiquitous in Jakarta, Makarim combined a penchant for marketing genius with up-to-date technology, dressing his drivers in smart green jackets and helmets and using Android and iOS apps so that their customers can track them as Uber does.  Customers can order a Go-Jek to either transport them to their destinations or stay home and ask the driver to deliver goods, order food or even shop for them. As with Uber in other more advanced metropolitan areas, users can track the driver’s location via a global positioning system (GPS), which tells them exactly how long it will take for the driver to arrive. Go-Jek’s popularity has been rising on the slogan “An ojek for every need.” After launching “Go-Box” which serves customers with various sizes of trucks for transportation, it also introduced “Go-Glam” for beauty care services, “Go-Clean” for cleaning services, and “Go-Massage” which offers a private masseuse delivered to customers’ homes. That has raised antagonism of more traditional ojek riders, much as traditional taxi drivers in other cities have grown angry from the competition from Uber, which is cheaper, trackable via internet, and whose drivers are supposed to be guaranteed to be polite. Go-Jek users need not bargain as the company sets a fixed price for each kilometer traveled. It also offers a flat tariff during non-rush hour of Rs15,000 Rupiah (US$1.10) for maximum 25 kilometers. – Rappler.com Read the rest of this article on Asia Sentinel, a platform for news, analysis and opinion on national and regional issues in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/heroes-and-villains-in-jay-tablantes-geekology101","title":"Heroes in Jay Tablante’s 'Geekology101'","date":"Oct 28, 2012 11:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Lensman and uber-geek Jay Tablante releases the first Pinoy photo book celebrating cosplay","body":"MANILA, Philippines - Iron Man and War Machine strode around National Book Store Greenhills like they’d start duelling at the drop of a cog.    You’d probably mistake it as a rehearsal for alternates for an upcoming Marvel movie, but this is the book launch of Jason Tablante’s aptly titled “Geekology 101.”  This book answers the question: What do celebrities like Daiana Menezes, Bubbles Paraiso, Jinri Park and Sollen Heussaff have in common with cosplay queen Alodia Gosiengfiao? The answer: They’ve all posed as characters for Tablante’s sumptuously designed photographs that raise the bar for local cosplay photography.  In fact, sometimes — as in the case of Gosiengfiao as White Phoenix of the Crown — he rips the bar right off and flings it into the stratosphere to burn on the psychic flames of the superhero’s outspread wings.  His penchant for perfection becomes our delight. They look so good they transcend fandom photography, nudging into the realm of fine art prints.     Cosplay, or costume play, is a pop culture phenomenon that has enabled people to behold heroes, villains and everything in between, stepping off the page and into flesh. For geeks, cosplay is the closest thing they’ll get to inhabiting a favorite characters’ skin.  “The characters we bring to life are fantastic to begin with,” wrote Tablante in the book’s introduction. “They’ve got superpowers, paranormal abilities and things that just don’t exist in everyday life. \"I want to shoot people beyond the costumes. I want people to believe, for a moment, that superheroes can be real.”   Tablante, an upbeat and down to earth guy who has a perennial college student aura about him, describes himself as an uber geek. The first comic he ever bought was an issue of Marvel’s “Uncanny X-Men” way back when he was still grade school, and he hasn’t looked back since.  He’s also considered one of the country’s top commercial photographers, having honed his craft for almost 15 years now. Though he confesses he was a frustrated illustrator, he has no doubt come far from his early days tinkering around his cousin’s dark room.  One of his specialities is photographing women in various states of undress. Pick up a copy of one of the many local men’s magazines and, chances are, Tablante has shot one of the pretty ladies there.  Or, better yet, check out the gravure photo book ”The Jinri Park Experience” that Tablante is credited as having shot in full. Should come as little surprise; he does cite American erotic and porngoraphic lens woman Suze Randall as one of his influences alongside David LaChapelle.  Photographing cosplay remains close to his heart though, and it has enabled Tablante to interlace his profession and his passion into a single endeavor. Often, the images come off so well that his models become geek favorites.  Take Jinri Park, who donned the costume of the X-Men’s psychic ninja Psylocke. Her portrayal of the iconic character not only turned out amazing, it also brought her to the attention of European geeks who eventually flew her to Italy for a convention there last year.   “I got to go to Rome and Milan!” exclaimed Park. “I had to wear the skimpy costume in front of Europeans. They were like `Oooh!’ and looking at my butt.” She laughed. “Jay got me interested in a lot of geeky things, including cosplay. I’m very thankful because he opened a new market for me.”  Cover girl Alodia Gosiengfiao echoes Park’s sentiment, declaring that Tablante’s compilation is a giant step forward in their efforts to have cosplay gain wider recognition.    “This is our first `official’ Pinoy cosplay book,” said the cosplay pioneer, recounting how it was an uphill battle in the early days for her and her friends.  “When we started doing cosplay photography, we didn’t know that we would be compiling a book. We just did it out of the love for what we do.”  The book itself is a study in how an overload of attention to detail leads to photographic genius. And what a top notch team of production designers, stylists, make-up artists, illustrators, costumers and illustrators can achieve when working in perfectly-tuned concert.   The Mad Hatter, Alice and the Cheshire Cat play at cards while gulping down beer in the “Tea After Party” tableau; Bianca King investigates a murder scene as the local supernatural detective from the local comics “Trese,” or casts a spell as DC Comics’ Zatanna; Brazilian model Daiana Menezes lounges amid a sanctuary to the dark arts as the Black Queen; Gosiengfiao pulls off Capcom’s Morrigan and anime characters Amaha Masane and Rei Anayami with her usual aplomb.        One of the book’s highlights are the America-based cosplayers and costume designers that Tablante shot last year when he and his crew flew to the New York Comic-Con.  “It was luck more than anything that I was able to get in touch with the NY cosplayers,” said Tablante. “Going there and collaborating with [them] was a revelation. They did not disappoint. Their costumes were top notch. Movie-worthy. Natuwa talaga ako working with them!”  Tablante shot over 10 costumes for 9 hours in NY with Yaya Han, Riki Lecotey, Megan Marie and Marie Claude Bourbonnais. Most of them were Marvel characters like Dazzler, Cat Woman, Black Cat and Wasp.   “Believe it or not I am going back to some Japanese characters,” he said about his upcoming cosplay shoots. “Nag-shoot ako ng Voltes V for fun! I’ll be collaborating with a CG team and we’ll be producing a Camp Big Falcon and Lander V and Jamie Robinson.” Tablante is also working with Dingdong Dantes for a planned Cyclops shoot. Also in the works are more gravure foto books (like the Jinri Park Experience 2), and continuing with more cosplay images that can hopefully be brought to the ultimate geek powwow that is the San Diego Comic Con. - Rappler.com   “Geekology 101” is available at all National Book Store outlets at Php 345.

This is in line with past statements where Uber said that information such as trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, or dates of birth were not accessed and downloaded. The NPC said it's continuing their investigations and was now looking at procedures that Uber claimed it had implemented to prevent future incidents like this, as well as, measures Uber can take to protect Filipino users. They were also looking at steps to ensure that potential data breaches in the future were not concealed from regulators and users of the service. The NPC also said that they received \"reports of irregular processing following the report of the breach\" – claims that the NPC said they were still investigating. Uber's Philippine arm has been summoned to appear before the commission to further explain the said details.   Over 57 million were affected globally by this October 2016 data breach, which Uber kept a secret, and for which they paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy relevant data.

Sementara Departemen Kehakiman Amerika Serikat mencari kemungkinan terjadinya tindak pidana, sumber dari Bloomberg mengatakan bahwa Uber bekerja sama dengan badan hukum O'Melvenny & Myers LLP untuk melakukan pengecekan data pembayaran luar negeri, melakukan interview terhadap karyawannya, dan mencari tahu mengapa permasalahan krusial seperti ini tidak terdeteksi sejak dulu. Pengacara dalam badan hukum fokus kepada 5 negara yang memiliki aktivitas yang mencurigakan seperti Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, dan Korea Selatan. Uber mengatakan bahwa pihaknya telah berkoordinasi dengan sejumlah penyidik, namun hingga kini, baik dari pihak Uber maupun pihak Departemen Kehakiman enggan memberikan komentar. Pada akhir tahun 2016, Uber sempat bermasalah dengan pihak kepolisian Indonesia, lantaran kantornya berada di tempat yang tidak diperuntukkan untuk membuka usaha. Kemudian seorang pegawai memutuskan untuk memberikan sejumlah uang secara berkala kepada polisi tersebut agar kantor Uber tetap dapat beroperasi. Transaksi tersebut bahkan tercantum dalam pembukuan pengeluaran, yang ditulis dengan keterangan sebagai pembayaran ke aparat setempat. Sumber Bloomberg mengatakan bahwa karyawan yang melakukan tindakan penyuapan tersebut telah dipecat. Sementara itu, Direktur Bisnis Uber di Indonesia, Alan Jiang, tidak berkomentar apapun mengenai ini. Alan Jiang diketahui adalah orang yang menyetujui pembukuan pengeluaran tersebut. Alan yang sebelumnya cuti, kini mengundurkan diri dari Uber. Di lain tempat, Kepala Biro Penerangan Masyarakat Divisi Humas Polri Brigjen Rikwanto mengaku telah menengar kabar ini dari media sosial. Seperti dilansir Kompas.com, pihak kepolisian akan terus mendalami kabar dugaan penyuapan oleh Uber pada polisi.  Seorang senior bidang hukum milik Uber sebelumnya mengetahui hal ini namun memutuskan untuk tidak membuat laporan kepada aparat berwenang. Hal ini baru terbongkar ketika Departemen Kehakiman menunjukan adanya dugaan tindak pidana korupsi di luar negeri (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). Uber kemudian meresponnya dengan menjelaskan apa yang terjadi di Indonesia. Di Malaysia sendiri, penyelidikan sampai pada level pembuat kebijakan. Pasalnya, Uber melakukan donasi perusahaan senilai puluhan ribu dollar kepada Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre.

Sumber Bloomberg menyebut Emil Michael dan Eric Alexander, mantan anggota eksekutif Uber yang berperan penting dalam 2 negoisasi tersebut.  Penyelidikan terkait kasus suap Uber masih dijalankan di Negeri Tirai Bambu dan di Negeri Ginseng, meski belum ada kabar sampai mana proses penyelidikan berlangsung. —Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/leader-tnvs-drivers-group-uber-fault-ltfrb","title":"Leader of TNVS drivers' group: Uber at fault","date":"Aug 15, 2017 6:35 PM PHT","snippet":"TeamSpeed president Bobby Coronel hopes Uber will learn its lesson and fully comply with regulations","body":"MANILA, Philippines – It's Uber's fault. That is the sentiment of TeamSpeed president Bobby Coronel after Uber was suspended by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Monday, August 14, for one month. \"Wrong move po talaga si Uber regarding this one, lumalabas talagang wala sila pakialam sa peer and driver partners nila, importante lang sa kanila ang kumita,\" Coronel said. (Uber really made the wrong move. It shows that they really don't care about their drivers and peers, they only want to earn.) Coronel leads a group of some 4,200 drivers partnered with Grab and Uber. He started the viral petition asking the LTFRB to lift its suspension order against Grab and Uber, and its moratorium in processing transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications. Uber's fault, as stated by the LTFRB, was it continued to accredit drivers despite the regulatory board repeatedly ordering all transport network companies (TNCs) to halt accreditation. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) Uber defended itself by saying that it was only responding to \"public demand.\" It also slammed the LTFRB for taking too long in processing thousands of franchise applications. Then, Uber claimed, it was not properly briefed about the July 26 order, which it took to mean that accreditation of drivers was still allowed, but these new drivers cannot ply the roads. The LTFRB rejected the ride-hailing company's explanation. Because of Uber, Coronel said drivers and their families are bearing the brunt of the dilemma. \"Ngayon ganito ginawa nila, parang pinatay nila mga pamilya na umaasa sa marangal na trabaho na gusto lamang makapagbigay ng serbisyong publiko. Alam na ni Uber na may fault sila,\" he said. (With what they did, it's like they killed the families of those who depend on the job, those who just want to serve the public. They know that they are at fault.) Better to impose a fine? While thousands of his fellow drivers will lose the source of their income, Coronel said it was only right that the LTFRB suspended Uber instead of imposing another fine. \"Ipinapakita lamang po ng government natin na may talim ang batas. I'm sure matututo na si Uber niyan... Of course, mas okay kung fine only lang but paano matututo si Uber if magbabayad lang lagi siya ng danyos sa pagiging pasaway?\" Coronel said. (The government just showed them the rule of law. I'm sure they will learn their lesson now. Of course, a fine would be less harsh, but how will they learn if they can just pay every time they violate the law?) Uber earlier criticized the LTFRB for imposing archaic laws and failing to adapt to the changing times. But for Coronel, Uber should have slowed down and complied with the law from the start. With some 66,000 Uber drivers prohibited from operating starting Tuesday, August 15, Coronel echoed the LTFRB's recommendation that the transport network giant provide financial aid. \"Nananawagan po kami sa pamunuan ng Uber na makipag-usap sa mga apektadong partners at panagutan nila ang gusot na ito. Nagpa-panic na mga kasamahan namin. 'Yan ba talaga matatawag na business partner? I don't think so,\" he added. (We are calling on Uber to talk to their affected partners and give compensation for this mess. Our colleagues are panicking. Is that really what you call business partners? I don't think so.) Should drivers be caught violating the ban, they can be fined as high as P120,000 and their cars may be impounded for at least 3 months.

They appealed to the LTFRB to lift its July 21, 2016, order, which bars TNVS applicants from getting provisional authority permits (PAs) from the agency. Without PAs, new drivers waiting for the processing of their TNVS franchises cannot ply the roads. Citing \"public demand,\" however, Grab and Uber continued to accept new drivers and let them ply the metro's roads even with expired or without PAs.  Of 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers, 26,600 have expired or no permits. The LTFRB issued a July 11, 2017, order, slapping both transport network companies (TNCs) a P5-million fine each, and marked July 26 – Wednesday next week – as the start of apprehension of drivers without proper documents. Grab and Uber put the apprehension day on hold as they filed motions for reconsideration of the July 11 order. However, the order which put the PA moratorium remained in effect. In their defense, the drivers accredited only by TNCs and not by LTFRB said they also underwent screening in obtaining their accreditation. \"After undergoing stringent screening, training, and drug tests, we received our accreditation from our [TNCs].... Even though many in our ranks do not yet have a PA, it is hard to consider us as fly-by-night 'colorum' drivers. Remember we underwent screening, training, NBI clearance, and drug tests,\" their statement said. Receiving their petition, DOTr Undersecretary for Roads Thomas Orbos said he cannot assure them anything but their \"best effort\" to resolve the regulation deadlock. He said he will push for their inclusion in the upcoming technical working group talks, where so far only the LTFRB, Grab, and Uber representatives are included. \"I will take it up with the LTFRB. They (drivers) are stakeholders. So, definitely. I am not saying anything, that's a decision that [the LTFRB needs] to make, but definitely they need to be heard,\" Orbos said.

In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced, it will not succumb to pressure,\" LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada said on Monday. According to Grab head Brian Cu, the order might as well have been to close down their business as they need to continuously replenish their pool of drivers to accommodate \"public demand.\" Uber and Grab have allowed their drivers to continue plying the streets and kept on accepting new drivers even though they had expired permits or none at all, prompting the LTFRB to slap them with a P5-million fine each for negligence. \"The TNCs have a duty to explain to their peer operators [why they accredited] them without [permits] issued by the board and that they take full responsibility for putting them at risk of operating illegally,\" Lizada said. To give them breathing space, the LTFRB has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until July 26, 2017. Lizada warned that if they will still refuse to follow their orders beyond that date, their accreditation will be put at risk. \"In the event that both TNCs will continue to defy the order, the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law, considering that both accreditations are under review,\" Lizada said. Grab's accreditation expired last July 3, while Uber's is set to expire in August. While Grab's time is up, the LTFRB allowed them to operate. The LTFRB is now waiting for the full list of accredited drivers and the compliance of both TNCs before passing their judgment. During their show-cause hearing on July 11, Uber and Grab admitted that around 80% of their drivers are not properly documented, but only because the \"majority\" of those with expired permits asking for renewal are just waiting for LTFRB's nod.

US-based Lyft lets people summon rides using smartphone apps as does Uber, but has cultivated a reputation as a more socially responsible and driver-friendly version of the service. Lyft even mocked Uber in an advertising campaign late last year, depicting leaders of an imaginary \"RideCorp\" firm that appeared to be a reference to its market-leading competitor. The supposed executives sat in a black-walled conference room discussing how to defeat Lyft. Each short video clip focused on undermining what Lyft touts as advantages, such as extensive driver background checks and letting passengers tip drivers (something Uber has firmly opposed). Lyft also took a stand in January against US President Donald Trump's first anti-immigration executive order, announcing a million-dollar donation to the American Civil Liberties Union to help fund legal opposition. Meanwhile, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick was on track to be part of a Trump business advisory group and a movement grew to dump the ride-sharing service because of his connection to the administration. Kalanick quit the group, putting out word in an email to employees that the move was not meant as an \"endorsement of the president or his agenda.\" Uber also took heat for how the service reacted to a taxi strike at a major New York City airport to protest Trump's initial anti-immigration order, winding up accused of trying to undermine the protest. Uber said its response was misinterpreted. Lyft saw downloads of its mobile application climb as a \"DeleteUber\" campaign picked up speed on Twitter. The campaign got renewed momentum in recent weeks after accusations of sexism, cut-throat management, and a toxic work environment at Uber surfaced. In the Philippines, Uber drew flak for a tweet that was deemed insensitive towards jeepney drivers who were holding a transport strike at the time.  Last week, Uber acknowledged the use of a secret software program to steer drivers away from trouble, including sting operations by local authorities to catch law-breakers. Lyft was founded in 2012, 3 years after Uber, and is also based in San Francisco but is smaller. Lyft has attracted a few investors, including General Motors, Alibaba, and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding. The company is currently seeking to raise an additional $500 million in a funding round that would value the company about $6 billion, less than a tenth the valuation of Uber. While Uber has expanded internationally, Lyft has concentrated mostly on the US.

Mana yang berikan layanan termurah saat hujan?","body":"Memesan ojek online memang telah menjadi kebiasaan bagi masyarakat, terutama di kota yang penuh kemacetan seperti Jakarta. Dibanding menggunakan kendaraan umum atau memesan transportasi on demand berupa mobil, layanan seperti Go-Jek, UberMotor, dan GrabBike tentu bisa lebih cepat mengantarkan para pengguna di tengah kemacetan. Namun ketika musim hujan, menggunakan layanan on demand berupa sepeda motor pasti akan mengurangi kenyamanan. Untungnya, masyarakat masih mempunyai alternatif berupa taksi atau layanan on demand berupa mobil. Pertanyaannya, dari sekian banyak layanan yang tersedia, mana yang menghadirkan tarif termurah? Saya pun mencoba untuk membandingkan semua layanan tersebut. Sebagai informasi, saya memesan layanan ini dari kawasan Mampang Prapatan menuju Plaza Festival di Kuningan, Jakarta Selatan, yang berjarak 3,7 kilometer. Pesanan tersebut saya lakukan di hari kerja, sekitar pukul 16:30, dan dalam kondisi hujan. UberX dan UberPool  Layanan pertama yang saya coba adalah UberX. Uber sendiri mengenakan beberapa komponen tarif yang harus dibayar pengguna layanan ini, yaitu tarif dasar sebesar Rp3.000, biaya bensin Rp2.000 per kilometer, dan biaya pengemudi sebesar Rp300 per menit. Saat kondisi hujan dan waktu pulang kerja, permintaan di lokasi tertentu biasanya akan naik, dan UberX pun memberlakukan kenaikan harga (surge pricing). Ketika saya mencoba memesan, saya mendapati kenaikan harga sebesar 1,3 kali. Oleh karena itu, tarif minimal yang tertera di aplikasi Uber adalah sekitar Rp19.500. Selain UberX, Uber juga menyediakan layanan berbagi tumpangan yang bernama UberPool. Layanan ini menghadirkan tarif tetap yang besarnya 25 persen lebih murah dibanding tarif minimal UberX. Oleh karena itu, saya hanya perlu membayar Rp14.500 jika menggunakan layanan ini. Berbeda dengan layanan lain yang saya coba dalam perbandingan ini, dengan UberPool saya harus berkendara dengan beberapa penumpang lain. Karena itu, meski tarif UberPool lebih murah, waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk sampai di tempat tujuan bisa menjadi lebih lama. Go-Car Berbeda dengan Uber yang membagi tarif mereka menjadi tiga komponen, Go-Car hanya menghitung tarif berdasarkan jarak yang ditempuh oleh pengguna.  Mereka memberlakukan tarif Rp6.000 per kilometer di jam sibuk (rush hour), sehingga seharusnya saya hanya perlu membayar sekitar Rp22.200 untuk sampai di Plaza Festival. Akan tetapi, ketika saya mencoba layanan Go-Car, aplikasi Go-Jek justru membuat rute yang sedikit memutar, sehingga menaikkan jarak tempuh menjadi 4,8 kilometer. Itulah mengapa tarif yang tertera di aplikasi adalah Rp29.000. GrabCar Serupa dengan Go-Car, GrabCar juga hanya mengenakan tarif per kilometer kepada pengguna. Mereka memberlakukan tarif Rp2.800 per kilometer pada hari kerja, dan Rp4.000 per kilometer saat akhir pekan. Namun GrabCar juga memberlakukan surge pricing apabila permintaan terhadap layanan mereka naik. Itulah mengapa tarif normal yang seharusnya hanya sekitar Rp10.360 (dengan jarak perjalanan 3,7 kilometer) naik 2,7 kali lipat menjadi Rp28.000. GrabTaxi dan Blue Bird Selain kendaraan on demand berupa mobil, masyarakat Jakarta juga bisa memesan layanan taksi secara online, baik dengan aplikasi Grab (untuk layanan GrabTaxi) maupun dengan aplikasi Blue Bird. Karena tarif taksi ditentukan berdasarkan argo, maka kedua aplikasi tersebut pun hanya bisa memberikan perkiraan harga, bukan harga pasti. Dari aplikasi Grab, saya mendapatkan perkiraan harga Rp30.000 hingga Rp45.000, sedangkan dari aplikasi Blue Bird saya mendapatkan perkiraan tarif Rp20.000. Ketika saya mencoba secara langsung, ternyata perkiraan dari Grab lebih mendekati kenyataan, karena saya akhirnya harus membayar sekitar Rp35.000. Dari perbandingan di atas, bisa dilihat kalau layanan UberX merupakan pilihan yang cukup baik ketika hujan karena harganya yang lebih murah. GrabCar juga bisa menjadi alternatif karena tarifnya yang cenderung lebih murah apabila tidak ada surge pricing. Namun perlu diingat kalau surge pricing dari UberX dan GrabCar memang bisa berbeda-beda, tergantung kondisi pada saat memesan layanan tersebut. Dalam kondisi ekstrem, tak mustahil kalau tarif UberX dan GrabCar bisa jadi lebih mahal dibandingkan layanan yang memberlakukan tarif tetap seperti Go-Car. —Rappler.com Artikel ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di Tech in Asia"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/volkswagen-toyota-ridesharing-uber-gett","title":"Volkswagen, Toyota buy into ridesharing","date":"May 25, 2016 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Toyota signs a memorandum of understanding with Uber to explore collaboration, while Volkswagen makes a strategic investment in Gett","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Toyota and Volkswagen announced separate partnerships Tuesday, May 24, with rideshare companies Uber and Gett, in the latest such moves by major carmakers. Japan's Toyota and ridesharing titan Uber said they had entered into a memorandum of understanding to explore collaboration, starting with trials in countries where ridesharing is expanding. \"Through this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient, and attractive mobility services to customers,\" Shigeki Tomoyama, senior managing officer of Toyota Motor Corporation, said in a joint statement. The deal includes a strategic investment by the Toyota Financial Services Corporation and its Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership, although no figure was disclosed. The partnership will create new leasing options enabling car buyers to lease their vehicles from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments with what they make as Uber drivers. Toyota and Uber are also exploring collaboration on developing in-car apps and setting up a program to sell Toyota and Lexus vehicles to Uber. \"Toyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide and we look forward to collaborating with Toyota in multiple ways going forward,\" said Emil Michael, Uber's chief business officer. Separately, German auto giant Volkswagen said it had made a $300 million strategic investment in Uber competitor Gett, which has a presence in more than 60 countries worldwide including London, Moscow, and New York. \"The ride-hailing market represents the greatest market potential in on-demand mobility, while creating the technological platform for developing tomorrow's mobility business models,\" it said in a statement. Shahar Waiser, Gett's chief executive and founder, said the company \"provides VW with the technology to expand beyond car ownership to on-demand mobility for consumers and businesses.\" Toyota and Volkswagen are not the first carmakers to link up with rideshare apps. In March, General Motors and Lyft unveiled a joint car rental service for drivers, a move aimed at boosting the number of vehicles available for the Uber rival. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/sopir-taksi-tolak-uber-grabtaxi","title":"Pro dan kontra penggunaan transportasi aplikasi online","date":"Mar 15, 2016 6:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Pengemudi taksi tolak keberadaan UBER dan GrabTaxi yang dinilai 'menghancurkan sopir kecil'","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — (UPDATED) Ribuan pengendara angkutan darat yang terdiri dari sopir taksi, metromini, bajaj, dan angkot berunjuk rasa pada Senin, 14 Maret di dekat Istana Negara. Mereka menuntut agar transportasi berbasis aplikasi online segera ditutup. Salah satu perwakilan dari Paguyuban Pengendara Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Suwardi mengatakan ada sekitar 15 ribu demonstran yang ikut turun ke jalan. \"Kami menuntut agar aplikasi online tersebut segera ditutup, karena sudah menyengsarakan pengemudi angkutan umum resmi,\" ujar Suwardi yang merupakan sopir taksi Blue Bird. Dari armada taksi tempatnya bekerja, masing-masing pull mengirimkan 40 orang untuk berdemonstrasi. Belum lagi dari armada taksi lainnya. Semula mereka berkumpul dan berorasi di depan Balai Kota serta menuntut untuk bertemu Gubernur DKI Jakarta, Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahja Purnama. Namun, perwakilan hanya bisa bertemu dengan Kepala Dinas Perhubungan. Dari sana, mereka berjalan kaki menuju ke area Monas di dekat Istana Negara. Suwardi menjelaskan sejak transportasi umum berbasis aplikasi online beroperasi, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Salah satu rekannya yang bekerja di armada taksi Express hanya bisa menyetor sekitar Rp150 ribu hingga Rp200 ribu. Padahal, sebelumnya, rekannya itu bisa menyetor hingga Rp300 ribu. \"Saya sendiri hanya bisa setor ke perusahaan. Komisi untuk dibawa pulang tidak ada,\" keluh Suwardi. Akibat berkurangnya pemasukan tiap bulan, banyak rekannya yang tidak sanggup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari seperti membayar kontrakan. Bahkan, ada istri yang meminta cerai. Dia mengatakan kantor pusat Blue Bird merestui niat mereka berdemonstrasi. Baginya lebih baik dia dan sopir taksi lainnya berdemonstrasi hari ini, ketimbang tidak ada kejelasan di masa depan mengenai persaingan yang tidak sehat tersebut. \"Kami bukannya mempermasalahkan kalah saing dengan transportasi berbasis online. Selama mereka menaati aturan-aturan yang sudah ada, membayar pajak, jika mereka taksi maka mereka memasang plat kuning, ada argo dan tera, kami tidak mempermasalahkan,\" papar Suwardi. Sementara, setiap kali mereka mengaku rugi karena harus mengeluarkan biaya untuk mengurus  semua persyaratan agar menjadi transportasi umum yang legal. \"Sementara, pengendara grab dan Uber kan menggunakan mobil pribadi. Bahkan, ketika kami perhatikan dari platnya tidak hanya berasal dari Jakarta, tetapi juga Tangerang, Tegal, Semarang dan Cirebon,\" kata dia. Mewakili rekan-rekannya, Suwardi mengaku kecewa terhadap sikap pemerintah yang malah melanggar aturan yang mereka buat sendiri. Demonstrasi anarkis Dalam demonstrasi tersebut, Rappler menemukan satu kendaraan dengan jenis Toyota Avanza berwarna hitam yang dirusak oleh para demonstran. Menurut petugas polisi yang Rappler temui, mobil tersebut dirusak oleh para demonstran merupakan salah satu armada Grab yang tertangkap basah tengah beroperasi di depan Kementerian Koordinator Politik, Hukum dan Keamanan. Lalu, bagaimana respons dari perwakilan PPAD soal sikap anarkis ini? Suwardi mengatakan tidak bisa mencegah hal itu. \"Karena di sini kan ada beberapa pihak yang ikut berdemonstrasi, sehingga tidak bisa menjamin 100 persen. Kalau kami dari sopir taksi pasti tertib. Walau ada suara sumbang dari kami, tetapi itu kan hanya sebatas suara,\" papar Suwardi. Buka lapangan pekerjaan Sementara, salah satu pengemudi transportasi berbasis online, Go-Jek, Dadang Trisnandi mengatakan tidak mempermasalahkan jika para sopir kendaraan umum konvensional ingin berdemonstrasi. Dia hanya berharap demonstrasi tidak berlangsung anarkis. \"Saya memang menduga mereka berdemonstrasi karena mengeluh mengenai pendapatannya yang banyak berkurang setelah ada kehadiran Go-Jek dan Grab. Tapi, itu semua kini ada di tangan pemerintah,\" ujar Dadang. Sebab, dia melanjutkan yang membuat aturan dan hukum adalah pemerintah. Dia turut menyebut justru dengan kehadiran Go-jek dan perusahaan startup sejenis membantu pemerintah menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan. \"Saya kembalikan kepada masyarakat selaku pengguna, apakah mereka ingin Go-Jek ditutup atau tidak. Pemerintah atau pejabat yang berwenang terhadap masalah ini juga perlu membuat kajian apakah transportasi berbasis online memberikan banyak manfaat atau malah merugikan,\" kata dia. Tak bayar pajak? Guberur DKI Jakarta, Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama yang ditemui pada Selasa, 15 Maret meminta pemilik atau pengelola layanan transportasi berbasis online untuk memenuhi kewajiban membayar pajak. Berdasarkan aturan, setiap pengusaha angkutan di Jakarta wajib membayar pajak yang nilainya sekitar 25 hingga 28 persen dari total pendapatannya setiap tahun. Pengusaha transportasi berbasis online juga tak luput dari pajak itu. \"Transportasi online itu pasti lebih murah, karena kan tidak harus membayar pajak, bayar asuransi dan lain-lain. Sedangkan, angkutan umum konvensional dan taksi harus memenuhi kewajiban untuk membayar pajak tersebut,\" ujar mantan Bupati Bangka Belitung itu. Sementara, salah satu pengemudi Grab Car bernama Bashari menepis jika pihaknya abai membayar pajak. \"Bahkan nominal yang dipungut perusahaan itu berkisar Rp170 ribu-Rp180 ribu setiap minggunya. Itu dari satu pengemudi,\" ujar Bashari ketika ditemui Rappler pada Senin, 14 Maret. Dia pun berkisah saat ini menjadi pengemudi Grab Car semakin kompetitif, karena jumlahnya yang semakin banyak \"Sekarang, saya harus bekerja selama 15 jam sehari untuk bisa mencapai target penghasilan Rp3 juta per minggu. Jadi, kami turut merasakan kesulitan,\" kata dia. Harus lebih kompetitif Pengamat transportasi dari Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia (MTI), Dharmaningtyas, berpendapat senada dengan Ahok. Menurutnya, walaupun mengaku sebagai perusahaan teknologi, tetapi baik Grab dan Uber memberikan jasa layanan transportasi bagi publik. Di saat taksi-taksi reguler dikenai pajak, kir (pengujian kendaraan bermotor), dan dituntut memiliki pull. \"Sementara, angkutan seperti Grab dan Uber kan tidak. Masalahnya kan di situ. Menguntungkan konsumen, tetapi bagi operator taksi pada umumnya merugikan. Apalagi bagi taksi reguler,\" ujar Dharmaningtyas yang dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin malam, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa yang sebaiknya dilakukan pemerintah? Dharmaningtyas menyarankan agar Presiden Joko Widodo mengingatkan kedua perusahaan itu agar tetap tunduk kepada UU No 22 tahun 2009 mengenai Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. \"Tetapi, jika Presiden ingin merevisi UU tersebut harus hati-hati. Sebab, penggunaan angkutan berbasis aplikasi online ini hanya ada di kota-kota besar. Sementara, UU kan berlaku secara nasional,\" kata dia. Dia menyarankan sebaiknya aplikasi itu digunakan oleh operator taksi yang legal. \"Tetapi, taksi konvensional juga harus berbenah diri, menurunkan tarif agar lebih bisa kompetitif. Alasan publik menggunakan taksi Uber dan Grab kan karena tarifnya lebih murah. Pengelola taksi reguler harus mencari jawaban bagaimana bisa menerapkan tarif yang kompetitif,\" papar dia. - Rappler.com BACA JUGA:  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/kemenhub-minta-kemkominfo-blokir-grab-uber","title":"Kemenhub minta Kemkominfo blokir aplikasi transportasi online","date":"Mar 14, 2016 7:26 PM PHT","snippet":"Kementerian Perhubungan menilai perusahaan GRAB dan Uber telah melanggar aturan dan angkutan ilegal.","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – (UPDATED) Kementerian Perhubungan meminta Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika memblokir aplikasi transportasi berbasis internet, khususnya GRABTAXI dan Uber. Menurut Kemenhub, baik GRABTAXI maupun Uber telah melanggar delapan ketentuan beroperasi di Jakarta. Menurut dokumen yang diperoleh Rappler pada Senin, 14 Maret, GRABTAXI dan Uber dianggap melanggar tiga aturan yaitu UU Nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan, UU Nomor 25 tahun 2007 mengenai penanaman modal yang menyatakan penanaman modal asing wajib dalam bentuk perseroan terbatas berdasarkan hukum Indonesia serta Surat Keputusan Kepala BKPM Nomor 22 tahun 2001 yang menyebut UBER sebagai kantor perwakilan Indonesia tidak diperkenankan melakukan kegiatan komersial. Dalam dokumen tersebut, Kemenhub menyebut keberadaan kedua perusahaan itu telah menimbulkan keresahan dan konflik di kalangan pengusaha angkutan resmi dan pengemudi taksi resmi serta meyuburkan praktek angkutan liar (ilegal). Hal lain, keberadaan dua perusahaan itu turut membuat angkutan umum semakin tidak diminati. Dengan mempertimbangkan semua aturan itu, maka dalam surat tersebut Kemenhub mendorong dua hal: 1. Kemkominfo segera memblokir situs aplikasi milik GRABTAXI dan UBER serta melarang seluruh aplikasi sejenis. 2. Tidak bekerjasama dengan perusahaan angkutan umum lain yang tidak mempunyai izin resmi Lalu, apa komentar Kemenhub mengenai surat tersebut? Kepala Pusat Komunikasi Kemenhub, JA Barata membenarkan surat yang beredar di dunia maya tersebut. \"Surat itu memang sudah ada dan baru dikirim ke Kemkominfo pagi tadi. Yang melaksanakan pemblokiran nanti juga Kemkominfo,\" ujar JA Barata ketika dihubungi Rappler melalui telepon pada Senin, 14 Maret. Lalu, apa bedanya kebijakan Kemenhub saat ini dengan yang dikeluarkan Menhub Ignasius Jonan pada 17 Desember 2015? \"Kalau kebijakan saat ini hanya tertuju kepada Taksi Uber dan Grab Car karena perusahaan angkutan ini dianggap melakukan pelanggaran terhadap UU yang berlaku, karena di dalam UU itu diatur syarat untuk mendirikan perusahaan taksi,\" kata Barata. Sementara, yang dituntut oleh Kemenhub dalam kebijakan 17 Desember tahun lalu, menyasar angkutan aplikasi online gojek dan grab bike. Barata menegaskan tidak ada aturan khusus mengenai angkutan transportasi umum sepeda motor. Pada 17 Desember 2015, Kementerian Perhubungan juga melarang Gojek dan Grabike beroperasi tetapi larangan itu dicabut sehari sesudah diumumkan. Pencabutan kebijakan dilakukan usai Presiden Joko Widodo memanggil Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan ke Istana Negara.  Kemenhub, kata Barata, menyerahkan sepenuhnya keputusan akhir pemblokiran aplikasi online kepada Kemkominfo. Regulasi tak dipegang Kemkominfo Sementara, Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika, Rudiantara mengatakan tak akan menutup transportasi berbasis online. Rudiantara bahkan berpikir, jika memang aplikasi tersebut dinikmati oleh masyarakat maka sepatutnya dicarikan solusi alternatif. \"Dari sisi Kemkominfo, kami tidak relevan mengatur mengenai regulasi. Hal itu seharusnya ditangani oleh Kemenhub, dishub daerah dan pemda,\" ujar Rudi ketika ditemui di kompleks DPR Senayan pada Senin, 14 Maret. Justru dia mengatakan tidak semua aplikasi harus mengajukan perizinan. Kecuali jika startup di bidang e-commerce itu memberikan pelayanan kepada publik, mereka membutuhkan akreditasi, tapi itu semua diserahkan ke industri. Kemkominfo justru ingin menerapkan light touch regulation, sehingga jika membutuhkan izin, hanya keluar dari satu pintu. \"Kalau izin cukup dari dirjen ya maka dari dirjen saja. Nanti, dirjennya melapor ke saya,\" kata Rudi. Dia bahkan mengkritik jika segala sesuatu membutuhkan perizinan dan diurus oleh pemerintah, maka sektor tersebut tidak akan kompetitif. \"Itu kan idenya anak muda. Untuk apa start up minta izin? Ketika memulai kan belum tentu jadi bisnis, jadi tinggal lapor saja ke Kemkominfo,\" tuturnya.  Kendati begitu, Rudi menyebut akan terus berkoordinasi dengan Ignasius terkait dengan kebijakan ini. Beri waktu 15 hari Sementara itu, Ketua Paguyuban Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD), Cecep Handoko yang ditemui di kantor Sekretaris Negara mengatakan mereka dan pemerintah sudah mencapai kesepakatan. PPAD memberikan waktu 15 hari kepada pemerintah untuk mengeluarkan kebijakan agar GRABTAXI dan Uber mematuhi aturan yang ada. \"Iya, permasalahannya ini kan di regulasi. Kami merupakan pengendara mobil pelat kuning itu dibebani berbagai macam aturan hingga ke penetapan ongkos. Maka, jika mau setara, mari dibuat Peraturan Presiden atau Instruksi Presiden yang tidak perlu legislasi hingga nanti ada revisi terhadap UU Lalu Lintas tahun 2009,\" kata Cecep. PPAD menegaskan mereka akan terus mendesak Kemkominfo untuk segera mengambil tindakan tegas agar segera menerapkan rekomendasi dari Kemenhub. \"Maaf, bukan bermaksud sombong, tetapi kami beri waktu 15 hari. Kalau enggak ada tindak lanjut, maka kami akan demo lagi.

LTFRB Board Member Antonio Inton Jr said commuters using transport network companies (TNC) such as Uber and GrabCar should request for premium vehicles other than Mitsubishi Montero. \"May iba namang premium vehicles na ino-offer and mga TNC, siguro for their own safety, baka pwedeng 'yun ang kanilang i-request,\" Inton said on Thursday, December 3.  (TNCs offer premium vehicles [other than Montero Sport]. Maybe the [public] could just request for those.)  Inton also said that their office will study whether to suspend the provisional authority issued to new Montero units. According to Inton, there have been more than 7,000 new applications for a transport network vehicle (TNVS) permit. At the very least, 10% of those are Montero Sport, he said. A concerned lawyer urged LTFRB Thursday, December 3, to put on hold the approval of the applications of Montero vehicles accredited by Uber and GrabCar. \"As shown on TV and news item, said model Mitsubishi Montero Sport would suddenly accelerate very fast and run wild beyond the control of the driver thereby causing damage to properties and injuries not only to the driver but to pedestrians as well,\" wrote Felizardo Tiu's letter to LTFRB. \"[We] request your office to suspend or hold in abeyance the approval of application of Transport Network Vehicle Service.\" Tiu called for urgent action on the part of the regulatory body. \"It's just proper to protect the riding public. You might not be using Montero Sport but if that [Montero Sport] is on the highway, then suddenly accelerates, who would stop them?\" the lawyer told reporters after he filed his complaint. The LTFRB assured the public of a speedy response to the case but also stressed that it would have to wait for the results of the Department of Trade and Industry's investigation, which is set to be released in two weeks. Asked about their quickest action to prevent any accident, Inton said they would ask for the TNC's initiative to suspend their vehicle's accreditation. \"If [Uber and GrabCar] suspend the accreditation of those Monteros within that two-week period, [it would] probably help. If the TNC will suspend the accreditation and furnish their copy to us, then we can act on that their suspension,\" Inton said, noting that they cannot simply revoke the provisional authority they issued to the vehicles.

Penolakan Pemerintah Kota Bandung terhadap keberadaan Uber dan Grab Taksi berdasarkan pada hasil seminar 'Fenomena Moda Transportasi Baru Kota Bandung di Era Digital' yang dilaksanakan pada Senin (24/8/2015) lalu. Dilihat dari berbagai aspek, teknis, kelayakan dan situasi ekonomi serta aspek legal, keberadaan taksi berbasis aplikasi itu tidak memenuhi persyaratan.   \"Tim dari seminar sudah lapor dari berbagai aspek.

Namun dia berpendapat, pelarangan itu disikapi oleh taksi resmi dengan memperbaiki layanannya. “Uber mendapat tempat karena ada yang kurang dari pelayanan taksi di Bandung,” katanya.  Kathy merasa cukup terbantu dengan adanya Uber. Pelayanan yang bagus, gampang diakses, kendaraan terawat, lebih murah dan aman. Perempuan berusia 36 tahun itu lebih memilih Uber daripada taksi konvensional.“Sekali-kali pakai Uber sih, tapi kalau disuruh milih sih lebih baik pakai Uber,” ujar dia. Warga Bandung lainnya, Fajar Anugrah mengaku sangat menyayangkan pelarangan itu apalagi alasannya adalah aspek legalitas. “Mungkin Kang Emil belum betul-betul paham bahwa Uber bukan perusahaan transportasi tapi perusahaan apps. Mobil yang digunakan Uber adalah kendaraan yang secara legal terdaftar di berbagai perusahaan rental,” kata Fajar saat dihubungi Rappler.com, Selasa. Berdasarkan aturan, lanjut Fajar, mobil pelat hitam boleh berfungsi sebagai kendaraan komersil bila sebagai armada rental.

The new categories, expected to be published later this week, are an effort to modernize transportation services, and usher in the conveniences offered by technological innovation especially with increasing demand for these services, the DOTC said (READ: Taxis beware: Gov't introduces 4 new transport categories). “The Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) classification will allow app-based services offered by Transportation Network Companies (TNC) to exist within our regulatory framework,” said DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya. The new classification is the fruit of collaborative efforts between the DOTC, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and TNCs a few months ago to formulate updated classification policies. Under the new classification, a TNC is defined as an organization that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an Internet-based technology application or a digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles. TNCs will provide the public with online-enabled transportation services known as a TNVS, which will connect drivers with ride-seekers through an app. A new classification is also being created for Premium Taxis, which compared to regular taxis, will have the advantage of being equipped with global positioning system (GPS), of having online and smartphone booking capability, a 7-year age limit, and transactions using credit or debit cards. “Many people appreciate the safe and convenient services offered by the TNVS category. We want this to motivate other public utility vehicle operators to modernize, upgrade, and innovate their services for the benefit of the public,” Abaya said.  Requirements The DOTC is imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility under the new TNVS classification like the requirement of GPS tracking and navigation devices for convenience and safety. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles will be allowed and a maximum age limit of 7 years will be enforced.

Shares will be priced at $45 for the initial public offering (IPO), valuing the startup at more than $82 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. San Francisco-based Uber was set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the eponymous ticker \"UBER\" in one of the largest initial public offerings in the tech sector. Despite the eye-popping valuation, Uber dialed back some of its earlier ambitions for a value exceeding $100 billion after a rocky start for US rideshare rival Lyft. Analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Uber has the potential to be a game-changing company and \"is paving a similar road to what Amazon did to transform retail/ecommerce and Facebook did for social media.\" Ives said Uber has the potential to grow as it morphs its ridesharing platform into a more diverse set of services with Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and self-driving vehicle initiatives. \"We view Uber's conservative pricing as a smart and prudent strategy coming out of the box as it clearly learned from its 'little brother' Lyft, and the experience it has gone through over the past month,\" Ives said in a note to investors. Risks to new model But some of the risks surrounding Uber and its rivals were highlighted Wednesday, May 8, as thousands of drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike over pay and working conditions. The strikes targeting Uber and its US rival Lyft highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange with some signs reading \"Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.\" Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. \"While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,\" Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. \"In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\" Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber said in a securities filing Thursday that it had reached agreement with a large majority of the roughly 60,000 drivers contesting their status as independent contractors and who had instituted arbitration proceedings against the firm. The company anticipates the total cost of the individual settlements, combined with attorneys' fees, will fall between $146 million and $170 million. Uber maintained it was sticking to its plans on how it classifies drivers. \"Our business would be adversely affected if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors,\" the company said. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry predicted that Uber will eventually have to raise ride prices, causing its customers to seek other options. Uber will be raising up to $9 billion in the offering being underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and other large banks. Lyft shares skid Uber's inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft, which has lost more than 15 percent of its value since its March offering. Lyft's losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to more than 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Uber envisions becoming the \"Amazon of transportation\" in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike or e-scooter to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between \"skyports,\" taking off and landing vertically. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-self-driving-truck-program-cancellation","title":"Uber hits brakes on self-driving trucks","date":"Jul 31, 2018 12:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The company is refocusing on developing autonomous cars, one of which had killed a woman pushing a bicycle in a street in Arizona earlier this year","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber on Monday, July 30, US time, said it is hitting the brakes on self-driving trucks, shifting gears to focus just on autonomous cars. Uber is among a number of technology and car companies racing toward what some contend is an inevitable future in which vehicles drive themselves. Uber's aspirations had included self-driving trucks, with the smartphone-summoned-ride service revving that effort with the purchase of startup Otto two years ago. \"We've decided to stop development on our self-driving truck program and move forward exclusively with cars,\" Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber advanced technologies group, said in an email response to an AFP inquiry. \"We recently took the important step of returning to public roads in Pittsburgh, and as we look to continue that momentum, we believe having our entire team’s energy and expertise focused on this effort is the best path forward.\" San Francisco-based Uber had suspended its self-driving car program after a crash that killed a woman pushing a bicycle in a street in Arizona in March of this year. Uber has a version of the ride service that matches truck drivers with loads in need of hauling. In the absence of an urgent need for self-driving trucks to keep Uber Freight competitive, members of that team will work on autonomous cars or be offered spots elsewhere in the company. Uber Freight has become a national operation since launching in May of 2017. Otto co-founder Lior Ron left Uber in the weeks after the fatal accident in Arizona, according to media reports. Ron and co-founders including Anthony Levandowski, started Otto in early 2016. The startup was bought by Uber nine months later in a deal valued at more than $500 million. Levandowski was a central figure in a blockbuster federal lawsuit filed by Waymo against Uber claiming trade secrets were stolen from the self-driving car project where he worked before leaving to start Otto. A trial was taking place when Waymo and Uber in February announced a surprise agreement to resolve the legal clash. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-grab-deal-singapore-road-block","title":"Road block for Uber-Grab deal in Singapore","date":"Jul 5, 2018 8:08 PM PHT","snippet":"The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticizes both companies for going ahead with the deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway","body":"SINGAPORE – Singapore on Thursday, July 5, threatened to reverse the sale of Uber's Southeast Asian business to Grab, calling for changes to be made to the deal, which it said infringed competition rules. Singapore-based Grab in March agreed to buy Uber's food and ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing companies. But Singapore's competition commission found that the deal created a virtual monopoly in the city-state's ride-hailing market, with Grab raising prices after the merger was completed, it said in a statement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticised both companies for going ahead with the \"irreversible\" deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway. \"CCCS's investigations also revealed that the parties had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties,\" the statement said.

It also suggested a series of potential \"remedies\" to ensure fair competition and called for a public consultation on the proposed measures. \"CCCS may require the Parties to unwind the transaction unless the... public consultation confirms that any of the proposed remedies... are sufficient to address the identified competition concerns\", it warned. The deal has come under scrutiny across the region, with Malaysia and the Philippines also launching investigations. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, California-headquartered Uber received a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Grab said in a statement that it disagrees with the commission's findings, calling it a \"narrow approach in defining competition\". \"This provisional decision and proposed remedies are overreaching and go against Singapore's pro-innovation and pro-business regulations in a free market economy,\" it said, adding that it will appeal the decision.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-caps-driver-hours-to-10-britain","title":"Uber caps driver hours to 10 in Britain","date":"Jan 17, 2018 1:13 PM PHT","snippet":"After 10 hours of driving, drivers will not be able to log on to the app. They are required to take an uninterrupted 6-hour break to be able to log in again","body":" LONDON, UK – US ride-hailing app Uber on Tuesday said it would cap the number of hours its drivers can work in Britain from next week in a bid to increase safety after heavy criticism of its business practices. The new policy means that drivers must take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours, and will not be able to log on to the app during that time. The company had already been messaging drivers who were working too long to switch off its app. \"We believe this is an industry first and are not aware of any other private hire operator in the UK that has introduced such a limit,\" Uber said in a statement. \"It's another example of how Uber uses technology to help enhance driver and passenger safety,\" Andrew Byrne, Uber's head of policy, was quoted as saying. Uber is currently appealing against the withdrawal of its license in London over the way in which the company reports serious criminal offenses and obtains criminal record checks for its drivers. Uber can continue to operate in London pending the appeal, which is set to be heard later this year. Uber is also appealing against an employment court ruling that would give its drivers the right to paid holidays and the national minimum wage. Uber has around 40,000 drivers in London and 50,000 in Britain as a whole. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, head of the British parliament's business committee, welcomed the news. \"We received evidence of Uber drivers being logged into the Uber app for more than 60 hours per week so we welcome the introduction of limits to driver hours. \"We look forward to seeing how this will work in practice and hope other companies will quickly follow suit,\" she said. But James Farrar, head of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, said drivers were tired \"because they are not earning enough\". \"If Uber forces drivers to work less without paying more, it is just going to depress hourly earnings even further below the minimum wage and push drivers to the brink,\" he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-files-appeal-london-ban","title":"Uber files appeal against London ban","date":"Oct 13, 2017 7:32 PM PHT","snippet":"\"We have this morning filed our appeal on the London licence decision at Westminster Magistrates' Court,\" Uber says in a statement ahead of the Friday deadline","body":"LONDON, United Kingdom –  Uber on Friday, October 13, filed its appeal against a decision by London authorities not to renew its licence, the US ride-hailing company said. \"We have this morning filed our appeal on the London licence decision at Westminster Magistrates' Court,\" Uber said in a statement ahead of the Friday deadline. An initial court hearing is expected on December 11. London transport authorities last month said they would not renew Uber's licence to operate in the city owing to public safety concerns. Transport for London (TfL) claims that the conduct of Uber, which has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital, had raised concerns. \"While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,\" Uber added on Friday.  \"As our new CEO (Dara Khosrowshahi) has said, we are determined to make things right.\" TfL has highlighted the company's approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and to obtaining criminal record checks for drivers as factors in its decision. The company came under scrutiny in Britain after it emerged that dozens of rape and sexual assault claims had been made against their drivers and when one of their drivers used his vehicle in a recent terror attack on Buckingham Palace. It also questioned the process through which drivers obtain their medical certificates and the practice of \"greyballing\", when the company uses a fake version of its app to fool regulators in cities in which it is banned. 'Mistakes' In an open letter last month, Khosrowshahi apologized for \"mistakes\" made by Uber. \"While Uber had revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way,\" he wrote. But he pledged to appeal the TfL decision \"on behalf of millions of Londoners.\" Uber hired Khosrowshahi from US travel group Expedia in August, in the hope that he can steer the ride-sharing service away from the string of controversies. Uber, which has accumulated financial losses, has faced allegations also of technology theft, corruption and use of illegal software. At the same time, its drivers have been struggling with a wave of opposition from traditional taxis in several countries – and has faced regulatory problems in other hubs including Cape Town, Mumbai, and New Delhi.

Khosrowshahi will be at Uber's headquarters in San Francisco for an 'all-hands' gathering to meet workers at the controversy-battered company. \"We are delighted to announce that Uber's Board has voted unanimously to appoint Dara Khosrowshahi to be our new CEO,\" Uber executives said in an email sent to employees late Tuesday. Khosrowshahi is credited with turning Expedia into a global travel services behemoth, winning admiration from employees on the journey. Uber is hoping he will now slip into the driver's seat at the controversy-battered ride-sharing service and steer it along a similarly glorious route. Khosrowshahi replaces Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was pressured to resign as chief of the leading smartphone-summoned ride service. Kalanick was the driving force behind Uber, taking a spur-of-moment idea and turning it into the world's most valuable venture-funded tech startup. But his brash personality and freewheeling management style, which some argue set a problematic tone at the company, made him a liability as well as an asset to the global ridesharing giant. In June, he stepped down as chief executive. Khosrowshahi was nine years old when he and his family immigrated to the United States on the eve of the Iranian Revolution, according to Uber. Khosrowshahi is known as an experienced top executive, willing to speak his mind and to advocate for women getting equal pay and leadership opportunities. \"We're really fortunate to gain a leader with Dara's experience, talent and vision,\" Uber said in the message to employees. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-august-29-2017-evening-edition","title":"Uber, Ombudsman, Bautista | Evening wRap","date":"Aug 29, 2017 6:47 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board lifts the suspension of Uber. President Rodrigo Duterte's son-in-law Manases Carpio confirms he made visits to the Bureau of Customs but said it had nothing to do with smuggling. The Office of the Ombudsman begins its own probe into the death of Kian delos Santos. Commission on Elections Chairman Andres Bautista says he can explain the allegations in the impeachment complaint against him. Armed Forces Chief Eduardo Año says the military removed a pole marker planted on a Philippine-occupied island in the West Philippine Sea.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/uber-financial-assistance-help-drivers-ltfrb","title":"Uber to give financial aid to its drivers","date":"Aug 17, 2017 9:40 AM PHT","snippet":"Drivers will get assistance based on their performance for the past 28 days","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Uber on Thursday, August 17, extended financial assistance to its drivers after being suspended by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

Senate public services committee chairperson Senator Grace Poe arranged the meeting in the hopes of easing the burden of passengers affected by the suspension. Uber is requesting for a change in penalty – from a one-month suspension to a fine. While Poe said Uber is offering a \"generous\" deal, the LTFRB needs one more week to hear and decide on the matter. \"Masaya na medyo malungkot din.

Second, Uber also said that they would comply with the requirements. They added that they would provide compensation to their drivers and they would also pay any fine.) Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV explained that since the LTFRB already rejected Uber's motion for reconsideration on its suspension, effectively closing the case, a new petition has to be filed. The LTFRB is set to hear the new request next Wednesday, August 23. It remains unclear how soon they can issue a decision on it. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)

What exactly are the requirements for these permits?","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Regulatory Franchising Board (LTFRB) recently raised issues against Grab and Uber drivers over franchising permit violations. What does the LTFRB need from these transportation giants? It all started in July 2016, when the LTFRB, through Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008, suspended the acceptance of new applications for transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) permits of transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Grab. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the government review of the fare scheme. On July 23, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) released a statement on its Facebook page and cited issues of \"accountability of TNCs to passengers and operators alike, and the problem of fare surging scheme.\" \"Equally important issues for compliance is to make sure that TNCs and TNVS contribute their fair share of taxes to the government, and for TNVS to have the required garages to avoid illegal parking on streets to prevent traffic congestion,\" the DOTr said. TNVS permits are legal papers given to accredited TNCs. These are the qualifications for aspiring TNVS applicants prior to the moratorium: LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise valid for one to two years. (READ: LTFRB fines Grab, Uber P5M each for permit violations) The requirements for a CPC permit are as follows: New Certificate of Public Convenience by Kimiko Sy on Scribd  A CPC permit usually takes more time to process. While waiting for the CPC permit, LTFRB gives out a PA permit which is processed just for 7 to 10 days. Here is the cost for filing permits: Filing for a motion to get a PA permit requires a motion for extension of provisional authority to be executed by a lawyer, OR/CR from LTO Registration, receiving copy of the application for CPC, government-issued ID, special power of attorney (for a representative), and the receipt of the payment for motion. No more permits Since the suspension last year, LTFRB has not processed a single application for TNVS permits. However, Grab and Uber have admitted that 80% of their drivers are driving without either a provisional authority (PA) permits or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Those whose status have been held following last year's suspension order can continue to file for PA permits until their CPCs are released.  The LTFRB’s latest estimate is that of the 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers,15,400 at most have adequate papers to operate. Discussions of Grab and Uber’s suspensions raised numerous complaints from commuters, especially those taking metered taxis. (READ: #CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes) The suspension dilemma is also heavily reflected on 50,000 Grab and Uber drivers operating around the country. “Hindi ko naman po alam na kailangan naming kumuha ng ganoon sa LTFRB kasi hindi malinaw ang instructions nila sa amin, ang hirap po kasi lahat kami mawawalan ng trabaho,” said Grab driver Dodie Cabatu. (I didn't know that we had to get [those forms] from the LTFRB because their instructions weren’t clear to us. It’s hard because a lot of us will lose our jobs [because of this]).” Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. Pending the LTFRB decision on the MRs, the TNCs' undocumented drivers can continue their services. The LTFRB has also ordered the Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the TNCs after June 30 this year. – with reports from Hannah Mallorca/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-uber-riders-minority-ltfrb","title":"Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB","date":"Jul 26, 2017 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'Sila lang ho 'yung maingay sa social media, [but] definitely government will not budge, we will not be allowed or influenced because of social media,' LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they're just noisier on social media.

This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,\" said Karlo Nograles.  Poe and the Nograles brothers filed similar bills, which would require transportation network companies and drivers (TNDs) to “exercise diligence” in ensuring their drivers would comply with all requirements and obligations set by the government. Among the requirements to be able to operate a TNC specified under the measures are as follows:  The bills would also require Uber and Grab to strictly adopt a zero-tolerance policy on the use of drugs and alcohol of its drivers.

Susan Fowler, an engineer who worked at Uber until the end of last year, said in a blog post that her manager made sexual advances shortly after she joined the company. She said she complained to upper managers and the human resources department, but was told that it was the man's \"first offense\" and that they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing a \"high performer.\" Fowler told of later meeting other women engineers at the company who said they had experienced similar harassment, including inappropriate behavior from the same manager she had reported. Men engineers were gifted leather jackets, while women were left out, she noted. \"In the background, there was a game-of-thrones political war raging within the ranks of upper management in the infrastructure engineering organization,\" Fowler said, comparing the scene to a hit fantasy television drama in which rival nobles viciously vie for power. \"It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor's job.\" A New York Times report on Friday depicted a \"Hobbesian environment\" at Uber in which workers were pitted against one another and misbehavior by top performers was overlooked. The story included tales of a director shouting a homophobic slur in a meeting; a manager threatening to beat an underperforming worker with a baseball bat, and women employees groped at a Las Vegas retreat where cocaine was used in bathrooms during private parties. #DeleteUber  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that Holder and another attorney will look into issues raised by Fowler, \"as well as diversity and inclusion at Uber more broadly.\" Holder was former US president Barack Obama's attorney general between 2009 and 2015. The lawyers were to be aided by journalist Arianna Huffington, who is a member of the Uber board. The controversy threatened to revive a #DeleteUber campaign triggered by Kalanick's short-lived plan to be part of a business advisory group for US President Donald Trump. Kalanick quit the group under pressure from a growing movement to stop using the ride-sharing service because of his connection to the new administration, and by extension an anti-immigrant agenda. As the campaign picked up speed, rival Lyft's popularity accelerated. \"Now, they are facing yet another avoidable backlash where people are disconnecting themselves from the (Uber) app,\" analyst Enderle said. \"Lyft is likely the biggest beneficiary, but at the same time, Google is coming to market with its Waze carpool service – this is the wrong time for Uber to have this.\" Snowball of trouble Meanwhile, the race to develop self-driving vehicles took a turn on Thursday when Google's parent company Alphabet filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing it of using stolen technology. Alphabet contends that a manager at its autonomous car subsidiary Waymo took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto, Uber's self-driving vehicle unit, in a reported $680 million deal. Waymo is calling for a trial to stop Otto and Uber from using technology taken in a \"calculated theft.\" Waymo also wants unspecified damages in what it described in court documents as \"an action for trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement and unfair competition.\" San Francisco-based Uber acquired commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto last year as it pressed ahead with a pursuit of self-driving technology. \"We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,\" an Uber spokeswoman said. In the eyes of consumers, Uber's controversies pack together into \"a snowball of trouble rolling down the hill getting bigger and bigger,\" said brand management specialists Bruce Turkel. Once people switch to a new ride-hailing app, they are likely to stick with it and forget about using Uber, according to analysts. \"Uber can do all the damage control they want, it's not going to change who they are at their very core,\" Turkel said. \"And, unfortunately, when you watch Travis Kalanick when he is on TV or whatever, he has that frat boy kind of attitude anyway.

There can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber.\" Susan Fowler, an engineer who worked at Uber until the end of last year, said her manager made sexual advances shortly after she joined the company at the end of 2015. She said she complained to more senior managers and the company's human resources department, but was told that it was the man's \"first offense\" and that they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing a \"high performer.\" Fowler said she was given the choice of joining another team, or staying in her position with the possibility of receiving a poor performance review from her manager. Other the next few months, Fowler said she met other women engineers at the company who said they had also experienced similar harassment, including alleged inappropriate behavior from her previous manager. After lodging various complaints of what she considered inappropriate behavior, Fowler said she was told by her manager that she was \"on thin ice\" for reporting his boss to human resources.  The HR department, meanwhile, told her that she might be the problem, not the men she was reporting. Fowler said she was blocked for a transfer and given a negative performance review without justification. She now works at Stripe, a company that helps businesses handle online and mobile payments.

We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the reported incident and are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and stand ready to assist them in every way we can,\" Uber said in a statement to Rappler.  According to a report by the Philippine Star, the 22-year-old woman was allegedly raped by the driver, identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, while en route from Camp Crame to Katipunan Avenue last July 27. The driver allegedly forced the female passenger to hold his genitals and to perform oral sex on him before she was able to escape. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has issued a show cause order to Uber and has set a hearing on August 10. The incident comes after another transport network company (TNC), Grab, also received a complaint regarding one of its drivers, who allegedly threatened to shoot a passenger.

The same day, a new law comes into force that allows the Hungarian authorities to block \"a provider of taxi services operating without a proper dispatch center\" for up to one year. An Uber statement said that the legislation passed by parliament last month \"makes it impossible for Hungarian drivers, in spite of having licenses and properly paying taxes, to use their own vehicles to make money.\" The US company has become one of the world's most valuable startups, worth some $50 billion (44 billion euros), as it has expanded to more than 50 countries including 21 EU member countries other than Hungary. Last month Saudi Arabia pumped $3.5 billion into the company to help it fund further growth. The firm says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers. But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Last week a French court fined it 800,000 euros ($900,000). In Europe, Uber has filed complaints with Brussels against France, Germany, and Spain, arguing that restrictive national or city policies are in violation of European Union law. 'Punishing innovation' Since Uber entered the Hungarian market in November 2014, around 1,200 drivers and 160,000 riders have registered with the company. The new law followed months of protests by licensed taxi drivers who complained that orders have been decreasing sharply. They say Uber drivers – who often charge significantly cheaper fares – should be subject to the same stringent rules regulating official cabs. Uber's head in Hungary told AFP on Wednesday however that the legislation \"punishes innovation, is disadvantageous to both competition and consumers, and provides no advantage to the state.\" Around 39-40% of Uber trips were ordered by foreigners, and most of their clients were between 20 and 35 years old, Zoltan Fekete said. \"On several occasions we signaled our willingness to help put together a modern set of regulations, but there was no interest for that,\" he said. A government ministry said that Uber had decided to leave Hungary \"rather than to agree to operate legally and compete fairly on the market with tax-paying Hungarian taxi drivers.\" \"The government supports innovative solutions, but is committed to ensuring that players on the passenger transport market operate according to the law and pay taxes under equal terms,\" said a statement by the National Development Ministry published by the MTI news agency. \"Uber acquired an edge over other market competitors by dodging taxes and disregarding rules and regulations.\" Uber hopes one day to restart its service in Hungary, said Robbie Khazzam, the firm's boss in Central Europe. \"Hungary stands out as the exception and not the rule,\" he told AFP. \"We are definitely not giving up on Hungary.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/european-union-warning-curbing-companies-uber","title":"EU warns against curbing companies such as Uber","date":"Jun 3, 2016 10:55 AM PHT","snippet":"'Absolute bans of an activity should only be a measure of last resort,' says the European Commission","body":"BRUSSELS, Belgium – The European Union (EU) on Thursday, June 2, warned member states against banning \"sharing economy\" services such as Uber and Airbnb, especially if only to protect existing businesses from competition. \"You cannot put an absolute ban on activity if the reason for this is only protecting a business model,\" EU industry commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said at a news briefing in Brussels. Online success stories like ride-sharing app Uber and Airbnb have caused major disruptions in Europe, with taxi drivers and hotel owners furious at the inroads made by the main actors of the sharing economy. In response, local governments and national regulators have moved to limit access to the websites, and in some cases, outright banning them. Uber has filed complaints with the EU against France, Germany, and Spain to hit back, arguing that the national or city policies are in violation of European law. The EU is currently deliberating a response to those complaints as well as another lodged by an individual in Berlin who is unhappy with a local law against websites like Airbnb. The EU's Bienkowska warned against government overreach as she unveiled the European Commission's recommendations on how the EU's 28 member states should better regulate the sharing economy. \"Absolute bans of an activity should only be a measure of last resort,\" said the commission's guidelines. While the advice from the EU executive is non-binding, it does offer an indication on how the commission will respond to the complaints by Uber. \"We invite member states to review their regulation in the light of this guidance and stand ready to support them in this process,\" Bienkowska said. In one idea, the EU encouraged regulators to differentiate \"between individuals providing services on an occasional basis and providers acting in a professional capacity.\" It also recommended that sharing economy actors \"fully cooperate\" with national tax authorities amid accusations that the services facilitate tax evasion. Uber welcomed the commission's proposals. \"The European Commission has made it clear that EU laws protect collaborative economy services against undue restrictions,\" said Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman. \"Member States should review regulations that undermine the development of such services,\" he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/piala-uber-2016-indonesia-korea-selatan-perempatfinal","title":"Tim Uber Indonesia tersisih pada perempatfinal","date":"May 20, 2016 9:21 AM PHT","snippet":"Indonesia tersisih dari Piala Uber 2016 setelah kalah dari Korea Selatan 0-3 pada perempatfinal","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Tim Indonesia tersisih dari turnamen final Piala Uber 2016 setelah kalah dari tim Korea Selatan 0-3 pada babak perempatfinal yang berlangsung di Stadion Bulu Tangkis Kunshan, Tiongkok, Kamis, 19 Mei.

Jakarta authorities are just the latest to target Uber, an app that has sparked protests from taxi drivers in several countries as it allows customers to hail private rides via their phones. \"In our opinion, the service Uber provides is just like a taxi service, but it doesn't have a license to operate as one in this city,\" Jakarta transport agency chief Muhammad Akbar told AFP. \"Registered taxis in Jakarta have to meet certain standards, including some to do with safety, so if Uber wants to operate here, it must be held to the same standards – otherwise it's not fair.\" Authorities are concerned that Uber's service will undercut the current market for taxis and that the company may evade tax if not registered legally, Akbar said. The agency is working with the ministry for IT and communications to have the app shut down, Akbar said, adding that it had invited Uber to a meeting a month ago but never received a response. Uber could not be immediately contacted for comment, but has fended off similar criticism in the past by explaining its service merely links customers looking for a ride with those who have a car, and does not own or operate its own fleet. Uber began by linking users of its apps to luxury car operators, but then decided to offer a broader selection of cars and include a ridesharing option. In Jakarta, it currently only links to services offering paid-for trips in upmarket cars.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber's ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced \"competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.\" Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – \"to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.\" The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission's clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal \"within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.\" In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly.

From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,\" Fernando Aldaba, dean and professor of economics at the Ateneo de Manila University and a senior fellow of Eagle Watch, told Rappler. \"Without competition, prices may go up and quality of service might deteriorate,\" Aldaba added. Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8 – or two weeks from now. (READ: Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks) Pola del Monte, a 28-year-old editor in Quezon City, said this gives her no choice but to rely on Grab for ride-hailing services. \"I'm an Uber loyalist – largely by force of habit, but also because I prefer its sleeker interface, have had too many pleasant riding experiences, plus I find their customer service impeccable. I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,\" she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. \"Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won't be able to compare prices now. We won't know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,\" she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. \"If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,\" Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  \"If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,\" PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan's statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. \"As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,\" the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a \"dynamic surcharge\" would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. \"With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,\" the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/uber-dpwh-partnership-traffic-planning","title":"Uber, DPWH join forces for better traffic planning","date":"Dec 5, 2017 3:35 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing company will share traffic data with the government to help analyze how infrastructure projects affect traffic","body":"MANILA, Philippines – In a change of pace from the past months, transport network company (TNC) Uber now finds itself teaming up with the government to help ease the country's traffic woes. Uber Philippines and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday, December 5. The ride-hailing company will build the Movement for Manila platform with the help of the DPWH Planning Department \"to provide inputs for enhanced traffic management and troubleshooting.\" The tie-up will see Uber share its traffic data with the DPWH in order to help the government agency analyze how its infrastructure projects affect traffic and eventually to determine which projects are most needed for various locations. Uber gets its data from the daily routes of thousands of Uber drivers. \"We realized that all this data can be useful not just for us but also for society and for the government as it can be used for better planning,\" said Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua at the signing. \"We think this data can be sliced and diced to better understand how our roads and infrastructure [are] currently supporting travel, how fast it takes [motorists] to go from one point to another. It helps us not only evaluate past projects but also inform how planning can go forward,\" he added. Effects of infrastructure projects In practical terms, Cua pointed out that the DPWH can use the data to determine how opening new infrastructure projects like roads and bridges would affect travel time not just in a particular area, but also in surrounding places. An example of this is how Uber determined that opening the NAIA Expressway earlier this year cut down the average travel time from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2 to San Lorenzo Village in Makati City by 3.8%, and from the same terminal to Marina Bay in Pasay City by 4.7%. Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar noted how the government needs to use technology to solve a lot of the metro's problems, particularly as the DPWH will be entering a crucial stage in the Build, Build, Build program implementation next year. \"With this partnership with Uber, we'll be able to plan our traffic much better. The wealth of information they are providing will help us cut down on the time it takes [to] analyze traffic... and it will be very important in our short- and long-term planning,\" Villar said. Open to other firms, too Uber and its users will be relieved not to find the company at odds with the government this time. The DPWH said it was in fact Uber which approached them with the idea for the partnership. The government agency added that it is open to partnering with other firms for data which can be used in the planning and implementation of projects. Uber has been involved in legal issues with the government in recent months, culminating in it being suspended for a month and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said Tuesday that hackers had compromised personal data from some 57 million riders and drivers in a breach kept hidden for a year. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber is notifying drivers whose license numbers were swiped, and offering them credit and identity theft protection. The company also said it is notifying regulators, and monitoring affected rider accounts for signs of fraud. How did hackers do it? The stolen data are thought to have been stored on an external server of Amazon Web Services – a division of Amazon offering cloud data storage facilities. Two hackers gained access to it using the log-ins of Uber employees taken from an account at the software development platform, GitHub.  What did Uber do wrong? Aside from the problem of safeguarding the data, Uber sought to keep the breach quiet. CEO Khosrowshahi – who took over at the end of August – has acknowledged wondering why it took Uber a year to make the breach public. He also admitted that the company failed in not immediately informing the users affected or the authorities. His predecessor, Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick, was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, according to a source familiar with the situation.  Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, the source said.  Who is affected? A lot of people. While Uber has not said exactly which users were affected, the number of 57 million is enormous, considering that former CEO Travis Kalanick said in October 2016 – roughly when the breach took place – that Uber had 40 million users worldwide. Sean Sullivan, security advisor at Finnish company F-Secure, suggested that companies tend to downplay the number of people affected, while the hackers exaggerate their \"booty\". An outside party was needed to undertake an in-depth investigation, he said. Gerome Billois, cybersecurity specialist at consultancy Wavestone, said that nasty surprises or \"aftershocks\" could not be ruled out. \"In the case of private individuals, we need to wait a bit,\" he said.   What are the consequences for users? For the moment, not a lot, even if the volume of the data would represent a sizeable market value for cybercriminals. Users may perhaps receive a lot of spam or ads on their mobile phone. Experts quizzed by the Agence France-Presse pointed out, however, that with the names, email addresses and telephone numbers, hackers could orchestrate phishing campaigns by creating fake Uber accounts, asking users to \"confirm\" their banking details or to click on links that would allow viruses into their devices.   What can you do? \"Not a lot,\" said Jerome Robert, marketing chief at EclecticIQ, a Dutch company specializing in cyber threats. Users could try to protect their identity by providing the wrong date of birth, or a false telephone number. But \"in the end, that won't work because there are verifications,\" he said. It may just be a matter of crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. We all more or less have to trust the apps we download. But don't provide personal data to apps that aren't trusted. At the very least, use an alternative email address for these sorts of services, not your main address. What are the consequences for Uber? Fines, certainly, especially as Uber sought to hide the breach. In the United States, Donald Trump's administration might be more lenient than that of his predecessor Barack Obama, said Sean Sullivan of F-Secure. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation is scheduled to come into force in May 2018. Under that measure, companies that have lost personal data may be fined up to 4% of their revenues. In the case of Uber, this would be $260 million.  Sullivan said Uber might find it more difficult to have its licence renewed in London, not to mention the bad publicity. \"If they don't pay a fine, they are going to pay a cost.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-deal-sell-stake-softbank","title":"Uber gives green light for sale of stake to Japan's SoftBank","date":"Nov 13, 2017 2:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) 'We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,' a company statement says","body":"NEW YORK, USA (UPDATED)  – Scandal hit ride-sharing company Uber on Sunday, November 12 (November 13, Manila time) announced a deal to sell a stake to Japan's SoftBank, as the firm looks to turn a new page ahead of its planned IPO by 2019. The move was unveiled shortly after reports emerged that its former CEO Travis Kalanick and an influential investor had buried the hatchet in a long feud that paved the way for the acquisition. \"We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,\" the company said in a statement Sunday evening. \"We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber's long-term potential,\" it added. \"Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance.\" But SoftBank refused to confirm the news when contacted by AFP and said it was not planning to issue any statement on Sunday. The Japanese group, founded by billionaire Masayoshi Son, expressed an interest several months ago in investing around $1 billion in Uber for a stake of at least 14 percent.  But the deal was threatened by conflict between Kalanick and US venture capital firm Benchmark. The latter filed a lawsuit against Kalanick, accusing him of fraud, breach of contract and of plotting to manipulate the board of directors to allow him to return as CEO following his resignation in June. The two parties reportedly reached an agreement on control of board seats, which included Benchmark putting its lawsuit on hold -- while Kalanick will allow directors to vote on his future appointments to the 3 seats he oversees. A deal would be positive for Uber, which is looking ahead to the future in the wake of recent repeated scandals, among them workplace sexual harassment allegations. 'Gorilla' investor Meanwhile, SoftBank has been diversifying through investment for several years, and has ventured into sectors outside its core mobile technology business – completing deals with the likes of French robotics firm Aldebaran and e-commerce with Chinese giant Alibaba.   It is sending tremors through the tech world with a its massive new Vision Fund -- a venture capital fund with $100 billion coffers intended for startups and expected to dominate the industry so thoroughly it's playfully referred to as a \"gorilla.\" \"SoftBank shows a remarkable amount of bravery, confidence and optimism to look to apply this much money in technology,\" said Bill Maris, who started Google Ventures nearly a decade ago and runs his own California-based investment firm Section 32. \"I can't say it's a wrong bet, if you think the trends in tech will continue in the future. I would be much more worried if SoftBank was saying tech is dead.\" Some investors worry that the Vision Fund will buy into startups at high prices, overinflating the market, while crowding out other investors and prolonging the time it takes for young companies to go public.

The Israel-based startup working on a self-piloting, electric aircraft was at the Wall Street Journal D.Live (WSJDLive) conference Tuesday with a vision of \"Uber meeting Tesla in the sky.\" Bar-Yohay spoke of a future in which people could take Uber to a regional airport, then use another smartphone application to summon an Eviation electric plane to whisk them inexpensively to destinations hundreds of miles away. \"What would happen if Uber meets Tesla in the sky?\" Bar-Yohay asked rhetorically in an interview. \"I think it makes super-commuting not so super anymore; you just go. That is the vision.\" Eviation was at the Paris Air Show earlier this year with a small-scale prototype, and is intent on returning with a full-scale electric aircraft capable of carrying passengers in 2019. Funding takeoff Co-founders were at the Wall Street Journal technology conference to rustle up funding, with a goal of about $20 million. The startup founded about two years ago has been paying its way out of pocket, with some help from the Israeli government, going through about $10 million to date, according to Bar-Yohay. The new infusion of cash will be used as fuel in a race to be first to market with an electric airplane, this one designed to carry up to nine passengers and two crew members. \"We have been sprinting full-speed for the past two years,\" Bar-Yohay said. \"I don't think it is going to be winner takes all, but it will be winner takes a hell of a lot.\" In his eyes, the appeal was obvious.  Instead of spending hours in a car traveling hundreds of miles, an electric plane summoned on-demand to a regional airport would get passengers to far-away destinations quickly and inexpensively. Eviation is out to take advantage of small, typically underutilized regional airports, making them lift-off spots for on-demand flights. \"It needs to cost like a bus ticket,\" Bar-Yohay said of such a service. \"If you build the plane electric, like a Tesla, the cost of operating becomes ridiculously low.\" \"Never break\" Electric components for airplanes are a fraction of the cost of comparable parts for engines in traditional aircraft, and are more reliable, according to Bar-Yohay. \"You need to build machines that will never break; electric components are naturally like this,\" Bar-Yohay said. Eviation plane batteries are spread out in more than a dozen places, so \"no matter what hits you, some part of the aircraft will have the power to keep you going,\" according to Bar-Yohay. The expected range of the Eviation plane will be about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers). The vision is to have the aircraft be self-piloting, so it could be summoned by an app or be available as desired for people who pool resources to buy one. \"The market can become transportation for the masses,\" Bar-Yohay said. \"We are already getting used to not owning everything.\" He notes that while society may be grappling with trusting self-driving cars, self-piloting aircraft have been around for decades. \"We are not here to steal clients from Cessna or other aircraft makers,\" Bar-Yohay said. \"We are here to steal clients from Ford, GM, Tesla... because we can be cheaper per mile.\" He expected the first-generation Eviation aircraft to cost $2.5 million to $3 million. Bar-Yohay noted there is competition forming already, including rideshare leader Uber researching vertical-takeoff vehicles to fly passengers short distances. \"It's the next blue ocean out there,\" Bar-Yohay said of the on-demand flight market. \"There is going to be room for everybody.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/uber-driver-offer-puzzle-riders","title":"Uber driver offers puzzles to commuters while stuck in traffic","date":"Sep 28, 2017 5:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Because of the country's terrible traffic, Uber driver Boyet Ong makes use of his hobby to make his passengers happy","body":"MANILA, Philippines – In a country where traffic is considered one of the major transportation problems, an Uber driver found a way to entertain his passengers in the midst of it.

The rest of the day is for sleeping and eating) Commuters’ woes  Barrientos also raises his concern for commuters who depend highly on Uber.  “I had this one passenger, it was before dawan, female, she was by herself. Drunk. When she got in the car, she passed out. You can’t do that in a taxi or a jeep,” he said. Another time, a mother booked a ride for his grade schooler son on Uber. According to Barrientos, she just let him drive the small boy to his school.  What happens to commuters like them?  The Uber driver said that the TNVCs introduced an unprecendented trust between commuters and drivers.  \"What’s the reason why riders use Uber? It’s the service that they are getting. They are getting their money’s worth and peace of mind brought by good service. No one will ask for additional fare. The car smells nice, it's clean, and the air conditiioner works,\" he explained. True to this statement, commuters immediately took to social media to express their anger and rally behind Uber drivers on Monday night.   According to commuters, the decision will cause unnecessary \"hassle for commuters.\" This was echoed by Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, calling the suspension “cruel and absurd.” She said she is set to call LTFRB officials for a meeting on Wednesday, August 16. Moving forward  Despite Uber's suspension, Barrientos remains optimistic that the transport network will not allow the suspension to last for days.  \"Nung una, ang unang pumasok sa isip ko ay hindi magtatagal yan. For sure, hindi papayag si Uber at magpa-file ng motion for reconsideration,\" the Uber driver said. (I initially thought that the suspention will not last for long. For sure, Uber will fle a motino for reconsideration to overturn the decision)  In fact, around lunch time on Tuesday, August 15, Uber filed a motion for reconsideration and resumed its operations.  LTFRB, however, clarified that the order still stands, and that Uber drivers are still prohibited from plying the roads even though the ride-hailing company has filed a motion for reconsideration. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/editorials/grab-uber-government-medieval-times","title":"[EDITORIAL] #AnimatED: Grab and Uber in medieval times","date":"Jul 31, 2017 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"The LTFRB should know better. It is best to ride and confront change, not resist it.","body":"A disservice to all.  This is what the government, through the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), is doing in its wish to impose its authority and medieval mindset on Grab and Uber. Its pronouncements on the app-based riding services have confused more than clarify, raised questions more than answer them, and agitated more than serve thousands of already harried urban commuters. The mess began when the LTFRB threatened to apprehend all Grab and Uber drivers by July 26, 2017, if they remained without permits or provisional authorities. It also ordered the two companies to pay the fine of P5 million each, which they eventually did. This came a year after the agency did the correct thing, which was to suspend the issuance of such permits after these transport network vehicle services (TNVs) deployed drivers beyond the number they were allowed. The LTFRB promised at the time to draft new regulations, which it has so far failed to do. Worse, it lost the companies’ accreditation papers. Now it's saying perhaps these drivers should have minimum working hours. Or that government should tax them.  The revived crackdown smacks of bad faith on one hand – are well-entrenched taxi operators in control of LTFRB? – and incompetence on the other, given the agency’s short-sighted and wish-washy approach to a modern-world management problem. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) To be sure, app-enabled transport services are not beyond criticism or abuse. In America, Europe, and Asia, governments and established taxi operators have risen up in arms over the way technology has allowed public-interest companies to escape regulation and basic standards.  The disruption at some point prompted some governments to recommend banning Uber, an idea that’s akin to controlling news distribution online.  Yet, it cannot be denied that Uber and Grab serve commuter needs; they're efficient and can be tracked – both in how much they're paid or where they travel. In the Philippines, they fill a void left by a perennially weak mass transport system. So why fix what isn't broken? Technology should serve to motivate us to do things better. Taxi operators, for example, can band together for their own app or 3rd-party channels. Instead of spanking tech-savvy drivers, the LTFRB should help drivers and companies upgrade skills and use technology to improve services, strengthen safety for commuters, and connect with each other to discuss welfare issues, such as better pay and insurance. The data collected over the years by Grab and Uber can also help government better understand consumer behavior – as well as the unaddressed weaknesses of the transport industry. Singapore has started doing this. As what we learn every day in this new world, it is best to ride and confront change, not resist it. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/go-beyond-save-grab-uber","title":"Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:50 PM PHT","snippet":"'What I support is a more comprehensive campaign that calls for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike'","body":"Here's an unpopular opinion: I don’t exactly rally behind the #WeWantUberGrab campaign. What I support is a more comprehensive campaign calling for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until Wednesday, July 26, 2017. Responding to this, Grab and Uber drivers united and launched an online campaign calling on the LTFRB to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers.  I, however, think that saving Grab and Uber alone will not really solve our traffic woes in Metro Manila.  Let me start by sharing my experience with a taxi driver – whose name unfortunately escaped my memory – almost two years ago. Unfair boundary system  He told me that taxi drivers like him work 24 hours a day just so they could reach their boundary and earn enough to support his family for two days.  “Paano 'nyo nakakaya (How do you do it)?” I asked.  “'Ayun Ma’am, lumalaklak ako ng Cobra at kape. Minsan sinasamahan ko pa ng Red bull. Ganoon talaga eh,” he answered with a smile. (Ma'am, I drink Cobra and coffee. Sometimes, I would also take strong energy drinks like Red Bull. That's just how it is.) He said he would spend the following day in bed, gathering his strength for the next cycle on the road. The next day, he would start work at 5 am, weathering the traffic, unforgivable flooding and rain, and fatigue, and clock out exactly 24 hours later. He said this as a matter fact, without the slightest hint of complaint or regret. That is how he is able to put food on the table. How could he complain about it? Since then, I’ve made it my mission to ask every taxi driver I get to meet if this is how they lived. Majority of the taxi drivers – from the youngest to the 72-year-old driver I met – affirmed this.  The only ones who control their time and sleeping habit are those who are rich enough to own a cab. And that’s just a speck of the total taxi driver population in the Philippines.  The plight of bus drivers and conductors who would cram their vehicles with standing passengers during rush hour is no different. They are also limited by the boundary system that defines our public transportation system. This is the reality of many taxi and bus drivers in the country: the public transportation system is plainly inhumane to them.  False dichotomy How does this relate to the \"We want Uber and Grab\" campaign?  The current narrative surrounding the campaign creates a false dichotomy between the ride-sharing apps and traditional public utility vehicles. It is as if to favor one thing, you should be against the other.  But that misses the whole point.  It is true that Grab and Uber have served as an answered prayer for many commuters in Metro Manila,  However, Grab and Uber alone cannot solve traffic. In fact, they only add more franchises and cars on the road, benefitting only a certain portion of the commuter population that could afford its pricing rate on a daily basis. And how they leave more carbon footprint is a totally different matter.  What the country needs is better public transportation which essentially means fewer and more efficient modes of transportation – emphasis on train systems and buses – that have the capacity to transport more commuters.  Because of the false dichotomy, we forget that there are good and bad drivers regardless if they drive a cab or a Grab or Uber car. We’ve read it on social media, in news reports.  There are kind and honorable taxi drivers like Gener Jarito and Jhun Ochavo as there are rude drivers with the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).   Because of the false dichotomy, we also miss the fact the LTFRB is not only being inconsistent with its regulation of franchises. It has also failed to fix the boundary system in taxis and buses, and has fallen short in delivering its mandate to provide a decent means of livelihood for regular public utility vehicle drivers.  What is clear and sure is that it is wrong for the government to cut the lifeline of a temporary and functional solution such as Grab and Uber without providing a long-term solution to traffic for the public.  Proposal What should the government do then?  We are on the cusp of technological disruptions. Airbnb has redefined accommodation. Social media has empowered citizen journalism. Amazon has taken the retail industry on a whole new level. As early as now, we should be asking ourselves: In this age of technological disruptions, how do we make sure everybody gains from them? Right now, with the discussion on public transportation in the Philippines, the onus largely weighs on the government to make sure this gets addressed.  This is why I agree with Grab when it said that “we must level it up by improving the quality of service of other modes of public transport, and bring them at par with TNVS not by back-pedaling on the standards in place we have today.” In fact, the government might just be able to hit two birds with one stone. By learning how to adapt these advancements to benefit our taxi drivers, the government might be able to finally solve the problem surrounding the outdated taxi and bus boundary system that benefits no one but the franchise holders. While doing so, the government should definitely expedite its plan on improving, building, and expanding our train and bus systems. Let us step back and go beyond Uber and Grab. Let us pressure the government to provide an efficient public transportation that we deserve.  Because, honestly, with an efficient train system and better public transportation in general, discussions like these would be irrelevant and everyone would be happy. – Rappler.com   Raisa Serafica is a community manager and social media producer for MovePH, Rappler's civic-engagement arm "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-self-driving-car-manila","title":"Want your self-driving car in Manila?

The others are Boston, Sydney, and Washington D.C. Rappler was invited to the Future of Cities summit organized by Uber at its headquarters in San Francisco.  The country's lead agency on traffic, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), is one of the few who have gained initial access to the program that was launched in January although product manager Jordan Gilbertson said they will roll out data on other cities soon.  \"The root of problem is there is insufficient data to make informed decisions. The question that we put before the crew was: How can we prompt cities to make the types pf data-driven decisions using the resources that Uber has available,\" said Gilbertson.  Uber head of transportation policy and research Andrew Salzberg said there's a lot of interest in Manila because of the challenging traffic situation and the availability of reliable partners who can implement projects on the ground. In 2015, navigation app Waze gave Metro Manila the notoriety of having the \"worst traffic in the world.\" It was based on the rating of Waze users meaning Filipino drivers have the most complaints about the roads compared to other nationalities using the mobile application. Uber Movement aggreggates data collected every day to show how much time it takes to ply certain routes depending on several factors such as days of the week, time of the day, or activities undertaken in the area. \"By delivering all these insights to cities, we can start to give back to communiites in a meaningful way while also solving these very real problems that are impactings the cities in which we operation. This has been the core of what has become Uber Movement,\" said Gilbertson. Uber Movement can show how a baseball game, closures of certain routes, or maintenance operations, for example, affect total travel time to and from certain locations. Uber envisions this data could help governments make informed decisions when they draft transportation policies.  Salzberg gave assurances data that the privacy of Uber individual users are protected. Only aggregate data on travel times are shared and no demographics are revealed.  \"We’re showing aggregated trips happening between two zones and the average time, bucketing them by hours. You cannot get individual trips here, which is important. If we show individual trips, there is a lot of privacy implcations to that and it’s not necessarily as easily useful for the kind of traffic planning pruposes we’re building for here.,\" said Salzberg.

The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2016-008 on Thursday, July 21, directing its technical division and regional offices not to accept any applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS), particularly those of Uber, GrabCar, and Uhop proposing to ply the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.  Transportation Spokesperson Cherie Mercado said the circular was issued due to the rising volume of TNVS applications and the department’s review of the fare scheme. As of July 15 this year, the transportation department said applications for TNVS units rose to 29,151. The department said there are 5,727 pending applications for GrabCar units, 23,292 for Uber units, and 131 for Uhop units. In October last year, TNVS applications were only at about 3,500. LTFRB said the suspension of TNVS applications will take effect once the circular is published in at least one newspaper. Second time This is the second time the government has suspended accepting TNVS applications. In December 2015, a Quezon City court ordered the government to stop accepting Uber and GrabCar applications for 20 days. This was after the LTFRB faced complaints on the accreditation of TNVS, particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units. Uber Technologies, Incorporated said it respects the decision of LTFRB, but asked the agency to \"maintain the spirit of Department Order No 2015-011.\" \"We respect the decision of the LTFRB to suspend the acceptance and processing of new TNVS applications. However, this decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars,\" Uber said in a statement released Friday, July 22. \"We ask the LTFRB to maintain the spirit of Department Order No. 2015-011 that was meant to promote innovation, reliability, and consumer choice in mobility so that we can all help solve the problem of traffic congestion together,\" the service provider added. Grab Philippines echoed Uber's remarks. \"Grab respects the decision of the LTFRB on revisiting the policies of TNVS...We are hopeful that the playing field will be leveled among all transport providers and that this will direct the focus on providing the best passenger and driver experience,\" it said in a statement. \"Thousands of aspiring TNV operators will be affected by this latest development, along with the thousands of passengers who rely on our services daily. At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,\" Grab added.

San Francisco-based Uber, a smartphone app that connects passengers and drivers around the world, said on Wednesday, June 1, the funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would help Uber's global expansion. The PIF acted roughly 6 weeks after Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced a wide-ranging plan to transform the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. At the heart of the Vision 2030 plan is a revamped PIF. \"Like many, I am caught off guard by this massive investment in Uber,\" said Michael Maduell, president of the US-based Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute which studies public investment funds. \"However, it telegraphs to the world that Saudi Arabia will be a major player when it comes to sovereign wealth fund investing in the future.\" Vision 2030 aims to turn the PIF into the world's largest state investment fund, with $2 trillion in assets. These would include proceeds from the sale of state-owned real estate and other property, as well as roughly $100 billion from a share offer for less than 5% of state oil firm Saudi Aramco. Profits from the investment fund would help economic diversification and provide an alternative to oil revenues that have fallen by about half since 2014. The collapse has accelerated Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income. \"The Public Investment Fund will not compete with the private sector, but instead help unlock strategic sectors requiring intensive capital inputs,\" Vision 2030 says. \"This will contribute towards developing entirely new economic sectors and establishing durable national corporations.\" The aim is to participate \"in large international companies and emerging technologies from around the world,\" the plan adds. Maduell said that in future moves, he would not rule out PIF's working with US industrial firms to expand manufacturing in the kingdom. It may also seek exposure to venture-backed companies. 'PIF on the prowl' \"I see PIF on the prowl for strategic development investments with leading companies to spur job growth, enhance sector diversification, and prosperity in the country,\" he told AFP. The head of the PIF, Yasir Al Rumayyan, said in a statement about the Uber deal that it fits with Vision 2030. It is an investment which marks a new approach by Riyadh, a European diplomat said. With such a major stake abroad, the government is \"following the example of Prince Alwaleed,\" the diplomat said. He was referring to the kingdom's most high profile businessman, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose Kingdom Holding Co has interests ranging from the Euro Disney theme park and Four Seasons hotels to News Corporation and Citigroup. Late last year Kingdom Holding became the second-largest shareholder in Twitter, and invested more than $100 million in Lyft, a San Francisco-based rival to Uber. Christopher Dembik, an economist at France's Saxo Bank, said the PIF is adapting to the transformations under way in the Saudi economy and pursuing a diversification strategy which is not particularly risky. Uber is part of the so-called gig economy in which people work flexibly and without labor benefits. Dembik said the business model is proven and still represents significant growth opportunities. Other potential PIF targets in that category could be Airbnb, the online site for accommodation, or US-listed \"fintechs\", financial start-ups which use computer and Internet technology to develop innovative financial services and applications. \"It's of course a significant strategic choice on the part of Saudi Arabia but one whose scope should not be exaggerated,\" Dembik told AFP, explaining that the fund will not abandon traditional sectors such as real estate. Although Uber is the kingdom's first major foreign investment since Vision 2030 was unveiled, PIF last year acquired a 38% stake in the engineering unit of South Korea's Posco for $1.1 billion. Prince Mohammed, who leads the country's main economic development council, told Bloomberg News in an interview published April 1 that PIF was looking at \"two opportunities outside Saudi Arabia\" in the financial industry. Only about 5% of the fund is currently invested abroad, Bloomberg News said. – Ian Timberlake, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/pemerintah-cari-solusi-uber-bluebird","title":"Pemerintah cari solusi 'adil' untuk taksi online dan offline","date":"Mar 22, 2016 9:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Luhut menyampaikan bahwa pemerintah menemukan indikasi pelanggaran pada aksi demo hari ini.

During a Senate hearing on Monday, January 25, the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said there are currently 1,497 accredited transport units at NAIA. These include rental cars, coupon taxis, and the cheaper metered taxis. But this number is not enough for the tens of thousands of passengers arriving at NAIA's 4 terminals. In 2014, MIAA recorded 46,418 passengers arriving daily at NAIA. The average number of metered taxi and coupon taxi users daily, however, were only at 10,777. MIAA general manager Jose Angel Honrado said that the airport will need to have more taxi units available, especially since the number of arriving passengers daily has gone up to 50,210 in 2015. \"We increased passenger load, but our supply of transportation units is not growing,\" Honrado said. More vehicles needed To address the problem, Honrado said the MIAA, in coordination with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), are considering allowing app-based transport network vehicle services like Uber and GrabCar to pick up passengers at the airport. Honrado added that they have also asked the LTFRB to accredit more metered taxis inside NAIA, since passengers prefer these to the more expensive fixed-rate coupon taxis and rental cars. Currently, unaccredited white metered taxis are allowed to pick up passengers at the arrival areas of NAIA Terminals 2 and 3 during peak hours.  In the past, regular taxis were only allowed to pick up new riders if they also brought departing passengers to the airport. Angara, vice chairman of the Senate tourism committee, earlier said the lack of available transport services at the airport may affect tourism in the country. Lawmakers have pointed out that the shortage of available metered taxis at the airport – much cheaper than the fixed-rate airport cabs – have forced desperate passengers to agree to exorbitant rates from rental car operators. Angara earlier filed Senate Resolution 1702 to investigate the issue of overcharging taxi drivers. \"It's good that there's a demand for transport services from the airport. But we have to match that by increasing the supply of available taxis,\" Angara said. Traffic, infra projects to blame During the hearing, MIAA outlined several factors behind the shortage of available taxis for arriving passengers. At the top of the list was the worsening traffic in Metro Manila and ongoing construction of the NAIA expressway. Honrado said that because of heavy traffic, it takes 2 to 6 hours for taxis to return to the airport to pick up more passengers. In a 12-hour period, taxis make only about 3 or 4 trips, Honrado said. Angara, however, said the ongoing infrastructure work aggravating traffic are only \"short-term problems that will soon be fixed.\" \"In the long term, we still don't have enough taxis serving our passengers,\" he said. Honrado said MIAA is already in talks with Uber and GrabCar to discuss how to set up guidelines for the drivers and how the airport authority can monitor trips of passengers using the app-based services. The MIAA chief said they are still waiting for Uber's proposal. Meanwhile, Honrado said GrabCar has already proposed setting up an iPad at the airport that passengers can use to book trips. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/seattle-uber-drivers-join-union","title":"Seattle lets Uber drivers join union in US first","date":"Dec 15, 2015 8:53 PM PHT","snippet":"'This legislation is a huge victory for all the underpaid workers seeking to rebuild the labor movement and fight for a decent life,' says a council member","body":" LOS ANGELES, United States – Seattle has passed a measure allowing drivers of smartphone-based taxi companies like Uber and Lyft to unionize over pay and other working conditions, the first move of its kind in the United States. The Pacific Northwest city's council unanimously backed the bill. Mayor Ed Murray was quick to say he would not sign the measure, which can become law without his support.  The firms have fought such measures, arguing they offer more flexibility and pay than traditional companies to their drivers, who they consider independent contractors. \"This legislation is a huge victory for all the underpaid workers seeking to rebuild the labor movement and fight for a decent life,\" said Council member Kshama Sawant. \"Massive corporations such as Uber, Lyft, FedEx and others exploit loopholes around independent contractors to try and prevent workers from unionizing.\" Under the ordinance, a majority of drivers paid to give rides will be given the option to join a union, and penalties will be applied for companies that fail to comply. The measure applies to all such drivers, whether they are paid by a taxi company, a for-hire company or a so-called transportation network company like Uber that uses an online-enabled platform to connect drivers and passengers. \"I remain concerned that this ordinance, as passed by the Council, includes several flaws, especially related to the relatively unknown costs of administering the collective bargaining process and the burden of significant rulemaking the Council has placed on City staff,\" said Murray.  \"Since my concerns were not adequately addressed in this legislation, I will not sign this bill.

It’s on helping your economy grow,' Uber Senior Advisor David Plouffe says on the sidelines of #APEC2015","body":"MANILA, Philippines — With rivals and critics slamming the ride-hailing company for its aggressive tactics, San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, Incorporated positioned itself as a solution to the Philippines’ economic challenges. \"In a country like the Philippines, debate is not on regulations. It’s on helping your economy grow,\" Uber Senior Advisor David Plouffe told a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit 2015 in Makati City on Monday, November 16. As of now, Uber is in 66 cities in the Asia-Pacific region. Plouffe said that around 1.1 million drivers are on the Uber platform as of November 2015. \"Our growth does not come from people who are not taking taxi trips. It comes from people not driving their own cars. There’s a lot of economic activity,\" Plouffe added. Five-year-old Uber has asked all 21 APEC member economies to allow the company to operate legally and safely in their jurisdictions. Despite its young age, Uber continues to face difficulties in making inroads into China, Korea, Japan, and Canada, partly due to regulatory hurdles. 'Smart regulations' \"The misperception about Uber is that we don’t want to be regulated.\" Plouffe said. \"We are eager to work with governments to have smart regulations.\"  The Uber chief advisor said one characteristic of having \"smart regulations\" is not putting a cap on the number of Uber vehicles operating in a certain city. \"That has two really negative impacts: One, something almost all of us can do — drive — is being taken away from us as an opportunity to make additonal income,\" Plouffe said. \"Two, it forces people into car ownership, as there is not enough supply on the road to give them an alternative to get around locations,\" he added. Behavior change In the Philippines, there are about 4,465 vehicles used for ride-hailing services, a letter from a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) showed. For Plouffe, these vehicles are helpful to address Manila's car-centric roads. In underserved markets where transportation is too hard – taking much time and money – most people turn to car ownership, he said. \"What comes as we scale up – in places that are transportation deserts – is behavior change around car ownership,\" he said. \"With Uber, even if we are just in the infancy [stage], 10% of millennials say they had given up a car.\" \"Not just that, over a million of people are earning because of the Uber platform, and we want that number to continue to grow,\" he added. So far, the Uber chief advisor thinks the Philippines has the best framework and transportation regulations in the world, aimed at easing traffic congestion through \"efficient use of road space.\" \"Now, we are sitting down with the government and non-profit organizations and saying, 'We’ve got a really powerful platform.

Despite its young age, Uber has been accused by rivals and critics of using unreasonable tactics, while others have praised its way of disrupting the unreliable, regular taxicab industry.

But in a letter signed by Antonio Enrile-Inton Jr, who is a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), dated Thursday, October 8, the board is facing opposition and complaints on the accreditation of TNVS, particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber cars plying and earning from the public transportation. According to Inton’s letter, there is a total of 4,465 accredited TNVS units to date; while around 3,500 applications are being studied by the LTFRB. The LTFRB board member, in his letter, asked Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya’s approval to impose a moratorium on acceptance of applications for TNVS units. But this was opposed by Uber’s Alexander, saying \"instead of the government regulating the cap, this is I think where the private industry does a great job.\" \"[Imposing a] cap is not the right answer. The right answer is to let us, as a business, manage. The part of the game is building demand.

Regular taxi operators went through tedious process and inspection just to get franchise for our units. Foreign companies, like Uber, are given leeway, while local operators had difficult time just to get license,\" Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) President Jesus Manuel Bong Suntay said in a phone interview. The government earlier announced the introduction of 4 new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion through \"efficient use of road space.\" These new categories are the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. After the announcement, the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) also in May laid out the rules and regulations for the new transport categories. Under the guidelines, those who want to operate a TNVS should always be in good standing with its accredited Transportation Network Company (TNC). \"The franchise for the TNVS will be revoked if the accreditation is cancelled by the TNC or if the certificate of the TNC is revoked by the Board,\" the LTFRB memorandum circular read.

Sagcal added that technological developments that enabled Uber \"are here to stay.\" \"We understand the threat that taxi operators feel due to the TNVS classification as concern about their business interests.

For this, he is called an \"ubrepreneur.\" The writer discovered Escolar's story when the Filipinio immigrant picked him up on an Uber booking. He writes: \"Then it hits me: I’m not in Gavin’s car. I’m in his mobile showroom. He’s not just an Uber driver. Nor is he just an entrepreneur. He’s an Uberpreneur, using the ridesharing app to promote his jewelry business.\" The same report said Escolar was able to earn over $250,000 – or about P10 million – in one year.  Escolar immigrated from the Philippines to start a jewelry company in San Francisco and became an Uber driver to make ends meet. He recalled of his early days as an Uber driver, \"My passengers surprised me.... I thought they would be silent or on the phone. But most people wanted to talk. When I mentioned my jewelry, they asked for business cards, but I didn't have any.\" Then it struck him to go beyond business cards and actually sell the jewelry in his car. \"I never solicit. I only keep subtle hints to spark conversation if they notice,\" Escolar was quoted in Forbes. \"If they don't notice, they probably wouldn't be my customer anyway.\" Escolar designs all his jewelry himself. \"As a child, I was intrigued by the technical watercolor renderings of jewelry that my father kept on his desk, and I have been fond of gemstones ever since,\" he wrote on his website. And it turns out that the global ride-sharing app does not discourage their drivers from being entrepreneurial.  Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvell told Forbes, \"One of the greatest things about the Uber platform is that it offers economic opportunity for a variety of drivers...in more than 260 cities around the world.\" According to CBS News, there are now over 160,000 Uber drivers across the United States. In the Philippines, Uber is only available in Metro Manila. Without giving an exact figure, Uber regional manager Michael Brown told the Inquirer that Uber will be signing \"tens of thousands\" of new drivers in Metro Manila.  Will we then find the next \"Uberpreneur\" in the Philippine capital? – Rappler.com    Uber Philippines' Laurence Cua is one of our speakers in #ThinkPH The Next Big Idea: Platform Thinking.

The popular but controversial service has come in for heavy criticism in India since a young company executive said she had been raped by an Uber driver, who had previously been accused of assault. Local media reports say Uber failed to carry out a background check on the 32-year-old man, who had spent several months in jail on a separate rape charge before being acquitted in 2012. Uber is banned from operating in Delhi with immediate effect and the company will be \"on a blacklist\" regarding the provision of transport services in the future, a government statement said. \"(The) Transport Department has banned all activities relating to providing any transport service by the www.Uber.com with immediate effect,\" said the city government in a statement. It also said it had cancelled the licence and registration certificate of the driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was remanded in custody for three days on Monday while police investigate. Police arrested him on Sunday after tracking him down to his native Uttar Pradesh state, where he had fled. San Francisco-based Uber, which lets customers hail and pay for taxis or private vehicles via a smartphone app, has expanded at breakneck speed since it launched in 2009 and is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries. But its rapid growth has caused deep tensions, especially in Europe, where rival taxi companies have protested that Uber cars are not subject to the same stringent regulations as they are. 'Despicable crime'  The alleged attack has again raised the issue of women's safety in India, days before the second anniversary of a fatal gang-rape of a Delhi student that unleashed widespread outrage. \"It is really sad because this was one app you thought you could trust,\" said Delhi housewife Anu Chadha. \"This incident has shocked everyone.\" The victim, an executive at a finance company who is in her mid-20s, dozed off in the taxi as she was returning home from dinner with a friend.  She told police she woke to find the taxi parked in a secluded place where the driver assaulted and raped her, before dumping her near her home in north Delhi.  Although the driver threatened to kill her if she reported the crime to police, the woman took a photo of the car's number plate before alerting the authorities. Delhi police said it appeared that Uber had not followed the standard procedures for private cab services in the city. Special commissioner Deepak Mishra said Sunday that early investigations showed GPS had not been installed in the taxi and police background checks were not conducted on the driver. However Uber said it had complied with city regulations. Background checks are \"currently absent in (Delhi's) commercial transportation licensing programs,\" chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a statement.  \"What happened over the weekend in New Delhi is horrific. Our entire team's hearts go out to the victim of this despicable crime,\" the statement said. \"We will do everything... to help bring this perpetrator to justice and to support the victim and her family in her recovery.\" The latest incident comes as Uber tries to undo damage to its public image from a series of embarrassing incidents, including negative comments about the media from a top executive who proposed setting up a team to dig up dirt on critical reporters. That controversy widened when a BuzzFeed report indicated that executives at Uber had taken liberties with access to an internal company tool called \"God View\" that showed where riders and their drivers were located at any given time. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/new-york-ordered-pay-debt-hit-taxi-drivers","title":"New York City ordered to pay debt-hit taxi drivers $810 million","date":"Feb 21, 2020 3:04 PM PHT","snippet":"New York's taxi industry has been upended by the arrival of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft","body":"NEW YORK, USA – New York City must pay $810 million to its debt-ridden cabbies, the state attorney general said Thursday, February 20, accusing the city of fraudulently inflating the value of permits needed to drive its famed yellow taxis. Letitia James, head prosecutor for the state of New York, said an investigation by her office showed that the auction price of thousands of permits, known as medallions, had been artificially inflated by hundreds of millions of dollars between 2004 and 2017. The attorney general's office alleged that the Taxi and Limousine Commission knew in 2011 that the price of medallions had passed actual value. Yet the administrative body \"published false and misleading medallion prices\" in a number of cases, James' office said, causing the price of a single medallion at auction to spike from $283,300 in 2004 to $965,000 in 2014. The city allowed brokers and top players to collude on prices, the prosecutor said, as the TLC encouraged drivers to use the medallions as collateral for loans. The state's prosecutor said medallion prices were fraudulently set so high that drivers could not pay them off with their earnings from cab operation regulated by the city itself. \"These taxi medallions were marketed as a pathway to the American Dream, but instead became a trapdoor of despair for medallion owners harmed by the TLCs unlawful practices,\" James said in a statement. \"The very government that was supposed to ensure fair practices in the marketplace engaged in a scheme that defrauded hundreds of medallion owners, leaving many with no choice but to work day and night to pay off their overpriced medallions.\" New York's taxi industry has been upended by the arrival of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft. More than 950 licensed taxi drivers have declared personal bankruptcy since 2016, according to a New York Times investigation of court records published last year. Recent years have also seen a spate of suicides from cab drivers suffering under crushing debt. The sum of $810 million corresponds to the city's revenues from medallion sales and resale tax, according to the attorney general, and must be paid within 30 days or James' office intends to sue, it said.

TeamSpeed said the LTFRB had repeatedly given assurances that they would not put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cars in the country. The LTFRB supposedly only changed its mind recently. \"Nu'ng nasa Senate hearing kami, ang sabi ay walang cap, then all of [a] sudden, [in the] past technical working groups bigla na lang nagbago in a snap (When we were at the Senate, they said they would not put a cap, then all of a sudden, in the past technical working groups they changed their mind in a snap),\" the group said. TeamSpeed will appeal the decision of the board, and will demand the data or the rationale behind limiting the number of TNVS cars to 45,700. The LTFRB estimated that Grab has 55,000 units and Uber has 77,000 registered in their systems. Around 50% of them cross between the two platforms – a practice called \"dual citizenship.\" \"Papatayin ninyo ang hanapbuhay ng mga Pilipino (You will kill the livelihood of Filipinos),\" TeamSpeed said, addressing the LTFRB. Why impose a limit? The LTFRB started limiting TNVS units as it believes these cars worsen the traffic in Metro Manila's clogged streets. The LTFRB previously said that as more and more cars are being brought into the metro every year, road-widening projects simply cannot keep up. Transport network companies (TNCs), or the companies that manage the ride-hailing apps, also found themselves in trouble as they allowed thousands of their drivers to operate despite lacking proper registration papers. The regulatory deadlock was tackled at the Senate, where lawmakers demanded that the LTFRB fix the mess immediately for the benefit of drivers and commuters.

On Monday, January 22, Poe said the LTFRB should be transparent in its decisions, citing the Executive Order on freedom of information (FOI). \"In this age of algorithms, LTFRB should make public the factual basis of its decision. Ilabas nila ang minutes ng meetings and consultations para alam ng publiko. (They should put out the minutes of the meetings and consultations so the public knows),\" said Poe. \"Such disclosure of a public document is what the FOI rules, issued by the President, require. Tulad namin dito sa Senado (Like here in the Senate), ang transcripts are made public. Walang (None are) censored or hidden,\" she added. Poe said that she's not questioning the decision, rather just asking the LTFRB to explain the scientific basis of cap. \"Malaki na ang inunlad ng data science, kaya maraming interesadong malaman kung ano ang justifications. Isang importanteng tanong: Ano ang baseline data na ginamit? Ano ang forecast model for future demand ang ginamit?\" she said. (Data science has greatly improved that's why many people are interested to know what are the justifications. One important question is: What was the baseline data used? What forecast model for future demand was used?) On Thursday, January 18, the LTFRB released a memorandum circular setting a \"common supply base\", limiting the number of cars operating under Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) to 45,700. Impact Poe highlighted the possible impact on both drivers and patrons of the service. The senator asked if consultations with patrons were done by the regulatory agency. \"If the most important components in the ride-sharing business, the customers, were consulted, was there a survey? Was the pulse of those who'll be affected were taken into account?\" Poe said in a mix of Engish and Filipino. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada explained that the numbers were computed based on the data submitted by ride-hailing application companies and the \"churning rate\" of drivers which takes into account those who decided to quit driving. (EXPLAINER: LTFRB requirements for Grab, Uber permits) Poe noted that the review should not be based on the churning rate but through an algorithm that determines demand and supply.  \"Given that there are currently about 100,000 TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,\" she said.

This was underscored in a panel discussion at the 2017 Social Good Summit held on Saturday, September 16. The discussion focused on the challenges to innovation in the Philippines, and what various groups have been doing to promote entrepreneurship in the country. Ongoing conversation The recent deadlock between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber reflects the challenges encountered by innovators clashing with government regulators. Uber is no stranger to controversy, encountering backlash in the places where it launched because its business model did not fit current transportation laws. The Philippines is unique in that respect, since it created new transport categories back in May 2015 to accommodate Grab and Uber's business models. In July this year, the LTFRB cracked down on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms, eventually leading to Uber's suspension and the imposition of a hefty fine. (READ: What's the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)  The issue sparked controversy, with some criticizing the LTFRB while others pointed out the need for accountability and regulation for these transport network companies. Lawyer JJ Disini cited this issue as he discussed the challenge of balancing innovation with the need for government regulators to do their job and protect the public interest. In other countries, some firms can try out new ideas by participating in a regulatory sandbox, where businesses are allowed to test out their innovative products or business models without following some legal requirements. The results and information generated from participating in a regulatory sandbox can be used by the government to craft regulations that better fit the public need, Disini said. This way, both innovators and regulators can work together to learn and refine the new business models. \"We need regulators to be there. Their job is to protect the general public, but we should also understand that they're constrained by that. At the same time, they want innovation as well. We do understand the complexities of the issues,\" Disini said. Supporting PH startups On the part of the government, there have been efforts among different government agencies to enable an environment where local startups can thrive. Rosemarie Edillon, planning and policy undersecretary of the National Economic and Development Authority, said entrepreneurship is key to helping the Philippine economy prosper. \"One of the big problems we're trying to address is the economy, and the way to have more employment is to have more employers. So we see entrepreneurship as one strategy,\" Edillon said. \"We actually need to grow much faster, and we need growth to be more inclusive. Key to that is entrepreneurship and innovation,\" she added. To help entrepreneurs and startups thrive, agencies like the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) have their own programs geared toward budding entrepreneurs. The BSP, for instance, has a credit surety fund program to help micro, small, and medium enterprises obtain loans from banks. The DICT, meanwhile, has launched a roadmap for digital startups, that aims to provide a framework for developing the Philippine startup ecosystem. \"It's so exciting today, we're glad that [Philippine startups] have become sexy,\" said Mon Ibrahim, undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology. For Diane Eustaquio, executive director of non-profit incubator IdeaSpace, encouraging millennials to take risks and overcome a fear of failure is crucial for boosting the local startup scene. \"We're conditioned to follow and not to challenge, so it's difficult for people to become entrepreneurs,\" she said.  \"I think that's the challenge, it's not in our culture to be allowed to fail... But it's that failure that allows you to try to be better than what you were before,\" she added. –Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/john-colombo-uber-indonesia-hari-buku","title":"John Colombo, bos Uber yang ingin Indonesia dikenal karena buku","date":"May 18, 2017 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Pimpinan Uber Indonesia ini menjadi penerjemah dan penyunting terjemahan buku-buku karangan Andrea Hirata","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia — Laskar Pelangi merupakan salah satu buku Indonesia yang terbilang sukses diterjemahkan ke dalam bahasa Inggris.

It is in no way comprehensive, but meant as an indicator to help with the burnout.","body":" Remember that Silicon Valley episode where Richard’s doctor tells him he aged 40 biological years in 7 weeks? While everyone held their bellies and laughed at that one, chances are, if you’re a startup founder, you didn’t join in. For the startup industry, that one was too close to the bone. That entrepreneurs should give up on their social lives, and live and breathe their business has been the mantra for startups ever since the industry bloomed. After all, if they do not give their “all,” and treat their business like their baby, how will they convince investors that they are building something of worth? However, it isn’t uncommon for even the most passionate entrepreneurs to crash out with too much stress, and the mental well being of people in the industry is definitely a cause for concern. Very successful people across industries have always sworn by a “pause” button in their lives, claiming it helps them refocus and come back with more energy. Here’s a list of habits that the uber successful weave into their weekends. It is in no way comprehensive, but meant as an indicator to help with the burnout. 1. Try to avoid the office space A Stanford study says our productivity levels go down when the workweek exceeds 50 hours. Spencer Rascoff, founder of Hotwire and former VP of Expedia says he checks emails, but otherwise spends time with his family on Saturdays and Sundays. That does not, however, mean he cuts himself off. “My weekends are an important time to unplug from the day-to-day and get a chance to think more deeply about my company and my industry,” he told Forbes. 2. Do something that recharges you Go on a drive, cross-train, practice on the piano, volunteer – pick anything that is not similar to the work you do all week and which also helps you be happy. Doing a different kind of acitivity helps your body and mind recover from the things that stress you all week. Richard Branson stays active with kite surfing, while Meryl Streep knits. 3. Kick out the FOMO  All week you are ensnared in a 100 meetings and countless emails. Take time out to be by yourself over the weekends. Catch up on sleep. Read a book, or just sit silent. Randi Zuckerberg says people should give up on FOMO (fear of missing out) to embrace JOMO (joy of missing out). Oprah practices meditation. 4. Fix your priorities Take this time to take a step back and regroup your thinking. Busy people, especially entrepreneurs, are so busy fire-fighting most works days that it is easy to lose sight of the big picture. Steve Jobs used weekends to remind himself of the small, forgotten things – the things that keep your work-life in balance, and to reset if needed. 5. Don’t disrupt the body clock too much Everyone from Disney’s Robert Iger to Jay Z to Bill Gates wakes up early – and they keep that momentum going on weekends. Disrupting the body clock too much will mean carry-over effects the next week. In simple words, sleeping too late on Sunday night will result in groggy Monday mornings. 6. Plan for Monday Twitter’s Jack Dorsey says he “takes off” on Saturdays, keeping Sundays for reflection, feedback, strategy, and getting ready for the rest of the week. Laura Vanderkam, author of What the Most Successful People Do on the Weekend, says successful people know that weekends are actually the secret weapon in professional success. “You need to hit Monday ready to go,” she says. – Rappler.com  This article was first published on Tech in Asia.  About Nivedita: I like good apps, tech, books and food, not necessarily in that order.

Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday giving it an estimated valuation of some $80 billion, one of the biggest tech listings in recent years but rather lower than its earlier hopes of around $100 billion. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in cities around the world. It will also come in the rear-view mirror of a troubled market debut for Uber's largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15% of its value since its March IPO. Strikes that took place Wednesday highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange, where Uber is set to list shares, with some signs reading \"Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.\" Similar actions took place in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington and in Uber's home town, San Francisco. Protests were held in Britain as well with drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow called on to log off apps and demonstrate outside Uber offices, according to the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. \"While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,\" Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. \"In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\" Lyft shares skid Uber's inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft's losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"UBER\" sometime next month. \"We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and 'little brother' to Uber,\" Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is \"paving a similar road\" to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the \"Amazon of transportation\" in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between \"skyports,\" taking off and landing vertically. Uber's platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-kidney-delivered-by-drone","title":"Like Uber, but for organs: first kidney delivered by drone","date":"May 4, 2019 10:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The specially designed high-tech drone was fitted with equipment to monitor the kidney along its 5-kilometer journey to its recipient: a 44-year-old woman from Baltimore who had spent 8 years on dialysis before the procedure","body":"WASHINGTON, USA – A kidney needed for transplantation has been delivered by a drone for the first time ever, the University of Maryland Medical Center said, a development that could herald faster and safer organ transport.

The drone, which required a special clearance from aviation regulators, took off at 1:00 am on April 19 and flew at a height of 400 feet (120 meters) for about 10 minutes before touching down at its destination. Doctor Joseph Scalea, who was among the team of surgeons that performed the transplantation, hailed the project's success and said drone deliveries could help overcome delays that destroy an organ's viability. \"The next run could be over 30 miles, or 100. The distance is relatively unimportant,\" he told AFP Wednesday. \"The most important part is, we were able to implement drone technology into the current system of transplantation and transportation.\" Current transport methods involve expensive chartered flights or even variable commercial flights, occasionally resulting in delays, and cost typically around $5,000. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, there were nearly 114,000 people on waiting lists for an organ transplant in the US in 2018. About 1.5% of deceased donor organ shipments did not make it to their intended destination while nearly 4% of organ shipments had an unanticipated delay of two or more hours. Scalea, who has founded a company that manages data for organ shipments, likened the system to an Uber-like service that would prove eventually prove less costly. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/madrid-barcelona-taxis-strike-uber-cabify-ride-hailing","title":"Madrid taxis join Barcelona strike against Uber","date":"Jul 29, 2018 12:05 AM PHT","snippet":"Taxi drivers in Spain demand that the number of ride-hailing vehicles should be limited","body":"MADRID, Spain – Taxi drivers in Madrid went on strike Saturday, July 28, in solidarity with Barcelona cabbies protesting against \"unfair competition\" from Uber and Cabify.

The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode, with an operator behind the wheel, when it hit a woman walking in the street in the city of Tempe late Sunday, according to the San Francisco-based company.  The victim was hospitalized and later died from her injuries. \"Our hearts go out to the victim's family,\" an Uber spokesperson told AFP. \"We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.\" Uber said it had temporarily halted its use of self-driving cars for testing or customer rides in Tempe, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and San Francisco.  Tempe is one of just two cities -- along with Pittsburgh -- where the ride-sharing firm has been using autonomous vehicles as part of its regular passenger. The vehicle operator in the driver's seat was the only person in the car when the accident occurred, Uber said. The car was in police hands on Monday. Sunday's accident was the first fatal self-driving car crash involving a pedestrian. The first deadly self-driving car accident was reported in mid-2016, and involved a Tesla. Sheriff needed? The Tesla Model S, cruising on \"Autopilot,\" failed to detect a crossing tractor-trailer against a bright sky, killing the driver – who it later emerged had kept his hands off the wheel for extended periods of time despite automated warnings not to do so. Investigators at the US National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the Tesla crash was the combination of \"a truck driver's failure to yield the right of way and a car driver's inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation.\" Autonomous-vehicle technology has been touted as having potential to save fuel, ease congestion, and to save thousands of lives by avoiding accidents due to human error. As with the fatal Tesla crash, however, the deadly Uber accident is likely to stoke concerns that the industry is moving too fast.  Google-owned Waymo this month began using its self-driving trucks to haul cargo bound for the internet giant's data centers in Georgia, while rival Uber announced the use of self-driving semi trucks as part of an on-demand trucking service in Arizona. In September, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released new guidelines that permit more testing of self-driving cars. But America's non-profit Consumer Watchdog has warned that roads are being turned \"into private laboratories for robot cars with no regard for our safety.\" The group on Monday called for a nationwide moratorium on testing self-driving cars on public roads while investigators figure out what went wrong in the Uber accident. \"Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place,\" Watchdog technology project director John Simpson said in a statement. \"When there's no sheriff in town, people get killed.\" Car vision tests? US states set their own rules for roads, and a handful have passed laws allowing self-driving vehicles. California and Arizona have been particularly encouraging, hoping that companies developing autonomous technology in those states will create local jobs and facilities devoted to a promising new industry. Duke University robotics professor Missy Cummings is among the advocates of slowing down introduction of autonomous vehicles to avoid risk and get proper regulations in place. While machines are better at staying vigilant and reacting to routine situations, human drivers have proven superior at handling unusual or unexpected situations, according to the professor. Cummings reasoned that if people need to pass vision exams in order to get driving licenses, so should self-driving cars. She noted a case in which putting stickers on a stop sign could fool autonomous car sensors into seeing it as a sign indicating a speed limit. \"If we are still learning at this rate, and still uncovering major problems, it begs the question of why we are trying to put this technology into widespread use,\" Cummings told AFP. \"I am a big fan of the technology, but it is very unproven and experimental.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/viral-uber-driver-eating-plastic-bag","title":"VIRAL: Uber driver eating on the road inspires netizens","date":"Feb 4, 2018 12:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Netizens lauds Uber driver Teofisto Torres who was seen eating his meal from a plastic bag while driving through traffic in Metro Manila","body":"MANILA, Philippines — On January 28, a video of an Uber driver quickly went viral after he was seen eating meal from a plastic bag while juggling his Uber driver duties.

Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Khosrowshahi learned of the incident, the source confirmed. Promise to protect  In early 2016, Schneiderman announced a settlement with Uber stemming from an investigation into the company's handling and protection of riders' personal information. The probe was prompted by word of a hack, and by reports that Uber executives were able to track the locations of riders in real-time using a tool known internally as \"God View.\" The settlement required Uber to better protect rider data, and pay $20,000 for failing to tell drivers about the 2014 data breach in a timely manner. Schneiderman's office determined that the earlier hack took advantage of access information posted by an Uber engineer at software development platform Github. Computer security specialists interviewed by AFP said the recent breach apparently involved a similar slip with a password that was taken from Github and used to get into Uber data stored in the cloud at Amazon Web Services. \"The fact that attackers were able to compromise an Amazon Web Services account and not come away with credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other highly sensitive information could mean that Uber had controls in place to keep this kind of data very well-secured,\" said Covata vice president of security Mike Fleck. \"It’s also possible that the attackers just didn't look very hard and Uber got lucky.\" Hackers are known to take seemingly low-value information, such as email addresses, and build on them with what they can find or steal elsewhere to prey on victims, according to McAfee vice president of labs Vincent Weafer. \"On the hacker side, there is aggregation, tying disparate data sets together,\" Weafer said. \"There is no such thing as benign information; we really have to take better care.\" Law firm Keller Rohrback put out word on Wednesday that it is looking into the potential for a class action suit against Uber. \"By choosing not to disclose this massive data breach and attempting to mitigate the breach by paying the hackers to destroy the data, Uber has essentially rolled the dice with its customers' and drivers' personal identities,\" law firm partner Cari Campen Laufenberg said in a release. State law in Uber's home state of California calls on companies to disclose big data breaches without unreasonable delay, meaning the handling of the hack could herald a rough stretch of road there. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-board-trims-power-former-chief-kalanick","title":"Uber board trims power of former chief Kalanick","date":"Oct 4, 2017 10:26 AM PHT","snippet":"The board also votes unanimously to move forward with a billion-dollar investment by Japanese telco giant SoftBank","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber's board of directors Tuesday approved a plan that reins in the influence of ousted chief executive Travis Kalanick and opens the door to a colossal investment by Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. The proposal adopted by Uber's board also promised to put an end to in-fighting between Kalanick supporters and investors who suspected the co-founder was plotting a wily return to the head of the company. \"Today, after welcoming its new directors Ursula Burns and John Thain, the board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,\" Uber said in an emailed statement. \"SoftBank's interest is an incredible vote of confidence in Uber's business and long-term potential, and we look forward to finalizing the investment in the coming weeks.\" If the investment goes ahead as proposed, Softbank would directly pump between $1 billion and $1.25 billion into Uber at the San Francisco-based startup's current valuation of $69 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. As a secondary investment move, the Japanese group would put out an open offer to buy 14% to 17% of outstanding shares from large investors at a discounted price, the source said. Major investors who are unhappy with the leading smartphone-summoned ride share startup, or who want to cash-in on early investments that have multiplied in value, could take SoftBank up on the offer. Governance changes approved by the board hinge on the SoftBank investment taking place. Changes included eliminating \"super-voting\" power of some shares, such as those owned by Kalanick, to shift to a one vote per share model that would curtail the co-founders clout, according to the source. The board also endorsed Uber going public with a stock market debut by the year 2019. The board itself would expand from 11 seats to 17 seats, with two of the additions going to SoftBank and the other four being independent. One of the four independent seats would chair the board. Rule changes for the board would include requiring two-thirds or more of the board to approve any new chief executive hired before the stock market debut, signaling that newly-appointed boss Dara Khosrowshahi would be safely ensconced at the startup. If all of those piece fall into place, a lawsuit filed by early Uber investor Benchmark Capital will be dropped, ending a distracting power struggle at the company, the source told AFP. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/netizens-ltfrb-uber-suspension-lifted-philippines","title":"'Uber is back:'  Netizens celebrate as LTFRB lifts suspension","date":"Aug 29, 2017 6:19 PM PHT","snippet":"Meanwhile, some social media users direct their attention toward the LTFRB after its decision to lift the suspension","body":"MANILA, Philippines – This is not a drill.

Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body's crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What's the issue about? Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year. What's the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB's earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don't have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it's not their fault they are considered \"colorum.\" They point to the LTFRB's earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB's preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What's the LTFRB's position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their \"partner drivers\" to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it's standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a \"minority\" in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB's admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies' accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab's accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber's is set to expire in August.   How did the public react? With the LTFRB's crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government's move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What's next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it's considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-27-2017-evening-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, Aguirre, PCGG | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 7:52 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it is 'seriously considering' setting \"minimum\" working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre conducts a surprise inspection of the New Bilibid Prison. Malacanang says proposals to abolish the Philippine Commission on Good Government is driven by the need to streamline government, not politics. Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella claims the European Union and the Commission on Human Rights were invited to President Rodrigo Duterte's State of the Nation Address. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve 'in any capacity' in the U.S. military.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-27-2017-midday-edition","title":"Grab and Uber, Gorio, Trump | Midday wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the ride-hailing companies after June 30. State weather bureau PAGASA says Tropical Storm Gorio has slowed down but maintained its strength. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve 'in any capacity' in the U.S. military."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-july-26-2017-evening-edition","title":"Uber and Grab, Fariñas, Cayetano | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 26, 2017 8:12 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada says Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they’re just noisier on social media. House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas says Congress will form its own technical working group to propose amendments to the 1987 Constitution and pave the way for federalism. Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Cayetano says the proposed joint development with China in the West Philippine Sea should adhere to Philippine laws if it pushes through. State weather bureau PAGASA says residents of parts of Luzon should brace for more rain, as Tropical Storm Gorio enhances the southwest monsoon. Vatican finance chief Cardinal George Pell denies before an Australian court all charges of historical sexual abuse.   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grieving-lawmaker-demands-grab-uber-legal-accountability-ltfrb","title":"Grieving lawmaker demands Grab, Uber legal accountability","date":"Jul 25, 2017 9:09 PM PHT","snippet":"AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe lost his nephew two weeks ago in a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore","body":"MANILA, Philippines – If a crash happens involving a Grab or Uber driver, can the transport network companies (TNCs) be sued? This was the question that grieving lawmaker AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe posed to TNCs and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday, July 25, during the hearing of the House committee on Metro Manila. The committee hearing comes after the LTFRB encountered a regulation deadlock with the TNCs, as the LTFRB attempted to put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) cars in the metro. “Two weeks ago, namatay ang pamangkin ko sa Singapore, Uber. Yung driver hindi namatay, pero pamangkin ko namatay in Singapore…Let's say dito sa Pilipinas nangyari 'yun, sinong idedemanda ko?\" Batocabe asked. (Two weeks ago, my nephew died in Singapore [while riding] Uber. The driver didn't die, but my nephew did. Let's say it happened in the Philippines. Who do I sue?) LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III pointed Batocabe to Memorandum Circular (MC) 2015-015, which says that the driver, not the TNC, will be liable. “The TNC shall be liable for failure to exercise due diligence and reasonable care, except if such non-compliance is due to acts or omissions outside of the TNC’s control. However, such liability shall not extend to actions of drivers, who are independent contractors who provide the transportation services directly to passengers,” the MC read. But for Batocabe, the TNCs should also take a part of the blame since they also accredit their drivers as their “partners.\" “They can’t just operate with apps and everything without any regulation especially when it involves public utilities and public service [and when] it involves our people,” Batocabe said.  Batocabe recommended that the LTFRB issue a “remedial order” to reinforce their last MC increasing the accountability of the TNCs. Passenger insurance In their defense, representatives from Grab and Uber said that all rides booked through their applications are insured by the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency, setting insurance as high as P200,000 per passenger in case something untoward happens. They also said that they actively reach out to passengers when they get into trouble in their trips. Uber government relations chief Yves Gonzalez added that passengers can file a case against Uber if they find fault committed by the company itself. Meanwhile, the LTFRB chairman said he will raise Batocabe's concern in the board's technical working group meetings with Grab and Uber in the coming weeks. Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. In its July 11 order, the LTFRB directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. But Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration.

This comes after Grab and Uber on Thursday, July 20, filed separate motions for reconsideration (MR) with the LTFRB on its July 11 order that directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. The order was to take effect on July 26. Without the MR, undocumented Grab and Uber drivers may be fined as high as P120,000 and detained for as long as 3 months starting July 26. With the receipt of the appeals, the LTFRB would deliberate on whether to keep, revise, or lift its order within 15 days. Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua said they argued in their MR that the LTFRB did not inform them when it would lift the moratorium on accepting new driver applicants. This, he said, caused them to continue accept drivers, creating a backlog of drivers they allowed to operate. “Sa MC, hindi sinabi na bawal mag-accredit, so kami naman, patuloy naman kami mag-accredit (The MC did not say that we can’t accredit, so we continued because) we’re expecting na malilift ang moratorium anytime (that the moratorium would be lifted anytime),” Nabua said. “Eh kasi sinasabi naman nila na once makapagsubmit ng position paper i-rereview na natin rules and regulations ng TNCs at TNVS, pero 7 months have passed, wala pa ring nangyayari,”  he added.  (They were saying that once we submit a position paper, they will review the rules and regulations of TNCs and TNVs, but 7 months have passed, nothing has happened.) Uber lawyer Roberto Ramiro filed their MR a few hours later, but declined to give details.  The LTFRB reportedly reached a \"compromise\" with Grab and Uber during a meeting initiated by senators on Wednesday night, Senator Paolo Benigno \"Bam\" Aquino IV said on Wednesday. \"We're happy LTFRB, Grab and Uber reached an immediate compromise during the meeting with Senators Grace [Poe] and JV [Ejercito]. Now we can focus on a long term solution to ensure that the riding public is protected,\" Aquino said in a statement.

Uber has seen a shake-out in its executive ranks as it works through a series of scandals that included disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics, and covert use of law enforcement-evading software. It was likely that some departures of Uber executives were related to investigated complaints, but the company offered no details. \"All reported incidents to date have been investigated, and where they were corroborated we have taken swift, decisive action on the findings,\" Uber said in an email statement. \"We have been doing this consistently and with rigor for the past few months and will continue to do so as issues are raised.\" Uber is strengthening its human resources staff and processes, and recommendations for changes based on the internal investigation were to be released next week.

In the latest in a streak of damaging news for the ridesharing giant, Uber came forward about its \"Greyball\" software after a New York Times report which said the program aimed to deceive authorities in markets around the world. According to an Uber statement, the tool was used in cities where it was not banned from operating, and the main intent was to protect drivers from disruption by competitors using the smartphone application to interfere instead of summon legitimate rides. \"This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email reply to an Agence France-Presse inquiry. \"Whether that's people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret 'stings' meant to entrap drivers.\" Uber said the program was used in locations where drivers feared for their safety, and \"rarely\" to avoid law enforcement. The New York Times report, which said Greyball was used in several countries, cited interviews with current and former employees whose names were cloaked. The report said Greyball was part of a part of a broader program created to reveal people trying to us Uber in \"violation of terms of service\" and had the blessing of the company's legal team. According to the report, the program raised ethical and potential concerns, and had been a closely guarded secret in Uber's toolbox as it expanded around the world, clashing with regulators and traditional taxi groups. Adding to Uber woes The \"Greyball\" disclosure comes as accusations of sexism, cut-throat management, and a toxic work environment have Uber trying to pull its image out of a skid as competition revs in the on-demand ride market. Uber chief Travis Kalanick this week apologized, acknowledging that \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\" after a video showed him verbally abusing a driver for the service. The incident which circulated on social media was another hit for the image of the global ridesharing giant, which faces accusations of sexual harassment and a lawsuit contending it misappropriated Google's self-driving car technology. In the message to employees later, Kalanick wrote \"To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement.\" Uber is one of the largest investor-backed start-ups with a valuation estimated at $68 billion, and has operations in dozens of countries and hundreds of cities, even as it battles regulators and an established taxi industry. Kalanick also faced criticism for agreeing to be part of a business advisory panel for President Donald Trump, but then quit the panel amid a campaign by Trump opponents to delete the application. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-february-3-2017-evening-edition","title":"Ceasefire, factory fire, Uber | Evening wRap","date":"Feb 3, 2017 8:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Chay Hofileña","body":"Today on Rappler"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/google-uber-ford-volvo-lyft-coalition-self-driving-cars-2","title":"Google, Uber in coalition to promote self-driving cars","date":"Apr 27, 2016 2:35 PM PHT","snippet":"The tech giant and the ride-hailing company join Ford, Volvo, and start-up Lyft as founding members of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Google and Uber are part of a coalition unveiled on Tuesday, April 26, to push for a unified US legal code on self-driving cars as part of a broader lobbying drive to promote that technology.

The protesters adorned their vehicles with signs saying \"stop illegal taxis\" and rallied in front of parliament and government buildings, in an upsurge of anger at technology they say is threatening their livelihoods. As convoys of vehicles brought downtown Jakarta to a standstill, the demonstration turned violent, with protesters jumping up and down on vehicles that refused to take part, while stone-throwing drivers and rivals from app-based services clashed in several areas of the city.  Commuters faced morning rush-hour travel chaos, with even the motorcades of President Joko Widodo and the vice president getting stuck in the gridlock, making both men late for a meeting. Some people were left bloodied and bruised, with at least one person needing hospital treatment, while police detained 60 drivers from popular motorbike taxi-hailing service Go-Jek. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by US company Uber, one of the world's most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Herman, a 49-year-old taxi driver involved in the Jakarta protest, who goes by one name, said his earnings had dwindled from around 250,000 rupiah ($20) a day several months ago, to almost nothing due to the increased competition. \"I haven't paid my rent, and I need to feed my 3 children and my wife,\" he said. The demonstration, which also involved motorized rickshaw and bus drivers, came after weeks of rising tensions between traditional public transport operators in the sprawling, traffic-clogged metropolis of 10 million and a flurry of new ride-hailing services.    As well as Uber, Malaysian app Grab and Go-Jek are providing stiff competition for Jakarta's taxi drivers.   'Unfair competition' Traditional taxi, motorbike taxi, and other public transport drivers are angry that the new services are offering rides at lower prices, claiming they are not paying taxes, and are operating without official permits. \"Why should thousands of people who didn't pay tax, get a permit, or undergo car checks roam the roads freely while we have had to fulfil those duties?\" said Yohannis Rorimpandey, a protester who works for Blue Bird, one of Indonesia's biggest taxi groups. After rallying outside parliament, where several tires were set alight, a large group of protesters moved to the communications ministry, demanding that the minister block the apps. Uber and other app-based services currently operate in a legal gray area in Indonesia, and there is a division in the government about how to handle them. Indonesian law gives a narrow definition of \"public transport,\" which does not include the ride-hailing apps, and the transport ministry has sought to ban them.  However the communications ministry has refused to block the services, saying that it is committed to supporting the growth of the digital economy. Jakarta police said that up to 6,000 drivers were involved in Tuesday's protest, and 6,000 officers were out on the streets for the protest. It was the second anti-app protest by drivers in the space of a week, although the first was on a much smaller scale. However, there was little sympathy for the protesters among commuters caught in the rush-hour travel chaos in the heaving capital. \"Must it be anarchy? This only scares passengers and makes them prefer app-based taxis,\" said Twitter user Petricia Yuvita. And there was no sign that the government was ready to give in to the protesters' demands. \"You can't defy technology, it just needs to be regulated,\" said Vice President Jusuf Kalla. – Olivia Rondonuwu, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grabcar-uber-application-tro-quezon-city","title":"No Uber, GrabCar applications for 20 days – court","date":"Dec 4, 2015 1:59 PM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) The TRO does not apply to current operations of Uber, GrabCar, the Quezon City RTC judge clarifies","body":"MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A Quezon City court on Friday, December 4 ordered the government to stop accepting Uber and GrabCar applications for 20 days. This was after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) faced opposition and complaints on the accreditation of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS), particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber, GrabCar units plying and earning from the public transportation. In a 7-page temporary restraining order issued by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, Judge Santiago Arenas said the transportation department and LTFRB should stop \"accepting, processing, and approving of applications belonging to TNVS category…for a period of 20 days effective from date of receipt.\" It said that the petitioner, Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organization Transport Coalition, Incorporated (STOP and GO), \"has demonstrated that there is extreme urgency to issue TRO to prevent grave and irreparable injury and damages to the association’s officers and members because of their claim that they suffer less or low incomes…due to the sudden and uncontrolled increase in the number of TNVS utility vehicles running in the streets of Metro Manila.\" A separate letter signed by LTFRB Board Member Antonio Enrile-Inton Jr in October said there are a total of 4,465 accredited TNVS units to date, while around 3,500 applications are pending with the LTFRB. Asked if the TRO includes the suspension of operations of accredited TNVS, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez said in a phone interview with Rappler: \"It's unclear if the operations of existing certified TNVS units are included in the TRO. What is clear is they are asking to stop for 20 days the applications of TNVS.\" Ginez said that the LTFRB will meet with the Office of the Solicitor General, which is handling the case, that afternoon. \"We will discuss our remedy,\" he said, but declined to elaborate. But later on Friday, Arenas clarified that the TRO does not apply to current operations of Uber and GrabCar, as it only stops government offices from accepting TNVS applications at the moment. Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio \"Jun\" Abaya, meanwhile, replied to Rappler via a text message,\"We need to see a copy of the TRO and read its contents.\" Abaya is with President Benigno Aquino III in his working trip to Paris, Rome, and Vatican City and is flying back to Manila Friday. Implications In a statement, Uber said: \"Uber is aware of a decision issued earlier today by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court and is studying the implications of this decision upon Transport Network Vehicle Services performed by Uber partners. Uber was not a party to the proceedings that resulted in the court's decision and plans to coordinate closely with the DOTC and LTFRB.\" It added, \"Uber remains 100% committed to serving Filipino commuters and has confidence that the DOTC and LTFRB will continue working productively with Uber and other industry participants to issue all necessary permits under the prevailing regulations and assure the smooth operation of Transport Network Vehicle Services in Metro Manila and elsewhere in the Philippines.\" The imposition of a moratorium on the acceptance of applications for TNVS units was already opposed by Uber Technologies, Incorporated in October. \"[Imposing a] cap is not the right answer. The right answer is to let us, as a business, manage. The part of the game is building demand. So that is why when we come to a country like the Philippines, we spend a lot of money in marketing – to make people more aware of the service and make the pie much bigger,\" Uber Asia President of Business Eric Alexander told reporters in October. In a statement, GrabTaxi PH said the TRO has not been officially received by neither GrabCar nor the LTFRB. \"Until we receive the TRO, we will continue to operate as usual,\" it said. GrabTaxi PH added it is closely coordinating with the government and is hopeful it will get their support \"to be able to provide safe and convenient GrabCar rides in the country.\" \"Our commitment toward providing the highest quality of service remains.

The Delhi court last month convicted Shiv Kumar Yadav of abducting and raping the 25-year-old passenger as she returned home from dinner with friends in December. Yadav, dressed in a white checked shirt, wiped tears from his cheeks as the judge read out the sentencing, the maximum possible jail term for rape. \"He will serve rigorous imprisonment, which shall mean imprisonment til natural death,\" Judge Kaveri Baweja told the court in New Delhi. Yadav, 32, was convicted last month of four charges – rape, abduction, intimidation and causing harm – and the prosecution had been expected to argue for the maximum punishment of life in jail. Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said in the courtroom the sentencing should send \"a message\" to society \"where a person cannot even think of committing such an offence.\" \"She is not the only victim, rather the whole society is the victim,\" he said, alleging Yadav had a \"criminal history\" dating back to 2001. California-based Uber was accused of failing to conduct adequate background checks after it emerged that Yadav had been accused of assaulting other women, although he had no previous convictions. \"This man has changed,\" defence lawyer Dharmender Kumar Mishra said of his client, adding he was the sole breadwinner for his poor family. \"On the day of his conviction, he cried... he had gone to the extent of wanting to commit suicide,\" Mishra said, adding that his client would appeal the sentence at a higher court.  Yadav's wife broke down in the courtroom, howling inconsolably, as the pair's crying daughters tried to console her. 'Rape capital'  Uber was officially banned from Delhi in the aftermath of the attack, but the ban has not been strictly enforced and the company's cars continue to operate in the capital. The former Uber driver was tried by one of the fast-track courts introduced in 2013 following the fatal gang-rape of a student on a bus in Delhi, a crime that sparked nationwide protests about dangers to women.  The rape occurred days before the second anniversary of that now notorious attack, which earned Delhi the title of India's \"rape capital\", and brought the issue of violence against women back into the spotlight. Yadav's sentencing was delayed from October 23 because of a shortage of police in the Indian capital, which was preparing to host a summit of African leaders. Uber set up its India operation in September 2013 and now works in more than a dozen cities. Last month India's federal government published new guidelines for web-based ride-hailing firms – including installing emergency alarms – a move seen as a boost for Uber's battle for legal status. India recorded 36,735 rape cases in 2014, with 2,096 of them in Delhi alone. Experts say those figures are likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/coins-ph-people-into-atms","title":"Uber for banking? Coins.ph turns people into ATMs","date":"Jul 21, 2015 11:44 AM PHT","snippet":"A new service on its Bitcoin wallet called 'Teller' turns anyone with a smartphone into an ATM, where you can deposit your money. Think Uber for banking.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Bitcoin startup Coins.ph has come up with a way for you to move money without having to deal with a bank. A new service on its Bitcoin wallet called “Teller” turns anyone with a smartphone into an ATM, where you can deposit your money. Think Uber for banking. Here’s how it works: say you need to make a deposit to send money to a relative. To do this, you would open your Coins.ph wallet and find a teller near you using your GPS. Tellers can be people or small retail establishments like convenience stores. Upon meeting, the teller collects your cash and transmits the equivalent amount in bitcoins into your mobile wallet, while charging a small fee for processing. The maximum amount per deposit is $50 (over P2,000). With your wallet topped up, you may remit bitcoins to your relative through your relative’s Coins.ph wallet if he has one, or his preferred mode of cashing out. Remittances can be cashed out through bank deposits, cardless ATM withdrawals, door-to-door delivery by logistics firms 2GO and LBC, or cash pick-up at partner pawnshops and remittance centers. Tellers dictate their own fees or the amounts they are willing to accept for deposits. The maximum amount each teller can accept will depend on his track record, says Coins.ph CEO Ron Hose. This method of moving money is new so it begs the question of how safe the whole process is, especially since you’re handing your cash to a stranger. Hose says Coins.ph is rolling out Teller first with existing money exchangers and retail establishments that are familiar with handling such transactions. These entities screen tellers, run identity checks on them, and train them. Soon, the technology will be extended to any retail store where Coins.ph does the screening and training. This is similar to how Uber manages its network of drivers. Also similar to Uber, a two-way rating system lets both customer and teller rate each other following a transaction. Catering to the unbanked Hose says the new service provides basic financial access to unbanked individuals. These people may be poor, live far away from bank branches, or don’t have proper documentation to open bank accounts. “Over a third of municipalities in the Philippines still don’t have any form of banking facilities and even in big cities, retail banks are only able to serve a small percentage of the population,” he tells Tech in Asia. The goal is not to render banks obsolete but to provide a way for them to reach consumers they wouldn’t normally cater to. “It costs too much to put up branches everywhere, resulting in over two billion adults who are still unbanked,” Hose explains. “We think this will augment banks in areas that are hard for them to serve. Our vision is to help the banks drive services there, not to replace them.” Founded in early 2014 by Hose and Runar Petursson, both Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Coins.ph’s mission is to accelerate financial inclusion in Southeast Asia through mobile and the Bitcoin blockchain technology. Bitcoin has now become more competitive with traditional remittance services. Filipinos based overseas send home about $24 billion in remittances each year and pay 8% of this amount in fees. Remitting through Bitcoin takes away these fees (if done through your Bitcoin wallet) or significantly lowers them (if it’s done through Bitcoin remittance firms). Still, Bitcoin adoption in the Philippines is in nascent stages – there are only a few startups that allow for exchange of Bitcoin into fiat money. By growing the options for converting Bitcoin, startups like Coins.ph hope to widen its adoption in the country. – Rappler.com Editor's note: This article was first published on Tech in Asia."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/uber-france-bosses-trial-illegal-practices-taxis-protest","title":"Uber France bosses to face trial for 'illegal' practices","date":"Jun 30, 2015 10:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber France and two of its bosses will go on trial in September over the company's allegedly \"illegal\" ride-booking practices after violent protests by taxi drivers against the app","body":"PARIS, France – Uber France and two of its bosses will go on trial in September over the company's allegedly \"illegal\" ride-booking practices, prosecutors said Tuesday, June 30, after violent protests by taxi drivers against the app. Uber France, its director general Thibaud Simphal and director for Western Europe Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty are being charged with \"misleading commercial practices, complicity in the illegal exercise of the taxi profession and illegal use of private data,\" the Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement. The two Uber bosses handed themselves in to police on Monday for questioning in relation to a probe launched in 2014 of the San Francisco-based company. The investigation is targeting the UberPOP service offered by the company, in which clients are put in touch with cheaper, unlicensed drivers who are generally everyday people trying to make a bit of extra money. The service has raised the hackles of cabbies around Europe who complain of unfair competition from drivers who do not face the same regulations as they do, and undercut their pricing. (READ: Judge bans Uber in Spain) UberPOP has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and it continues to operate. A taxi strike in France last week turned violent as drivers set fire to vehicles and blocked highways, creating a headache for thousands of tourists. The French investigation is also targeting the casual UberPOP drivers for \"illegally exercising the taxi profession,\" the prosecutor's statement said. One UberPOP driver in France has already been given a 15-day suspended prison sentence while 79 other cases are under way. A total of 202 fines have been handed out.  The Uber managers will appear in court on September 30.  The taxi strike in France last week saw some 3,000 cabbies block access to the capital's Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports. Ten people were arrested, seven police officers were injured and 70 vehicles were damaged in clashes between Uber drivers and taxi drivers. And on at least two occasions in Strasbourg in eastern France last week, taxi drivers posed as customers in order to lure Uber drivers to isolated spots where they were assaulted by cabbies and their vehicles damaged.

The charges, which carry a maximum penalty of two years in jail or a 20 million won ($18,150) fine, came with the company facing criticism and bad publicity around the world despite its high levels of popularity. Travis Kalanick and Uber's Korean partner MK Korea, a local rental car service operator, were indicted for violating a law on passenger transport services. Neither was detained, and it was not immediately clear whether Kalanick would visit Seoul for trial. Last year he showed up at a police station in Seoul for questioning. In South Korea, rental car service operators are barred from conducting passenger transport business using their cars. Uber said in a statement it would fully cooperate with the investigation and it is \"confident\" the court would make a fair and sensible judgment. \"We firmly believe that our service, which connects drivers and riders via an application, is not only legal in Korea, but that it is being welcomed and supported by consumers,\" the statement said. Uber, which operates in more than 50 countries, started its service in Seoul in 2013. Last year the company launched Uber Black, which links users with limousines and, in October this year, it unveiled UberX, which connects passengers with drivers of non-luxury vehicles. The Seoul city government, however, filed complaints with prosecutors, saying Uber's operations raised passenger safety issues and threatened the livelihoods of licensed taxi drivers. One million won reward City regulators have launched a crackdown on drivers and rental cars that cooperate with Uber, with a one million won reward offered for those who reported the company's activities. But Uber has vowed to continue its business regardless of the crackdown. South Korea's online community was split over the indictment, with some users describing Uber as illegal and supporting the crackdown on its service in order to protect domestic taxi drivers. \"Uber is illegal and endangers the livelihood of our taxi drivers,\" one user wrote on the popular Internet portal Naver.com. However, another user named SungNoChoi wrote: \"Uber is providing a service catering to our clients. Its fate should be decided by consumers.\" Uber is the most prominent of several smartphone apps that are shaking up the traditional taxi landscape in cities around the world. It has already faced significant resistance from regulators in several countries, who accuse it of unfair competition and a lack of standards. Uber has also sparked angry protests by cab drivers in France and other countries who fear it is chipping away at their client base. It made headlines this month when an Uber driver allegedly raped a passenger in New Delhi. Also on Wednesday the company apologised for raising prices as frightened people fled an armed cafe siege in the Australian city of Sydney last week.  The firm reportedly charged customers four times the regular fare to leave the area -- a move that sparked outrage. Globally Uber has defended surge pricing, arguing it effectively matches supply with demand by encouraging drivers to move to areas where there are shortfalls. It has, however, had to concede to cap surge pricing throughout the United States during national emergencies after reaching an agreement with regulators. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/uber-hit-misrepresenting-data-promote-ride-safety","title":"Uber hit for misrepresenting data to promote ride safety","date":"Nov 26, 2014 12:22 PM PHT","snippet":"","body":"The list of questionable corporate practices allegedly committed by car-sharing service Uber is getting longer.

Bagaimana dengan Tim Piala Uber?","body":" Hasil undian cukup menguntungkan didapat Indonesia pada putaran final Piala Thomas dan Piala Uber 2016, yang akan berlangsung di Kunshan, Tiongkok, pada 15-22 Mei mendatang.  Skuat Piala Thomas berada dalam Grup B bersama India, Thailand, dan Hong Kong. Sedangkan Tim Piala Uber masuk ke Grup C bersama Thailand, Bulgaria, dan Hong Kong. Menilik hasil Kualifikasi Zona Asia, Februari lalu, Tim Piala Thomas Merah Putih layak mendapat target muluk. Apalagi, di laga final, Jonatan Christie dkk. berhasil membungkam Jepang, yang merupakan juara bertahan Piala Thomas dengan skor 3-2. Amat wajar bila kemudian Pengurus Pusat Persatuan Bulutangkis Seluruh Indonesia (PP PBSI) membidik status juara grup sebagai langkah awal. Diakui Kepala Bidang Pembinaan dan Prestasi PP PBSI, Rexy Mainaky, di antara ketiga calon lawan, hanya India yang tidak boleh dianggap sebelah mata. “India memang kuat di sektor tunggal. Namun, kami pernah mengalahkan India di kualifikasi Piala Thomas 2016,” tutur Rexy, dilansir dari siaran pers yang diterima Rappler, Senin, 21 Maret. “Kami masih unggul di sektor ganda, jika dibandingkan negara-negara lain yang satu grup dengan kami. Tinggal bagaimana kami mengatur strategi untuk mengambil poin dari nomor tunggal,” kata Rexy, peraih medali emas Olimpiade Atlanta 1996. Pertemuan terakhir Indonesia dengan India di ajang Piala Thomas terjadi pada babak semifinal Kualifikasi Zona Asia 2016, pada 20 Februari lalu. Saat itu, Indonesia sempat tertinggal 0-1 lebih dulu, setelah Tommy Sugiarto gagal mengatasi perlawanan Srikanth Kindambi dalam pertarungan tiga game. Namun, tiga partai berikutnya berhasil dimenangi Indonesia. Lewat ganda Mohammad Ahsan/Hendra Setiawan dan Angga Pratama/Ricky Karanda Suwardi, serta tunggal masa depan nasional, Anthony Ginting, Indonesia menuntaskan pertandingan dengan skor 3-1. Rapor hijau inilah yang kemudian menjadi rujukan prestasi bagi Tim Piala Thomas Indonesia 2016, termasuk status juara grup. Waspadai Thailand Berbeda dengan Tim Piala Thomas yang lebih memasang mata kepada India, barisan Srikandi Piala Uber Indonesia justru wajib mewaspadai Thailand. Memiliki pemain-pemain kelas dunia, semisal Ratchanok Intanon dan Busanan Ongbungrumpan, tidak berlebihan jika target realistis Linda Wenifanetri dkk. adalah lolos ke putaran selanjutnya. “Thailand memang akan menjadi lawan berat untuk Tim Uber Indonesia. Namun kami masih berpeluang besar untuk menang dari Hong Kong dan Bulgaria,” ujar Rexy. Berdasarkan aturan turnamen, hanya dua tim terbaik dari setiap grup yang berhak melangkah ke babak perempat final. Nantinya, di fase ini, akan kembali diadakan pengundian sesuai dengan status negara yang lolos. Dengan begitu, duel perempat final dipastikan bakal menyajikan pertarungan antara juara grup kontra runner-up grup. Tim Uber Indonesia, jika ingin melanjutkan perjalanannya sampai ke semifinal, wajib meloloskan diri dari putaran grup dengan status juara grup. Karena, besar kemungkinan, negara unggulan pertama, Tiongkok, akan menyelesaikan tugas pertama mereka di putaran Grup A dengan label tersebut. Di Kualifikasi Piala Uber Zona Asia 2016, Tim Uber Indonesia gagal berbicara banyak. Usai melaju dari putaran Grup WC sebagai runner-up, Srikandi Merah Putih langsung keok 0-3 dari Tiongkok. Tim Uber Indonesia bahkan baru bisa memastikan diri menyusul Tim Thomas setelah berdasarkan penghitungan poin ranking dunia oleh Badminton World Federation (BWF) menempati peringkat keenam dari 16 slot yang tersedia. “Lolosnya Tim Uber ke putaran final adalah sesuatu yang positif. Bukan cuma sekedar lolos jadi partisipan, Tim Uber Indonesia juga masuk daftar unggulan 5/8,” kata Rexy saat Tim Uber Indonesia dipastikan lolos ke putaran final Piala Uber 2016.

The war chests they have allotted for the Philippine market would put off most anyone. A Cebuano startup success But this tall order is exactly what the founders of miCab have taken to task. Based out of Cebu, but quickly expanding to a new city in the next few months, miCab has a different business model than the other familiar transportation apps. Rather than earn from consumers, they monetize from companies, as they have an advertising-based business model. “We have LEDs that sit on the taxis and tablets inside the taxis that advertisers can book,” said Kenn Costales, the chief marketing officer of the company. According to Costales, miCab has raised 3 rounds of undisclosed funding. The company is also experiencing success on both ends of its marketplace - achieving 80% month-on-month growth for driver acquisition and 20% month-on-month growth for app installations. Costales believes that the success of miCab, as a Philippine-headquartered company, holds special significance for the country. He explained that all companies will have geographic priorities depending on where the largest market is and where the highest profits are, which usually is where the startup is founded - otherwise, they can’t scale. “As a result, offshore offices in expansion markets are either filled with expats or will have few employees overall,” Costales said. He continued, “So in other words, it’s important that there are more homegrown businesses in Philippines because these companies will, on average, employ more local talent than international companies.” Costales added that this principle applies to all types of businesses and not just tech startups. He said that miCab was founded to ultimately help both ends of its marketplace. For cab drivers, they seek to improve the standard of living. “miCab only partners with top tier and top employer taxi operators that provides drivers with benefits like SSS, Pag-Ibig, health insurance, etc, while increasing their billings per day,” he said.  Prioritizing top taxi fleets ultimately benefits consumers. “Our application also gives these top-tier taxi operators (who do their job right) a competitive advantage by driving out low performing and bad quality taxi fleets,” Costales said. This in turn results in a better user experience for their passengers. Costales feels this addresses the problems with incumbent transportation apps, which he claims prioritize taxi availability over user experience and lack employee-type protection and benefits. Winning niches Costales cited consumer awareness as the biggest challenge facing miCab. With the funding that miCab has raised, they want to focus on winning specific niches. “If the initial niche loves our product, then we expand to other niches,” he said. Costales compared this strategy to what Facebook did in the immediate wake of its founding. “This is how Facebook was able to subvert Friendster despite the latter’s huge awareness advantage in the mid-2000’s. They started with Harvard, then the Ivy League, then universities, etc,” said Costales, who added that by generating positive word of mouth in an aspirational niche, they could leverage this as fuel to acquire other or large niches. Luckily, Filipinos are not reluctant to adopting new technology. In response to what aversions we may have toward using a platform like miCab, Costales said, “The question has an assumption that Filipinos are hesitant to begin with. They are not. As long as they can get a safe / good quality cab fast, they are OK to use any taxi hailing app.” As miCab’s minimum viable product (MVP) continues to gain significant traction, the company wants to bring all its team members on a full-time basis. They are driven by a twofold goal, one for each side of their marketplace. On one hand, they want to increase the billings per day for drivers through the miCab, while providing employee-type benefits and protection for them by partnering with top taxi fleets. “For the general public, consistently offer them with an affordable, safe, and quality ride by only partnering with top tier taxi operators,” Costales said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/new-delhi-bans-web-taxis","title":"New Delhi bans all web taxis after Uber rape claim","date":"Dec 9, 2014 9:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Hours after banning Uber, New Delhi bans all other taxi service providers relying on 'web based technology'","body":"NEW DELHI, India – New Delhi has extended a ban on Uber to all web-based taxi services in the Indian capital, as the US-based operator said it would continue operating despite the order, which followed a rape allegation against one of its drivers. The city government announced on Monday, December 8, it was banning Uber with immediate effect after a young female passenger accused the driver of raping her over the weekend. Hours later, it said all other taxi service providers that rely on \"web-based technology\" must also cease operating in the city because they did not comply with local regulations. But an Uber executive told the Agence France-Presse on Tuesday, December 9, that it was still operating in New Delhi and had received no formal notice from the government. \"We have not received any official notification (about the ban). If and when we do, we will of course appeal it,\" said the executive, who asked not to be named. \"As of now we have not stopped our operations in Delhi.\" Delhi police said they had registered a case against the company for \"cheating\" and had summoned its officials for questioning over the alleged rape. Police said Uber did not conduct a background check on the driver, who had been acquitted of a separate rape charge in 2012. Uber said it complied with local rules and background checks were not required. It is the latest setback for the popular but controversial San Francisco-based start-up, which lets customers hail and pay for taxis or private vehicles via a smartphone app. The company's rapid growth has caused tensions, especially in Europe where rival taxi companies have protested that Uber cars are not subject to the same regulations. Dutch judges on Monday ordered the company to shut down UberPOP, which allows non-professional drivers to register, saying it was against the law to charge for a ride without a licence. Also on Monday, authorities in the US city of Portland, Oregon, asked a court to stop Uber from operating in the city, saying it did not comply with local rules. In India, Uber says it works with licensed drivers and is a taxi aggregation service, putting passengers in touch with nearby available cabs. The company set up its India operation in September 2013 and also provides services in 10 other cities across the country. Unlike radio taxi services, which will be allowed to continue operating in Delhi, it does not have a 24-hour call centre operation, relying instead on Twitter and email for customer support. The latest incident has once again raised the issue of women's safety in India, days before the second anniversary of a fatal gang-rape of a Delhi student that unleashed widespread outrage. The victim dozed off in the taxi as she was returning home from dinner. She told police she woke to find the taxi parked in a secluded place where the driver assaulted and raped her, before dumping her near her home in north Delhi. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/contractors-employees-uber-drivers-california-vote","title":"Contractors or employees? Uber drivers split ahead of California vote","date":"Oct 18, 2020 6:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Proposition 22 will determine whether California can enforce a law requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors","body":"Ahead of a referendum that could upend the whole gig economy, Uber driver Karim Benkanoun says his relationship with the rideshare giant must stop being a one-way street. \"If you’re a driver with Uber or Lyft, you're nothing,\" said Benkanoun as he speaks of how he will vote in California's Proposition 22 referendum. \"They don't consider us as employees, they consider us as independent contractors but we have no say in the contract. \"It doesn't work this way and it has to change.\" Proposition 22, which is being put to voters on the same day as the November 3 presidential election, will determine whether California's government can enforce a law which became effective this year requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors. Were the referendum to be approved, drivers would remain independent contractors but Uber and Lyft would pay them a number of benefits promised as part of a compromise package, including a minimum wage, a contribution to health care and other forms of insurance. If it doesn't pass, the drivers would be classified as employees and thus entitled to all the benefits laid out in California labor law.  Supporters in the \"Yes\" camp are warning of mass job losses if they lose as the companies could not afford to keep on all their drivers and say others will quit because they will automatically have less flexibility. While supporters argue the bill would mean increasingly hard-pressed drivers are guaranteed to earn between $25 and $28 per hour, critics cite a University of California study showing that compensation equates to only $5.64 per hour after subtracting unreimbursed costs, taxes and waiting time. The measure has divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others such as Sergei Fyodorov enjoy the flexibility of being able to work on weekends or whenever he chooses to pick up extra income. \"If you make a living out of it, great, but for me it's supplemental income and flexibility,\" said Fyodorov, who has a regular job as a project manager at a tech company. \"Let's say Proposition 22 does not happen. I can guarantee that Lyft, Uber and all these services will lay off at least 80 or 70 percent of the drivers and the main thing is that we're not going to get the flexibility.\" Geoff Vetter, a spokesman for the \"Yes\" campaign, said hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost across a global industry headquartered in California, arguing many drivers would quit if they have to work set hours. \"With Proposition 22, we're trying to recognize first that these drivers want to remain independent contractors – more than 70 percent of drivers say they want to remain independent contractors because it gives them flexibility and choice – while also getting new benefits like a minimum guarantee (for wages) and health care,\" said Vetter. Benkanoun, who began working with Uber in 2012, says he used to make between $1,500 and $2,000 a week but is now lucky to make $500 before expenses despite working a seven-day week with demand shrunk by the Covid-19 pandemic. As his income has dwindled, so has his faith in the rideshare companies. \"I don't trust anything Uber or Lyft says,\" he said. Another driver, Erica Mighetto of Sacramento, said she was making $40 an hour when she started driving 4 years ago but only $20 earlier this year and now that's closer to $10 an hour in pandemic conditions. \"Uber and Lyft are just trying to exempt themselves from the benefits that drivers need,\" said Mighetto, who drove from her home in Sacramento to take part in a recent demonstration calling for a \"No\" vote. She slept in her car. \"We need a guaranteed minimum wage and overtime and in this time we desperately need employment for drivers who are unable to work and support their families.\" Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86 percent worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model; Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. \"While these services feel ubiquitous to our lives, they're very new,\" Vetter told Agence France-Presse. \"I think there's recognition we need to apply a 21st century solution to 21st century challenges.\" But drivers like Mighetto are not convinced. \"They're really trying to scare drivers and scare voters into doing what they want,\" she said. \"I think that billionaire companies are able to offer flexibility as well as minimum protection.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-closes-los-angeles-support-office","title":"Uber closes Los Angeles support office, outsources tasks to Manila office","date":"Feb 19, 2020 6:28 PM PHT","snippet":"The closure of the Los Angeles support office, which dealt with driver outreach, will lay off some 80 employees","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ridesharing firm Uber abruptly closed its Los Angeles customer support center, laying off some 80 employees and outsourcing the jobs to its Manila customer support office.  According to the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, February 18, Uber manager Ruffin Chevaleau acknowledged the short notice of the closure meeting in a recording the Times obtained.

Uber drivers split ahead of California vote","date":"Oct 18, 2020 6:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Proposition 22 will determine whether California can enforce a law requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors","body":"Ahead of a referendum that could upend the whole gig economy, Uber driver Karim Benkanoun says his relationship with the rideshare giant must stop being a one-way street. \"If you’re a driver with Uber or Lyft, you're nothing,\" said Benkanoun as he speaks of how he will vote in California's Proposition 22 referendum. \"They don't consider us as employees, they consider us as independent contractors but we have no say in the contract. \"It doesn't work this way and it has to change.\" Proposition 22, which is being put to voters on the same day as the November 3 presidential election, will determine whether California's government can enforce a law which became effective this year requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors. Were the referendum to be approved, drivers would remain independent contractors but Uber and Lyft would pay them a number of benefits promised as part of a compromise package, including a minimum wage, a contribution to health care and other forms of insurance. If it doesn't pass, the drivers would be classified as employees and thus entitled to all the benefits laid out in California labor law.  Supporters in the \"Yes\" camp are warning of mass job losses if they lose as the companies could not afford to keep on all their drivers and say others will quit because they will automatically have less flexibility. While supporters argue the bill would mean increasingly hard-pressed drivers are guaranteed to earn between $25 and $28 per hour, critics cite a University of California study showing that compensation equates to only $5.64 per hour after subtracting unreimbursed costs, taxes and waiting time. The measure has divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others such as Sergei Fyodorov enjoy the flexibility of being able to work on weekends or whenever he chooses to pick up extra income. \"If you make a living out of it, great, but for me it's supplemental income and flexibility,\" said Fyodorov, who has a regular job as a project manager at a tech company. \"Let's say Proposition 22 does not happen. I can guarantee that Lyft, Uber and all these services will lay off at least 80 or 70 percent of the drivers and the main thing is that we're not going to get the flexibility.\" Geoff Vetter, a spokesman for the \"Yes\" campaign, said hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost across a global industry headquartered in California, arguing many drivers would quit if they have to work set hours. \"With Proposition 22, we're trying to recognize first that these drivers want to remain independent contractors – more than 70 percent of drivers say they want to remain independent contractors because it gives them flexibility and choice – while also getting new benefits like a minimum guarantee (for wages) and health care,\" said Vetter. Benkanoun, who began working with Uber in 2012, says he used to make between $1,500 and $2,000 a week but is now lucky to make $500 before expenses despite working a seven-day week with demand shrunk by the Covid-19 pandemic. As his income has dwindled, so has his faith in the rideshare companies. \"I don't trust anything Uber or Lyft says,\" he said. Another driver, Erica Mighetto of Sacramento, said she was making $40 an hour when she started driving 4 years ago but only $20 earlier this year and now that's closer to $10 an hour in pandemic conditions. \"Uber and Lyft are just trying to exempt themselves from the benefits that drivers need,\" said Mighetto, who drove from her home in Sacramento to take part in a recent demonstration calling for a \"No\" vote. She slept in her car. \"We need a guaranteed minimum wage and overtime and in this time we desperately need employment for drivers who are unable to work and support their families.\" Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86 percent worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model; Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. \"While these services feel ubiquitous to our lives, they're very new,\" Vetter told Agence France-Presse. \"I think there's recognition we need to apply a 21st century solution to 21st century challenges.\" But drivers like Mighetto are not convinced. \"They're really trying to scare drivers and scare voters into doing what they want,\" she said. \"I think that billionaire companies are able to offer flexibility as well as minimum protection.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-closes-los-angeles-support-office","title":"Uber closes Los Angeles support office, outsources tasks to Manila office","date":"Feb 19, 2020 6:28 PM PHT","snippet":"The closure of the Los Angeles support office, which dealt with driver outreach, will lay off some 80 employees","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Ridesharing firm Uber abruptly closed its Los Angeles customer support center, laying off some 80 employees and outsourcing the jobs to its Manila customer support office.  According to the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, February 18, Uber manager Ruffin Chevaleau acknowledged the short notice of the closure meeting in a recording the Times obtained.

The application started at 8 am, with the first applicant completing the entire process within 10 minutes. Juliet Bulaon, a Grab partner, lined up as early as 6:30 am to make sure she would finish first. \"It's a relief. Now that [we have the papers needed], I won't be worrying about our [car getting apprehended] all the time,\" she said in Filipino on Monday. Bulaon is among the 66,750 operators who are expected to apply for their Provisional Authority (PA) as a step to eventually getting their Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) franchise. After 10 working days, Bulaon will return to the LTFRB for a hearing that will determine whether she will be granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). If that is granted, she will get a franchise that will last for two years. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu echoed Bulaon's sentiments, saying many TNVS drivers worry about getting apprehended by traffic enforcers for being \"colorum.\" \"They can now drive without worrying that they will be apprehended for the reasons that they are colorum vehicles – they are not,\" Cu said. Smooth process LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada described the process on Monday as \"very smooth.\" They were able to process about 50 applications within the first hour. \"The applicants have complete documents with them that's why the flow is smooth. There are some minor setbacks (with incomplete documents), but it's manageable,\" Lizada told reporters on Monday. Based on initial talks, LTFRB is set to process 300 applications per day – with Grab and Uber alloted 150 slots each. (READ: LTFRB to accept franchise applications for lease-to-own cars but...) But Lizada said they were able to finish all 300 applications before 2 pm, so the regulatory board will increase the number of applications they can accommodate in succeeding days.

Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines' public policy head, said more drivers would be encouraged to get on the road now that are holding the proper documents. Grab's Cu also said that that booking will be smoother, as issuing franchises is one way to determine whether the supply of TNVS vehicles will meet the demand on the road. \"This is the step to get the right number of vehicles. We will see whether the supply will meet the demand. LTFRB will assess in the next months whether there's a need to increase the numbers,\" Cu said.

The law brings down income tax rates, but increases excise taxes on petroleum, cars, and vehicle spare parts. (READ: EXPLAINER: How the tax reform law affects Filipino consumers) The TRAIN law imposed P2.50 per liter tax on diesel. The diesel excise tax will increase to P4.50 in 2019, and P6 in 2020, the 1st package of tax reform showed. Meanwhile, gasoline is scheduled to be taxed P7 per liter in 2018, P9 in 2019, and P10 in 2020. LTFRB had told reporters that there will be no fare hike until March following the increase of fuel prices due to new taxes.

The case is yet another thorn in the side for US-based Uber, which has drawn the fury of taxi drivers and officials for flouting local regulations. It also comes the same week as one of its drivers admitted to the attempted rape and murder of a British embassy worker coming home from a night out in Beirut, Lebanon. \"The service provided by Uber connecting individuals with non-professional drivers is covered by services in the field of transport,\" said the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice. \"Member states can therefore regulate the conditions for providing that service.\" Uber, the biggest name in the growing gig economy, claims it is a mere service provider, connecting consumers with drivers in more than 600 cities. Uber has run into huge opposition from taxi companies and other competitors who say this allows it to dodge costly regulations such as training and licensing requirements for drivers and vehicles. The case was brought by a taxi drivers' association in the Spanish city of Barcelona, where belief runs high that Uber is a taxi company that should be subject to rules governing such vehicles. Ruling 'won't change things' Uber said the ruling would make little difference in practice. \"This ruling will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours.\" In a dense legal judgement, the ECJ said that Uber was a service that connects \"by means of a smartphone application and for remuneration non-professional drivers using their own vehicle with persons who wish to make urban journeys.\" That means it is \"inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as a 'service in the field of transport' within the meaning of EU law.\" The EU court's senior adviser had said in a legal opinion in May that Uber was indeed a transport company. Uber has had a rough ride in Spain, where a judge ruled in 2014 that its UberPop service risked breaking the law, leading to the Barcelona submission to the ECJ. Early last year it decided to only operate a limited a version of its UberX service in Spain which uses licensed, professional drivers instead of the amateurs who had previously worked via the UberPop application. Uber has already had problems with the law in several European countries, particularly France where the company was forced to overhaul its business model. In November a labour court in London, where the company is threatened with losing its license, said it had to pay the drivers a minimum wage and give them paid leave. Uber does not employ drivers or own vehicles, but instead relies on private contractors with their own cars, allowing them to run their own businesses. Licensed taxi drivers meanwhile often have to undergo hundreds of hours of training, and they accuse Uber of endangering their jobs by using cheaper drivers who rely only on a GPS to get around. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-bribery-probe-us-justice-department","title":"U.S. looking into whether Uber bribed foreign officials","date":"Aug 30, 2017 12:13 PM PHT","snippet":"The company confirms that the US Justice Department is currently investigating them","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – The US Justice Department is investigating whether Uber broke American laws against bribing foreign officials to promote business interests, the company confirmed Tuesday, August 29, US time.

Consider Uber’s one-month suspension that started on August 15. Beyond the many angry comments, hashtags, and memes that it inspired on Facebook and Twitter, the welfare losses from such suspension could prove huge in monetary terms. In the US, one study found that UberX generated about $6.8-billion worth of consumer welfare in 2015 alone. No such study yet exists for the Philippines. But given the hundreds of thousands of rides that don’t happen anymore because of the suspension, the losses for riders and drivers could easily amount to several millions of pesos daily. Regulating 'surge pricing' Market prices orchestrate the decisions of consumers and producers. In the case of Uber and Grab, riders want to hail vehicles when prices are low, while drivers want to ply the streets when prices are high (or “surge”). Governments worldwide are particularly keen to regulate “surge pricing.” It is often taken as a form of price gouging, akin to what happens when prices of basic commodities rise during times of short supply (think Yolanda or Marawi). In the previous Christmas season, the LTFRB warned Uber and Grab against these “unreasonable” price surges that “take advantage” of people. But far from abusing people, this “dynamic pricing” mechanism – afforded by algorithms – lies at the heart of the dependability of Uber and Grab. By allowing prices to rise and fall with changes in supply and demand, riders can reliably hail vehicles whenever, wherever. Figure 1 below shows surge pricing in action. Notice the rise of driver supply (green) in response to a rise in demand (red). Surge pricing makes sure that demand always meets supply, and a similar phenomenon occurs whenever it suddenly rains or it’s rush hour in Metro Manila.   Figure 1. UberX supply rises to meet higher demand. Source: Hall, Kendrick, and Nosko (2015). Tinkering with dynamic pricing – by imposing a price ceiling beyond which prices can’t surge – will not just diminish the reliability of Uber and Grab, but also prolong wait times. Entrants that lack dynamic pricing altogether (such as taxis using the new Micab) are also therefore unlikely to match the availability of Uber and Grab vehicles. To see the effect of price controls, one need only look at the first day of Uber’s recent suspension. Bookings for Grab rides jumped by 10% to 15%, and Grab managers responded by capping their surge rates at 1.4 (meaning their rates can’t go beyond 1.4 times the regular rates). But the effects of such a binding “price ceiling” are well-known in Econ 101: It creates excess demand, where demand exceeds supply. In Grab’s case, more riders were willing to hail rides than there were Grab vehicles on the road, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and longer wait times. Grab wanted to help riders with this surge cap, but ended up making them wait longer for their rides. Regulating work hours LTFRB also came up with a proposal to impose “minimum work hours” on Uber and Grab drivers. They reasoned that the franchises they issue will be put to waste if many drivers don’t ply the streets at least a certain number of hours per week. But again, this proposal ignores the centrality of supply and demand in Uber and Grab’s operations: With dynamic pricing, both prices and the number of cars on the road have to adjust freely to reflect supply and demand. During peak hours – when demand is high – prices rise to incentivize drivers to go out and drive. By contrast, during off-peak hours – when demand is low – prices go down, which turns off most drivers, many of whom choose not to drive. The net effect is that ride-hailing vehicles typically have higher “capacity utilization rates” than taxis. Simply put, Uber and Grab drivers are far likelier than taxi drivers to ply the streets with passengers in their cars. In a 2016 paper, two economists confirmed this when they looked at UberX in 5 American cities in 2015. Figure 2 shows that, in Los Angeles, UberX was 58% more efficient than taxis; in Seattle, 41%. Figure 2: Capacity utilization rate for taxi and UberX drivers in Los Angeles and Seattle. Source: Cramer and Krueger (2016). Capacity utilization rate = percent of miles driven with a passenger.   Again, no similar study yet exists for the Philippines. But if the LTFRB requires Uber and Grab drivers to work minimum hours, supply and demand tells us their vehicles will likely become idler on the road. Heed the law of supply and demand One might argue that, in all this, the LTFRB – with all its “draconian” and “antiquated” policies – is just doing its job. On the first day of Uber’s recent suspension, motoring journalist James Deakin said on Facebook, “rules are rules.” However, what is illegal is not necessarily bad economics, and what is legal is not necessarily good economics. The letter of the law is no excuse for LTFRB to spawn a flurry of discretionary policies that completely ignore (and even negate) the most basic lessons of economics. To make sure that there are enough rides when people need them, don’t impose caps on surge rates. To make Uber and Grab operations more efficient, don’t impose minimum work hours. To improve the welfare of the riding public, don’t kill a new industry that many people have come to love and depend on. The LTFRB can impose all the orders and decrees it wants, but it cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Try as it might, it will be as successful as the proverbial king who commanded the waves to retreat. – Rappler.com   The author is a PhD candidate at the UP School of Economics.

But my question is did any of the two, or any of these TNCs hire agencies using minions and all the other to bash the LTFRB?” Medina asked. However, she was not given the chance to continue her questioning, as Senate committee chair Grace Poe called her out. Poe said it is not wrong for either parties to hire public relations companies in a free market. “Ma’am I think we’re going off topic. I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There's a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it's propaganda, it won't last). They can spend millions and it will not take off.

In a press briefing, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the LTFRB qualifies transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers as \"public service\" so they should observe a minimum number of hours on the road – just like government workers – to fulfill that duty. \"So if ever we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours na dapat online kayo. Kasi kung bibigyan kayo ng prangkisa, pero two hours a week lang kayo babiyahe, sayang. Bibigay na lang natin sa iba 'yung prangkisa,\" Lizada said. (So if we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours that they need to be online. Because if we will give franchises, but they will only work for two hours a week, it would be a waste. It would be better to give the franchise to other operators.) The board member said the measure will help regulate the drivers of TNVS operators, as there are currently 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers plying the roads. Imposing minimum working hours, Lizada said, would also respond to a recently-revealed practice of Grab and Uber drivers who only go on the road \"when surge prices are high.\" Currently, Grab classifies drivers as part-time if they stay on the roads below 40 hours a week, and full-time if they clock higher hours. Uber, for its part, classifies drivers as \"casual drivers\" if they operate below 10 hours, part-time if below 40, and full-time if above 40. The LTFRB bared the plan a day after its second technical working group meeting with Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 26. On Wednesday, the agency announced that it ordered the deactivation of drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017. Lizada said they hope to be done with the meetings by September 2017, and produce memorandum circulars to fix the regulation deadlock. After that, the LTFRB plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. There are bills filed in both houses of Congress seeking to regulate TNVS providers.

According to the LTFRB, of the 10,054 names of active drivers that Uber submitted, they found that the PA of 5,850 were dismissed while 3,505 are still in the process of applying. This leaves less than 2,000 as having complete permits. Grab has not submitted its list. According to TNVS drivers themselves, the number of \"colorum\" drivers spiked in the last year mainly because of LTFRB Memorandum Circular (MC) 2016-008 which suspended the issuance of new PAs beginning July 21, 2016. (READ: Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications) In addition to negligence, the LTFRB also took into account the TNCs' violation of LTFRB MC 2015-016, which mandates the following: 'Strong passenger demand'   Grab country head Brian Cu admitted in the hearing that they accepted new drivers despite the earlier order of the LTFRB. \"Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers... we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],\" Cu said. When asked by Delgra whether the move was for \"marketing reasons\" so that competition would not get their clients, representatives from Uber agreed. In their defense, Grab and Uber invoked passengers' needs. \"In all honesty everyone we accepted since July are still 'colorum.' They remain on the road. Because there is [a] demand that is needed to be met, we let them,\" Cu said. Delgra noted, however, that demand does not justify illegal operations. He likened the TNCs' alibi to a manufacturer of fake license plates who argues there is demand for such. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber's operations should have been shut down. But according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, the interest of the riding public \"overrides\" the provision. But while the transport network giants were not ordered closed, their accreditation as TNCs will still be reviewed. Grab's accreditation expired on July 3, while Uber's is set to expire in August. Lizada also said the LTFRB will form a technical working group that will meet with the TNCs to set a deadline for the elimination of illegal operations. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/grab-uber-drivers-ltfrb-lift-ban","title":"Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications","date":"Jul 7, 2017 4:48 PM PHT","snippet":"The drivers are petitioning a Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board order halting the processing of new drivers' applications issued in July 2016","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber drivers have united to move forward. How? Through a petition. TopSpeed and Busypaps, organizations consisting of at least 250 Uber and Grab drivers, urged on Friday, July 7, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to lift their ban on new driver applications. “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority,” TopSpeed Bobby Coronel said, reading their petition. (We are appealing to the LTFRB, we hope you listen to our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues who still do not have provisional authority [permits].) They are rallying against an LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2016-008 issued on July 21, 2016, which suspended the applications for the provisional authority (PA), or temporary permits to operate, for Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applicants.  The order was released to limit operations of TNVS while LTFRB prepares a pitch on how to further regulate TNVS providers. The Philippines is the first country to regulate TNVS service providers. TNVS simply pertains to any transport service where commuters and drivers get matched through an application. The 45-day PA permit is the precursor for the regular permit, which is renewed every 3 years. Ever since the order was implemented, thousands who wanted to drive for transportation network companies (TNCs) or providers of TNVS, were barred from applying.  This has forced the aspiring TNC drivers to go to other transport services like airport car services, or to become taxi drivers, Coronel said. 7,000 in limbo While applicants have been rejected from applying as TNVS drivers, some 7,000 already-accredited drivers did not get their PAs renewed in 2016, with all of them having expired PA permits by December 2016, Busypaps president Jephthe Gamad said. \"We are not colorum by choice, our colleagues were left with no choice,\" they said in the petition.\"Many of us were unemployed, some are retirees. We were given the chance to be productive in becoming partners of TNVS companies.\" LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra clarified in an earlier press conference that the drivers can “renew or extend the PA”. Drivers applied for renewal and extension, but according to Gamad, LTFRB has not processed their applications. \"Nakapagpa-renew naman kami. Ang problema lang kasi hindi kami nilalabasan ng papeles, (We renewed our PAs, but the problem is that they have not given us our documents),\" Gamad told Rappler. He added that since December 2016 most drivers already had expired PAs. Some continued to drive and said that they were not apprehended by the LTFRB, while some were forced to go off the road. As drivers who do not own the cars they drove, they were forced off the road by their operators – the car owners – who feared penalty from apprehension. \"Medyo masakit on our part, we do our best to give riding experience to our commuters.

Senator Grace Poe, chair of the public services committee, filed Senate Resolution 262 seeking a congressional inquiry into the unfair practice and the need to create standards to limit it. During the holiday season, passengers complained of the unfair price increases, with surge amounts ranging from P2,000 to P28,000. Poe denounced this, saying it is just similar to the “kontrata (contract)” system rampant among regular taxi cabs, which passengers try to avoid by using TNCs. “The surge pricing experienced by consumers is no different from 'kontrata,' where cab drivers would demand a fixed and excessively high fare during rush hours and the holiday season,” the senator said in her resolution. She also cited cases in other countries like Australia and the United States, where Uber had been criticized for increasing its fares during disasters and emergencies such as the Sydney hostage crisis and Hurricane Sandy. “Here and in abroad, commuters have complained that sometimes, the ride they requested would suddenly get cancelled, and when they request for a new ride, surge pricing appears,” she added. Congress should craft guidelines While the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has ordered Uber and Grab to limit the fare increases, the senator said Congress should craft guidelines to curb surge pricing. (READ: LTFRB warns Uber, Grab over unreasonable price surge) In pushing this, Poe said lawmakers abroad have already tried to address the problem by proposing “to ban surge pricing or put a cap on it.” In the House of Representatives, a bill has been filed banning the \"exorbitant\" and \"undue\" rate surges. A counterpart bill has yet to be filed in the Senate. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian filed a measure in August 2016, but it focused only on the regulation of TNCs, without specific provisions prohibiting unfare price surging. Poe also asked Congress to look into how TNCs have been used by some businessmen to skirt franchising laws and operate a fleet of private vehicles, “resulting in further traffic congestion.” “TNCs should not lose sight that their services are mainly for the convenience of the riding public, which is why they were awarded a certificate of public convenience.” The transportation department's Department Order No. 2015-11 allows TNCs \"to determine their fares in line with efforts to encourage innovation in public transportation in order to increase mobility on major thoroughfares, boost travel time, improve the quality, sustainability and reliability of public transport services, and respond to the needs of the modern commuter.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/uber-kerja-sama-dengan-manchester-united","title":"Uber mengumumkan kerja sama global dengan Manchester United","date":"Jan 17, 2017 5:46 PM PHT","snippet":"","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia - Kamis, 12 Januari lalu, Uber secara resmi mengumumkan kerja sama global mereka dengan salah satu tim sepak bola ternama dan terbesar di dunia, Manchester United.

Hal utama yang mereka keluhkan adalah keharusan mengubah nama di Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan (STNK) menjadi nama perusahaan atau koperasi, serta kewajiban memiliki SIM A Umum, dan melakukan uji kir.  Menanggapi aksi demonstrasi tersebut, Kementerian Perhubungan pun bergeming, dan tetap akan menjalankan aturan tersebut pada batas waktu yang telah ditetapkan. Hal ini kemudian dibantah oleh Agus Muharram, Sekretaris Kementerian Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil Menengah.  Agus, melalui siaran pers, menjelaskan apabila mobil yang digunakan sebagai armada Uber, GrabCar, dan Go-Car merupakan milik pribadi, maka nama di STNK pun harus tetap menggunakan nama pribadi. Menurut Agus, hal tersebut telah disepakati dalam rapat yang dihadiri oleh Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika Rudiantara, Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Pudji Hartanto Iskandar, serta perwakilan dari layanan transportasi on-demand. Keputusan ini diambil karena perbedaan struktur organisasi antara perusahaan taksi dan layanan transportasi on-demand yang berbentuk koperasi.  “Dalam prinsip koperasi, anggota adalah pemilik dan pemilik adalah anggota. Karena itu, pengemudi yang tergabung dengan layanan transportasi on-demand bukanlah pekerja seperti pengemudi taksi konvensional,” ujar Agus. Terkait syarat-syarat lain yang telah ditetapkan, seperti keharusan pengemudi memiliki SIM A Umum dan melakukan uji kir, Agus mengatakan kalau pihaknya akan membantu layanan transportasi on-demand untuk memenuhi hal tersebut. Kabar ini tentu akan disambut baik oleh para pengemudi layanan transportasi on-demand seperti Uber, GrabCar, dan Go-Car.

This was a day before the LTFRB starts its clampdown on unregistered Internet application-based transport systems. The regulator will impose a fine of P200,000 ($4,283.68) and vehicle impoundment of 3 months for operators who are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise. In May, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. “There is a need to delineate and clarify the various transportation policies pertaining to the different transport administration components such as planning, policy making, data management, and enforcement,” Aquino, chairman of the Senate Committee on Trade, Commerce, and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement. “The main challenge of the different government agencies and offices is to align their rules and regulations, as well as policies, in order to solve the worsening traffic conditions in Metro Manila,” the senator added. Lack of communication In his resolution, Aquino said the lack of communication between the DOTC and LTFRB underscores a National Center for Transportation Studies report. This, according to the senator, shows the inability to coordinate overlapping functions among transportation and traffic related units of the national and local government. “The department order was issued in response to the call of Uber, GrabTaxi, other similar Internet application-based transportation networks, and the public to recognize this innovative technology and be able to operate legally,” Aquino said. “Let us continue supporting emerging industries and new business models, especially in our public transportation system that will enhance competition and provide better service to our fellow Filipinos,” he added.

Two members of the Uber information security team who \"led the response\" that included not alerting users that their data was breached were let go from the San Francisco-based company effective Tuesday, according to Khosrowshahi. The Uber chief said he only recently learned that outsiders had broken into a cloud-based server used by the company for data and downloaded a \"significant\" amount of information. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Uber's new boss Khosrowshahi learned of the incident. \"You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it.\" Khosrowshahi said that what he learned about Uber's failure to notify users or regulators prompted corrective actions. Need to change Uber is notifying drivers whose license numbers were swiped, and offering them credit and identity theft protections. The company also said it is notifying regulators, and monitoring affected rider accounts for signs of fraud. \"While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We are changing the way we do business.\" Khosrowshahi inherited a litany of scandals and a toxic workplace culture when he replaced Kalanick. Kalanick's brash style has been credited with driving Uber to the leading spot in the smartphone-summoned ride market, but also blamed for fostering an atmosphere of impropriety and rule breaking at the company. A planned tieup with Japanese tech giant SoftBank suggests the ridesharing giant is set to come of age in the business world, but it still faces a long road ahead. The deal would give Uber an additional $1 billion in capital and could allow SoftBank to acquire as much as 14% of Uber over time. While Uber has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, it is trying to move past scandals and missteps that have included executive misconduct, a cutthroat workplace, and potentially unethical competitive practices. One step toward the future was the hiring of Khosrowshahi earlier this year, which left founder Kalanick in the background. But Uber needs to clean up governance and other practices in order to meet its goal of a 2019 stock market debut that will open up the privately-held firm to greater scrutiny. Under Kalanick, Uber reached an eye-popping valuation of $68 billion, unprecedented for a private firm.  But at the same time, it has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators, and faces possible bans in cities for failing to live up to local rules. The deal with SoftBank is aimed at getting past the clashes between Kalanick and early investors like Benchmark Capital, which has sued the former CEO. SoftBank is expected to buy up shares from some investors by pumping in as much as $9 billion, in a so-called tender offer to Uber stakeholders. Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said earlier this month that some details are not yet final. Uber called the SoftBank deal \"a strong vote of confidence\" in the company's long-term potential. But Uber has other issues as well. It is in court facing Waymo, the former Google Car unit, which has alleged the theft of trade secrets on autonomous vehicle technology, in a case pending in California. Uber's use of software aimed at thwarting rivals like Lyft has also hurt its image, and could create further legal woes. Uber is facing tougher competition around the world, with rivals in Asia and Europe ramping up efforts and the expansion of US-based Lyft – which recently announced it would launch services in its first city outside the US market in Toronto, Canada. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/less-than-10-drug-deliveries-grab-uber-none-tnvs","title":"'Less than 10' deliveries involved in illegal drugs, says Grab","date":"Sep 26, 2017 1:59 PM PHT","snippet":"This comes after the PDEA reports that drivers of ride-hailing services are being used to deliver narcotics; Uber reports 'zero incidents' of this sort","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines asked its commuters to keep calm Tuesday, September 26, after the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) said drivers of ride-hailing services were being used for deliveries of illegal drugs.

Uber announced Tuesday, August 29, that it hired Expedia boss Khosrowshahi as its new chief executive, hoping that he can steer the ride-sharing service away from the string of controversies it has faced in the past year. Khosrowshahi is credited with turning Expedia into a global travel services behemoth, winning admiration from employees along the way. He replaces Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was pressured to resign as chief of the leading smartphone-summoned ride service. Khosrowshahi is known as an experienced top executive, willing to speak his mind and to advocate for women getting equal pay and leadership opportunities. A possible stock market debut for Uber, the world's most valuable private company based on funding rounds, has long been a source of speculation. The Iranian-American has responded to IPO questions by expressing the opinion that he would like to see it as late as possible. Kalanick was the driving force behind Uber, taking a spur-of-moment idea and turning it into the world's most valuable venture-funded tech startup. But his brash personality and freewheeling management style, which some argue set a problematic tone at the company, made him a liability as well as an asset to the global ridesharing giant.  He stepped down as chief executive in June due to pressure from influential investors including Benchmark Capital, which went on to file a civil lawsuit against Kalanick. Based on how much investors got for their money during recent funding rounds, Uber is valued at some $68 billion. Some mutual funds have reportedly marked down their stakes in Uber in a sign that months of scandal were taking a toll on the private company's value.

The order came Monday, August 10, when a judge granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based. The suit calls on the companies to comply with a state law that went into effect at the start of this year that requires \"gig workers\" such as Uber and Lyft drivers to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits. \"The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,\" Becerra said in a release. \"While this fight still has a long way to go, we're pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve.\" Uber is backing a referendum in the state to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent. The judge wrote in the ruling that Uber and Lyft could not indefinitely put off their \"day of reckoning\" when it came to complying with the law. Uber has argued that most of its drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits. Lyft vowed to appeal the judge's ruling, referring to the court battle as a fight for driver independence. \"Drivers do not want to be employees, full stop,\" Lyft said in response to an AFP inquiry. \"Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\" \"Misclassification hurts drivers and it puts the burden on taxpayers to pay for benefits that Uber and Lyft should be providing,\" said San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera. \"During this global pandemic, it's even more important for drivers to get access to protections like unemployment insurance.\" The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to comply with the order, which the companies can appeal. Uber outlined proposals this week for a new type of relationship with gig workers, including its own drivers, that would keep them as independent contractors but with some guaranteed benefits. The ride-hailing giant described \"a new model for independent platform work\" in a document it hopes can be used as a blueprint for Uber and similar firms relying on independent workers. The company seeks \"to deliver certainty for millions of independent contractors who will increasingly rely on independent work to help them face the economic challenges that lie ahead,\" Uber said in its document. Uber proposed that gig economy companies be required to establish \"benefits funds,\" allowing gig workers to accrue and use the money for benefits or paid leave. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, writing in The New York Times, said that the current employment system is outdated and \"forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net.\" Uber argues that requiring drivers to be classified as employees would leave jobs only for a small fraction of its drivers and that costs would become more expensive. More than 85% of Lyft drivers in California work fewer than 20 hours weekly, with many of them seeking flexible hours because they are parents, students, retirees or hold other jobs, according to the company. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-black-offer-quiet-mode-passengers-wanting-silence","title":"Uber now has 'Quiet Mode' for passengers wanting silence","date":"May 16, 2019 8:23 PM PHT","snippet":"The Quiet Mode option for the Uber Black service lets users pick if they want to have a quiet ride, one with a hearty chat, or have no preference either way","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Users of Uber's premium services in the United States will likely be pleased to know there's a new suite of options that allow you to tailor your ride preferences.

The Quiet Mode option lets users pick if they want to have a quiet ride, one with a hearty chat, or have no preference either way.  Uber asserts this option as one of a number of different features it is releasing to differentiate Uber's premium ride services from its regular and UberPool offerings.  Other options that come with the premium rides include options to let your Uber driver know if you need help with your luggage, set the optimal temperature in the vehicle you're riding in, or even ensure you get a professional driver or a consistent vehicle model, make, interior, or exteriors of the car you're taking. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/sony-sride-ride-hailing-apps-japan","title":"Sony to compete with Uber in Japan with own ride-hailing app","date":"Apr 22, 2019 2:13 PM PHT","snippet":"Sony has its own ride-hailing app in Japan","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Globetrotting Uber has faced many rivals in the ride-hailing space, many of which tend to be startups including Southeast Asia’s Grab and its home country rival Lyft. In Japan though, Uber faces off with a company that certainly has more history than most of its rivals: Sony. The gaming and electronics giant launched on Tuesday, April 16, its own ride-hailing service called S.Ride. For the service, Sony partnered with 5 taxi companies with a combined fleet of 10,000 cabs.  Uber operates a little differently in Japan as domestic laws prevent non-professional drivers from taking in fees from passengers and alleged pressure from long-time taxi operators.  This has resulted in Uber partnering with taxi operators instead of forming its own fleet of privately driven cars as in other markets.   JapanTaxi is another local Uber rival, with a fleet of 60,000 nationwide.  Like many apps today, S.Ride offers cashless payment, which in its case, is called S.Ride Wallet. It allows passengers to pay for a ride just by scanning the QR code displayed on a backseat tablet. Sony also said that it plans to add services such as a “supply and demand forecasting service using AI technology within the fiscal year.” It has no plans of bringing the service to other countries. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-fares-status-after-philippine-competition-commission-conditions","title":"Grab fares 'not necessarily lower' after Uber buyout approval","date":"Aug 10, 2018 5:09 PM PHT","snippet":"In fact, Grab has a 5% fare hike petition pending with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines said that fares \"will not necessarily be lower\" following the fair price and quality service conditions imposed by the Philippine Competition Commision (PCC). In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. \"What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares... but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,\" Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab's pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is \"sufficient competition\" in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. \"The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it's providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,\" Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB's franchise cap at 65,000 units. \"To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of 'maximum supply' – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,\" Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as \"demand exceeds supply.\" To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/philippine-competition-commission-pricing-service-grab-uber-deal","title":"Antitrust body OKs Grab-Uber deal, sets conditions","date":"Aug 10, 2018 1:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Any breach of the fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments set by the Philippine Competition Commission will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has bound ride-hailing company Grab Philippines to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments for acquiring Uber. The PCC released its decision on Friday, August 10 – 70 days after Grab first submitted commitments to address concerns of \"virtual monopoly\" of the ride-hailing service. Any breach of the conditions will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation. Unwinding the acquisition deal is still a possibility, depending on the gravity of the violation. The commitments are enforceable starting Friday, the PCC said. \"In effect, while Grab operates as a virtual monopolist, the commitments assure the public that quality and price levels that would prevail are those that had been [there] when they still faced competition in Uber,\" PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said. Monitoring: Compliance to the commitments will be monitored by a third-party body that will independently monitor Grab for a period of one year.  \"Grab can apply to release themselves from the commitments if there are already sufficient competition in the market. But Grab cannot be released from the commitments in the first 6 months,\"Antitrust Commissioner Stella Quimbo said.  The LTFRB has recently approved 5 new ride-hailing companies, but Grab still dominates the market after its acquisition of Uber.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to close down before April 16, in a hearing on the company's accreditation as a transport network company (TNC) on Wednesday, April 11. Uber's TNC accreditation expired in August 2017. \"The sooner as possible that you are able to resolve your concerns with PCC (Philippine Competition Commission), the better. Therefore, in the interest of all TNVS (transport network vehicle services) and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC,\" LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said. \"Upon April 16, you cease and desist to exist as a TNC,\" she added. The ruling came despite the PCC order for Uber and Grab to continue operating separately beyond April 8, the date when Uber was supposed to have closed and transitioned its operations to Grab. The PCC gave the order as it launched a review of the Uber-Grab deal. When the PCC ordered Uber to continue running beyond April 8, Grab said it would shoulder the cost of the extension but only until April 15. Uber and Grab face a P50,000 to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC's order. But both companies will be given a chance to explain their side. The LTFRB earlier said it would rather that Uber close down by April 8, citing the lack of manpower on the company's backend to handle customer services. Many patrons of Uber slammed the deal with Grab, arguing that the latter has \"monopolized\" the ride-hailing market.

The US Attorney's Office in Northern California sent the letter to US Judge William Alsup last month to share some of what they have learned \"in the course of a United States' pending criminal investigation,\" according to a copy of the paperwork obtained by Agence France-Presse. Alsup had referred the case to the Justice Department to look into possible criminal charges, but prosecutors remained mum after that. Information shared by the department with Alsup sparked a courtroom furor over the possibility that Uber operated a program to hide nefarious tactics. It also resulted in the trial being delayed a second time, with the judge setting a new start date of February 5. The US Attorney's Office said in the missive to Alsup that they interviewed former Uber manager of global intelligence Richard Jacobs, who contended that \"employees routinely used non-attributable electronic devices to store and transmit information that they wished to separate from Uber’s official systems.\" Attorneys representing Uber have repeatedly assured the judge no files taken from Waymo ever touched Uber servers. Jacobs' attorney laid out his allegations in May in a letter to Uber's associate general counsel, according to the Justice document. Alsup continues to mull whether it should have been shared during an evidence-gathering phase of the civil case. The letter signed by Jacobs told of an effort to evade discovery requests, court orders, and government investigations \"in violation of state and federal law, as well as ethical rules governing the legal profession.\" Techniques used included smartphones or laptop computers that couldn't be traced back to the company, and communicating through encrypted, vanishing message service Wickr, according to the letter and a transcript of courtroom testimony obtained by Agence France-Presse. Jacobs testified that he left Uber early this year with a compensation deal valued at $4.5 million. As part of that agreement with Uber, Jacobs remained a consultant on the payroll. Uber executives who testified denied any wrongdoing or trail-covering. The civil case stems from a lawsuit filed by Waymo – previously known as the Google self-driving car unit – which claimed former manager Anthony Levandowski took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto and was later acquired by Uber. Uber is also a target of investigations and lawsuits over the cover-up of a hack that compromised personal information of 57 million users and drivers. Uber purportedly paid data thieves $100,000 to destroy the swiped information – and remained quiet about the breach for a year.

(READ: PH privacy commission summons Uber execs over data breach) Investigations will continue, and Uber will face the possibiliy of civil and criminal liabilities for the concealment of a data breach under the Data Privacy Act of 2012. The breach happened in October 2016, but was only made public on Wednesday, November 23, Philippine time. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that their two information officers who led the response to the breach opted to withhold the information from the public. The officers were fired on the day of the breach announcement. A report also said that Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling which rider or driver's information was exposed. (READ: Should Uber users be worried about data hack?) Those responsible for the exiltration of data will face charges too from the NPC.  Uber has repeatedly said that there has been no misuse or evidence of fraud tied to the incident, nor was information such as trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, or dates of birth accessed and downloaded. The breach primarily stole names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers of Uber riders.  Of the 57 million affected in the hack, 600,000 are said to be drivers whose driver's license information was stolen. Among these 600,000 instances, there was no indication that a Filipino driver's license had been one of these, said Uber.  Aside from the Philippines and the NPC, Uber is currently facing investigations globally in other countries such as the US, Mexico, and Australia. The NPC said that they are also working with data privacy authorities in the US and Australia to investigate further.  Uber also currently has an information page available on the app regarding the breach, found in the \"Accounts and Payment Options\" menu within the \"Help\" section. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/expedia-chief-dara-khosrowshahi-named-uber-ceo","title":"Expedia chief Dara Khosrowshahi named to lead Uber – report","date":"Aug 28, 2017 9:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Dara Khosrowshahi emerges as the leader among 3 finalists for the job during company board meetings over the weekend, the New York Times reported","body":"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Expedia chief Dara Khosrowshahi has been chosen to replace ousted Travis Kalanick as the next CEO at Uber, The New York Times reported Sunday, August 27, as the ride-hailing giant looks to move past a rough patch. Khosrowshahi emerged as the leader among 3 finalists for the job during company board meetings over the weekend, the Times reported, citing two people familiar with the decision. Uber spokespeople were not immediately available for comment. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise chief Meg Whitman had been seen as the favorite, according to several media outlets, but the Times said the situation changed on Sunday in the 48-year-old Tehran-born Khosrowshahi's favor. Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, whose name was on the shortlist, on Sunday removed himself from the running for the top job. \"I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber,\" Immelt said on Twitter, without explaining his reasons. \"I have immense respect for the company & founders.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Immelt had opted not to pursue the CEO post after \"observing disorder and divisions among different factions of Uber's board,\" according to an unnamed source familiar with the matter. Other sources close to the search process said the 61-year-old Immelt – who left General Electric on August 1 after 16 years at the helm – did not have the votes to win and thus \"saved face\" by publicly bowing out, the newspaper said. Uber has been without a boss since June when Kalanick resigned, yielding to pressure from investors seeking to clean up a toxic corporate culture at the fast-growing company he created in 2009. The San Francisco-based firm has been roiled by disturbing reports of a cutthroat workplace culture, harassment, discrimination and questionable business tactics to thwart rivals. The pressure mounted earlier this month when early Uber investor Benchmark Capital filed suit against Kalanick, accusing him of fraud, breach of contract and of plotting to manipulate the board of directors to allow him to return as CEO. Kalanick fired back, claiming that Benchmark \"began secretly planning an effort to oust him\" and \"executed its plan at the most shameful of times\" following the death of his mother in a May accident. Uber has not only disrupted the local transport industry in dozens of countries. It's also been investing in autonomous driving technology, and has provoked a lawsuit from the former Google car unit now called Waymo that accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/daily-wrap/thewrap-august-16-2017-evening-edition","title":"Uber, Taguiwalo, Mile Long property | Evening wRap","date":"Aug 16, 2017 9:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: Uber asks the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board for a change in penalty from a one-month suspension to a fine during a meeting arranged by Senator Grace Poe. The Commission on Appointments rejects the appointment of Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo. Sunvar Realty Development Corporation says it will vacate the 2.9-hectare Mile Long property in Makati being claimed by the government. The Department of Agriculture says it will also cull around 400,000 birds from 30 farms within the 7-kilometer radius or the controlled area of the bird flu outbreak in San Luis, Pampanga. United States President Donald Trump backtracks on his response to the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that ended in bloodshed, saying there was 'blame on both sides.' "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/uber-suspension-transport-network-companies-applications-ltfrb","title":"As Uber hits the brakes, TNC applicants eye share of riders","date":"Aug 16, 2017 10:59 AM PHT","snippet":"At stake is a demand of 300,000 phone-booked trips per day, the LTFRB estimates","body":"While Uber stares at a one-month 'stop light,' others see it as a 'go.'  According to Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Aileen Lizada, they have received many Transport Network Company (TNC) pitches from various businessmen ever since their regulation mess with Grab and Uber. “Marami nang lumapit na mga TNCs…Sa ngayon, as of last week meron nang [nagpresent] na isa and then we were speaking to another,” Lizada told reporters in the sidelines after they junked Uber’s appeal. (A lot of TNCs which have approached us....For now, as of last week, there was already one which presented, and we are speaking to another.) Lizada said their first applicant was U-go. Lizada declined to give the service's selling point, however. For the other TNC preparing to file its papers, she hinted that its application will be connected to taxis. At stake is a demand of 300,000 phone-booked trips per day, which Grab and Uber have cornered to each make P150 to P180 million a month, the LTFRB estimated.

For one, car-based TNC U-Hop has not been penalized as it has followed all of the LTFRB's orders. “We have learned from what had happened,” Lizada said. “At least we now know ano pag-aralan mo (what we need to study).” “If you give the TNCs too much room there will be always a subject to abuse, so from the start, as you, before you accredit them, you lay down the terms and conditions,” Lizada said.

This means the prospective TNCs can only get drivers by inviting present LTFRB-accredited Uber, Grab or U-Hop drivers to join their ranks.

Delgra said his boss was referring to “colorum” drivers – or those operating without permits from government – when he said he wanted the government to get a share in the earnings of the ride-hailing drivers. On Wednesday, Tugade said in a press briefing in Malacañang: “Kailangan diyan may share din diyan 'yung gobyerno, 'yung kinikita doon. Kung kailangan may mekanismo at tsaka pamamaraan niyan na 'yung plete na binabayaran o 'yung kita na inaambag, eh ibahagi 'nyo naman sa gobyerno.” (The government should have a share in their earnings. If needed, there should be a mechanism and a way that the government gets a share in the fares what [the drivers] get or what the share they contribute [to Grab and Uber]. You should give the government a share.) The secretary's statement was met with online rage from regular Grab and Uber riders. “Ang punto ni Secretary Tugade at ng LTFRB, kapag colorum ang isang sasakyan, walang habol d'yan ang gobyerno. Paano mo masisingil ng tamang tax kung hindi nga sila rehistrado?” Delgra said in a press statement on Thursday. (The point of Secretary Tugade and the LTFRB is, if a vehicle is “colorum,” then the government go after them. How can you charge taxes if they are not registered?) “Like any business, TNCs and their partners are covered by laws of taxation and they must give what’s due to the government,\" Delgra added. However, the LTFRB cannot collect taxes anytime soon. Their hands are tied since they had given Grab and Uber until July 26 before apprehending some 26,600 colorum drivers, whose numbers have increased since 2016. Delaying the apprehension further, the transport network companies both filed motions for reconsideration against the LTFRB’s order. According to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, they hold another meeting with Grab and Uber on July 26 to discuss how to solve the regulation deadlock. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-fast-track-renewal-expired-permits-grab-uber","title":"LTFRB fast-tracks renewal of expired Grab, Uber permits","date":"Jul 19, 2017 4:46 PM PHT","snippet":"A one-stop shop at the LTFRB headquarters in Quezon City will process applications from 8 am to 3 pm daily","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) began fast-tracking the renewal of expired permits for transport network vehicle service (TNVS) operators Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 19. \"Those pending with us, which is around the total number that we will be fast-tracking, will be around somewhere between 10,000 and 11,000,\" LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after their technical working group meeting on Wednesday. For this, the LTFRB set up a one-stop shop inside its headquarters in Quezon City. From 8 am to 3 pm every day, it will accommodate drivers with expired provisional authority (PA) permits who are waiting for their certificate of public convenience franchise, and those with expired CPCs. The PA is given to drivers while they wait for the approval of their CPC franchise and is valid for 45 days. The PA can be renewed repeatedly until the CPC is approved. The CPC is valid for one year to 7 years. According to Lizada this is a measure in anticipation to July 26, when they will begin apprehending some 26,600 TNVS drivers who do not have permits. \"We have to bring it out to solve, to address immediately the problems of other commuters....

Aquino made the call a day after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slapped a P5-million fine each on Grab and Uber for letting some of their drivers operate without permits. \"We need to provide the commuting public with better options and alternatives to improve their daily commuting experience. The government must work with rideshare companies that share this mission and develop suitable standards and requirements for them,\" Aquino said in a statement on Wednesday, July 12. \"I urge the LTFRB to address this issue of penalties for rideshare companies. Then we can focus on passing legislation to develop the industry and to ensure these new transport networks are held accountable for offenses,\" he added. Last year, Aquino filed Senate Bill 696 or the Rideshare Support Company Act, which seeks \"to encourage new, affordable, and safe transportation options and ensure the safety of the riding public by imposing safety and financial responsibility standards and requirements.\" \"In any industry, increased competition often leads to improved quality, improved service, and lower prices for consumers. For the commuting public, this is a change they have long clamored for,\" the senator said in his explanatory note to SB 696.

LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Tuesday that the interest of the riding public \"overrides\" the provision. On Wednesday, Aquino renewed his push for SB 696 which seeks to institutionalize a regulatory framework for the new type of service.

The suit contends that a Waymo manager took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto. \"We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,\" an Uber spokeswoman said in an email reply to an AFP inquiry. Waymo called for a trial, and urged the court to order Otto and Uber to stop using patented technology at issue in the case.  Waymo also wanted unspecified damages in what it described in court documents as \"an action for trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, and unfair competition.\" Waymo argued that a \"calculated theft\" of its technology netted Otto a buyout of more than $500 million and enabled Uber to revive a stalled self-driving car program. California-based ride-sharing service Uber acquired commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto late last year as the company pressed ahead with its pursuit of self-driving technology. Anthony Levandowski, a co-founder of Otto, a 90-person startup, was put in charge of Uber's efforts to develop self-driving technology for personal driving, delivery and trucking. Waymo's lawsuit contended that Levandowski in December 2015 downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary files from a highly confidential design server to a laptop. A week later, and after removing a data storage card, Levandowski reformatted the company laptop in what the suit maintained was an attempt to erase any trace of what happened to the downloaded data. At issue in the suit was proprietary LiDAR system information that was stored on the Waymo server and which, according to the company, wound up at Otto. Waymo has invested tens of millions of dollars in LiDAR sensors that use lasers to scan and essentially enable vehicles to \"see\" what is around them, according to the lawsuit. \"Thanks in part to this highly advanced LiDAR technology, Waymo became the first company to complete a fully self-driving trip on public roads in a vehicle without a steering wheel,\" the suit said. After downloading confidential information regarding Waymo’s LiDAR systems and other technology, and while working at Waymo, Levandowski attended meetings with high-level executives at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco in January 2016, the lawsuit contended. By the end of that month, Levandowski officially formed a venture that would become Otto and resigned from Waymo, according to the court filing. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/michelle-obama-profile","title":"Michelle Obama: uber-mom, style icon, political force","date":"Jan 19, 2017 10:38 PM PHT","snippet":"Once a reluctant 'mom-in-chief,' the tall, toned Princeton and Harvard graduate – America's first black first lady – has evolved, becoming a singular voice for women and a political dynamo","body":"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – In 2008, Michelle Obama was tentative on the campaign trail, wary of saying anything to jeopardize her husband's historic bid to be America's first black president. Eight years later, the self-assured first lady – back on the campaign trail – electrified Democratic Party faithful with a passionate takedown of Donald Trump and what she called his \"frightening\" attitude towards women. \"It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\" Obama told a rally for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. \"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable.\" The speech cemented the transformation of Obama, who turns 53 on Tuesday. Once a reluctant 'mom-in-chief,' the tall, toned Princeton and Harvard graduate – America's first black first lady – has evolved, becoming a singular voice for women and a political dynamo. During her husband's two terms in the nation's highest office, the native of Chicago's South Side – who grew up in a one-bedroom apartment with her parents and older brother – has also become a style icon and global role model. \"One of the most intriguing things about Michelle Obama is that she represents so many things to so many different people,\" Peter Slevin, a professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism and the author of \"Michelle Obama: A Life,\" told AFP. \"She chose her issues, she stayed true to her values and she made the role uniquely her own.\" From the South Side to Harvard Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born in Chicago on January 17, 1964 to a stay-at-home mom and a father who never missed work at a city water plant despite a battle with multiple sclerosis. She received an Ivy League education at two of the nation's most elite schools – Princeton and Harvard, where she studied law, as her future husband would also do. Michelle joined the Sidley Austin law firm in Chicago upon graduation and it was there that she met Barack Obama – a young associate she was asked to mentor. That meeting would change her life. Obama's political career skyrocketed, and by January 2009, their family would move into the White House. Her causes At first, Michelle Obama focused her attention on getting the couple's two young daughters, Malia and Sasha, settled into their new home. \"Those early years in the White House were a real adjustment for Michelle,\" David Axelrod, a former senior advisor to Barack Obama, told CNN. \"She had to start over in so many ways and she had to do it under the watchful eye of the world. And that's a lot of pressure.\" The first lady soon found her stride, and steered clear of controversy, embracing causes with universal appeal. Her \"Let's Move\" initiative to stamp out childhood obesity through healthy eating and exercise earned praise, as did her work to promote the wellbeing of military families. Jennifer Lawless, the director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University in Washington, told AFP the \"strong argument she made for being active... resonated in a way that a lot of first ladies' issues don't hit home.\" In 2015, Obama went global with the \"Let Girls Learn\" campaign, a cross-agency effort to improve education for teenage girls worldwide. \"She connected powerfully with a wide array of audiences – as a working mother, as a progressive Democrat and, as she herself put it, as a 'little black girl from the South Side of Chicago',\" Slevin noted. Throughout her time at the White House, Obama has also emerged as a beacon of support for the US fashion industry. She turned once little-known designers such as Jason Wu into major style stars, and made it acceptable to wear a cardigan to meet Queen Elizabeth II. And she embraced social media and pop culture – dancing with late night talk show host Jimmy Fallon, rapping with Missy Elliott in a \"Carpool Karaoke\" sketch, or doing the mannequin challenge with NBA superstar LeBron James. \"She's just fundamentally cool. She is comfortable in any kind of setting. She seems real,\" Lawless said, adding that her television appearances or viral videos did not seem \"artificial – just her embracing the way people communicate.\" Political force Last year, as Clinton and Trump vied for the presidency, Obama took on a new and somewhat unexpected role: political powerhouse.  She was a natural on the campaign trail and a forceful surrogate for Clinton, herself a former first lady. In October, Obama – a first lady who once shied away from controversy and endured racial slurs throughout her time in Washington from a small fringe of Americans – unleashed a fierce attack on Clinton's Republican rival. \"This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior. And actually bragging about kissing and groping women,\" she said of Trump's comments caught on video, which he dismissed as guy talk. \"The men in my life do not talk about women like this,\" she said. \"This is not how decent human beings behave.\" That day, Obama knowingly stepped into the political limelight she had long shunned – and people listened. \"She spent eight years developing a relationship with the American people and they came to trust her,\" Lawless told AFP. Moving on In an exit interview with CBS, the president admitted his wife was looking forward to regaining some semblance of a normal life. \"Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny,\" he said. \"She never fully embraced being in the public spotlight -- which is ironic, given how good she is.\" Obama has repeatedly said she is not interested in a political career for herself, but could she follow in Clinton's footsteps, from the role of first lady to elected office? \"In 12 years, if an Illinois senate seat is open and the Democrats have no one to run... who knows what can happen? Life changes and she's young,\" Lawless said.  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/kontroversi-uber-vs-taksi-resmi-pemerintah-musti-apa","title":"Kontroversi Uber vs taksi resmi, pemerintah mesti apa?","date":"Mar 25, 2016 7:51 AM PHT","snippet":"Kalau taksi resmi harus punah dengan formatnya yang sekarang, pastikan itu karena mereka kalah bersaing, bukan karena tangan mereka diikat","body":" Awal minggu ini kita disibukkan oleh kontroversi taksi aplikasi (Uber dan Grab) vs taksi konvensional. Api yang telah cukup lama ada dalam sekam akhirnya meletup juga.  Sopir taksi resmi dalam satu tahun ini memang merasakan ketidakadilan dengan beroperasinya Uber dan Grab. Murahnya tarif taksi aplikasi telah menekan pendapatan taksi konvensional. Melalui demo besar-besaran, kekesalan itu terlampiaskan dalam bentuk yang sangat brutal. Kita sudah liat cuplikan-cuplikannya. Ngeri. Mudah bagi para netizen untuk mengolok-olok sopir taksi ataupun perusahaannya sebagai bagian dari dinosaurus yang akan punah. Mereka melihat teknologi sebagai dewa baru yang akan melindas siapapun yang menghalangi derap teknologi itu. Netizen ini bisa jadi benar, tapi cara melihat teknologinya keliru. Teknologi itu sekadar enabler. Sesuatu yang memampukan kita untuk melakukan sesuatu dengan lebih efektif atau efisien. Daya \"rusak bukan ditentukan oleh teknologi itu sendiri, namun pada pemanfaatannya dalam mengubah cara berbisnis. Ini yang jadi persoalan ketika teknologi tersebut diterapkan pada bidang yang diregulasi oleh pemerintah. Apa yang \"dirusak\" oleh Uber dan Grab? Ada beberapa. Uber dan Grab memang memberikan efisiensi bagi sopirnya. Pemborosan terbesar bagi taksi resmi atau konvensional adalah kegiatannya memutar kota tanpa penumpang. Untuk berbaris menunggu penumpang di sentra-sentra ekonomi pun ada premannya. Biaya. Sementara itu, sopir Uber dan Grab bisa duduk manis di mana saja, menunggu permintaan dari lokasi terdekat. Itu saja sudah memberikan keunggulan kompetisi melawan taksi resmi. Dan ini sah. Namun, yang benar-benar \"merusak\" adalah penentuan harganya. Sungguhpun Uber dan Grab memiliki standar harga, mereka bisa mengubahnya melalui ketersediaan penawaran dan permintaan. Pada jam-jam sibuk, mereka bisa menaikkan harga. Pada jam-jam sepi mereka bisa kasih diskon. Sebenarnya ini hal yang baik. Tapi keleluasaan mengatur harga ini tidak dimiliki oleh taksi resmi — dan ini masalahnya. Rasa keadilan kita harusnya tergerak saat dua entitas dengan layanan yang sama harus berkompetisi dengan aturan berbeda. Yang satu bebas menaikkan dan menurunkan harga, yang lain diikat dengan ketat. Anda boleh berargumen kalau pengaturan rentang harga itu dipicu oleh ketamakan pengusaha taksi melalui kartel Organisasi Angkutan Darat (Organda). Saya setuju. Tapi faktanya, pengaturan itu ada dan sopir taksi sebagai pihak yang paling lemah telah menjadi korban. Sebagai masyarakat, kita ingin agar teknologi apapun bisa dimanfaatkan untuk terjadinya alokasi sumber daya yang lebih effisien. Aplikasi Uber dan Grab memberikan itu. Dengan demikian, tidak pada tempatnya kita menolak aplikasi Uber dan Grab. Namun, pemerintah harus memastikan aturan yang dibuat menciptakan persaingan yang setara. Kalau taksi resmi, dengan formatnya yang sekarang harus punah, pastikan itu karena mereka kalah bersaing. Bukan karena mereka diikat tangannya. Jadi pertanyaannya bukan lagi apakah pemerintah akan melegalkan taksi berbasis aplikasi atau tidak. Tergantung sudut pandangnya, banyak pihak yang merasa Uber dan Grab itu merupakan sesuatu yang legal. Akan habis waktu kita di situ. Pertanyaan pentingnya, bagaimana pemerintah bisa membuat aturan yang mampu mengadopsi dua kriteria utama tadi. Satu, pemanfaatan aplikasi Uber dan Grab untuk memberikan layanan transportasi yang lebih efektif dan effsien. Dua, memberikan aturan yang setara bagi Uber dan taksi resmi. Saya punya beberapa usulan. Pertama, saya ingin pemerintah menarik garis tegas dulu antara penyedia aplikasi Uber dan Grab beserta mitra mereka. Mereka harus jadi dua entitas yang berbeda. Mari kita atur dulu mitra Uber dan GrabCar. Merekalah pengusaha layanan angkutan. Kedua, untuk adilnya, pengusaha taksi resmi dan partner Uber dan Grab harus diatur dengan ketentuan yang sama agar keadilannya terjaga. Kalau Keputusan Menteri Perhubungan yang sekarang tidak memungkinkan, mari diubah Keputusan Menteri (KepMen) itu dengan KepMen yang baru. Jangan malas. Dalam KepMen yang baru itu pendefinisian argometer dalam taksi perlu diubah. Pastikan dengan definisi baru, sistem penentuan harga dalam aplikasi Uber dan Grab, bisa dikategorikan sebagai argometer. Ketiga, hapuskan batas tarif. Berikan kesempatan kepada semua pihak untuk bersaing secara setara. Saya paham pembebasan batas tarif ini merupakan hal yang tidak sederhana. Ada beberapa isu yang harus dijawab tentang perlindungan konsumen. Menjamin bahwa mereka tidak ditipu dengan argo kuda. Tapi kalau aplikasi Uber bisa, kenapa taksi resmi tidak bisa? Keempat, dengan kemungkinan adanya perang harga, pemerintah harus menjamin standar pelayanan angkutan umum dengan lebih baik. Pengawasan ini penting karena keselamatan penumpang biasanya jadi hal yang dikorbankan saat terjadi perang harga. Kelima, tidak perlu merepotkan diri dengan urusan plat kuning atau plat hitam. Jadikan itu pilihan. Toh, pilihan plat itu punya konsekuensi positif dan negatif sendiri. Dengan plat kuning, bisa bebas pajak barang mewah. Tapi kurang gaya kalau dipakai jadi kendaraan pribadi. Keenam, dan ini adalah hal yang penting, pastikan pengusaha angkutan baik itu taksi resmi atau partner Uber memiliki kontrak kerja untuk melindungi kepentingan sopir. Pada akhirnya, merekalah yang menjadi garda terdepan dalam layanan transportasi. Apakah pemerintah akan mendengar usulan saya? Ardi Wirdamulia adalah Doktor dari PSIM FEUI dalam Ilmu Manajemen.

San Francisco-based Uber, which allows customers to hail taxis or private vehicles via smartphones and pay with a credit card, is expanding rapidly in the region while fending off legal and regulatory challenges in various markets across the world. Founded in 2009 and backed by Google Ventures, the investment arm of the Internet giant, Uber now operates in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam after first entering Southeast Asia in Singapore last year. The firm, whose valuation was placed at $18.2 billion after an investment drive in June, employs smartphone and satellite technology to match taxi supply and demand. A list of the world's 10 worst cities to hail a taxi compiled by industry website tourism-review.com in March included Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh and Bangkok. In Singapore, locals grumbled in pre-Uber days about vanishing taxis during peak periods, with cabbies refusing to pick up roadside passengers while waiting to earn extra fees from reservations made via antiquated phone-in booking systems. In some cities, it was not uncommon for cabbies to demand exorbitant fares before taking passengers at peak periods, during heavy rain and floods, or at times of day when taxis are scarce. Regulatory tangles Uber executives say they welcome competition and are more than ready to go head to head with the likes of Malaysia-based GrabTaxi, Indonesia's Blue Bird, and Easy Taxi, a regional player backed by German startup incubator Rocket Internet. \"As long as people are giving people options, that's a good thing,\" Michael Brown, Uber's Southeast Asia general manager, told Agence France-Presse in an interview. \"What makes Uber bristle is when special interests try to protect monopolies and keep new entrants and new competitors out,\" said Brown, who is based in Singapore. Despite threats to have it banned in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Uber continues to operate there. The firm is also facing legal threats in San Francisco and other major cities including New York and Frankfurt. It is has also run into opposition in Seoul, where officials believe it should follow South Korean laws regulating taxi or rental car companies. \"Uber insists that it is acting as an online broker connecting drivers and customers rather than acting as a rental car company,\" a Seoul city official told Agence France-Presse. \"We do not agree with their characterization of their business.\" Authorities in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta also say its car-hailing service makes use of private vehicles that do not comply with strict regulations that traditional taxi operators come under. Uber has vehemently denied the accusations. The firm does not own its own limousine or taxi fleet. Instead, its app allows customers to summon cars in its network, usually from a private car company. It takes a cut of the total fare from the driver, which is paid electronically. Other taxi app players allow their members to take cash. \"Up to this day our principle remains that this taxi service is illegal,\" Muhammad Akbar, head of Jakarta's transport authority, told Agence France-Presse. In Malaysia, authorities say they began a crackdown on private cars using Uber on October 1, fining drivers up to 10,000 ringgit ($3,070). Giving people options Commuters and market analysts say unyielding bureaucrats are not seeing how taxi apps like Uber have the potential to significantly improve the standard of living of city dwellers. Jakarta resident Winda Rezita said the arrival of Uber in the Indonesian capital was a relief. \"When I am too lazy to drive in Jakarta's heavy traffic jams or when there's a long taxi queue at the mall, I just switch on the app,\" the e-commerce business founder told AFP. \"It's so much better than waiting outside a building or standing in a long queue.\" Daphne Kasriel-Alexander, a consumer trends consultant at research firm Euromonitor International, said \"inadequate and overburdened public transport systems\" coupled with the emergence of more middle-class consumers have boosted the usage of taxi-hailing apps in Southeast Asia. Expansion plans GrabTaxi, which first launched in Malaysia in 2012 and has since expanded to Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, is aiming for further growth. Unlike Uber, the firm, backed by Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings, has so far avoided regulatory difficulties. Its app mainly matches customers with registered taxis. A recently launched function called GrabCar allows for booking of private vehicles just like Uber, but so far it has not been flagged by authorities. \"We're the leading taxi booking app in Southeast Asia including Singapore, and we are well-positioned to extend our lead,\" Lim Kell Jay, GrabTaxi's general manager in Singapore, told Agence France-Presse. The firm says it gets one taxi booking every two seconds in the whole region, with more than 300,000 people using it at least once a month. Taxi drivers say they hope the intense rivalry between the apps will continue. A Singaporean taxi driver who only wanted to be known as Tan said his revenue has increased by 20% to 30% since he signed up with UberTaxi last month. The service connects Uber users to registered taxis, just like rival GrabTaxi. \"With the apps like Uber, it's like a win-win. You (passengers) wait around less, and we drivers don't have to roam around hunting for passengers, saving time and petrol,\" he told Agence France-Presse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/youtube-alan-alex-stokes-plead-guilty-staging-fake-bank-robberies","title":"Twin YouTube stars plead guilty to staging fake bank robberies","date":"Apr 1, 2021 11:36 AM PHT","snippet":"One fake bank robbery of YouTube pranksters Alan and Alex Stokes led to police drawing guns on the brothers' unsuspecting Uber driver","body":"YouTube stars Alan and Alex Stokes, twins known for provocative video gags, have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from two fake bank robberies they staged in California, one of which led to police drawing their guns on the brothers' unsuspecting Uber driver. The 23-year-old brothers were originally each charged with one felony count of false imprisonment by violence, menace or fraud, and two misdemeanor counts of falsely reporting an emergency in connection with the October 15, 2019, pranks in the city of Irvine. Those charges carried a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison, according to the Orange County district attorney's office. But the brothers accepted a bargain offered by the judge reducing the felony count to a misdemeanor and imposing a more lenient sentence –probation and 160 hours of community service – in return for a guilty plea. The judge also ordered the brothers, who boast nearly 7 million subscribers on YouTube, to stop making videos mimicking criminal behavior, the district attorney's office said. The plea was entered in court Tuesday over the objection of prosecutors who felt the tougher charges were warranted given the potential danger to the community, Kimberly Edds, the district attorney's spokeswoman, said on Wednesday. A similar stunt in Tennessee last February ended with the prankster fatally shot by his \"victim,\" she said. In the Stokes case, the brothers dressed in black clothing and ski masks and carried duffle bags full of cash as they pretended to flee from a bank robbery, while their videographer recorded the stunt.

During the House committee hearing on the registration and franchising or lack thereof of the two companies, Uber said it has more than 66,000 \"partners who have taken at least one trip in the past year.\" Out of that number, only over 2,500 have either a provisional authority (PA) permit or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise, which allows them to ply the streets of Metro Manila. Grab, meanwhile, has more than 52,000 vehicles accredited with only 3,000 to 4,000 of those vehicles possessing either PAs or CPCs from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). \"We are shocked, to say the least,\" LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said, after the two companies stated the figures. Delgra said up until today, the number of vehicles registered under Grab and Uber had been unclear even to them. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before the House of Representatives to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. \"Come to Congress, get your franchise, and don't fight with LTFRB,\" said AKO Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe, author of a bill that would regulate TNCs. Batocabe lost his nephew to a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore last month. Lawmakers also quipped that it was no wonder traffic in Metro Manila has gotten worse, given the sheer number of TNC vehicles on the road.    Both Uber and Grab, however, clarified that not all of the vehicles registered in their networks ply Metro Manila at the same time. Some \"partners\" are registered with both companies. Not all drivers are full-time either, meaning they only drive their vehicles for a few hours a day at most. Bong Suntay of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) said they are fine with operating alongside Uber and Grab so long as these ride-hailing services \"are regulated just like [taxis].\" \"The requirements are almost the same. But the difference is in the compliance. So it's an unequal application [of the rules],\" said Suntay. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/wrap-indonesia-bandung-haze","title":"The wRap Indonesia: Haze-related arrests, Uber-less Bandung","date":"Sep 8, 2015 7:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber is banned from Bandung, YouTube announces Indonesia's first-ever FanFest, and other top news to start your day.","body":"Eight people are detained in relation to forest fires that have caused widespread haze across the country – including 6 provinces that are under emergency alert status.

Some 58% of voters backed a proposition exempting the firms, which will instead provide some benefits but ones that fall short of those given to traditional employees. The measure divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others enjoy the flexibility of being able to work when they choose to pick up extra income. Uber driver Erica Mighetto campaigned against the proposition. \"I'm among tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of drivers who are devastated by this outcome,\" Mighetto told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by the fact that billionaire corporations can buy their ways out of laws. More than $200 million was spent on Proposition 22, in what is reported to be the most spent on an initiative before voters in the state. Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86% worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model. Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. An appeals court recently rejected a bid by Uber and Lyft to avoid having to treat drivers as employees while battling the California labor law.

PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo had announced the forthcoming release of the interim measures during a public hearing on the deal on Thursday, April 5, when it was first announced that the PCC had asked Uber and Grab to continue using their own platforms beyond Sunday, April 8. (READ: PCC asks Uber, Grab to continue separate operations beyond April 8) The PCC order, dated April 6, effectively stops Grab’s acquisition of its competitor temporarily until the PCC completes its \"in-depth review\" of the local implications of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to Grab.  Measures Under the interim measures, aside from maintaining the independence of their respective operations and other conditions that prevailed prior to the deal on March 25, Uber and Grab were also directed to \"refrain from providing access to or from allowing a party to obtain from the other party any confidential information, including but not limited to information pertaining to pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, partner drivers, and customers.\" The National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier expressed concern about privacy issues that may arise from the deal, saying personal data privacy should be respected and protected in the process. (READ: No migration of personal data to Grab in Uber app shutdown – privacy commission) The PCC also ordered the ride-hailing services to: Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC's order, but this will not be immediately executory as they will be given a chance to explain their side. Compliance report Referring to the continued independent operations after April 8, the PCC said in its order, \"Should the Respondents failed to comply with item (a) above within five (5) working days from service of this Order, Respondents shall show cause within twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the aforementioned five (5) day period as to why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.\" The PCC also ordered Uber and Grab to submit periodic verified compliance reports with supporting documents, the first within 15 days from the service of the order, and evern 20 days after. The PCC is mandated to protect competition in the market and prohibit anticompetitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. Virtual monopolization In a statement, PCC chairman Arsenio Balisacan said the looming monopoly may have consequences for Filipinos who avail of the ride-sharing services.   “This move by Uber in the Philippine market leads to further substantial concentration of what is, to begin with, an already highly concentrated ride-sharing market. This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,” he said.  “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,\" he added. The PCC chief cited the case of Uber operations in Singapore. “Uber’s compliance with our antitrust counterpart in Singapore to extend the operation of its app indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” he said.  Balisacan also said that Uber does not highlight the fact that it would become a “part-owner” of Grab through the deal. “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he said.   Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.

We believe the government's efforts to improve road safety complements our own efforts to practice and promote the same with our driver partners,\" Uber said in an e-mail correspondence with Rappler. Drivers under TNVS companies are heavily reliant on their devices to accept trips or locate their passengers. They fear that they may not be able to use navigational apps like Waze and Google Maps. In an interview with Rappler, Law Enforcement Service Director Francis Ray Almora of the Land Transportation Office clarified that motorists can still use these apps as long as they use hands-free function.

Sukses merintis layanan di Jakarta, kini Uber sudah merambah hingga ke empat kota lainnya seperti Bandung, Surabaya, Bali dan terakhir Yogyakarta. Beragam perluasan layanan pun terus dihadirkan seperti UberPool, UberMotor hingga UberTrip yang dihadirkan khusus di Bali. Yang terbaru adalah kerjasama Uber dengan LINE di mana pengguna LINE di Indonesia bisa memesan perjalanan Uber tanpa harus pindah dari aplikasi LINE bahkan tanpa harus mengunduh aplikasi Uber.  Pencapaian-pencapaian Uber di Indonesia selama tahun 2016 pun lantas dirangkum di Year with Uber 2016. Berikut data menarik yang terungkap dalam Year with Uber 2016: Jarak perjalanan sepanjang 603 juta kilometer Jakarta memang menjadi pasar terbesar Uber di Indonesia. Karena itu, jarak perjalanan di Jakarta pun menjadi yang terbesar. Tercatat, total jarak perjalanan di Jakarta mencapai 603,000,005. Jarak tersebut setara dengan jarak tempuh berkeliling dunia sebanyak 15,000 kali, lho! Destinasi terpopuler Untuk warga Jakarta, ternyata Bandara Soekarno-Hatta menjadi destinasi utama saat menggunakan Uber. Dan tercatat, sebanyak 24 persen perjalanan dilakukan di pinggiran kota Jakarta. Sebanyak 30 persen perjalanan Uber di Jakarta dilakukan pukul 20.00 hingga 02.00. Selain itu, terungkap pula data bahwa Jumat pukul 17.00 sampai 18.00 menjadi periode waktu di mana Uber paling banyak digunakan di Jakarta. Waktu ini tidak berbeda jauh dari data Uber secara global, dimana waktu terbanyak penggunaan Uber ada di hari Sabtu pukul 22.00-23.00. Rekor perjalanan Tahun ini lewat Year with Uber, Uber pun ingin mengungkap data perjalan para pengguna dan mitra pengemudi mereka. Rekor perjalanan terbanyak yang pernah dilakukan seorang pengguna Uber di Jakarta adalah sebanyak 1.777 perjalanan. Sementara untuk mitra pengemudinya, ada satu orang yang berhasil mencatat sebanyak 3.170 perjalanan di Jakarta selama tahun 2016. Berkaca dari data-data kesuksesan selama tahun 2016, tahun depan, Uber Indonesia akan memfokuskan diri untuk menyuguhkan experience terbaik mereka, kepada pengguna maupun mitra pengemudinya. \"Kami akan fokus pada tiga hal yakni keamanan saar berkendara, kecepatan yang berarti waktu tunggu yang lebih singkat serta kehandalan,\" ujar Alan Jiang, Managing Director Uber Indonesia saat bertemu dengan media di kawasan Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta Selatan, Kamis, 15 Desember. Alan juga mengungkap fakta bahwa perkembangan Uber di Indonesia, khususnya di Jakarta, cukup pesat dibanding negara lain. Hanya dalam dua tahun, Uber di Jakarta bisa menyaingi kota-kota lain yang mungkin butuh lima sampai enam tahun untuk mencapai prestasi serupa. \"Jakarta sudah pasti menjadi salah satu pasar utama dan terpenting bagi Uber secara global,\" kata Alan lagi.

Menteri Koperasi dan UKM, Anak Agung Gede Ngurah (AAGN) Puspayoga di kantor Kementerian Koperasi dan UKM di Jakarta menyerahkan akta pendirian badan hukum koperasi PRRI. \"Dengan adanya badan hukum tersebut, saya mengharapkan polemik seputar angkutan darat beraplikasi teknologi bisa segera diakhiri,\" kata Puspayoga pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Dia menyebut, pada dasarnya hal yang menjadi permasalahan saat ini bukan terletak kepada aplikasi online. Tetapi, pada badan hukumnya. Oleh sebab itu, perusahaan angkutan umum darat menganggap pihak lain tidak memenuhi aturan yang berlaku. \"Nah, dengan badan hukum koperasi ini, para pengemudi pun sudah memiliki payung hukum. Mereka sudah bisa melakukan uji KIR (uji kendaraan) melalui koperasi,\" kata dia. Selain itu, Puspayoga melanjutkan, dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, maka para anggotanya sudah bisa menikmati berbagai kemudahan dari pemerintah, antara lain fasilitas akses kredit usaha rakyat (KUR) dan Lembaga Pengelola Dana Bergulir (LPDB) KUMKM dengan suku bunga rendah. \"Kredit itu bisa untuk uang muka mobil, misalnya. Kredit Rp25 juta tidak perlu memakai agunan yang bisa dinikmati oleh anggota koperasi,\" tutur dia. Sementara, Ketua Koperasi Jasa PRRI, Ponco Seno menjelaskan, selama ini pengusaha rental mobil umumnya terafiliasi dengan aplikasi transportasi berbasis online seperti GrabCar dan Uber tidak memiliki badan hukum. \"Dengan tergabung dalam badan koperasi, artinya kita sudah memiliki wadah secara resmi untuk menjalankan usaha sewa mobil, termasuk yang menggunakan aplikasi teknologi. Kita disatukan dalam satu wadah koperasi,\" kata Ponco. Saat ini, jumlah anggota koperasi PRRI sudah mencapai 5.000 orang. Proses pengajuan badan hukum koperasi itu bahkan sudah berjalan sejak Oktober 2015. \"Dasar kami berbadan hukum koperasi adalah memenuhi ketentuan UU Nomor 22 tahun 2009 tentang angkutan umum. Jadi, GrabCar sudah mengikuti aturan pemerintah untuk menjalankan bisnis transportasi di Indonesia,\" kata dia. Manfaat lainnya yang diperoleh anggota koperasi yakni mereka mendapat fasilitas asuransi jiwa bagi pengemudi, ada pool bengkel bagi sekitar 300 unit dan bekerja sama dengan ATPM untuk perawatan kendaraan. Tidak ada izin Sebelumnya, Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan mengatakan mengukung keberadaan transportasi berbasis aplikasi online. Namun, dia mempermasalahkan baik GrabCar dan Uber tidak mengantongi izin. Izin yang disampaikan kepada Kementerian Perhubungan adalah keduanya masuk kategori perusahaan Teknologi Informasi (TI). \"Itu saja, bukan (kami mempermasalahkan) soal onlinenya. Online sangat bagus, kami mendukung. Cuma hingga saat ini, baik Grab dan Uber mengaku mereka IT provider. Itu pun betul, kami tidak menyalahkan mereka,\" ujar Jonan yang ditemui di Istana Negara pada Rabu, 16 Maret. Kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan GrabCar pun bukan dikategorikan untuk kendaraan umum baik itu taksi atau kendaraan sewa. Soal Uber dan GrabCar yang sudah tergabung dalam koperasi, dia turut mengaku belum menerima laporan itu. \"Saya kok ga terima laporan itu ada izinnya. Kalau sudah masuk koperasi ya diajukan izinnya atas nama koperasi,\" kata mantan Direktur PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) itu. Pihak GrabCar yang dihubungi Rappler mengatakan belum ingin berkomentar mengenai masuknya perusahaan mereka ke dalam koperasi. Sedangkan, pihak Uber tidak mengangkat telepon Rappler hari ini. Pada hari Senin kemarin, ribuan pengendara angkutan darat berunjuk rasa di dekat Istana Negara dan menuntut agar pemerintah menutup segera aplikasi online yang digunakan oleh GrabCar dan Uber. Para demonstran yang didominasi oleh sopir taksi itu mengeluh sejak kehadiran transportasi berbasis aplikasi online, penghasilan mereka menurun drastis. Para sopir taksi menuding transportasi berbasis aplikasi online bisa memberlakukan tarif murah karena tidak membayar pajak dan memiliki izin operasional di Indonesia. - dengan laporan ANTARA/Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/tro-uber-grabcar-tnvs-operations-transport-coalition","title":"TRO vs Uber, GrabCar should cover operations – transport groups","date":"Dec 8, 2015 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'The TRO should cover everything, including existing operations. Otherwise, what's the point?' transport coalition STOP and GO says","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A transport coalition hit the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by a Quezon City court against Uber and GrabCar, after the judge clarified that the order won't stop existing operations of the app-based transportation network vehicle services (TNVS).  Lawyer David Erro, representing the petitioner STOP and GO coalition, said the 20-day TRO was \"useless\" if it only stops transportation agencies from accepting or processing TNVS applications without affecting existing operations. \"We were surprised by the clarification given by the judge because the very intention of our petition is to injunct operations....I don't know why, by a mere interview, the order was amended,\" Erro said during the hearing on Tuesday, December 8. In an interview with reporters, STOP and GO president Jun Magno also criticized the judge's clarification. \"We firmly believe that the TRO should cover everything, including existing operations... Otherwise, what's the point of our TRO?\" he said. Last week, Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 Judge Santiago Arenas stopped the implementation of several department orders and memorandum circulars of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The issuances outlined the guidelines for the accreditation and operation of TNVS. The TRO, however, was limited only to the processing and approval of future applications. In the 7-page TRO, Arenas said the transportation department and LTFRB should stop the \"implementation and enforcement of DOTC Department Order No 2015-11, LTFRB Memorandum Circulars Nos. 2015-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2015-18 and other issuances thereto which include the accepting, processing, and approving of applications belonging to TNVS category…for a period of 20 days effective from date of receipt.\" He made no reference to previously approved applications. Only future applications stopped Following the reports of other media organizations that the TRO supposedly covered existing Uber and Grabcar operations, the judge was prompted to issue the clarification. The TRO will not affect existing operations of TNVS units already accredited by the LTFRB. But Erro, who raised his voice several times during the hearing, said it was \"common sense\" that the group sought a TRO to stop existing operations, not future ones. He also pointed out that the operation of TNVS units falls under the DOTC's department orders, and that stopping the orders should mean stopping operations of TNVS as well. \"These TNVS are creations of the department order. We're questioning the implementation of the department order. If the court restrains that order, then existing operations should also be restrained,\" he said. But Arenas stood by the TRO, citing jurisprudence that previously issued permits are not covered by the restraining order. Arenas also said that Uber and GrabCar were neither ordered to stop their operations, nor were they named in the dispositive portion of the TRO, because the two companies were not included in the body of infomation submitted by the petitioner when they sought the TRO. STOP and GO wants to stop the operations of TNVS. The group said taxi drivers suffer lower income because of the oversupply of Uber and GrabCar units plying the streets of Metro Manila. The next hearing for the transport coalition's application for preliminary injunction is set on Tuesday, December 15. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/setelah-gojek-uber-kini-ada-bajaj-app","title":"Bajai App pede jadi alternatif aplikasi transportasi di Indonesia","date":"Sep 6, 2015 12:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Tak cuma taksi dan ojek, sekarang layanan pemesanan bajaj juga ada aplikasinya","body":"Demam layanan booking transportasi bisa dibilang tengah melanda Indonesia, khususnya Jakarta. Layanan booking taksi, mobil, hingga ojek sudah tersedia di Ibu Kota ini. Bahkan, layanan booking ojek misalnya, tidak hanya disediakan oleh satu atau dua pemain, tapi juga menarik sejumlah pemain baru yang ingin ikut mengambil peluang. Beberapa waktu lalu, muncul satu lagi layanan booking transportasi yang menyasar mode transportasi bajaj bernama Bajai App. Bajai App merupakan aplikasi mobile yang mulai dikembangkan oleh Feryanto Njomin dan sejumlah rekannya pada bulan April lalu. Bertujuan mulia untuk meningkatkan taraf hidup pengemudi bajaj dan mengurangi kemacetan di ibu kota, tim Bajai App mulai melakukan survei pada awal Januari lalu. Fery mengatakan: \"Agar lebih memahami kebutuhan konsumen, kami mulai melakukan survei sejak awal Januari lalu. Kami merasakan sendiri pengalaman menjadi penumpang, bahkan menjadi sopir. Dengan itu kami tahu masalah-masalah yang mereka hadapi, serta bagaimana menentukan tarif yang pas.\" Tarif yang ditentukan Bajai App memang tidak sama dengan aplikasi  booking transportasi lainnya. Jika aplikasi booking ojek misalnya, menentukan tarif berdasarkan jarak tempuh, Bajai App mengklaim menggunakan algoritma khusus. “Kami menggunakan algoritma canggih yang tidak hanya menentukan tarif berdasarkan jarak tempuh, tapi juga kondisi jalan, waktu, dan cuaca. Ini kami terapkan agar tarif yang dikenakan adil, tidak hanya bagi penumpang tapi juga bagi supir,” ujar Yusak Oey, salah satu pengembang aplikasi Bajai App. Sama seperti layanan booking transportasi pada umumnya, pengguna hanya perlu menentukan lokasi penjemputan dan destinasi. Nantinya, Bajai App akan menampilkan tarif yang harus dibayar oleh pengguna. Menariknya, jika jumlah penumpang lebih dari satu, atau jika penumpang membawa barang yang memerlukan jasa angkat, Bajai App akan membebankan biaya tambahan sebesar Rp5.000. Pengguna juga bisa memberikan tip kepada supir bajaj melalui fitur Tips. Legal, tapi peraturan memberatkan Bajai App sendiri mulai diluncurkan dalam masa uji coba sejak Juni lalu. Hingga kini, tim Bajai App yang berjumlah 10 orang masih terus memperbaiki dan menambah fitur-fitur yang ada di aplikasi ini. “Rencananya sih sekitar dua bulan lagilah sudah siap fitur-fiturnya,” ujar Fery. Menurut Fery, berbeda dari layanan booking transportasi lain yang berbuah kontroversi terkait legalitas, Bajai App berada dalam binaan Organda. “Bajaj kan diatur sama pemerintah,” tambahnya. Bagaimanapun, meski bekerja sama dengan Organda, ada satu peraturan pemerintah yang masih menjadi kendala Bajai App, yakni tidak diizinkannya bajaj melintasi jalan protokol. Ini tentunya bisa membatasi jumlah pelanggan yang ingin menaiki bajaj, utamanya mereka yang ingin bepergian dengan jarak cukup jauh. Meski bisa melewati jalan kecil, bisa saja waktu tempuh menjadi lebih lama. Terkait hal ini, Fery mengatakan bahwa pihaknya berupaya mengajukan perizinan agar bajaj boleh melewati jalan protokol. “Mudah-mudahan saja ya, soalnya kan bajaj juga bisa mengurangi kemacetan. Ukurannya juga lebih kecil dibanding taksi, tapi muat untuk 2-3 penumpang,” imbuhnya. Armada yang terbatas Selain mengembangkan aplikasi, tim Bajai App juga tengah disibukkan dengan mengedukasi sopir bajaj tentang penggunaan aplikasi buatan mereka. “Ini salah satu tantangan kami. Tak jarang kami harus berada di pangkalan sampai subuh,” ujar Fery. Hingga saat ini, baru ada sekitar 100-200 sopir bajaj yang telah bergabung. “Sebenarnya sudah ada ribuan yang mendaftar, tapi kami harus edukasi satu per satu. Jadi baru segitu yang sudah ready,” jelas Yusak. Karena hanya menargetkan bajaj biru, armada Bajai App terbilang terbatas. Menurut tim bajaj, total armada bajaj biru di Jakarta hanya berjumlah 7.000. Bandingkan dengan armada layanan booking lain yang jumlahnya hingga puluhan ribu. Layanan booking ojek misalnya, bahkan bisa bertambah banyak, karena siapa pun yang memiliki motor dan memenuhi kriteria bisa bergabung menjadi pengemudi. Terkait hal ini, Fery mengaku tidak merasa khawatir. Meski mungkin akan mengalami kesulitan mengembangkan jumlah armada, timnya akan mengembangkan jenis layanannya. “Rencananya nanti kami juga akan menyediakan layanan logistik. Atau jika ini sukses, kami juga akan merambah mode transportasi lain.” Tunda monetisasi, fokus jaring pengguna Ketika ditanya tentang peminat layanan booking bajaj ini, Fery mengatakan bahwa sudah ada sejumlah pengguna yang telah menggunakan layanannya. Sayangnya, ia enggan menyebut detail pasti jumlah pemesanan atau transaksi yang telah terjadi. Hingga saat ini, Bajai App yang baru tersedia untuk platform Android ini telah mendapat sekitar 500-1.000 unduhan di Google Play. Terkait monetisasi, tim Bajai App yang kini masih beroperasi secara bootstrap mengaku belum memikirkan soal ini karena masih berfokus menjaring pengguna. Bagaimanapun, tampaknya Bajai App tidak akan menerapkan sistem komisi seperti layanan booking transportasi lainnya. “Intinya kami mau menggratiskan layanan ini. Kami tidak akan menarik komisi,” tutur Fery. Ke depannya, Fery mengatakan bahwa Bajai App juga berencana untuk berekspansi ke kota lain di Indonesia. Tim Bajai App kini juga tengah mengembangkan aplikasinya untuk platform iOS guna menjangkau lebih banyak pengguna. Jika melihat berbagai kendala yang dihadapinya, Bajai App tampaknya akan mengalami banyak kesulitan untuk bertahan di ranah layanan booking transportasi. Ditambah lagi dengan sudah banyaknya layanan booking transportasi lain yang bisa dipilih pengguna.  Bagaimanapun, menarik untuk dilihat strategi apa yang akan digunakan tim Bajai App untuk mengatasi kendala-kendala tersebut. Yang jelas, kualitas layanan, keamanan, kenyamanan, dan harga merupakan beberapa faktor yang harus diperhatikan sebuah layanan booking transportasi untuk bisa bertahan di industri ini. — Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di situs berita teknologi dan startup TechinAsia.

Then reality hit. Without guests or open dining rooms, hotels and restaurants in the Netherlands have had to turn to offering takeaway meals. For the canal-side Astoria that meant a $20 burger to go. The chefs had to come up with something unique, said the hotel's manager Roberto Payer. \"The way we do it, the way we prepare it, the way we serve it, the way it comes home is very different to any other burger.\" For 19.50 euros ($23) plus an Uber Eats delivery fee, the Waldorf Signature burger comes with a 240-gram Holstein-Frisian meat patty and is served with English Duke of Berkshire bacon on a French brioche bun and aged Dutch cheese and homemade relish.

But how can we minimize the risk?","body":"   In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte’s economic managers aren’t so worried.  Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said, “We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it.” Meanwhile, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia played down nCoV’s impact on tourism as “short-term.” How bad will nCoV’s effects be? Some private sector economists predict Philippine growth might fall this year by no more than one percentage point. Government economists have yet to publish their own estimates.  In this piece let’s explore the various channels by which we might feel nCoV’s economic fallout. Global spread Let’s start with the big picture. By all indications, it seems China will take the greatest hit from nCoV. Some Chinese economists expect that this quarter nCoV will cost their economy about $60 billion and shave 2 percentage points off their economic growth. Note that China’s growth already dropped last year to its lowest level in nearly 3 decades. China is also grappling with the effects of the trade war that US President Donald Trump needlessly waged. Oil demand in China has recently dropped, too, rattling oil exporting countries and further stoking fears of an impending global economic slowdown. (At least you may expect local gas prices in the Philippines to ease in the coming weeks or months.) To avert macroeconomic collapse, the Chinese central bank already pumped $173 billion of additional liquidity into their economy. Elsewhere in the world, stock markets took a hit amid heightened business jitters. More importantly, experts foresee nCoV will have a more profound economic impact worldwide than the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. With China today being the world’s largest economy and accounting for about a third of global growth, economic trouble in China will invariably spell economic trouble for the rest of the world. The faster nCoV is contained, the better for all of us. Trade Here in the Philippines, the impact of nCoV hinges on our economy’s exposure to China – which, as you may have sensed, has increased of late. For starters, China today is the Philippines’ biggest supplier of imported goods. From January to November 2019, as much as $22.6 billion worth of our imports came from China. That’s 22.7% or more than a fifth of the total value of imports (Figure 1). Our exports to China are sizable, too: over the same period China bought $8.8 billion or 13.6% of our exports.   Figure 1.   With factories in China closing left and right, expect that Filipino consumers might have a harder time buying some imported Chinese goods. Our domestic manufacturing sector will also feel the pinch since Chinese factory shutdowns are widely expected to disrupt global supply chains. This means that if Chinese factories fail to produce enough parts and components like brake pads or semiconductors, the production of cars and smartphones elsewhere will contract. The situation would be a lot less worrisome if only we didn’t depend so much on semiconductors as a trading commodity. That is, if only we exported a more diverse portfolio of goods to the rest of the world, we would be less susceptible to disruptions in supply chains abroad – like the one nCoV is creating now. But there’s a silver lining. Some China-based companies are considering locating or focusing their operations outside China – including the Philippines. Already, Ftech, which manufactures brake pedals for Honda in Wuhan, has opted to produce more brake pedals in its Philippine factory. If other China-based firms follow suit, this might inadvertently turn the nCoV outbreak into an economic boon. But don’t count on it to boost domestic growth so much; we have bigger problems on hand. (READ: Why did Philippine economic growth drop to an 8-year low?) Flows of tourists, OFWs Prolonged travel bans due to nCoV are also bound to hurt the inflows and outflows of people, especially tourists and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). I noted before that the share of tourists from China has tripled from 2005 to 2018 (Figure 2). But with lockdowns, travel bans, and flight cancellations now in place, expect the inflow of Chinese tourists to dwindle – at least momentarily.   Figure 2.   The influx of Chinese workers and the expansion of new industries like POGO (Philippine offshore gaming operations) might also be curtailed, what with the recent quarantines ordered by government. Remittances by China-based OFWs might also falter, especially if many of them can’t return to China due to existing travel bans, or if they are laid off.  This will spell hardship for them and their families, but data suggest this won’t likely have a significant dent on the economy at large, with remittances from China amounting to just 3.2% of all land-based remittances worldwide in 2018 (Figure 3).    Figure 3. Face mask shortages Zeroing in on specific markets, face masks are now in short supply despite the World Health Organization’s reminders that the general public doesn’t really need to wear them. In basic economics, shortages signal that prices are too low. Shortages may be abated or eliminated by allowing the price of face masks to go up. Most people understandably decry price spikes in times of crisis. But there will, in fact, be more face masks – and other related items such as hand gels or sanitizers – available in the market if prices are allowed to adjust freely and seek their own level. The last thing government will want to do now is impose price ceilings, which might only induce more hoarding, stoke panic, and possibly worsen existing shortages. Government could instead import lots of face masks, just as Duterte had recently promised.  Better still, government ought to double its efforts to debunk the notion that healthy individuals always need face masks in the first place. When China sneezes Finally, people have debated whether it’s fair to blame China (and the Chinese) for the current nCoV outbreak. On the one hand, China has objectively become a fertile source of infectious diseases borne by animals and, hence, a hotbed of future viral outbreaks. As pointed out in a recent scientific paper, this is because of the scale of livestock production in China, coupled by massive urbanization and globalization there. On the other hand, I’m not sure we could’ve significantly reduced our exposure to nCoV by distancing ourselves from China.   In this uber-globalized world, we have to accept that when China sneezes we will all likely catch a cold – literally and economically. The question is, how can we minimize catching such cold? And when we do, how will we recover and jump back on our feet as quickly as possible? – Rappler.com   The author is a PhD candidate and teaching fellow at the UP School of Economics.

Grab completed the transaction [with Uber] legally, and did not violate the interim measures order [of the PCC].” The PCC imposed P16 million ($296,741) worth of penalties on Grab Philippines for failing to maintain operations before it acquired Uber.  The fine was P12 million ($222,586) for Grab and P4 million ($74,195) for Uber for causing \"undue difficulties\" to the review being conducted by the PCC on their merger.  The PCC left it to the two firms how they would settle the penalty.  “During the review of the deal, we worked closely with the PCC and explained the market conditions that affected the interim measures,” Grab’s Aguila said.  The PCC is penalizing Grab for supposedly failing to keep its pre-Uber acquisition prices and quality of service, to keep operations separate with Uber, and to suspend Uber’s assumption of board seat in Grab. Aguila said Grab’s “fare and surge rates remained within the LTFRB-approved range.” He also said the deal giving Uber equity stake and board seat was already consummated before the PCC issued its order outlining interim measures. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and drivers data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” the Grab lawyer said.  PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said the commission has yet to receive a copy of Grab’s motion for reconsideration. “The parties have until October 29 within which to file their MR,” he said. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/philippine-competition-commission-fines-grab-philippines-over-uber-deal","title":"Antitrust watchdog fines Grab P16 million over Uber deal","date":"Oct 17, 2018 11:08 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Philippine Competition Commission slaps Grab with a fine of P12 million and Uber with P4 million for causing 'undue difficulties' to the review of their deal","body":"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the country's antitrust watchdog, imposed P16-million ($296,741) worth of penalties on ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines for failing to maintain operations before it acquired Uber.

In this situation, when Grab purchased Uber, Uber already exited. We would have a more difficult time imposing the possible solution. That's why we said come back first,\" Quimbo added. On April, the PCC released interim measures while they were reviewing the Grab-Uber deal. Quimbo said that the ride-hailing companies violated two measures, for a total of 10 counts. Under the law, PCC can impose penalties of, at most, P2 million ($37,097) per violation, which led to the P16-million total. The PCC left it to both firms on how they will settle the penalty. The order, which was sent to Grab on October 11, can still be appealed. The ride-hailing firm must submit a motion for reconsideration 15 days since receipt.

His stand: \"Kung 'colorum' ka, dapat wala ka sa lansangan (If you're colorum, you shouldn't be on the road),\" Lim said on Tuesday, July 25. According to him, traffic volume in the metro's roads has been the MMDA's problem for the longest time, and keeping thousands of unregistered Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers does not help. \"Last year, 417,000 cars were sold. The projection this year won't be less than 450,000. Let's say 30% of those cars are in Metro Manila. But the capacity of EDSA is not expanding,\" Lim said in a mix of English and Filipino. Of Grab and Uber's 42,000 drivers, the LTFRB estimates only 15,400 have the necessary permits to operate. The number of unregistered drivers ballooned over the past year as the LTFRB imposed a moratorium barring new drivers from getting temporary permits to operate while they wait for their certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Earlier, the LTFRB ordered unregistered drivers off the streets by July 26, but Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration allowing them to operate further.

At any given time, thousands are on the move: heading to the office, going home, running from one meeting to another. All this movement is a burden to a transport system that’s woefully inadequate to deal with the demand. The trains are either bursting at the seams or suffering technical glitches; buses are full to brimming. Private cars with a passenger or two crawl along EDSA, while passengers try to hail taxis sometimes pressured to pay additional tips. In the last couple of years, the Philippines has seen the entry of app-based ride-hailing services that provide passengers with transport options at the touch of a button. Uber and Grab are the best-known names in the industry, providing passengers with their own cars simply by using their smartphones. But critics say these services are exacerbating the traffic problem. They point out that enterprising businessmen buy more vehicles and hire drivers for Uber and Grab, essentially increasing the number of vehicles crowding an already congested road network. Transport officials have underscored their focus in proposing solutions: move more people, not cars. Last year, the Metropolitan Manila Development Agency launched an app to encourage Facebook friends to start carpooling. There have also been suggestions to allot a high-occupancy lane along EDSA exclusively for cars with 3 or more passengers. (READ: Taming Manila traffic: Hits and misses of 2015) Last month, Uber followed suit with the launch of its newest ride-sharing service, uberPOOL. The company said this aims to put more people into fewer cars, coordinating the logistics of a traditional carpool setup using technology. The new service promises a fixed fare that’s estimated to be 25% cheaper than usual UberX fares. In exchange for cheaper fares, passengers have to share the ride with others, and they should expect longer travel time as the vehicle makes several detours to pick up or drop off other riders. As with Uber’s initial launch in Manila two years ago, the concept of uberPOOL carried with it a degree of uncertainty, said Uber Manila’s general manager Laurence Cua. But, he added, Filipinos’ quick adoption to uberPOOL showed that they’re becoming more open to trying out new technology solutions. “I think what we're learning is that people in the Philippines are very tech-savvy, they're very progressive, very open-minded about embracing new concepts. And with technology, something like carpooling becomes safer and more convenient because you don't have to match or pre-plot...With uberPOOL, we knew that we could solve those problems efficiently with a tap of a button,” Cua said. Carpooling with tech But before uberPOOL was launched, another carpooling app had already entered the Philippine market. European carpooling app Wunder launched earlier this year, with the goal of connecting riders with others who have empty seats in their car. Unlike Uber and Grab, trips on Wunder are limited, so that passengers only chip in for the cost of gas as drivers travel to or from their destination. It is not meant to be a profit-making business. The launch of carpooling apps in the Philippines may indicate that Filipinos are not hesitant to take to the ride-sharing concept. (READ: Uberpool in Manila: Adjusting to the metro's unpredictable traffic) “Carpooling in general is not a very new concept, especially for the Philippines. We’re a very communal people, we're very friendly. And we don't mind sharing things, mabait tayo eh…People are just more socially dynamic,” Cua said, noting the positive feedback two weeks since the launch of uberPOOL. But the traditional carpooling setup, where groups of people discuss what time to leave and where to meet up, is a process that’s been made easier by technology. Instead of having to pre-determine carpool trips beforehand, these technology-based apps allow on-demand ride-sharing services. Cutting cars on the road Uber touts its carpool service as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option: riders cut their transportation costs, while helping cut down on greenhouse gases with fewer cars on the road. “If you keep doing that again and again, with thousands and hundreds of thousands of people, then you're now able to make scalable and high-impact changes on how people move around,” he said. But despite this new thrust in the company’s goals, Cua said drivers who want to partner with Uber should not be concerned that the company will also cut down on driver applications. He pointed out that demand for decent transportation in Metro Manila remains high. “As long as there are people who are looking for a ride to get around, then there's gonna be demand for something like Uber. And so that should not be a concern…We do want to see more drivers use Uber, and the main reason for that is there are people looking for their services,” he said. The carpooling service also aims to discourage people from buying more cars, which end up being underutilized in parking lots anyway, Cua added. But what about criticism that Uber is actually encouraging people to buy more cars? Cua pointed out that car ownership has been steadily growing over the last 10 years, buoyed by more purchasing power for consumers and riding on a growing economy. This, Cua said, happened even before Uber entered the Philippine market. When Uber entered the scene, it became an avenue for drivers to make extra income to help pay for the vehicle that they would have bought anyway, Cua said. He also said that the company is hoping to discuss with government the current limitations on the cars allowed on Uber. Currently, only cars that are 3 years old or newer are allowed on Uber, but Cua said they’re eyeing to relax this as long as the vehicle is still in good shape. By doing this, drivers won’t feel compelled to get a new vehicle, he added. “Rather than having it sit in a parking lot or forcing people to buy new cars, let's just use what's out there and put them on UberPOOL, or even just UberX, or both. Now the concept of car-sharing can tap into more underutilized assets,” he said. Complementary government solutions With a new set of officials handling the Metro Manila traffic situation, Cua hopes that ride-sharing can be more widely adopted by Filipinos and readily supported by the new administration. He also said that Internet connectivity should be improved and made more reliable, so that transport solutions that rely on technology would be more efficient. Improving public transportation systems should remain a top priority, he added. In developed countries with efficient public transport, Uber plays a role in addressing the last-mile problem, or ferrying riders from the bus or train station to their final destination. “Here in Manila we know it's already happening on some level, and as infrastructure gets better, Uber can also play a complementary role to help out those people who use those modes of transport,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-postmates-sue-california-over-gig-economy-labor-law","title":"Uber, Postmates sue California over gig-economy labor law","date":"Dec 31, 2019 6:03 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The companies claim that the new law treating gig-economy freelancers as employees is unconstitutional","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA (UPDATED) – Ride-hailing giant Uber and delivery company Postmates have filed a lawsuit against the state of California, claiming a new law that would treat gig-economy freelancers as employees is unconstitutional. The legislation, due to go into effect on Wednesday, January 1, would mean that – under certain conditions – independent contractors are classified as employees and granted the minimum salary and health insurance benefits that entails. This would include drivers for both Uber and Postmates. \"Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to protect their constitutional rights and defend their fundamental liberty to pursue their chosen work as independent service providers and technology companies in the on-demand economy,\" said the lawsuit filed on Monday, December 30. Uber warned earlier this year that it would oppose any change of status for its drivers, which will cost the company extra in social security costs. In the suit, Uber and its co-plaintiffs argue the law targets independent service providers while exempting direct salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers and commercial fishermen. \"There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions,\" it said. In the suit, Uber and its co-plaintiffs argue the law targets independent service providers while exempting direct salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers, and commercial fishermen. \"There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions,\" it said. Uber and its American rival Lyft have each put aside 30 million dollars to organize a referendum, allowed under Californian law, to replace the legislation with a compromise on social rights that has been put before the state Governor.  Drivers are divided between those who want the same security as employees and those who want the flexibility of being able to choose the hours they work.  The gig economy has given drivers \"opportunities to earn money when and where they want, with unprecedented independence and flexibility,\" the lawsuit said. California is one of Uber's key markets, with around nine percent of its sales on ride and delivery platforms made in the state, CNBC said, citing the company's head Dara Khosrowshahi. The new law comes as the ride-hailing company is also facing legal clampdowns on its operations elsewhere. A German court ruled earlier this month that Uber – which relies heavily on the use of vehicles from local car rental companies in the country – must have a rental car licence of its own to operate.  In November, London's transport authority refused to renew the company's operating license because of safety and security concerns. That came as a big blow to Uber, which has about 3.5 million customers and some 50,000 drivers in the British capital. It has said it will appeal the decision. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/where-are-the-new-ride-hailing-companies-philippines","title":"Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?","date":"Oct 6, 2018 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Almost 6 months have passed but the new firms have yet to make a dent in the ride-hailing market","body":"AT A GLANCE  Part 1 of 2 MANILA, Philippines – Users of ride-hailing services were promised new options after Uber exited the Philippines. Almost half a year has passed but the firms have yet to make a difference in the market. When Grab bought Uber's Southeast Asia operations, the country's anti-trust agency, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), warned of a \"virtual monopoly\" of the industry. Grab Philippines offers ride-hailing services for sedans, taxis, 6-seater vehicles, and premium cars. It also introduced ride-sharing in the market. In a bid to \"break the monopoly,\" the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 6 new transport network companies (TNCs) – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto and GoLag in April; and ePickMeUp in June. They were set to challenge Grab's dominance in the ride-hailing industry, as drivers, too, had more choices on companies to link up with. But the companies are faced with problems that keep them from making a difference in the market, ranging from capital investments to recruiting drivers and getting riders. Where are they now? Taxi apps 'are okay' In the case of taxis, the LTFRB recently recalibrated meters to implement the fare hike that would include a P2-per-minute travel charge. The flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer.  The LTFRB also now requires operators to have a mobile application from an accredited TNC. It leaves them to choose from taxi-only firms Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated and MiCab Systems Corporation, or those with mixed services such as Grab or Hype Transport Systems. In separate interviews with Rappler, executives of MiCab and Hirna said that they have been faring well since they were accredited in May. For one, both firms do not charge booking fees, which they think should attract riders as they would only have to pay for the amount on the taxi meter. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Coco Mauricio, Hirna's founder and managing partner, said the LTFRB should review the cap on the franchises given to taxis as public utility vehicles. \"We're doing okay. But it can be better if more taxis would be joining us; if the cap for the taxis are increased,\" said Mauricio. MiCab, for its part, currently has 7,000 registered taxi drivers and operators in some key urban areas such as Metro Manila, Baguio, Cebu, and Iloilo. Hirna has some 6,500 partners operating in Davao City, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Bohol, Bacolod, and Iloilo. But MiCab acknowledged the fierce competition, especially with the taxi services being offered by Grab under GrabTaxi. \"Competition is fierce, especially with global multinational companies and very rich companies in the Philippines. There's Hype, and Grab is a multibillion-dollar company,\" Kris Montebon, MiCab's head of operations, told Rappler. In July, MiCab accused Grab of \"phantom bookings\" on their platform, and of  creating fake accounts to sabotage MiCab operations. MiCab accused the company of  attempting to poach its drivers too. Montebon said that MiCab's key advantage is its particular focus on the taxi industry. In a way, he said, it is \"improving its service quality,\" as there has always been a negative commuter perception of taxis. There are an estimated 42,000 taxi operators nationwide but the figure has never been adjusted for the longest time. When the LTFRB suspended Uber for a month in 2017, it said it was studying a proposal to increase the cap on taxis in Metro Manila. Competing with the giant Other ride-hailing firms competing head-on with Grab for riders and drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) face more challenges. Despite having thousands of drivers registered on their platforms, Hype and Owto are having a hard time keeping their drivers online because of incentive schemes \"not at par with Grab.\" On top of financial constraints, both firms still experience minor glitches on their apps. Hype chief operating officer Jen Silan told Rappler that only 30% of their 10,000 to 15,000 bookings per hour are being served. Hype has 13,000 taxi and TNVS drivers combined. \"Bookings served are still quite low. Honestly, not all the 13,000 drivers are going online so we were not able to serve a big percentage of the total bookings yet. Of course, there is still the perception among the riders that if there are no drivers in your area, then it would be hard to book,\" Silan said. She also noted that competing with Grab is a challenge in terms of capital investments. Hype's commission per ride is set from 5% to 15%. (READ: [OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters) \"It's really a challenge, especially if Grab is giving incentives that are not sustainable for the company (Hype). We're not into that kind of competition. What we are offering to our drivers is permanent commission,\" she said. Owto chief executive officer Joel Gayod said that the company also suffers from lack of drivers, making it unable to cater to its 86,000 booking requests daily.  Gayod complained that the \"playing field is not fair\" due to the \"predatory practices\" of Grab. \"We're facing a lot of challenges mostly because of the predatory practices of Grab. We can come up with an incentive scheme but what they do is practically giving away top-up that we cannot match. This kind of practice will kill us, the new TNCs,\" Gayod said. While Grab takes up to 20% of the driver's earnings, the ride-hailing giant gives a considerable payout through incentives to its TNVS partners, which Hype and Owto cannot match. \"The LTFRB should always protect the new players. There should be some safeguards against these practices. Or else, we will die sooner or later and Grab will remain as a monopoly,\" Gayod said. Some still adjusting Go Laguna (Go Lag) is the sole ride-hailing service offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by  TNVS drivers because of the distance. But it has yet to be fully operational, partly because of backend payment schemes being sorted out by the company, said Go Lag operations director Willie Bercasio. Bercasio told Rappler that there are currently 700 drivers that have signed up with them and there are around 150 on board. But Go Lag has been fielding only 50 rides per day in Laguna to avoid losing money. \"We are still beta testing. If we take on more rides, we would start losing money because we also pay for our infrastructure like the bandwidth system,\" Bercasio explained. He disclosed that they haven't earned from the business yet, as they have not asked for service fees from the drivers so far. Meanwhile, ePickMeUp, the latest addition to the accredited firms, has yet to be launched. It used to be a logistics firm but it decided to venture into the ride-hailing industry. Viable competition The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2018-016 suspending applications for accreditation of new ride-hailing firms effective August 29. The LTFRB said it issued the order so it can focus on pending applications and to monitor existing ones.  This means that there are only 8 apps to choose from, including U-Hop, until the regulatory board accredits a new firm. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo pointed out that it's not so much about the number of apps available for consumers, rather the viability of such firm to enter the market. \"On paper, they are there. But have they made a dent in the market? We know that they haven't, right? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,\" Quimbo told Rappler in an interview. There were some 65,000 active drivers on Grab's and Uber's platforms, merged in a masterlist submitted to the LTFRB earlier this year. When Uber left, Grab mostly answers to the full demand despite the \"undersupply\" of drivers because not all drivers moved to its platform. Grab said that it only has 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day. To maximize the available number of franchises currently open, the LTFRB allowed 10,000 new drivers to apply as TNVS drivers. Quimbo acknowledged that current local players challenging Grab face a difficult task. She said the ride-hailing industry is a two-sided market – both drivers and riders should be satisfied enough to grow. \"[They] need to attract the drivers and the riders. That in itself is a heavy capital requirement. The cash flow requirements are big if it comes to giving out incentives to both sides of the market. That's the challenge,\" she said. Grab has recently pulled in $2 billion worth of investments that brings its total funding to $6 billion – $1 billion of which is from Japanese car giant Toyota. The Financial Times reported the firm is looking at an $11-billion valuation. With funding on the side of Grab, how will the new ride-hailing firms fare in the coming months? – Rappler.com Part 2: Will Indonesia ride-hailing giant Go-Jek enter PH?"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-hr-head-resignation-liane-hornsey-discrimination-probe","title":"Uber’s head of HR resigns reportedly after discrimination probe","date":"Jul 12, 2018 12:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Internal investigations reportedly find that Liane Hornsey, the company's head of human resources, dismissed allegations of racial discrimination","body":" Uber’s head of human resources resigned Tuesday, July 10, US time, reportedly after a probe into how she had handled racial discrimination allegations at the company, marking the latest departure of a high-level executive there. Uber launched an internal investigation after anonymous whistleblowers asserted that Liane Hornsey, the company’s chief people officer, had systematically dismissed allegations of racial discrimination, Reuters first reported. Hornsey and chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi made no mention of the investigation’s finding in emails to staff about the resignation, obtained by The Washington Post. “I know this comes a little out of the blue for some of you, but I have been thinking about this for a while,” Hornsey said. She thanked her colleagues and expressed pride for “our shared ethic of doing what’s right for our employees.”  Khosrowshahi praised Hornsey in a separate email, writing “she’s accomplished a lot” and describing her as “incredibly talented, creative, and hard-working. She’s been a valuable member of my leadership team.” Uber declined to comment on the reason behind Hornsey’s departure, but said in a statement, “We are confident that the investigation was conducted in an unbiased, thorough and credible manner, and that the conclusions of the investigation were addressed appropriately.” Hornsey began at Uber in 2017, weeks before engineer Susan Fowler published her explosive memo about harassment and discrimination at the ride-hailing company. Hornsey joined Uber from SoftBank and had previously worked in human resources at Google. Her tenure was immediately consumed by the fallout from Fowler’s allegations, revamping the ride-hailing giant’s culture and implementing the 47 recommendations made by former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. after an internal investigation. Last October, Hornsey spoke with the Wall Street Journal, saying the company was making progress on most of the recommendations but also describing the difficulty in finding enough diverse candidates in engineering. She said the company had implemented practices such as earlier dinner hours and part-time working, held 200 listening sessions with employees, added women and diversity and inclusion experts to interview panels when hiring engineers, and moved recruiters to seek out diverse candidates.  She also recalled that in her first meeting with Khosrowshahi, his last questions were: “Liane, how are you taking diversity seriously? How does the organization know you’re taking diversity seriously? What are you doing for women, specifically?” But she also noted that it was “bloody hard” to implement the Rooney Rule – a hiring approach, named after a policy for selecting NFL coaches, that some employers use to mandate that one woman or underrepresented minority be interviewed for certain positions – for engineering jobs.  And although Hornsey said she had thanked Fowler publicly, she said, “I don’t know whether there would be any benefit in meeting her.” That sparked several reactions from Fowler on Twitter, who wrote that “she really, really doesn’t like me.” When Uber finally published its diversity numbers for the first time in March 2017, well after many other tech companies had done the same, Hornsey wrote that “it’s no secret that we’re late to release these numbers,” thanking employees for pushing for the transparency. At the time, it said, 8.8% of employees were black, 5.6% were Hispanic, 30.9% were Asian and 4.3% were multiracial. In 2018, each of those figures stayed the same or ticked up slightly except the percentage of black workers, which dropped to 8.1 percent. Hornsey’s resignation follows several high-profile exits at Uber. The executive charged with repairing the company’s brand, Bozoma Saint John, left the company last month after serving for only one year. She was brought on after a tumultuous year of scandals at Uber, which eventually led to the ouster of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick. The company’s head of finance and top lawyer were among the officials who resigned last year. – © 2018.

A total of 15 films – out of 73 submissions – made it to the final round. The films Ang Biyahe ni Marlon, Tago, and Gawilan were chosen as the top 3 winners.   Florence Rosini's Ang Biyahe ni Marlon was named Best Film. It features the story of Marlon Fuentes, an Uber driver who has Tourette Syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. Fuentes' story first went viral on social media after one of his passengers, Mimi Velasquez, saw the sign he put up inside the vehicle, saying, \"I have Tourette Syndrome. I hope you understand my condition.\" Velasquez posted a photo of the sign on Facebook, where her post has gained more than 37,000 reactions and over 13,000 shares as of Thursday morning, June 14. The Uber driver said he created the sign after noticing several of his passengers were uncomfortable during their trip because of his condition.  Robredo later invited Fuentes to tell his story through the Vice President's \"BISErbisyong Leni\" radio show on February 11. Rosini, who is currently taking up her master's degree in media studies, major in film at the University of the Philippines Diliman, took home a P50,000 cash prize, a DSLR camera, and a Samsung S8 phone for her winning piece.   Coming in as first runner-up was the film Tago by professional makeup artist and instructor Margaret Serranilla. The short film tells the story of Nelson Gonzales, who owns the rundown Tago Jazz Café in Cubao. In the film, Gonzales shares how the jazz café serves as a place for budding musicians to hone their craft. Several of these musicians have since gained international fame after performing at the humble Tago. Serranilla got a cash prize of P30,000.   Completing the roster of winners is Kelsy Lua's Gawilan, which features the story of swimmer Ernie Gawilan. Despite having no legs and no left arm, Gawilan kept on swimming, his hard work earning him a spot to represent the Philippines at the 2016 Summer Paralympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Lua, a film and television postgraduate student at the University of Southern California, won P20,000 for her film's second-place finish.

Even if the deal falls below the threshold of the PCC's mergers and acquisitions review, the commission started to look into the potential effects of the transaction, expressing concern that it would lead to \"a virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market.\" Gonzales said Grab will fully cooperate in the watchdog's motu proprio review.

The antitrust watchdog said it will evaluate and analyze if after the acquisition, prices will likely increase; ride-sharing services will deteriorate; passengers will effectively have less options; and how likely new transport network companies (TNCs) will be able to fairly compete against the merged firm. Should anti-competitive concerns arise, the PCC said Grab and Uber may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or prevent negative effects on market competition. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/competition-commission-singapore-grab-uber-deal-flout-rules","title":"Singapore says Uber-Grab deal may flout competition rules","date":"Mar 30, 2018 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) says both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market","body":"SINGAPORE – The sale of Uber's Southeast Asian business to Singapore-based rival Grab may have infringed competition rules, a Singapore watchdog said Friday, imposing restrictions on the deal while it carries out an investigation. The sale announced on Monday, March 26, ended a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marked the US firm's latest retreat from international markets. But the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market – the first time such a directive has been issued in the city-state. Under rules which take effect immediately, the companies will not be allowed to integrate their operations until the CCS investigation is finished. They will have to maintain separate pricing and cannot obtain confidential information from each other like costing or customer and driver details. This is likely to prove a major stumbling block for the deal, under which Singapore-based Grab is set to take over Uber's ride-sharing and food delivery operations in the region. In return Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business, with chief executive of the California-headquartered company Dara Khosrowshahi joining the Grab board. Singapore has a voluntary merger notification regime and the Commission said it has not received submissions from Uber and Grab as of Friday. Both companies have indicated they intend to file a formal merger notification, the CCS said.

According to Grab, they will only begin to expel undocumented drivers once they have a technical working group meeting, where commuters are invited to air out their concerns. (READ: LTFRB tells Grab, Uber: 'We will not succumb to pressure') \"We urge the LTFRB to convene the technical working group as soon as possible so we can discuss important matters affecting the TNC-TNVS industry, more so the riding public,\" Grab said. However, Grab said they are already taking steps to follow LTFRB as they have not allowed new drivers who do not have permits from the LTFRB to operate. Uber, for its part, continues to let new drivers without permits to operate, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lozada. The number of these undocumented drivers grew dramatically over the last year because of an earlier LTFRB order which had barred new drivers from applying for provisional authority (PA) permits. These PA permits allow TNVS drivers to operate for 45-135 days, and precede the longer certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise which lasts from 1-7 years. With the LTFRB preventing the inflow of new drivers needed by TNCs to replace those who leave, Uber and Grab continued to accept and allow new drivers even without permits from the LTFRB. They also allowed drivers who had expired permits to continue to operate. This prompted the LTFRB to fine Uber and Grab P5 million each for negligence, and set the deadline for the removal of undocumented drivers. With their defiance of the LTFRB, Grab and Uber put themselves in hot water as their accreditation as a TNC is still under review by the regulatory board. But with overwhelming public support, they are confident they will pull through.  \"The enforcement has been ongoing since last year in all cities where we operate. Be that as it may, Grab stands by the side of its partner-drivers who represent the safest most reliable transport service providers in the country,\" Grab added. - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/calon-rider-uberjek-tes-bau-ketiak","title":"Calon sopir UberJEK harus lolos tes bau badan","date":"Nov 12, 2015 3:19 PM PHT","snippet":"'Bagi yang punya masalah bau ketiak, maaf, tidak bisa jadi rider uberJEK,' begitu tulisan di situs ojek online terbaru","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Bisnis ojek online sedang berkembang di Jakarta.

The London-listed aerospace giant, which is based in Derby in central England, showed off the plans at the Farnborough Airshow for the first time, as other players also rush into the market segment. Rolls said it hoped to manufacture a prototype version of its electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle within the next 18 months, and could potentially take to the skies in the early 2020s. The Rolls-Royce EVTOL plane will seat four or five people, with a flying range of 500 miles (805 kilometers) and a top speed of 200 miles per hour. \"In this market, you will see something like this flying within three to five years, and we will demonstrate the system in two years,\" said Rob Watson, head of Rolls-Royce's electrical team. \"At the end of next year we will be flight ready,\" he told AFP at the group's Farnborough chalet. The hybrid vehicle, which has so far cost single-digit millions of pounds to develop, will use a traditional gas turbine engine with an electrical system wrapped around it. Rolls-Royce is also researching an all-electric product but that is not as advanced as the EVTOL offering. \"There is an emerging market for all-electric planes but we believe that you need a level of requirement that an all electric system cannot really provide today,\" Watson told AFP. Hybrid propulsion  \"So, all-electric is the way to hop around within a city, but if you want to travel 200 or 300 miles, if you want to run London to Paris, then you are going to want to run something that will give you that range. \"So we think you will see hybrid propulsion systems starting to make this market.\" Rolls is not alone in the hybrid \"flying taxi\" marketplace. Other companies researching the sector include US taxi-hailing company Uber, the Google-backed Kitty Hawk project, Lilium Aviation in Germany, Safran in France, and Honeywell in the United States. The aerospace sector's push into electric propulsion has drawn comparisons with the automotive industry, where electric cars are gaining ground in terms of popularity and performance. \"Think of it like the car industry. Historically everybody had an internal combustion engine. over time you add more electric capability to it and then you start to see electric cars,\" added Watson.  \"In the same way, we are introducing a hybrid propulsion system into this market because we think it gives you that range and capability.\" Potential disruptor David Stewart, aviation and aerospace adviser and partner at Oliver Wyman, told AFP that the aerospace sector was facing pressure to become more environmentally friendly. \"I think that electrical propulsion is a potential disruptor to the way things are powered,\" said Stewart, who will speak at Farnborough on Tuesday. \"We are quite a long way for electrical power to be a replacement for kerosene, but never say never.\" He cautioned that Rolls-Royce's flying taxi concept was in reality a development platform to test the new technology. The real market opportunity will likely be a scaled up version of 10-15 seats that can serve a wider variety of applications, according to Stewart. Watson added: \"Over time you've got more electrical capability for bigger and bigger aircraft – and that's really what we are thinking about today. \"We are learning today about the technology that we will need tomorrow.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/kenzo-hm-manila-launch","title":"Walk on the wild side: H&amp;M debuts KENZO collection in PH","date":"Oct 28, 2016 9:37 AM PHT","snippet":"The highly anticipated collaboration drops in H&M stores worldwide on November 3.

The summit entitled \"Innovation and Big Ideas: Pushing boundaries” was held on Tuesday, November 17, a day ahead of the center piece meeting to be attended by APEC economy leaders. Promoting MSMEs has been a central feature of the country’s APEC hosting this year, which revolved around the theme of inclusive and sustainable growth. These small businesses, which make up  99.7% of APEC economies, have been identified by the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) as key to tapping into inclusive growth. “Unlocking the remarkable potential of entrepreneurs needs robust innovation ecosystems. MSMEs are oftentimes better poised to understand new customer expectations and create transformational business models through innovation,” said ABAC 2015 chairperson Doris Magsaysay-Ho, 2015. Here are some of the ideas discussed at the summit. Asia as innovation hub “Between 2010 and 2025, 440 cities around the world will generate half of global gross domestic product (GDP) growth, “ said Asia Society CEO and founder Josette Sheeran. Many of these cities are those that most people have not heard of – such as Surat in India, Porto Alegre in Brazil, and Boshan in China, she added. Another interesting fact she shared was that in 2014, research firm AT Kearney did a study on the next global center of innovation in the world and which found that Jakarta in Indonesia came in first, while Manila was second. What this means, she explained, is that opportunity is coming in ways that one could not have felt or predicted in the past. “Manila now has ability to change the way the world does business through dealing with its own problems,” she said, and “the world is paying attention.” Sharing economy, creating opportunities “The sharing economy is not a problem to be managed but an opportunity to be seized to see what we can build with it,“ said David Plouffe, Uber senior adviser and board member.  It is not only because platforms now allow individuals to profit from them by being an Uber driver or renting an apartment out on Airbnb. These platforms are also fundamentally reorganizing economies. Services like Uber give people power to create their own income and create their own schedules. Right now, it is mostly for temporary periods but eventually it will reshape the way people think of work, transport, and other things, Plouffe said Because of the emergence of these new sharing platforms, governments will have to find a way to make more regulations more dynamic. Plouffle shared that upon entering office, US President Barack Obama ordered a regulatory review of US government agencies, the first initiated in decades, to illustrate the fact that government tends to lag behind innovation. Caring: An economic imperative “In the US alone, $280 billion (P13.2 trillion) is spent on child care. It's often the most expensive item for dual income households in the United States, more than college, mortgages, and transportation,\" said Sheila Marcelo. Marcelo is the founder of Care.com, a website that helps families find care for children, the elderly, or the sick. Care is often seen as a “soft issue,” she explained, but it has a fundamental importance in society that will create far reaching benefits. “Studies show that a country’s GDP would increase with equal female participation in the workplace. In the US alone by 9%, 13% in the EU, and a full 16% in Japan,\" she said. Staying at home to care for children, seen in most parts of the world as traditionally a women’s role, is the biggest limitation to women’s participation in the workplace, she added. “Women now are increasingly opting out. Deciding not to get married and have children. In Taiwan, the rate is now 1 out of 3 women, in Japan 1 out 5,” Marcelo pointed out. It affects supply because they are the primary source of caregivers, she said, adding that the solution is that care services must scale and transcend borders as there is a global demand for it. People are the biggest assets “To all SMEs out here, don’t let anyone tell you you can’t do anything. Business is business,” said AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes, who said that he started the budget airline with zero experience in the aviation industry. For him, the core concepts of branding and people is a far more valuable commodity. AirAsia has no worker unions partly because of the general contentment of its staff, which he took pains to create, he said. He went to the extent of doing the airline’s lowest level jobs temporarily to get to know the work and workers. This was crucial in fostering a flat organizational structure, he said, which allows for effective decision-making as employees are not intimidated. Fernandes captured the entrepreneurial spirit of the summit with a summary of his primary role as being one \"to turn rough diamonds into polished ones.\" – Rappler.com $1 = P47.17"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/thinkph-2017-digital-data","title":"#ThinkPH 2017: Humanizing stories through digital and big data","date":"Jul 16, 2017 3:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Speakers from Uber, We Are Social, Nestle, and Dentsu Aegis Network showed us how in the age of digital and big data, being human remains the best strategy","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Big data. Blockchains. Innovation. Digital. These are just some of the common buzzwords we hear in the world of technology today. But beyond harnessing technological breakthroughs, the single most effective way to tell stories remains simple and timeless: just be human. At #ThinkPH 2017 at the SMX Convention Center on Saturday, July 15, Laurence Cua, General Manager at Uber Philippines, Simon Kemp, Founder, Kepios, and Global Consultant at We Are Social, Paolo Mercado, Senior VP for Marketing, Communication, and Innovation at Nestle Philippines, and Donald Lim, CEO, Dentsu Aegis Network Philippines, talked about how data can be used not only to improve businesses but more importantly, to understand and serve consumers better.  Shaping cities by providing options After disrupting the transportation industry with its ride-sharing app, Uber has adapted to the needs of its consumers by providing more options like Uber Pool and Uber Hop. Uber's service base continues to evolve because they want to look beyond profits and metrics, said Cua. With carpooling, fares become more affordable, and the number of cars on the road is reduced, cutting down carbon dioxide emissions. “Uber’s mission all over the world is to move cities. But we realized that in order to move cities, we need to move individual lives,” said Cua. “Uber is more than just a platform that connects riders and drivers. Uber has become a tech that changes lives.”  With this in mind, Uber has become more than an app. And with people looking for smarter solutions to reach their destinations, for Cua and Uber Philippines, there is no turning back. Don’t panic, participate “Connected tech is now an integral part of everyday life for most people in the world. But our increasing reliance on connected tech is starting to change the way our brains work,” said Kemp. This, however, shouldn’t be a cause for panic but instead an opportunity to participate. With more than half the world already online, one million users connected everyday, and in the Philippines alone, 50,000 new users per day, being a tech-savvy brand or business is the way to go. Consumers are changing the way they remember things, such as Googling something instead of racking their brains to think. So they also need to rethink user experience, Kemp said. In the advent of voice control devices like Siri and Alexa, and what’s now known as “decisionless shopping,\" even the pronunciation of a brand name is crucial to its success.   By changing the way we tell stories, and by constantly evolving with consumers and the way they experience things, we don’t have to be afraid of being left behind. Marketing to the connected consumer When Greenpeace launched a campaign against KitKat in 2010, Nestle was caught off guard. The brand’s social media pages were attacked. And their social media managers, not really sure what to do, fought back, making the situation much, much worse. This scandal that started on social media and was then taken by the activists to the streets, in front of one of Nestle’s global offices, prompted the brand to launch a Digital Acceleration Program. Nestle brought some of its people to Switzerland to undergo an 8-month training in digital. “We realized we don’t know how to manage social media,” said Mercado.  They learned about digital but they also learned more about the people who care about their products by mapping out the consumer journey and personalizing the engagement. Now, Nestle brands are all over social media, topping the Youtube ads leaderboards, and the minds of its consumers.        Tell stories the human way In advertising, many brands and agencies get excited by digital and tech that sometimes they forget they’re supposed to tell stories. “If you want to do digital, you have to look at the entire media landscape,” said Lim. This means considering the value of TV, radio, outdoor, and print – the whole ecosystem –whenever you’re creating a campaign “for digital.\" According to Lim, people who buy in sari-sari stores learn about brands through noon time TV shows like Eat Bulaga. And these are the real people your brand should be talking to. Lim also reminds us that websites and apps are just platforms and that we should look beyond them. We should focus on capturing the human experience so brands become more relatable and approachable. “Digital only rarely succeeds. Make digital a part of the human system,\" he concluded. The day-long digital summit featured speakers who tackled the connection between humanity, culture, and technology, and how we can harness innovation and creativity for progress.

Uber touts its new service as its contribution to the Philippine capital region’s horrendous traffic jams, as more passengers sharing vehicles means cutting the number of cars on the road, according to Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua. Two weeks since it began rolling out to Manila’s riders, Cua said the response so far has been generally positive, even generating interesting stories from passengers who unexpectedly enjoyed the experience of meeting new people through carpooling. “They find the experience to be somewhat fun…People have been sharing stories where they are matched with another passenger who is fun to talk to. There's even one story where a passenger rode with a former high school classmate, and they got to reconnect,” Cua said. Any apprehensions about Filipinos not taking to the concept of sharing rides with strangers was eased out by the response to the new service, he added. “What's happened in the last two weeks is we've seen people are very comfortable with that, and the great thing there is the adoption has actually exceeded our expectations. We expect this to keep growing. We do think a lot of people are seeing the value of being able to share a car and save money,” he said. “I think, more importantly, people are getting behind the idea of helping save Metro Manila from more traffic. So it's a nice social benefit. I think that people feel that they're also helping in their own little way, they're trying to get more cars off the road,\" he added. Longer travel time But it’s not all smooth sailing for Uber's riders and drivers. While passengers get cheaper fares, the tradeoff is longer traveling time, as they wait for the driver to pick up new carpooling passengers or take longer detours to drop off co-passengers. (READ: UberPOOL in PH: How Uber's carpool feature works) In theory, the formula strives to be efficient: Rider A books a ride, Rider B is picked up along the way, and along the route Rider C joins the carpool, while the first two passengers get dropped off at their destinations. The idea is to create a continuous stream of passengers being picked up and dropped off – so that more people get to move around the metro using only one vehicle. The problem, however, is that while the system matches riders coming from the same geographical location and headed the same way, the travel time builds up significantly because of Manila’s paralyzing traffic jams. For instance, an uberPOOL ride from Pasay City to Pasig City during the evening rush hour took over 2 hours, with a detour to Bonifacio Global City to drop off a co-passenger. The ride cost P50 less than usual, but added significant minutes in travel time due to the heavy traffic buildup in the area. Several riders have also expressed the same sentiment, posting messages on Uber’s Facebook page about their riding experience. Several commented that the service would be more suitable for those who aren’t in a hurry or those who don’t mind adding half an hour or more to their trips. Others were lucky: they requested an uberPOOL ride, but didn’t get matched with other passengers. They managed to book their own private vehicle, while still being charged the cheaper fare. Some Uber drivers also took to social media to complain about the system. One Vincent Bravo said on Facebook that Uber drivers are earning less on uberPOOL because of the hours they spend on the road stuck in traffic or making additional detours. Cua said that the uberPOOL model aims to have drivers earning the same amount they would have earned driving an UberX car, or even more. “That’s the model we’re going after. That’s the part where we are tweaking the system,” he said. Improving the system While Cua acknowledged that the company has received such complaints, he added that these were a “small minority.” “We're very sensitive to feedback, we are continuously reviewing the data that we're getting and tweaking the system in small and big ways to make sure it works even better moving forward,” he said. He added that part of their solution is to provide more information and educate the drivers on how the system works. Amid some social media sentiments that users would skip uberPOOL because of the longer travel time, Cua said that the soft launch stage allows the company to gather more data and comments to improve the system. “In order for uberPOOL to really work, we need a lot of users…As more people use it, it's easier from a technical standpoint and for Uber as a platform in technology to match these people,” he said. Adapting the carpooling system to Metro Manila's particular traffic situation has a “level of complexity that is very hard to describe,” Cua admitted, but added that traffic is among the many variables they are considering in tweaking the system and improve user experience. “Our traffic situation is slightly more unpredictable, and that does create sometimes a less than optimal experience, which is what we're focused on, making it better,” he said. “Our traffic is the worst in the world, and how do you adjust around that is something that requires a bit more local attention. When there are changes in the road blocking system or when new routes are rerouted, we should be aware of these things and react accordingly,” he added. The challenge for Uber is to get riders to keep trying out the carpooling service and help make the system matching process better – but at the same time, to get those tweaks rolling out as soon as possible to ensure that riders won’t be too frustrated that they’ll skip out on choosing to carpool altogether. “Yes, you are getting a discount in exchange for getting a car off the road and at the same time a short detour, but we want to make sure that it's not too inconvenient, otherwise we know you will not use it again,” Cua said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/metro-manila-traffic-southeast-asia-study-bcg-uber","title":"Metro Manila has 3rd worst traffic in Southeast Asia – study","date":"Nov 30, 2017 8:30 PM PHT","snippet":"A study by the Boston Consulting Group shows Metro Manila motorists and commuters get stuck in traffic for an average of 66 minutes daily","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Metro Manila commuters and motorists alike spend more than an hour, on average, in traffic every day, placing the Philippines' capital region the 3rd worst in traffic in Southeast Asia. This was among the findings of a recent survey conducted as part of a study called \"Unlocking Cities,\" done by global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The study, commissioned by ride-sharing platform Uber, looks at the impact of ridesharing in Southeast Asia. The accompanying survey was done from September to October, covering around 300 respondents from Southeast Asian cities. The survey places Metro Manila 3rd worst in the region, with an average of 66 minutes stuck in traffic daily. It comes after Bangkok, Thailand, which is said to have the worst traffic (72 minutes), and 2nd worst Jakarta, Indonesia (68 minutes). The best performers in terms of traffic are Singapore (30 minutes) and Hong Kong (35 minutes). In Metro Manila, on top of the 66-minute traffic experience, drivers also spend an average of 24 minutes per day searching for parking. Traffic woes as economy improves The BCG survey results also indicated that traffic may worsen, as 84% of Metro Manila respondents said they plan to buy a car in the next 5 years. At the same time, however, 37% of Metro Manila respondents said they would be \"highly willing\" to forgo purchasing a vehicle if ridesharing can meet their transport requirements. As expected, travel time more than doubles during rush hour in the morning and in the evening, according to Metro Manila respondents.  'Silver lining' A silver lining, according to the study, is that a portion of potential new vehicles could be used on ride-sharing platforms such as Grab and Uber which would, in theory, lessen the number of overall vehicles on the road at the same time.  The effect would be especially pronounced if half of those cars are used for carpool services, where users would choose to share a ride with others in exchange for a lower fare. Both Grab and Uber offer this. Assuming 50% of rides are carpool services, BCG estimates that ridesharing could potentially reduce a million private vehicles from Philippine roads. Regulatory woes, infra buildup The potential effects of ridesharing, however, assume the presence of optimal conditions which has been far from the case in the Philippines. Uber itself was recently suspended for a month in the country and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The US–based firm may face even more problems ahead as it confirmed that details of Filipino users were exposed in a data breach that has affected 57 million users worldwide. The LFTRB also recently ordered the closure of popular motorbike-hailing platform Angkas over questions of legality. Multilateral agencies have put forward the improvement of public infrastructure as a long-term solution to traffic congestion. The study echoes this, pointing out that Manila, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh have all announced plans to invest more than $60 billion in rail infrastructure by 2022. But according to the study, the \"added capacity of rail transport alone will not be sufficient to meet growth in transport demand by 2022.\" It continued: \"We estimate that ridesharing adoption between 16% and 40% across these cities is needed in conjunction with public transport to maintain congestion levels today.\" The Philippine government is trying to address the poor infrastructure situation with its Build, Build, Build campaign, which seeks to raise public spending on infrastructure from 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 7.4% by 2022. The clock is ticking, however, with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimating that traffic congestion would cost the country P6 billion per day by 2030 if problems are not fixed. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/ltfrb-uphold-ban-colorum-grab-uber-july-26","title":"LTFRB to impose apprehension order vs 'colorum' Grab, Uber drivers July 26","date":"Jul 19, 2017 2:18 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says the ban on accepting new drivers will remain in place as well, as it awaits the companies' updated lists of drivers","body":"MANILA, Philippines—The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend \"colorum\" Grab and Uber drivers once its order against them takes effect on July 26, a board member announced on Wednesday, July 19. \"On the part of LTFRB, the order becomes executory 15 days after its publication.

Lizada was referring to the LTFRB's July 11 order that it would begin apprehending colorum Grab and Uber drivers starting July 26. This comes after the transport network companies allowed their undocumented drivers to operate until the regulatory board called for a meeting, in hopes it would lead to a compromise. According to Lizada, the ban on accepting new drivers will remain in place as well, as the LTFRB awaited the companies updated lists of drivers. Lizada recalled that Grab and Uber said they need 15,000 drivers each to serve the public. From this, the LTFRB will determine how many drivers are already on the road, and then decide how many permits to give out. The numbers get murky as both the TNCs admitted to Lizada that there were 14,000 \"dual citizens\" – drivers that partner with both companies, thus submitting two applications.  The LTFRB expects to get the new list of drivers by July 26, when they will have their next technical working group meeting, before deciding on when to accept new applicants. Until then, only around 15,000 for both Grab and Uber combined, can operate. Drivers who will get caught with expired permits or no permits at all can be fined P120,000 and detained for 3 months.  Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/indonesia-wrap-polemik-taksi-demo-uber-grab-online","title":"Indonesia wRap: Polemik taksi vs transportasi online","date":"Mar 23, 2016 8:50 AM PHT","snippet":"Ledakan di bandara Brussels membunuh belasan orang","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia —Demo sopir taksi menolak angkutan umum berbasis online berujung ricuh meskipun Presiden Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo meminta agar para demonstran bertindak tertib. Terlihat segerombol sopir taksi melakukan aksi kekerasan, bukan hanya terhadap pengemudi Grab dan Uber yang mereka protes, tapi bahkan kepada sesama pengemudi taksi Blue Bird dan Express.Video dan foto-foto kericuhan tersebut dapat dilihat di sini.Blue Bird akan beri layanan taksi gratis 24 jam besokPresiden Direktur Blue Bird Noni Purnomo mengatakan akan memberikan layanan taksi gratis pada esok hari sebagai kompensasi unjuk rasa sopir taksi hari ini.\"Blue Bird akan memberikan layanan taksi gratis selama 24 jam.

Kali ini, diharapkan pemerintah dapat memberikan solusi yang memuaskan.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Kisruh antara pengemudi angkutan umum dengan penyedia jasa transportasi online masih belum mencapai titik temu. Setelah berunjuk rasa sepekan lalu, para operator yang tergabung dalam Persatuan Pengemudi Angkutan Darat (PPAD) akan mengulang aksi mereka pada Selasa, 22 Maret. “Masih sama dengan yang kemarin. Kawan-kawan PPAD merasa tak puas dengan hasil kemarin,” kata Ketua Organda DKI Jakarta Shafruhan Sinungan saat dihubungi Rappler pada Senin, 21 Maret 2016. Sesuai dengan surat bernomor 02/PPAD-II/2016 yang dilayangkan ke Polda Metro Jaya, PPAD masih menuntut pemerintah untuk membekukan penyedia jasa transportasi online seperti Grab Car dan Uber. Menurut mereka, keberadaan angkutan ini menyalahi Undang-undang (UU) Lalu Lintas Nomor 2 Tahun 2009 tentang Angkutan Umum dan Jalan Raya. Di situ tertulis, kendaraan yang berfungsi sebagai angkutan umum harus berpelat kuning. Sementara kendaraan yang digunakan oleh Uber dan Grab Car berpelat hitam, atau kendaraan untuk penggunaan pribadi. Keadilan bagi seluruh penyedia jasa transportasi Shafruhan memuji keputusan pemerintah yang akhirnya memberikan badan hukum bagi Grab Car dan Uber, yakni koperasi. Namun, hal tersebut masih belum cukup. Masih ada sejumlah masalah lain yang harus diselesaikan. Selain masalah pelat, ada pula standar penetapan tarif dan izin pengelolaan. Shafruhan menilai Uber dan Grab telah menginjak-injak pemerintah dan UU dengan cara menetapkan tarif yang semena-mena. “Dia harus memperoleh izin pengelolaan angkutan umum dari pemerintah, seperti perusahaan taksi ataupun mobil rental. Kan semuanya sudah diatur, termasuk tariff juga dari pemerintah,” kata dia. Selain itu, mobil-mobil yang beroperasi di bawah naungan Uber dan Grab juga harus sudah melalui uji kir. “Kalau mereka (Uber dan Grab) seenaknya sendiri seperti ini, kan artinya sama dengan telah menampar pemerintah. UU kan yang buat pemerintah juga, kok dilanggar,” kata Shafruhan. Ia berharap unjuk rasa besok merupakan yang terakhir, dan pemerintah bisa segera mengambil keputusan yang adil bagi kedua belah pihak.  Menurut dia, para supir sudah mengikhlaskan waktu kerja dan penghasilan mereka dalam sehari untuk menuntut keadilan. \"Kalau belum tuntas juga, kami belum tahu akan mengambil langkah apa lagi,\" kata dia. Pastikan unjuk rasa damai dan bebas penyusup Shafruhan mengimbau agar unjuk rasa kali ini tetap berjalan dengan damai tanpa ada tindak kekerasan. Besok, ia memperkirakan ada 20 ribu orang yang akan mengikuti unjuk rasa dari seluruh pelosok Jakarta. “Sudah saya ingatkan agar menggunakan atribut penanda. Tujuannya menghindari provokasi dari penyusup,” kata dia. Atribut dapat berupa seragam, atau penanda kain hitam di lengan kiri seperti sebelumnya. Unjuk rasa pada pekan lalu memang menelan korban satu unit kendaraan Grab Car, yang dihancurkan salah satu kelompok demonstran. Namun, Shafruhan mengatakan belum tentu pelakunya anggota PPAD. “Bisa saja ada penyusup yang mau provokasi. Pokoknya sudah saya imbau supaya jangan terbawa emosi,” kata dia. Aksi besok masih akan memakai rute yang sama dengan sebelumnya. Dari pelbagai titik di Jakarta, massa akan bergerak menuju dua titik, yakni gedung Dewan Perwakilan Rayat dan Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika. Demonstrasi sendiri akan berlangsung mulai pukul 9 pagi hingga pukul 17.30. Untuk itu, armada Go-Jek, Grab Bike, Car, Taxi, dan Uber diimbau untuk tak melewati area tersebut. -Rappler.com BACA JUGA:                            "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/chris-taylor-grab-philippines-transport-team-head","title":"Ex-Uber U.S. exec now leads Grab transport team","date":"Jan 30, 2019 8:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Former country head Brian Cu is now Grab Philippines president, overseeing other services aside from transport","body":"MANILA, Philippines – A former Uber US executive is now the head of transport for ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines.

Lawyer Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), told senators that this practice is no different from Uber and Grab's surge pricing, or the increase in fares based on demand during peak hours. \"[Grab and Uber] are trying to incentivize drivers para kapag traffic, may high demand, pupunta ang auto sa pasahero. Because if they don't do it, hindi susunduin ng mga sasakyan nila 'yung mga pasahero,\" Suntay said during a Senate public services committee hearing on Thursday. (Grab and Uber are trying to incentivize drivers so that during heavy traffic and there's high demand, they would agree to pick up passengers. Because if they don't do it, the drivers won't pick up the passengers.) Suntay explained that some taxi drivers ask for additional payment due to insufficient income or losses incurred in traveling to far or congested areas. \"May taxi driver na magsasabi, 'Puwede ba padagdag ng P50 sa metro?' Dahil alam 'nyo ho, pagka ang pasahero magpapahatid sa lugar na matraffic, malulugi 'yung driver,\" he said. (There's a taxi driver who will say: \"Can you add P50 to the metered fare?\" Because you know, if a passenger wants to be brought to a congested area, the driver would incur losses.) \"If a taxi driver gets stuck in traffic for an hour, the meter would only earn him P75 because our waiting time is P3.50 for every two minutes. A driver who pays a boundary of P1,200 [a day] would need P60 an hour just to make the boundary. This is the reason why taxi drivers ay tumatanggi na maghatid (decline to get passengers),\" he added. Suntay also said he is not \"justifying\" the act, which has exasperated commuters and prompted them to switch to transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab. \"I'm not justifying it. I'm just saying the real reason why it's done,\" he said. Suntay added that the lack of income leads to the negative behavior of drivers. \"As with any normal person, income has a direct connection to individual behavior and action. Kapag walang pera, mas bugnutin ka, mas mabilis kang mainis. Kapag maliit ang kita mo, naghahanap ka ng paraan to augment it (If you don't have money, you're more irritable, you're easily annoyed. If you have limited income, you find ways to augment it),\" he said.

Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Aileen Lizada seconded Orbos' recommendation. Lizada told PUV operators that the public's support for Grab and Uber should be taken as a \"wake-up call,\" especially because jeepneys, buses, and taxis serve the majority of the riding public. Taxi driver-operators, said Lizada, should know how to navigate, keep their cars presentable at all times, and agree to take passengers to wherever their destination is. \"'Yung mga gano'n dapat sabihan 'nyo rin 'yung ibang taxi drivers na 'pag ginawa nila 'yun (mistakes), apektado ang buong taxi denomination,\" she added.

In a case led by two former Uber drivers, a London employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements that also included paid holidays and rest breaks. Uber drivers are currently treated as self-employed, meaning that by law they are only afforded minimal protections, a status the Silicon Valley-based company sought to maintain a long-running legal tussle. \"The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Uber's appeal,\" judge George Leggatt said on Friday. \"The legislation is intended to give certain protections to vulnerable individuals who have little or no say over their pay and working conditions.\" A total of 25 drivers were part of the case and Uber said the verdict did not apply to all of its current 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London, one of its most important global markets. \"We respect the Court's decision which focused on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016,\" said its Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood. \"We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.\" Uber shares fell 3.4% in premarket trading following the court announcement. Gig economy workers The gig economy, where people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis, has faced criticism from trade unions who say it is exploitative, while businesses say many of those working in it enjoy the flexibility. It could still take several months for the details of Friday's decision to be worked at a further employment tribunal hearing to sort through practicalities over sums owed to drivers, according to lawyers. Law firm Leigh Day says eligible drivers may be entitled to an average of 12,000 pounds ($16,780) in compensation. It represents more than 2,000 potential claimants. Uber has faced opposition from unions and challenges to its business model in several countries as it disrupts the taxi market. In November, however, it saw off a challenge in its home market of California where voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees. One of the two former Uber drivers who led the British case, James Farrar, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government to do more to reform the gig economy. \"I am delighted that workers at last have some remedy because of this ruling, but the government must urgently strengthen the law so that gig workers may also have access to sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal.\" – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/twitter-accounts-apple-musk-gates-hit-major-hack-july-15-2020","title":"Twitter hit by major hack targeting high-profile users","date":"Jul 16, 2020 8:38 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Posts trying to dupe people into sending hackers Bitcoin are tweeted by the official accounts of Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many others on July 15","body":"Twitter is investigating a massive hack in which high-profile users from Elon Musk to Joe Biden had their accounts hijacked by scammers who the social network believes targeted its employees to gain access to internal systems.

A total of 12.58 bitcoin -- worth almost $116,000 -- were sent to the email addresses mentioned in the fraudulent tweets, according to the site Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions. \"Tough day for us at Twitter,\" chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a tweet. \"We all feel terrible this happened. We're diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.\" The Biden campaign told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Twitter locked down the hacked account quickly and removed the bogus tweet. US President Donald Trump's account, which has more than 83 million followers, was not among those hacked. \"Most accounts should be able to Tweet again,\" the Twitter support team said in an evening update, having earlier briefly disabled posts from verified accounts with an official blue checkmark. The network said it had locked down the affected accounts, which also included Bitcoin speciality firms, and removed the tweets posted by the hackers. Twitter added that the network was largely back to normal, but that it \"may take further actions and will update you if we do.\" Media outlet Vice reported that a Twitter insider was responsible, citing leaked screenshots and two anonymous sources apparently behind the hack, one of whom told Vice they had paid the employee. Rachel Tobac of cyber-security firm SocialProof Security also theorized that hackers had got control of a Twitter employee's administrative access to post the messages. Meanwhile reports said that BitTorrent chief executive Justin Sun was offering a $1 million reward for bringing the Twitter hackers to justice. The tweet that appeared on Tesla founder Musk's Twitter feed said, \"Happy Wednesday! I am giving back Bitcoin to all of my followers. I am doubling all payments sent to the Bitcoin address below.

Since then, the charges against Golunov have been dropped, and in January five Moscow police officers were charged with fabrication of evidence and drug trafficking. According to Russian news website Baza.io, one of these officers, Igor Lyakhovets, said that he had obtained the reporter’s address by requesting his travel history from Yandex.Taxi, Russia’s most popular rideshare app. Yandex.Taxi has publicly confirmed that it received and complied with this request. It was a minor detail in Lyakhovets’ account of the Golunov investigation, but one that has shed light on the ability of Russian security services to carry out detailed surveillance of anyone who uses everyday online services, such as taxi apps. It also raised questions about the security of user data in the many countries outside Russia in which Yandex.Taxi operates. Concerns have risen over whether Yandex.Taxi went far beyond its obligations in giving the Moscow police Golunov’s user data. On March 2, the Russian digital rights group Roskomsvoboda published a report noting that Yandex.Taxi is not listed on the public registry of “information dissemination organizers.” Such organizations are required to grant Russian authorities access to all user data under the controversial “Yarovaya law,” a package of new measures and amendments to existing statutes focused on public safety and counterterrorism enacted in July 2016. But Yandex.Taxi argues that it was compelled to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies, citing a different law – known as the “operative-search activities” law, which regulates police investigations – which applies to any organization, regardless of whether it is on the registry or not. But according to Kirill Koroteev of the legal advocacy organization Agora, this law stipulates that requests for private data are not binding in the absence of a court order. No such court order appears to have been given, but Yandex.Taxi spokeswoman Natalia Zhuravlova told Coda via email that while “certain types of enquiries – for example, requests to reveal text of private correspondence between people – do require a corresponding court decision,” requests for ride histories do not. Golunov raised a further question concerning the legitimacy of the request Yandex.Taxi received from law enforcement. According to Golunov, it was not made via the correct channels, but rather was sent in an email, from an address at the domain Mail.ru – a popular Russian email server. Golunov told Coda Story that he saw evidence of this during the court proceedings. This detail has not yet been made public, as the trial is ongoing. Yandex.Taxi, however, denies that the request was made via email. In a Facebook post, the company’s spokesman Vladimir Isaev said that he personally saw the signed paper that was submitted to the company’s lawyers. In a text message, Golunov explained why the question of whether the request was made via email is significant.  “I don’t like the situation with Yandex.Taxi – that information about my movement is available to any person who can write a letter to Yandex.Taxi and sign as a police officer,” he wrote. “I think that this kind of information should only be shared by the company if there’s a court order.” Whether or not Yandex.Taxi gave up more information than they legally had to, this case shows the extent to which the Russian authorities expect unfettered access to private companies’ information, and do not see the need to give any reason for their requests. “I think it is also highly important to mention that usually, enquiries by the authorities don’t contain any details of cases or names of people in question,” wrote Zhuravlova. “They also don’t mention whether the person in question is under suspicion or whether they are a victim of a crime. As an example, they might contain just a phone number or an internet ID.” International repercussions According to its website, Yandex.Taxi operates in 17 countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and West Africa. In Georgia, where it is one of the two most popular rideshare apps, the news of the company’s involvement in Golunov’s case was met with alarm. Speaking to Georgian television reporters, parliamentarian Irakli Abesadze called for an investigation of Yandex.Taxi by state security services, in order to determine whether the app also shares Georgian users’ data with Russian authorities. Privacy concerns related to Russian access to Yandex.Taxi’s international user data long predate this week’s reports, and are not confined to Georgia. In 2018, the Lithuanian defense ministry’s National Cyber Security Centre published an investigation that found that the Yandex.Taxi app in Lithuania regularly sent encrypted communications to Russian IP addresses. Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis publicly urged Lithuanians not to download the app, owing to concerns that it stored excessive user data with inadequate security. Asked whether Yandex.Taxi would have handed over user data to the Russian authorities had their request concerned the travel history of a passenger outside Russia, Zhuravlova responded: “The responsibility for rides-related data is carried by the legal entity, which operates the service in a particular country. For example, Russian Yandex.Taxi LLC will handle the enquiries about rides in Russia, provided the enquiries are made according to established legal procedure. Enquiries about rides in Georgia will be handled by the Netherlands-based Yandex.Taxi B.V., while enquiries about rides in Ghana will be handled by MLU Africa B.V. and so on.” Yandex's partnership with Uber In 2018, Yandex and Uber merged their rideshare operations in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Russia into a single entity. Named MLU B.V., it is jointly owned by the two companies and officially based in the Netherlands. Today, if you open the Uber app on your phone in one of these countries, you are redirected to Yandex.Taxi, or another service operated by Yandex. In Russia, a separate Uber Russia app is available, with Yandex listed as the developer. In the U.S., according to Uber’s privacy policy, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena must be submitted by law enforcement before the company shares its user data. Uber has also published transparency reports detailing the number and frequency of these requests. However, an Uber spokeswoman told Coda Story via email that Uber and Yandex.Taxi “operate separately with different products, infrastructures and policies.” Uber declined to comment on Yandex.Taxi’s involvement in the Golunov case. Asked whether Yandex.Taxi could provide similar records of law enforcement requests to those Uber has made public, Zhuravlova responded, “We haven’t so far but are thinking about how to increase transparency on that going forward.” – Rappler.com   Additional reporting by Katerina Fomina and Mariam Kiparoidze.

Now Facebook is launching it’s own cryptocurrency, in association with Visa, MasterCard, Uber and others. The stated aim of Libra is to “enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people”. The announcement has sparked fears that Libra could be a threat to traditional banks, warnings to be cautious, and skeptical commentary of claims that it will help developing countries. But let’s go back to the basics and look at what Libra is, how it compares to other cryptocurrencies and whether you should be concerned about using it when it eventually arrives. What is a cryptocurrency? Currency is a system of money that is commonly used in exchange for goods and services and, as a result, holds value. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are secured using cryptography. The more popular recent cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology which uses a cryptographic structure that is difficult to change. One of the key properties of this structure is a distributed ledger that keeps account of financial transactions, which anyone can access. What is Libra? Libra is a new currency that is being proposed by Facebook. It’s considered a cryptocurrency because cryptography will be used to help protect the value of the currency from tampering – such as double spending – and to protect the payment process. Libra has the potential to become successful because of the backing from the Libra Association, which is made up of large international corporations such as Facebook, Uber and Vodafone. MasterCard and Visa have also thrown their hats in the ring, but no traditional banks are on the list. What’s different about Libra compared with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite egalitarian in nature. That’s because there is no single authority that verifies transactions between parties, so anyone could potentially do it. To authorize a Bitcoin transaction you would have to prove that you have done the work, known as a “proof of work”. For Bitcoin, the proof of work is to solve a mathematical puzzle. People who successfully solve the puzzle (proving they have done some work), can add transactions to the blockchain distributed ledger and are rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as mining. The good thing about this is that it reduces fraud. Since anyone can potentially mine Bitcoins, it’s harder to collude as you wouldn’t know who the next person to mine a coin would be. And it’s simple to verify that the person is authorized because anyone can check that the puzzle has been solved correctly. Based on the initial descriptions of the currency, it sounds like the difference with Libra is that it will verify transactions using a consensus system known as “proof of stake”, or a variation of this method. Under this system, transactions would be authorized by a group of people who have a stake or ownership in the currency. This makes it easier to predict who the next person to authorize a transaction might be (since there are a relatively small number of authorizing group members), and then collude to launder funds without other group members knowing. It appears the criteria to become a founding member of the Libra Association is to contribute a minimum of US$10 million entrance fee, have a large amount of money in the bank and be able to influence a large number of people. What are banks and regulators worried about? Cryptocurrencies affect governments and tax systems since they have little to no transaction costs when money is transferred across borders. So while the low transaction costs would be good for everyday users, the advent of a new cryptocurrency with a potentially very large user base has governments and traditional banks very concerned. While Libra is open source – meaning the source code is available for all to view, use and modify – it’s the members of the association who will be overseeing the currency. Libra could herald a shift away from traditional government taxes and banking fees to a new international monetary system controlled by corporate entities like Facebook and Uber. That’s a concern because of the lack of oversight from regulatory bodies. What should everyday people expect from Libra? The backing of software giants means it’s likely that the user interface for Libra coins would be smooth and simple to use. Low transaction costs would benefit users and the Libra Association promises to control the value of the currency so that it does not fluctuate as much as other cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear how they plan to do this. But value stability would be a great advantage in times of uncertainty. What are the risks? The everyday consumer probably wouldn’t know the difference between the “proof of work” and the “proof of stake” mechanisms. But since Facebook has a large database of users that are known to use Libra, it may be able to link Libra transactions to individuals. This could be a privacy concern. (Bitcoin transactions are anonymous because account numbers used in Bitcoin transactions are not linked to an individual’s identity.) Recent cybersecurity breaches have contributed to a growing awareness of the vulnerabilities of IT systems. As with all software, the Libra implementation and management could be vulnerable to attack, which in turn could mean users could lose their money. But that is a risk that all cryptocurrency users face, whether they are aware of it or not. What steps could consumers take to protect themselves? No matter what cryptocurrency you choose to use, your funds are still accessible through the same interfaces: a web page or a mobile app. And the way you control access to your personal funds is by authenticating with a password. Make sure you keep your password safe by making sure it is complicated and hard to guess. Look for applications that allow you to use two-factor authentication and make sure it’s turned on. Libra is yet to prove its claims of making financial transactions safe and convenient. Only time will tell if its uptake will become widespread following its expected launch next year. – Rappler.com This article originally appeared in The Conversation.

The service, launched last July, also uses the app-based booking system model of TNCs like Uber and Grab.

If convicted on the charges, Anthony Levandowski faces up to 10 years in prison and a penalty of $250,000 per violation, according to federal prosecutors who announced the criminal indictment. \"All of us have the right to change jobs, none of us has the right to fill our pockets on the way out the door,\" US Attorney David Anderson said in a release announcing 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. \"Theft is not innovation.\" Levandowski, 39, was a founding member of the group that worked on Waymo, a Google self-driving car project that is now a unit at parent company Alphabet. Levandowski worked on the project from 2009 and was leader of the light-detecting and ranging (LiDAR) team when he resigned from Google without notice in January of 2016, according to the indictment. The former star engineer left Google for his own startup called Otto, which was later acquired by Uber.  The theft allegations came out in a civil case in which Waymo accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. That case ended with a settlement between the two firms last year. Levandowski was fired by Uber in 2017 as the 2 firms were preparing to go to court on the civil trial. Waymo had alleged that Uber conspired with Levandowski, who according to Tuesday's indictment downloaded files that included circuit board schematics, instructions for installing and testing LiDAR, and an internal tracking document. A source familiar with the confidential deal said Uber agreed to a financial settlement giving the Alphabet unit a small stake in Uber. The indictment shows both the civil and criminal cases were about LiDAR, a laser-based system which is critical to enabling autonomous cars to get a three-dimensional picture of its surroundings. The documents states that Levandowski downloaded thousands of files before leaving Google including \"critical engineering information\" about the hardware and instructions for calibrating and tuning Google's custom LiDAR. Before the civil trial was cut short by the settlement, jurors saw evidence which was embarrassing for Uber, including a text message in which former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick told Levandowski to \"burn the village.\" After the settlement, the newly named Uber CEO said that \"we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber.\" Tesla, Waymo, Uber as well as major car companies and other technology firms are rivals in what is expected to be a large market for autonomous vehicles, whether for personal use or in commercial operations such as robo-taxis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/senate-hearing-ltfrb-grab-uber-taxi-passenger-bill-of-rights","title":"LIVE: Senate hearing on LTFRB issues vs Grab, Uber and Taxi Passenger Bill of Rights","date":"Aug 4, 2017 8:48 AM PHT","snippet":"Watch the hearing live on Rappler on Thursday, August 3","body":"Bookmark this page to watch the Senate hearing live on Thursday, August 3 MANILA, Philippines – The Senate public services committee will hold a hearing on the issues hounding ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber, as well as the proposed Taxi Passenger Bill of Rights, on Thursday, August 3.

Didi is locked in a war of attrition with Uber over drivers and riders but claims almost 90% of the market in the world's most populous nation, with about 300 million registered passengers and more than 14 million rides a day. The funds \"will be used for technology upgrading, big data research and operations, investments in improving rider/driver experience, as well as explorations into new business lines and opportunities,\" the statement said. Following the closing of this round, Didi stands as one of the world’s best-funded Internet companies with approximately $10.5 billion in disposable funds. The latest financing deals value the firm at close to $28 billion, Bloomberg News reported. The huge fundraising includes $4.5 billion in equity investment from backers such as Apple – which forked out $1 billion last month – and Chinese backers like China Life, the country's biggest life insurer. Apple's injection was the \"single largest investment the company has ever received,\" Didi said when the deal was announced.

Her phone pinged. \"I've already cried twice,\" she said, heading out to work as one of Saudi Arabia's first female drivers for Careem. The Dubai-based ride-hailing app, along with global behemoth Uber, reacted to Saudi King Salman's September announcement of an end to the kingdom's ban on female motorists by saying it would hire women in the conservative kingdom. On Sunday, when the king's decree took effect, nearly a dozen Careem \"captainahs\" -- all Saudi women – were ready to pick up riders. \"This morning, when I got in the car, I felt the tears coming,\" Reem said as she stocked her car with chilled water bottles for her riders.  \"I pulled the car over and cried. I could not believe that we now drive... It's a dream. I thought it would be totally normal, I'd just get in the car and go. I was surprised by my own reaction.\" She took a long pause.  \"I didn't expect it,\" she said. \"I'm doing this because I can. Because someone has to start.\" 'It's you' Seventy percent of Careem's customers in Saudi Arabia are women, according to company statistics, a figure largely attributable to the kingdom's now-obsolete ban on women driving.  Uber puts its equivalent figure closer to 80%.  At Careem's offices on Sunday, staff gathered to celebrate the women's first day on the job. Farahat's first ride request came just hours after the ban was officially lifted. \"This is my first ride. I'm excited. I'm excited to know who I'm picking up, what their reaction is going to be,\" she said. The driver – who also works with her father as a quality control consultant, is training in life coaching, and scuba dives with her sister off the Red Sea city of Jeddah – picked up Leila Ashry from a local cafe. Walking towards the car, Leila spotted Reem, did a little jump of joy on the sidewalk, and was already chatting as she opened the door. \"Oh my god I can't believe it's you. I can't believe you're here. I can't believe I'm here,\" Leila said. \"I've been tweeting to my friends that my ride is coming and it's a woman! And you're so pretty! And I can sit in the front now – wait, can I actually sit in the front next to you?\" 'We automatically understand'  Some 2,000 women have signed up to get their Careem licenses since September, said Abdulla Elyas, co-founder and CPO – \"chief people officer\" – of the ride-hailing app. They are all Saudi women, from their 20s to their 50s.  Uber also plans to introduce women drivers to their service this autumn. \"They come from completely different backgrounds,\" Elyas told AFP. \"We have women who have degrees, a master's degree. We have women who have no degree at all. We have women who want to do this full time. We have women who want to do this part time (for) an additional income, who are already working.\" Most of those who had been licensed by Sunday, like Reem, had permits from foreign countries, enabling them to skip driving courses and take the final exam for a Saudi license. The \"captainahs\" can pick up any customer, man or woman. Both the driver and rider have the right to end the ride at any point.   Leila, a young medical student with a pixie cut and bright smile, says she would still choose a woman. \"This automatically feels a lot safer... being a female and dealing with sexism on a day-to-day basis. There's just something about it that feels wonderful. But it's not only that. It's also women joining the workforce,\" she said. Sitting in the front passenger seat, she recalled previous rides with male drivers.  \"Before, sometimes they would stare at me from the mirror,\" she said. \"It's just like that thing we share with women, where we just automatically understand what it's like to be in that position where you feel their eyes on you but you can't say anything, you can't do anything against it.\" She turned to chat to Reem, and sang a riff from a West Side Story tune before saying: \"If you can do it, then I can do it.\" \"See?

This is easy for me and the fact that I get paid, even better.\"  It was actually NBA 2K that led Browne to trying out his luck as an Uber driver. Before, he was a security manager at the Mercy College in New York working an overnight shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. But when he found out the NBA 2K League would be be launched, he knew he had to find another job just so he can play with his friends in the evening. And  as it turned out, signing up as an Uber driver turned out to be the best option.  After Uber helped tide him over, Browne now relishes his new job as a professional gamer.  \"Sometimes I would sleep in my car. I would do anything I need to do just to scrape up some more time to make extra money,\" shared Browne. \"So the fact that I don't have to do any of those things anymore and I get to do what I love, I'm just blessed.\"  \"Now, I sleep like a baby.\" (READ: Can Filipinos make it to the NBA? The 2K League just might be the route) 'Yeah I Compete' There is a reason Browne is the league's 3rd overall pick among the 102 draftees.  During the Draft Combine wherein 72,000 hopefuls battled against each other, Browne won 80 percent of his games and he posted averages of 24.2 points, 13.7 assists and 3.5 steals.  His moniker \"Yeah I Compete\" says it all. Also, growing up watching the early-2000s Los Angeles Lakers led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal helped shape his oozing competitiveness.  \"I always considered myself one of the top guys every single year NBA 2K came out,\" he said. Although Browne, who has been playing the game since 2007, has joined the big league for NBA 2K competitors, he said he still plays the game at home \"every single day trying to perfect my craft.\"  \"Playing the game doesn't feel like work.\"  'Sky is the limit' The NBA 2K League, which is based on the best-selling video game that has sold more than 60 million copies since its launch in 1999, is the first eSports league set up by a major professional US sports organization.  It follows the NBA's format with a regular season and playoffs and its draft was presided by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, just like how NBA rookies are drafted.  Seventeen of the 30 NBA teams have their own squads in the inaugural season of the NBA 2K League and Browne sees the \"league will be highly successful in no time.\" \"I think the sky is the limit with this league. I think that the league has been very successful thus far, you have a lot of entertaining games and there's only 17 NBA teams right now,\" said Browne.  \"I honestly believe that within 3 to 4 years, like every NBA team will have an NBA 2K League team.

Namun, pemerintah secara resmi baru memberlakukan pelarangan ini pada Kamis, 17 Desember, ini. \"Apapun namanya, pengoperasian sejenis, Go-Jek, Go-Box, GrabBike, GrabCar, Blu-Jek, Lady-Jek, dilarang,\" kata Direktur Jenderal Perhubungan Darat Kementerian Perhubungan Djoko Sasono, Kamis.  Sontak, pelarangan ini menimbulkan amarah masyarakat utamanya di ibu kota yang selama ini telah bergantung pada moda transportasi seperti Go-Jek, GrabBike, dan Uber. Seorang netizen bernama F. Frico membuat petisi yang ditujukan pada Jonan agar meninjau ulang larangan pemerintah terhadap layanan ojek dan taksi berbasis online. “Layanan transportasi berbasis daring (online) sangat dibutuhkan saat ini, selain praktis juga dapat membantu mengurangi kemacetan yang sudah semakin tidak terkendali,” tulis Frico dalam petisinya di Change.org. Jika kamu merasa sependapat dan ingin mendukung petisi ini, kamu bisa klik di sini. Menurut Frico, jika alasan pelarangan ojek dan taksi online adalah karena tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai operator angkutan umum, seharusnya ojek tradisional juga dilarang. “Sejak dahulu mereka sudah tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai angkutan umum,” tambahnya. Selain melalui petisi, penolakan juga terjadi di media sosial. Bahkan mantan Wakil Presiden Indonesia Boediono juga ikut mengemukakan kekecewaannya atas keputusan Menteri Perhubungan. Sementara Presiden Joko “Jokowi” Widodo juga mempertanyakan keputusan Jonan dan berjanji akan memanggil menterinya tersebut. Tagar #SaveGojek pun sempat menjadi trending topic Twitter pada Jumat, 18 Desember, yang juga diikuti dengan #SaveGrabBike dan #SaveUber. Seorang pegawai swasta, Gloria Kezia, yang sering menggunakan fasilitas taksi online, mengatakan bahwa keputusan ini tidak masuk akal. “Yang benar saja dong, pemerintah. Kenapa sih memangnya? Itu kan sangat membantu masyarakat yang enggak punya uang buat naik taksi, sedangkan yang lebih murah fasilitasnya tidak memadai. Mau nyaman harus mahal, ada alternatif kenapa malah dilarang?” ujar Gloria kesal. Sedangkan menurut seorang pengguna setia ojek online, Dara Alia, pelarangan tersebut hanya sekadar gertakan biasa. “Alah, paling itu ‘gertak sambal’ saja. Kalau tidak ada aturannya, ya dibuatkan, bukan dilarang. Bukannya justru itu tugas dari kementerian?” kata karyawan sebuah perusahaan swasta di Jakarta tersebut.—Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/grab-monopoly-effects-filipinos","title":"[OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters","date":"Mar 29, 2018 1:34 PM PHT","snippet":"With Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

The company raised $2.3 billion from its IPO, ending the its first day of trading with a market valuation of $22.2 billion, CNBC reported.  Lyft has become the first ride-hailing company to be publicly traded, which Recode reporter Theodore Schleifer said is an advantage for Lyft, gaining attention and attract early investors. “If you’re an institutional investor who is eager — after years of watching two meteoric privately held startups amass value — to get exposure to U.S. ride-hailing, there will be a few months during which you will have one option and one option only: Lyft,” Schleifer wrote. Lyft, as opposed to world-spanning Uber, is only available in US and Canada, and doesn’t have other services besides ride-hailing. Lyft likely won't be the last tech company to IPO this year though. There's Uber of course, accommodation-sharing service Airbnb, visual discovery engine Pinterest, cloud-based video conference platform Zoom and a couple of other tech “unicorns” valued at more than $1 billion set go public in what reports have described as a big year for tech IPOs. We’re taking a look at what this could mean for each company below. Uber While Lyft is only estimated to be worth $20 to $25 billion when it goes public, Uber is estimated at $120 billion. Uber in February reported an $842 million loss in the fourth quarter of last year, which is 88% higher than that of the year earlier. These losses reportedly stem from the company’s push to dominate the ride-hailing space by attracting both riders and drivers with more incentives. Despite this, investment bankers still believe it would be one of the biggest-ever public offerings from the tech sector. It’s expected to be worth as much as $120 billion when it becomes publicly traded sometime in the first quarter, as sources claim. This begs the question: Why would investors want to buy stocks of an unprofitable company? According to The New York Times, tech companies are rarely profitable before they become public. This is mostly because they have to increase their spendings in research and development of new products and innovations to grow even bigger in the future.  Investors are willing to buy and help a company with a “path to profitability” now so that it can make money later, as Recode points out. By becoming a publicly traded company, Uber can quickly get the money it needs for its growth. This growth is said to come in the form of AI-powered self-driving cars and electric scooters. “They are moving from a business model innovation company to a product innovation one through autonomous vehicles and AI,” Matt Pencek, the director of consulting firm MorganFranklin told Vox. “It’s hard for a company to switch their business model, and so going public will provide liquidity.” While it’s too early to tell what consumers can expect from Uber’s IPO, it’s highly likely that we’ll hear and see more of their self-driving cars in the near future, especially since Uber recently resumed its testing program for these cars. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is also likely continue to pour money into the expansion of the company’s food delivery service Uber Eats in more territories as the company plans to deliver $10 billion worth of food worldwide this year. Airbnb After years of toying with the idea of whether to go public or not, Airbnb is finally ready to hit Wall Street this year. The company might reportedly be valued at $31 billion when it becomes traded. Though, unlike the two aforementioned companies, Airbnb is in no rush to get money as travel industry news site Skift, who cites Rented.com CEO Andrew McConnell, claims that the company currently has an estimated $3 billion in cash. This is likely true as Airbnb has in the last few years acquired numerous companies to expand its offerings. The most recent of which is HotelTonight, a mobile app that lets users book their stays last minute. The company has already rapidly grown since it launched in 2008, but it’s expected to grow even further when it goes public. Skift adds that the company is set to offer more experiences to its users as CEO Brian Chesky in numerous occasions teased. These could include Airbnb Lux, a luxury division of the service and the rumored Airbnb Flights, a part of the service that books flights. What’s certain for consumers is that more options for booking will be available to them as the company continues to acquire partners and continue expansion. Pinterest Pinterest last week announced that it has filed its S-1 – one of the main documents for going public – for its IPO expected on April, as reported by TechCrunch. Currently valued at an estimated $12 billion, the online image search would be listed in the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker PINS. The company posted revenues of $755.9 million in 2018, up 60% from 2017’s $472.8 million, but is still not profitable, according to Chris Neiger from The Motley Fool as it’s expenses for web hosting services, app costs, and salaries among others increased from $178.6 million in 2017 to $241.5 million last year. Though, the increase in revenue helped Pinterest narrow its losses from $130 million in 2017 to $63 million in 2018. The company’s monthly active users also saw some growth having hit 265 million in the fourth quarter of last year. While its user numbers are still far from Facebook’s 2.3 billion, Pinterest cites a research from Cowen and Company that claims more people use the platform to find or shop products than on other social networks.  Pinterest would likely use this data and the money it raises in its public offering to attract more advertisers to its platform. Slack Unlike most other companies on this list, workplace communication service Slack chose to go with a direct public offering (DPO), instead of an IPO. This is a process by which the company eliminates the need to hire underwriters – institutions that provide insurance to financial risks involved in trading – in favor of letting the people who own shares sell them directly to the public, as explained by Fortune. The Motley Fool, who cited The Wall Street Journal, points out that Slack has the cash it needs, which means it does not need to raise capital through an IPO. Besides this, it could save Slack some money to cut out the IPO middleman as well as avoid a lock-up period. The company could go public sometime within the first half of this year with a potential valuation of $7 billion. Postmates US-based delivery service Postmates filed confidentially for their IPO earlier in the year, joining Uber and Lyft as ride-hailing companies to debut in the stock market in 2019.  Business Insider reports that the company’s most recent venture capital funding round last January gave it a valuation of $1.85 billion. The company’s other financial figures, however, are not known. Postmates reportedly comes in at fourth with regards to its 10% market share, falling behind Grubhub at first with over 50%, UberEats at second with 21%, and DoorDash at third with 15%. Despite this, the company is said to have shown amazing growth in the past few years, now covering around 400 cities in the US. The company in early 2018 also partnered with automaker Ford to experiment with self-driving vehicles in the on-demand delivery space. Capital from an IPO could help Postmates continue to work with this tech and possibly use it to power their service in the future. Zoom Rounding out the list is cloud-based video conference software Zoom, who made their S-1 public last week. The company is said to be considered profitable as it has already made $7.5 million in profits from its $330.5 million total revenue for the fiscal year that ended in January 31. In their filing, they attributed this success to their video conference platform simply working as it should.  According to Quartz, there are often software and hardware incompatibilities when it comes to video conferencing that make it hard for users to use these types of platforms. Zoom, however, is different as it was built as a video conference platform from the very beginning instead of just being added to traditional conference calls. The company also said that their cloud infrastructure makes the process more seamless. Zoom will trade under the ticker ZM and hopes to raise $100 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/peraturan-menteri-perhubungan-taksi-online-2","title":"3 aturan baru pemerintah yang harus dipatuhi UBER, GrabCar, dan Go-Car","date":"Apr 26, 2016 12:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan bagi taksi online mulai diterapkan, tapi aturan-aturan baru sepertinya akan berat untuk dilakukan","body":"Tanda khusus berupa stiker Dalam Pasal 18 PerMen tersebut disebutkan bahwa setiap transportasi berbasis aplikasi diperbolehkan untuk menggunakan plat hitam, namun harus mempunyai kode khusus di plat tersebut.  Di pasal yang sama juga disebutkan kalau setiap kendaraan tersebut haruslah mempunyai tanda khusus berupa stiker, dan memasang nomor telepon pengaduan di dalam kendaraan.  STNK atas nama perusahaan Masih di Pasal 18, Jonan mewajibkan Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan (STNK) dari setiap kendaraan yang tergabung dengan UBER, GrabCar, dan GO-CAR haruslah tercatat atas nama perusahaan, bukan atas nama perseorangan.  Hal ini kemungkinan akan memicu kontroversi karena banyak kendaraan yang digunakan oleh aplikasi-aplikasi tersebut merupakan milik pribadi.
