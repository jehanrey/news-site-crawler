Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon noted the increasing number of sellers of non-approved drugs in online platforms like Instagram and Facebook and e-commerce sites including Lazada and Shopee. “While I am pleased that our officials are pro-actively looking for viable solutions to help Covid-19 patients overcome the disease, I am alarmed over the proliferation of online sellers marketing and offering medicines not approved as a cure for COVID-19,” he said. “Online platforms are the usual marketplace for these types of businesses where they escape liability.” Biazon called on the Department of Trade and Industry to tighten the monitoring of e-commerce sites selling restricted medicines. He said the intense focus on Ivermectin as a potential anti-Covid medication has “inadvertently diverted” the attention on other drugs being repurposed as Covid-19 medicine, the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen. He also expressed alarm over the confiscation of some PHP9 million worth of smuggled Chinese medicines, including Lianhua, in February. “These smugglers are realizing that there is a viable market for the drug here in the Philippines. Had the Bureau of Customs not seized these contraband medicines, they would have probably ended up in the grey or black market,” he said. He said Ivermectin for human use was recently allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be produced only by one pharmaceutical company after it applied for registration, while Lianhua Qingwen is a prescription drug that should only be sold as such from drugstores and other authorized outlets. In an earlier House health committee briefing, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Linhua has been delisted by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) as a dangerous substance, but a regular doctor’s prescription was still required for purchase. According to the FDA, Lianhua is registered in the Philippines as a traditional Chinese medicine for respiratory illnesses and not as a Covid-19 medication. The drug, however, is an approved Covid-19 treatment for mild and moderate cases in China. While the FDA approved Lianhua Qingwen, the agency warned against the purchase of unregistered versions of the Lianhua Qingwen Jiaonang capsule, which had different labels aside from the prescribed English version.

Under IPOPHL's Memorandum Circular (MC) 2020-049, or the \"Revised Rules of Procedure on Administrative Enforcement Intellectual (IP) Rights,\" the electronic, digital, or online channels have been expressly included as part of the IEO's scope in exercising its enforcement functions.  “The exercise of IPOPHL's enforcement powers shall cover manufacturing, production, importation, exportation, distribution, trading, displaying, broadcasting, streaming and offering for sale, including other preparatory steps necessary to carry out the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods or contents to the public, including electronic, digital or online means provided that there is no pending case before any office, tribunal, quasi-judicial body, or court involving the same issue/s or subject matter,” the MC read.  The new rules also expanded IEO’s actions in response to an administrative complaint from a right holder regarding counterfeiting and piracy.  An enforcement order is served to, but not limited to, carry out the following actions:  Request removal of counterfeit goods or pirated goods or content, including advertisements in relation to such goods or content, or the blocking of access thereto, in coordination with the appropriate agency, body, or intermediary service provide;  Give cease-and-desist order;  Order the removal of counterfeit and pirated goods or content from physical establishments; and  Endorse and refer to other government offices the cancellation of permits and licenses, such as business permits.  Moreover, the expanded rules drastically shortened the standard period given to offenders for compliance with IEO decisions —now in 72 hours from the previous 60 days— ensuring faster corrective actions.  The IEO can now also conduct motu proprio monitoring in both online and physical marketplaces.  “Motu proprio monitoring allows the IEO to take on a more proactive approach and help brand owners screen markets of IP violating listings, with  prospects of reporting possible infringements to concerned IP right holders for their validation and appropriate action,” IPOPHL Director General Rowel Barba said in a statement.  Drawn up in response to heightened counterfeiting and piracy concerns online, the revised rules took effect a few days after Lazada and Shopee signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with various brand owners and business associations to build stronger industry-wide coordination.  With the MoU, the online marketplaces also adopted a swift, efficient and harmonized mechanism to take down counterfeit products and pirated works sold or distributed within their platforms.  “The new rules of the IEO and the MoU share common goals in weeding out IP rights infringers and safeguarding the public, whether they be brand owners or consumers. We believe with these new powers, IEO can better intercept counterfeiting and piracy, especially in the online space, and reduce the economic loss and reputational damage IP right holders, and consequently the Philippine government, suffer from infringements,” IEO officer-in-charge Director Ann Edillon said.  However, legislative amendments remain “immensely needed” for enforcement actions to keep up with the fast pace of piracy today, Deputy Director General for Enforcement Teodoro Pascua said.  “With the IP Code amendments we are requesting in Congress, we will have greater say in shutting IP infringing sites. Once a take-down order is served, the National Telecommunications Commission will automatically and immediately enforce it, without further evaluation as their systems can trust the expertise and competence of IPOPHL,” Pascua said.  To recall, piracy reports and complaints surged to a record-high of 121 in 2020, the year the Covid-19 lockdown compelled a massive shift to online transactions.  The 2020 figure also exceeded the total annual reports and complaints received in the four years from 2016 to 2019, strongly indicating an unprecedented trend of online counterfeiting and piracy that needs to be urgently addressed.  The interagency National Committee on IP Rights, which IPOPHL steers as vice-chair and acting chair, is also consolidating its value of seizures in 2020, which are initially appearing to be relatively high in comparison to previous years despite the limited operations due to the quarantine.  The report is expected to be released by IPOPHL within the first semester of the year.

IPOPHL signed the agreement with Lazada and Shopee on Monday to build a stronger industry-wide coordination mechanism against rising online counterfeiting and piracy.  Brand owners such as Unilever Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Philippines, Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc., Castrol Ltd., and Solar Pictures, Inc., as well as business groups Philippine Retailers Association and American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines also signed the MOU.  “Before, we used to experience delays especially on complaints on counterfeits and piracy. But with this MOU, we hope that there will be easier coordination and faster action on the part of platform owners to act on complaints of counterfeiting, not only coming from brand owners but especially from the IPOPHL and DTI (Department of Trade and Industry),” IPOPHL director general Rowel Barba said in an online press conference following the ceremonial MOU signing.  Barba added the agreement provides a self-policing measure that will help in cleaning up the marketplace from bogus products online.  Under the MOU, industry players agreed to use the notice and takedown (NTD) system, wherein rights owners can use the NTD procedures to remove contents on the e-commerce sites that have copyright infringement and other intellectual property violations.  It also drafted a feedback mechanism between e-commerce platforms and rights owners.  “With harmonized procedures and deeper ties with platforms, intellectual property rights holders are better able to notify e-commerce and request for swift actions necessary to prevent counterfeiters and copyright pirates from making a sale,” Barba added.  He said with the massive shift to e-commerce last year due to the pandemic, IPOPHL received the highest number of reports and complaints on intellectual property rights violations done online.  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Office received some 121 reports and complaints last year, apart from over 20,000 complaints at DTI-Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau, he said.  Barba said this initiative also aims to keep the Philippines out of the piracy watchlist that will give confidence to investors to bring in their brands and technology to the Philippines without the fear of their intellectual property rights being violated.  The MOU is an outcome of IPOPHL’s collaboration with the British Embassy in Manila under the UK Prosperity Fund Asean Economic Reform Programme.  In the same event, British Ambassador Daniel Pruce highlighted the need to protect intellectual property rights.  “Intellectual property protection is critical -- it’s critical to encourage innovation,” Pruce said. “So we need to build confidence in online transactions by creating a safe and reliable digital ecosystem which is beneficial for all online players in the marketplace.” (PNA)  "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1131640","title":"Private partners step up efforts to help gov’t end hunger by 2030","date":" February 23, 2021, 7:08 pm","snippet":"MANILA – Various private companies have promised to proactively support the government efforts as they stepped up endeavors to help address involuntary hunger and malnutrition in the country.","body":"MANILA – Various private companies have promised to proactively support the government efforts as they stepped up endeavors to help address involuntary hunger and malnutrition in the country. This commitment was made as the government, through the Task Force Zero Hunger and alongside its partners in the private sector and other non-profit organizations, launched the \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" (PKG), a multi-sectoral anti-hunger initiative, which aimed at addressing involuntary hunger and food security in the Philippines on Monday. Margot Torres, private sector lead for the PKG movement, said the private sector has responded to the government's call for joint initiatives to end malnutrition and hunger being experienced by some Filipinos in different parts of the country. Torres said the private sector has translated the \"key responsibility areas\" of the National Food Policy into frameworks that can serve as a \"springboard\" for synergized initiatives and communication to end hunger issues among Filipinos. She said the PKG movement will be functional into four \"A\" frameworks: --Availability relates to food production by improving the productivity and income of the farmers and fisherfolk. It will also ensure a resilient food system. --Accessibility relates to distribution as well as ensuring 100 percent access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round. --Adequacy addresses hidden hunger with the vision of ending malnutrition experienced by children under five years old as well as pregnant women and lactating mothers. --Assistance that addresses hunger and ensures a resilient food system during crisis periods such as the current pandemic or natural disasters. \"While the long-term goal is to end hunger by 2030, we have set an immediate realistic goal of uplifting one million Filipinos from hunger and malnutrition by 2022,\" Torres said. She said the PKG programs will be pushed through in the priority areas with the highest poverty and malnutrition incidence. The Task Force Zero Hunger has identified 32 priority areas while the private sector has identified 17 more areas in 49 provinces nationwide. \"As the multisectoral collaboration continues, we have mapped out where in the Philippines there are existing programs to guide us in synergizing our efforts for both the present as well as the future,\" she said. Torres said they are targeting to include the public and partake in the PKG movement as she invited them to join the \"Lahat kasali, lahat kasalo\" initiative. \"We are preparing a consumer campaign and this will really invite the public to also participate even as low as 20 or 25 pesos to feed a hungry child so we're in the works,” she said. Torres noted that the campaign is set to be launched by April this year. Zero hunger movement Meanwhile, Task Force Zero Hunger chairperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said resolving issues on involuntary hunger in the country is a \"collective responsibility\" among the general public, the government, and the private sector. \"[It is] an imperative for all of us—the government needs the help of the private sector and other stakeholders to achieve our shared goals for zero hunger in the country,\" he said. Under the national food policy, Nograles said various programs and projects are lined-up to assist the food producers to sustain their livelihoods. The PKG movement also targets to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children by 2030 with the involvement of promoting breastfeeding and providing nutritious meals for every household.

Shining, shimmering, splendid are the best words to describe the face masks made by Randy Gomez and his wife Mina. They’re embellished with sequins, but nobody would ever think that they were made using backdrops from their photo studio “MRG Trading”. Since lockdown was imposed in March last year with events and other gatherings prohibited, Gomez had to think of a way to make use of all the sparkly backdrops supposedly meant for weddings, debuts, anniversary parties, and other events. “Di ba usually sa parties ang backdrop nila 'yung makikintab. Eh nung nag pandemic nawalan kami ng event. 'Yung mga tinda namin na backdrop, ang ginawa namin, binasag muna namin, ginawa naming face mask (Parties usually need shiny backdrops. When the pandemic started, we lost bookings. So we decided to cut the backdrops and turn them into face masks),” he told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in an interview. Gomez said one backdrop could make at least 100 face masks. To date, he and his wife have sold more than 4,000 masks that cost PHP40 each — quite affordable because they’re recycled. While he’s in charge of cutting the sequined backdrops, his wife sews them into face masks. “Meron kaming sewing machine dahil nagko-customize kami ng photography backdrop, photography bag (We have a sewing machine because we also customize photography backdrops and bags),” he said. Their stylish face masks are now among the top sales in digital stores like Shopee and Lazada — a feat they never saw coming. Gomez said buyers leave good reviews for their face masks because they not only keep them protected from Covid-19, but also get head-turns. “'Yung mga bumibili nagpo-post sila ng pictures, sini-send sa ’min. Usually nasa work sila. Sa work nila ginagamit kasi 'yung surgical mask, very common, pinapatungan ng sequined-face mask (Our buyers post photos then send them to us. They usually use them when they go to work. They use them over their surgical face masks),” he said. Apart from sequined-face masks, he said they also have other designs that cater to fans of floral, camouflage, and other patterns. Here to stay Now that limited gatherings are allowed as long as health protocols are observed, Gomez is thankful that clients are using their backdrops again but the demand remains low. “Bihira 'yung kumukuha ng photobooth kasi kung ikaw 'yung client, kukuha ka ng photobooth tapos ang pipictyuran is 10 visitors lang, mararamdaman mo na talo ka (People rarely want photobooths because if you were the client and get one to take photos of 10 visitors, you’ll feel like you’re at a disadvantage),” he said. Gomez remains hopeful that they would get back to business once the government kicks off their vaccine program. Because of the unusual shift from taking photos and selling photography equipment to making sparkly face masks, Gomez said he was initially embarrassed about having to sell them. However, he eventually grew to enjoy selling glamor face masks as it helped him sustain their family’s needs. “Nung una nahihiya i-post sa Facebook kasi siyempre puro pang babae 'yung pinopost ko, kaya lang dapat wala ka nang pakialam sa kritiko. Ang kailangan mo ngayong pandemic is mabuhay (At the beginning, I was embarrassed about having to post them on Facebook since they mostly cater to women but I realized I shouldn’t care about critics. What you need during this pandemic is a means to survive),” he said. Even if a large portion of the community becomes immune to Covid-19, Gomez said he still intends to keep selling fashionable face masks alongside their photography business. “Eto 'yung bumuhay sa ’min during pandemic so wala na kaming balak alisin ‘to kahit na bumalik sa dati 'yung photography (This what helped us survive during the pandemic so we have no plans of letting them go even if the photography business returns),” he added. Super-hero-themed masks Meanwhile, superhero fan, freelance graphic artist Rendell Sueña decided to design face masks that could make wearers feel like they have actual superpowers. Sueña owns a printing shop so it made perfect sense for him to make face masks with the help of his ninong (godfather) when they started losing customers due to pandemic lockdown. “Ang business ko po talaga nagtatatak ako ng shirts, tarpaulin pero nung nag-lockdown, humina 'yung business (My actual business is printing shirts, tarpaulins but during the lockdown, business slowed down),” he said. He started designing masks that were inspired by his favorite basketball teams and eventually expanded to include his favorite superheroes like Spiderman, The Hulk, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as well as anime characters like Dragon Ball, Voltes V, and Gundam. His face masks, which cost around PHP75-80, are also among the most preferred products in digital stores. “Gumawa rin ako ng concept kong design tsaka mga request ng customers ko nagbibigay ng pictures (I come up with my own designs but also accept requests from customers),” he said. Sueña considers his 93-year-old lolo (grandfather), Sofronio Porca, as a role model when it comes to design as he used to paint signages for stores in his younger days. “Ang lolo ko kasi artist din kasi siya. Magaling mag drawing, gumagawa ng signages—'yung mga sinaunang signages plywood, nagpipinta po siya (My lolo is an artist. He draws well, makes signages—those old signages on plywood, he paints them),” he said, adding that his lolo would also design posters which featured his favorite cartoon characters for his birthday. As a father to two kids, Sueña makes it a point to make sure his kids wear face masks others would envy. Designing face masks, he said, is an activity he enjoys doing so he doesn’t see himself stopping anytime soon. “Kung may nakita akong kumbaga natutuwa 'yung ibang tao sa gawa ko, natutuwa na rin ako (When I see people happy with the products I make, I feel happy too),” he said.

These are consistent with the Zero Hunger roadmap outlined in the National Food Policy unveiled by TFZH last month. PKG's initial projects include the following: -- Farmer assistance: With the end in view of elevating farming as a dignified and sustainable profession, these projects aim to increase farmer income by as much as 20 percent within the year, and to double farmer productivity by 2025 via the expansion of value chain projects and logistics improvements. -- Sustainable nutrition programs: Projects that will collectively work to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children across all households by 2030 via a strategy that involves campaigns to promote proper breastfeeding, address malnutrition, and roll out nutritious meals for Filipino households. -- Disaster response: Private sector companies will work to revolutionize their disaster response in close partnership and coordination with the attached national agencies and local government units to streamline the private sector’s efforts to facilitate a prepared, synchronized, and targeted action flow for food security when crises strike. -- Food banking: This effort involves the initiation of food surplus assessments among food manufacturers, restaurants, supermarkets, and public markets in Metro Manila, with the food surplus from donors eventually allocated for distribution to those in need. To promote these projects, to raise awareness regarding hunger, and to invite companies and organizations to join PKG programs, PKG is set to launch a public information campaign, the details of which will be accessible at pilipinaskontragutom.com.

This, as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in Region 12 launched on Friday a three-day online trade fair to help promote and market various products of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the region. Jude Constantine Jaugan, DTI-Region 12 director, said they partnered with Shopee to showcase the region’s products through a virtual exposition dubbed “Shopee x Treasures of Region 12: Tatak Pinoy!” from Feb. 19 to 21. He said they pushed for such collaboration to continue showcasing the region’s products under the “new normal” in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. It was among the innovations that they introduced to help keep the MSMEs afloat and generate sales despite the limited public movements and physical engagements due to the pandemic, he said. Jaugan said the “national online trade fair” is the first-ever organized by DTI-12 in partnership with an e-commerce company. “We enlisted 80 MSME-exhibitors with about 350 food and non-food products for this event,” he said in a statement. He said buyers may access the featured products through a microsite opened by Shopee for the virtual fair. Starting Friday, Jaugan said Shopee’s front page will feature the “Tatak Pinoy!” campaign banner containing the logos of DTI and the participating stakeholders. When clicked, the banner will lead users to the “Treasures of Region 12” microsite and will find the showcase of the region’s “best of the best” products, he said. These include coffee, tuna chicharon, Tnalak-based wearable and decorative items, Tboli brass products, traditional wear, cacao nibs, and other food and non-food products. Region 12 is currently considered as the country’s biggest coffee producer, the country’s tuna capital, and the fruit basket of Mindanao. DTI-12, in collaboration with various government agencies and local government units, launched the “Treasures of Region 12” trade fair in 2014 to feature the products of its localities, among them export-ready food items, high-quality arts and crafts, and furniture. It was held annually in various top event centers in Metro Manila and in this city. The fair was temporarily shelved in 2019 due to the series of earthquakes that hit parts of Mindanao, including Region 12, and continued last year due to Covid-19.

In a statement Tuesday, Shopee said the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has accelerated growth in the e-commerce industry.  Shopee Philippines director Martin Yu said with the community quarantine measures, consumers have turned to online platforms for their daily needs, entertainment, and interaction.  The previous year also transformed e-commerce as online shopping evolved from a purely transactional experience to a more social experience.  “With advancements in technology, increasing internet penetration, and a fast-growing population of young, tech-savvy youths and middle-income families, we expect e-commerce to play an integral role in the way we live, connect, and do business,” Yu said.  For this year, Shopee expects increased adoption of digital payments among Filipino consumers.  As digital payment is the preferred mode of payment for online transactions, people are expected to become more accustomed to e-payment systems and this will also drive cashless payment offline.  For Shopee, orders completed by using mobile wallets improved by four times.  “In line with movement restrictions and continued social distancing efforts, consumers and businesses have increasingly embraced digital payments for greater convenience and security,” it said.  The growth of e-commerce also drives the development of the logistics sector, Shopee said.  “Logistics will become even more important as consumers continue to rely on e-commerce platforms and develop greater expectations for efficient deliveries. The increase in demand is particularly significant for daily necessities and household essentials. In the Philippines, Shopee saw an 8.5 times increase specifically in food-related items shipped from the Shopee warehouse,” it added.  The online shopping firm said brands and sellers should make effective use of technology to deliver parcels in a timely and cost-effective manner.  Shopee expects brands and sellers to implement innovative retail strategies to continue reaching customers amid community quarantine restrictions.  “At Shopee, we are committed to improving the lives of people in the region using technology. I truly believe that our region has the potential to chart a new path forward in influencing the way businesses and consumers connect. We will continue to innovate to stay ahead of these evolving trends, and to drive the growth of e-commerce in 2021 and beyond,” Yu said.  Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry targets the e-commerce industry to be a PHP850-billion industry by end-2021 under its e-commerce roadmap.  The roadmap also aims to increase e-commerce’s share to the economy from 3.4 percent in 2020 to 4.3 percent this year and adding 250,000 e-commerce enterprises from 2020’s half a million online businesses.

To date, there are two local retail groups in the shop --AirAsia Philippines and Regent Asia.  Airasia.com head of Ancillary Commercial Rose Lam said the Philippines is the first country of expansion for the AirAsia Shop platform after Malaysia.  \"The Philippines has a bigger market potential. Metro Manila alone has 12 million population, compared to Kuala Lumpur's population of about 7 million,\" she said.  The Group envisions the AirAsia Shop to be an \"Asean travel and retail shopping platform that redefines duty free products,\" she added.  Customers may choose in-flight delivery, pick up at the airport, or have the products delivered to their doorsteps.  Lam said they are offering unlimited free delivery within Metro Manila, with no minimum purchase.  She also bared plans for the Group to launch the AirAsia Shop in Thailand and Indonesia in the first and second quarter of 2021.  Meanwhile, Karen Chan, airasia.com chief executive officer, said they will welcome local merchants who would like to partner with them.  \"We are now onboarding different merchants. We welcome any distributor or merchants who would like to open their doors for us,\" she said.  Chan added the AirAsia Shop in Malaysia where the Group is headquartered has 60 merchants.

IPOPHL said its office received a total of 139 intellectual property infringement reports for the first nine months of 2020, exceeding the total 129 reports received between 2015 and 2019. Of the intellectual property violations this year, 79 were operating online – 53 from Facebook, seven from Shopee, six from Lazada, three from YouTube, and one each from Carousell, Instagram, and Vineyard. Seven other reported violators were caught operating in other online platforms. The IPOPHL also reported 43 complaints about counterfeit goods and 41 reports about piracy, while 51 were other intellectual property infringement reports not involving counterfeit and piracy. As the number of complaints on intellectual property infringement this year exceeded the reports for the past five years, IPOPHL director general Rowell Barba said they call for new rules to expand online monitoring authority. Barba said the agency’s Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Office (IEO) is proposing updates to the 2013 Rules and Regulations on Enforcement. “The primary objective of the revision is to add more disruptive enforcement functions to the IEO, such as clearly including online counterfeiting and piracy in its coverage, coordinating with the National Telecommunications Commission to take down intellectual property rights offending posts and monitor marketplaces proactively based on findings of the IPOPHL, and elevate issues found to intellectual property rights owners,” he noted.

During the plenary session, the chamber approved House Bill 7805, or the proposed Internet Transactions Act, with 232 affirmative votes, six negative votes, and no abstention. The bill seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services, and digital financial services. The proposed e-commerce bureau will serve as the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one-stop-shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. Valenzuela City Rep. Wes Gatchalian, author of the bill, said the proposed bureau will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet. “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he said. Gatchalian said the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low-value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee, and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to publish the details of their merchants; fail to examine goods related to food, drugs, cosmetics, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or are already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” Gatchalian said.

Domagoso on Wednesday led a raid and the closure of two warehouses in Binondo for selling counterfeit beauty and cosmetic products and operating without business permits. After an investigation, the Manila Bureau of Permits said the products found at the two warehouses are sold through Shopee and Lazada and are delivered in various parts of the country. \"I think Shopee and Lazada should do some due diligence. It is not always the money, about earning, it's always about protecting your consumer,\" Domagoso said. He added that even the lessors of the two warehouses identified as Jerry Ong and Johnson Sy, failed to submit a business permit for wholesaler and occupational permits for service personnel, as well as a license to operate issued by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Domagoso served the immediate closure orders together with Bureau of Permits director Levi Facundo, and Manila Police District Special Mayor's Reaction Team (MPD-SMaRT) chief Maj. Rosalino Ibay. He clarified that while businesses are welcome to operate in Manila, they should acquire the proper permits needed to operate. Meanwhile, among those found inside the first warehouse include counterfeit products such as shampoos, lotion, body wash, bath bombs, and other high-end products bearing the brands of Unilever, Procter and Gamble, Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, and Bulgari. On the second warehouse, boxes of Johnson and Johnson's baby lotion, Cetaphil, bath soaps, and other medical cosmetic products, among others, were found. Domagoso warned the two popular online shops to strengthen their requirements in accepting sellers. \"If we are not going to receive proper explanation, you may be charged with certain liability because you're putting the citizens of Manila, the people of Manila at risk by allowing these products to be sold in your system,\" he said. He added that counterfeit beauty and cosmetics products may cause harmful effects to consumers. Domagoso also ordered Facundo and Ibay to coordinate with the National Bureau of Investigation and the companies involved for further investigation. Facundo said his office has coordinated with Lazada to countercheck if the sellers using their platform have business permits. Pursuant to Section 199 of City Ordinance No. 8331, both Ong and Sy may be slapped with a fine of not less than PHP1,000 nor more than PHP5,000 or imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than six months, or both, depending on the discretion of the court. Under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code, a penalty of one month and one day to six months of imprisonment, and a fine of not exceeding PHP500 shall be imposed against the two lessors.

Castelo said most of the online complaints of consumers were in violations to the Price Act, defective product, and deceptive, unfair, or unconscionable sales acts or practices.  The lower House’s Committee on Trade and Industry conducted the meeting following the growing report on online fraud.  In the recent months, the story of a student from Guimaras named Arthur Baylon went viral after he ordered a laptop on Lazada but only received stones upon delivery.  Another online shopper also received wooden blocks instead of two cellphones she ordered online.

In an interview Tuesday, Precious Cayaon, owner of Kawayan Nature PH said her business that includes buri-made products was greatly affected by the lockdown but the “plantita/plantito (plant lovers) trend” is helping the buri industry bounce back.  Kawayan Nature PH is a Philippine-based company supplying and promoting eco-friendly products.  “Our products are being exported to the Maldives but it (shipment) was stopped due to the lockdown. And even the resorts at the Maldives have ceased operation, our products are being sold in the resorts there,” she said.  The company thus added buri planters to its existing buri bags and mats to cope with the demand of plant lovers.  Buri are leaves from buri palm that are dried and used to make different handwoven products.  “The local government unit of Bolinao reached out to me for the livelihood of the communities in the town making buri products. So I said, we will introduce in-demand items that they could make and right now buri planters are a hit,” Cayaon said.  Cayaon said the five barangays, including Barangay Salud, Pilar, Victory, Boli, and Enve, at the Santiago Island in this town are producing the buri-made products being sold by her company.  “Each barangay is making a specific design or product for us and we name the products after the barangays. This is also to give livelihood to the community,” she added.  Cayaon said their products are sold through the online shopping platform, Shopee.  “We are also open for resellers in the Visayas and Mindanao areas,” she said.  The buri-made products are also made available through the provincial government of Pangasinan’s ‘Pamanang Yaman, Produktong Pangasinan’ project wherein a truck carrying products of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) from the different towns and cities in the province sell these goods in the province.  Aside from the local market, the company has received orders from Singapore, some inquiries from Turkey, and other countries with the help of Cayaon’s overseas Filipino worker (OFW) friends.  Cayaon herself is an OFW and a travel consultant who is now working from home while managing the business with her husband.  She said her company, which they launched late last year, has introduced eco-friendly products such as reusable bamboo straws, bamboo tumblers, bamboo sunglasses, bamboo toothbrushes, wooden comb or hairbrush, plantable pencils, products in the Maldives, and later on added buri-made products.  “Buri is known (for its) formats and bags but in the Maldives, we are marketing it as a beach or picnic mats. Since I am from Bolinao, I thought of marketing buri as I saw how the foreigners have embraced eco-friendly products,” she added.

The initiative is part of the livelihood program of BJMP Balungao to provide income to the PDLs while they are inside the facility.

Together with Facebook, Shopee, and Lazada, USAID’s “Connecting Women Entrepreneurs to the Digital Economy” initiative will enhance Filipina entrepreneurs’ access to markets by equipping them with knowledge and tools to become effective online sellers. The initiative is under USAID’s E-PESO project, which supports the Philippine government’s transition from cash and checks to electronic payments for broader-based economic growth and financial inclusion. “Advancing women’s digital connectivity is key to increasing their economic empowerment as business owners in an ever-expanding digital world,” USAID Mission Director Lawrence Hardy II said. “USAID is pleased to support and collaborate with women entrepreneurs, the private sector, government, and other stakeholders in this initiative that will promote robust, inclusive growth and economic resilience.” This partnership, as part of the US government’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, will increase women entrepreneurs' access to financing, market opportunities, and training to establish and grow their businesses. DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez said the partnership “presents a great opportunity that can be harnessed in building back Filipino communities during the pandemic.” He said: “Women entrepreneurs, who are agents of innovation and change, will help bring the country towards digital connectivity, and contribute to rebuilding livelihoods, as the Philippines re-opens the economy and prepares for a better normal.” In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, businesswomen face struggles in their entrepreneurial journey as they balance their roles managing the household and caring for their families. Despite these barriers, global data underscores that supporting women-owned businesses advances prosperity. In 2019, DTI reported that 64 percent of micro, small and medium enterprises assisted by the Philippine government were owned by women.

The MPTC said that with the ongoing campaign for cashless transactions, the MPTC’s ongoing group-wide RFID sticker installation is now on stream.

Actually, it was nationwide that we saw an increased general usage of the platform. And I think that’s (because) a lot of people (are) turning into the solution to find their basic necessities and needs,” said Shopee Philippines Associate Director Martin Yu during the virtual launch of the Where You Shop Matters partnership with digital payments solution provider, Visa.  He said orders from all over the country “registered (a) pretty steep increase”.  He, however, failed to provide any figures.  He said demand for personal hygiene products and necessities like groceries and diapers was “quite higher”.  The Shopee Philippines-Visa partnership aims to encourage consumers to support local businesses. It is also targeted to boost the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector by helping them to have or to increase their online presence.  Dan Wolbert, Visa Country Manager for the Philippines and Guam, said this tie-up is in line with their small business program to support 10 million small and micro businesses in the Asia Pacific and part of the Visa Foundation’s global commitment to provide USD210 million as Covid-19 emergency support to the small business sector.  He said the tie-up will give discounts to Visa cardholders when they shop at local merchants registered with Shopee.  Wolbert said “the impact of Covid-19 for these businesses along with shifting consumer behaviors to e-commerce reinforced the need for Visa to launch Where You Shop Matters.”  “Furthermore, the partnership with Shopee will help us support thousands of local businesses in the Philippines. We are confident that Filipinos will help support the local economy, especially since our study showed that 95 percent of Filipino consumers will purchase from local retailers to support small business recovery,” he said.  Wolbert said the same study shows that about 77 percent of Filipino consumers consider it a must for local retailers to have online presence.  “The pandemic has accelerated several years’ worth of change into the span of a few months, and this rapid acceleration of the shift to digital payments also means that businesses need to go through a digital transformation and adapt to changing consumers’ behaviors to do well,” he added.  With the tie-up, Visa will be providing local SMEs with a Visa e-Commerce Starter Kit that will help them start, manage, and grow their online storefronts.  Visa has teamed up with BigCommerce, an electronic commerce platform, to help the SMEs start their online store and to give special discount rates for SMEs to sign up with the program.  SMEs will also be given several offers like access to the Office 365 business packages and cashback on Google Ads to help them get their online business up and running.  SMEs with physical stores can order free Visa POS signage to build trust with consumers.  Wolbert said they expect thousands of merchants in Shopee Mall and Shopee Mart to avail of the program and provide discounts to Visa cardholders.  He said they decided to partner with Shopee because it is now a household name, and is among the biggest e-commerce platforms in the country.  “With the pandemic hampering our activities and forcing many of us indoors, the need and usage for Shopee has risen exponentially for both consumers and merchants. With that, we saw a great benefit in partnering with Shopee to help as many buyers and businesses as we can,” he said.  Yu said there are about close to 500,000 active sellers in Shopee to date.  “I do expect a lot of uptake and it’s something that we’re excited about,” he added.

When the city’s pasalubong center shut down last March and April, Katherine Manaog-Jordan, 37, owner of Mary’s Leyte Deli thought their 20-year “moron” and “binagol” making business would collapse, but they managed to survive  In the past three months, she has been busy reaching more consumers online and linked with new resellers in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao.  “We were worried since tourists have stopped coming, large gatherings are banned, and the airport’s operation is very limited, but we realized that this is the perfect time to explore the online platform to sell our moron and binagol,” Jordan told the Philippine News Agency in a phone interview on Thursday.  Moron, the most known delicacy in Leyte, is a mix of sticky rice and cocoa wrapped with banana leaves. It is the main product of Mary’s Leyte Deli.  Another product is binagol derived from the term bagol or coconut shell. Inside the bagol is a molded sweet root crop native in the province.  Since April this year, Jordan has been posting updates on their Facebook page that were not maximized since it was created in September 2017.  Starting May, their products have been sold online through Shopee, one of the country’s leading e-commerce platforms.  “In the past, I never thought of trying these online platforms since we regularly earned from pasalubong centers and walk-in buyers,” Jordan added.  Pasalubong is the Filipino tradition of travelers bringing gifts from their destination to people back home.  Through digital marketing, their business has strengthened partnerships with resellers in Pasig City, Cebu, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Bohol, Dumaguete, Davao, Tagum, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga City, and Surigao.  “Our sales now are not as good as before the pandemic, but we are happy that we survived and we are expanding. We thank the different government agencies for their assistance,” she said.  Mary’s Leyte Deli has been producing 7,000 pieces of moron daily, lower than the 10,000 pieces production before the health crisis. At least 17 of their 31 workers are now back to work.  Recently, Mary’s Leyte Deli gained attention after bagging the region’s top seller award during the one town, one product (OTOP) Pasinaya virtual trade fair held on July 23 to 24.  They earned PHP10 million from online trading, including booked orders until December.  The event organized by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is a digital market showroom and online trade platform. Pasinaya, which means debut, is the kick-off for the new normal trade fairs.  Jordan’s business is a beneficiary of various programs of DTI and the Department of Science and Technology over the years.  It is considered as a premier delicacy manufacturer in Leyte having a license to operate from the Food and Drugs Administration, compliant to food safety and good manufacturing practice, and using government-approved equipment.  In 2018, they completed their two-story production area in the city’s San Jose district funded through a loan from the DTI Small Business Corporation.  Mary’s Leyte Deli was established 20 years ago by Jordan’s mother, Esmeralda Manaog.  In 2014, Jordan resigned as a bank employee to engage full time in her mother’s growing business. A year after, her husband Geovane gave up his post at the Department of Labor and Employment to help manage the business.  The family is a native of Abuyog, a town in Leyte known for producing special morons.

In a statement, Bagong Henerasyon Rep. Bernadette Herrera said the proposed VAT would be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher prices. Herrera called the move “totally unacceptable at this time of economic uncertainty.” She also warned that aside from consumers, small-time businesses and sellers would also be directly affected by the imposition of a 12-percent VAT on popular online shopping platforms, such as Lazada and Shopee. “It’s not good to impose undue administrative burden associated with VAT on Lazada and Shopee, which have been of great help to small businesses and budding entrepreneurs,” Herrera said. These online shopping platforms, she said, play a big role for consumers as the government promotes contactless transactions amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Herrera noted that these shopping platforms have been a source of alternative livelihood for Filipinos affected by the public health crisis. “Many of our kababayans (who) have lost their jobs due to the pandemic had to resort to selling products and services online just to make ends meet,” she said. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Committee approved a proposal imposing a 12-percent VAT on digital transactions in the country. It seeks to amend Section 105 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) by taxing digital service providers that operate through online platforms. Digital services include online licensing or software, updates and add-ons, website filters and firewalls, mobile applications, video games, and online games, and webcasts and webinars. Also included are the provision of digital content, such as music, files, images, text, and information; online advertising spaces; electronic marketplaces; search engine services; social networks; database and hosting; and online training, among others. Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, panel chair, said no new taxes would be imposed, as he guaranteed exemptions for small businesses. “If your sales are below PHP3 million, you are exempt from paying or filing VAT. If your net income as a sole proprietor is below PHP250,000, you are exempt from paying and filing income taxes. So, the small Facebook online seller will not be taxed. I guarantee you,” Salceda said. Some 77 percent of the projected revenues would come from upper-middle-income families and above, he said, adding that only 0.04 percent of all revenues from this proposal would come from the bottom 20 percent of the population.

The tourism chief has made the assertion following the release of the Philippine Tourism Survey: Covid-19 Edition conducted by Isla Lipana & Co./ PwC Philippines (PwC). Results of the survey show that 63 percent of tourism players expressed optimism that their respective businesses will be back on track by 2021. “If we want to get back on our feet sooner than anticipated, we need to rethink our strategies and use technological advancements to promote the health and safety protocols in the new normal. This, coupled with the implementation of industry-wide best practices, will provide clients with excellent service and guarantee a pleasant customer experience,” Puyat added. Puyat earlier announced that the department would provide all DOT-accredited establishments access to SafePass -- the digital contact tracing, health declaration, capacity planning, and incident management solution. This service, which will be offered free of charge, aims to make safety protocols simple and easy for all types of organizations.

Valenzuela Rep. Wes Gatchalian, panel chair, said the proposed Internet Transactions Act seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions conducted over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services and digital financial services. Gatchalian said the e-commerce bureau will be the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one stop shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. He said the proposed bureau “will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet.” “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he added. According to Gatchalian, the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to take necessary measures against products sold on their platforms that do not comply with law; or fail to publish the details of their merchants, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or is already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” he said.

The Connecting Women Entrepreneurs to the Digital Economy project of DTI and the private sector aims to equip businesswomen with knowledge in maximizing the use of digital platforms to expand and boost their businesses.  The project will provide integrated digital marketing training on online storefronts, implementing digital marketing promotions, and leveraging digital payments to become effective online sellers.  “This presents the biggest opportunity we can harness in building back our communities during this period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Women entrepreneurs -- as agents of innovation and change -- will help our country bring us towards digital connectivity.

The DTI’s Regional Operations Group and Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprise Development will be in charge of implementing the project nationwide.  About 150 personnel of DTI and NATCCO will also undergo a mentorship program to guide the mentees.  The project targets to tap 400 Filipina entrepreneurs across the country who are already selling their products online.  The participants are also eyed to build the digital community in the country that will push for digital transformation among Filipino entrepreneurs.  Lopez said as their businesses grow and expand, this will create more jobs for Filipinos.

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda filed House Bill 6765, which seeks to establish a fiscal regime for the digital economy. “No new taxes here, we just want them to pay their fair share. Assuming you’re a company that sets up in the Philippines, and you do video-streaming or music-streaming services, you will definitely pay taxes. But companies like Netflix and Spotify don’t. That’s obviously not fair,\" he said. When you’re a network in the Philippines, advertising services paid to you will be subject to VAT [value added tax]. But Google and Facebook are not subject to VAT for advertising. Ang laki po ng kinikita nila sa mga Pilipino, pero ni isang kusing ng VAT, wala,” he added. Salceda said the bill responds to the increased urgency of finding new sources of revenue to fund the country’s efforts to recover from the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and anticipates the increasing digitization of the country’s economy. He said that this tax administration proposal aims to fairly capture the value created into the tax system, which will lead to five key changes to the way the digital economy is currently taxed. The bill seeks to make “network orchestrators” like Grab, Angkas, and other similar services as withholding agents for income taxes, to ease their partners of the burden of having to pay their own taxes, while also encouraging tax compliance. It shall clarify that services rendered electronically in the course of trade or business are liable to VAT. It would also clarify that digital advertising by internet giants such as Google and Facebook and subscription-based services such as those of Netflix and Spotify are subject to VAT. Network orchestrators for lease services such as Airbnb and electronic commerce platforms such as Lazada and Shopee shall be made withholding agents for VAT. The bill requires those who render digital services to do so through a resident agent or a representative office in the Philippines. This seeks to address the issue of companies having a significant presence in the country without having a physical establishment in the Philippines not being liable for tax and regulatory purposes. Salceda noted that the bill ensures consumer protection, as most of these companies are considered “runaway services”. “Kapag may reklamo ka, paano mo sisingilin, wala namang opisina sa bansa, kaya wala naman kaming pwede panagutin (If you have a complaint, how would you hold them responsible, if there is no physical office in the country? There is no means of accountability),’ he said. Salceda also added that his tax proposal will not affect social media users who do not advertise on these platforms. “If anything, these social media platforms need you, the user, to keep using, so that they could earn from digital advertising, the same way TV networks need viewers so they could get advertising contracts. So, the usual social media channels will definitely remain free,” he said. “The whole idea that somehow, this bill will make social media networks charge users who don’t advertise, that’s a bad reading of the proposal,” he added.

Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa, DOF Assistant Secretary Tony Lambino, and Caloocan Revenue Regional Director Ma. Gracia Javier led the serving of the closure order of the warehouses of the Cagayan Corn Products Corp.; Pacific Rim Transport & Logistics, Inc.; UPFC Logistics Corp.; AAI Logistics Cargo Express, Inc.; and JCOMP Trading and Distribution. These warehouses, located at the T12 Commercial Complex, on Ilang-Ilang St. in Tabang, contain more or less 260 sacks of rice from Myanmar and Vietnam, imported soya milk, liquid detergent and corn flour, and also house the service provider of Shopee, an online store. All the products inside the warehouses have an estimated value of PHP1 billion. Guballa said at least 11 storage units inside the compound were operating illegally, especially the six rice warehouses of UPFC Logistics Corp., which has not been paying registration tax. He added that the operators of the establishments were not compliant with the registration requirements of posting the annual registration fee, payment form, original certificate of registration and the poster “Ask for Receipts or Notice to the Public.” “Section 115 of the Tax Code, as implemented through Revenue Memorandum Order No. 03-2009, authorizes the BIR to suspend or close the business operations of a taxpayer for a period of not less than five days for failure to register, issue VAT official receipts, or sales invoices, file correct VAT returns; or pay the correct VAT,” he said. The closure order was signed by Guballa after the establishments failed to comply with the registration requirements specified in Section 236 of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines (NIRC of 1997), as amended. Guballa also told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that the surveillance operations on the warehouses started last March. Lambino, however, said they were still verifying if the goods found in the warehouses were smuggled or paid with the right taxes. The closure of the warehouses was implemented through BIR's “Oplan Kandado” campaign, which seeks to padlock businesses with unpaid tax dues, as well as those engaged in illegal practices, such as failure to register, understatement of taxable sales by more than 30 percent, and refusal to issue receipts.

The online shopping platform has announced a certain period of time when the public could purchase products, and top spenders would apparently win meet-and-greet tickets. Many netizens said they felt being scammed and cited several reasons why. Among these include the alleged revision of the mechanics to win tickets, just a day before the meet-and-greet. #ShopeeScam also trended on Twitter, as netizens expressed anger, saying a lot of them have spent thousands of pesos but did not win tickets. They emphasized that some people who spent PHP50,000 up to PHP100,00 were not considered as top spenders. They noted that the supposed ticket allocation for the real top spenders was given to celebrities and influencers. A netizen also shared that Shopee has taken away her ticket and claimed that she received a notification because there was a system error. Another fan shared that 10 of them were asked not to join the top 40 spenders who could approach Blackpink for an autograph. She claimed that another 10 people were suddenly included on the top 40 list. Shopee has apologized to customers and Blackpink fans over the incident. \"We hear your feedback loud and clear, and we understand that the event fell short of the high standards that Shopee users and Blackpink fans expect,\" said the online shopping firm in a statement posted on its Facebook page. \"Although we took immediate steps as soon as we discovered the problems to ensure the rightful winners of our contest could claim their prizes, we know that the entire process caused confusion, disappointment, and upset for many,\" it added. Shopee assured that it is currently reaching out to all those affected by the issue and that such an incident will not happen again. On Friday, the Department of Trade and Industry said it has initiated an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, Blackpink celebrities Lisa, Jennie, Rose and Jisoo left Manila on Friday afternoon. They are headed to Macau for a concert slated on Saturday. The girls are known for hit songs, such as Ddu-Du Ddu-du, Kill This Love, Forever Young, among others.

Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez met with Zalora co-founder Christoph Barchewitz during the economic cluster’s London Roadshow last month, wherein they discussed the online retailer’s prospects in the country. “We know it’s a long-term horizon,” Barchewitz told Lopez. He also mentioned that the bulk of the online orders in the Philippines came from emerging second and third-tier cities. “[M]ajority of our orders come from outside Metro Manila, which reflects the faster economic growth happening in the regions,” he added. On the other hand, Lopez affirmed the bright prospects for online retail platforms like Zalora in the Philippines with the rising income here, as well as its tech-savvy and young population. “The robust Philippine economy under the Duterte administration leads to a growing middle class that has greater purchasing power. The generally young population is also tech-savvy. This provides the perfect market for Zalora’s brand and its e-commerce business model,” he noted. Meanwhile, e-commerce aggregator iPrice Group reported that international players have driven the online market activity in the Philippines. Its report showed that Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, and eBay were the most visited e-marketplaces in the Philippines in the second quarter of the year. “The rationale behind the dominance of the international players in PH e-marketplace is because Filipinos’ online shopping preference is mainly based on brand familiarity,” the iPrice Group report read. It added that the partnerships of giant mall operators in the country such as SM and Ayala with these leading online retailers amplify the dominance here of these international e-commerce players.
