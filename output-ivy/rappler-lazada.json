Naturals","body":"In celebration of International Women’s Day last March 8, e-commerce site Lazada launched its first-ever Lazada Forward Women Awards. Lazada recognized 6 successful women entrepreneurs across Southeast Asia, putting the spotlight on their inspiring business journeys. The inaugural awardees are: Creative Seller Award Enterprising Seller Award Inspiring Seller Award  “I am honored to be amongst such inspirational women today. You found interesting and unique ways to leverage the Lazada platform to not only establish your online business but also to engage customers and build a niche following while uplifting the lives around you,” said Chun Li, CEO, Lazada Group. “Lazada is proud to be your partner and have the opportunity to be part of your successful journey.” The winner from the Philippines, Georgianna Carlos, co-founder of pet care brand Fetch! Naturals, shared how her thriving business was affected because of the pandemic. “The Philippines went under lockdown and all couriers and other logistic companies had to stop. But we are thankful Lazada could continue operations delivering essentials that we were able to keep our operations going [even] under lockdown,” said Carlos. Carlos brought Fetch! Naturals to Lazada a year after they launched the brand in 2017. While they already had their own e-commerce website, they weren’t able to ship nationwide. Joining Lazada enabled them to reach customers from different parts of the Philippines, helping them scale the business. What started as a search for a shampoo that wouldn’t give Carlos’ Drogo the Bichon dog allergies is now a renowned pet care brand. She’s thankful for its early success – and she cites two decisions that helped bring this about.  First, she took a huge risk by formulating her own FDA-approved natural pet care products, which made her pricing higher than those being offered by competitors. The brand resonated with discerning pet owners who are willing to pay premium for local yet quality pet care products.  Second, she made the business available online from the get-go. Buying Fetch! Naturals products became not just a convenience for customers but an enriching experience. Carlos’ team directly replies to inquiries and also gives product recommendations based on their customers’ needs. “Lazada has a really great team and I am so lucky that our account managers are very involved and try to help us out. Every time there is a pet-themed sale they try to support us through free homepage banners and the like,” said Carlos. Carlos hopes her business journey will help inspire others who are thinking of setting up a business nobody else has ever dared to try. “My advice is to just do it. Maybe you’ll succeed, maybe you’ll fail. What matters is that you started. Should things not go smoothly, take those encounters as learning opportunities so you can adjust, pivot, and find different ways to see how your business can thrive,” said Carlos.  “Don’t worry too much about what people [would] think. No matter what we do as women, people will have an opinion on what kind of mother, daughter, friend we should be. Life is too short to worry about such things. Just become the person you want to be.” – Rappler.com Sign up as a seller on Lazada today: http://lzd.co/LazadaPHSellerSignUp"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/lazada-online-revolution-live","title":"LIVE: Lazada's 11.11 Online Revolution Launch","date":"Nov 3, 2016 1:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Find out what's in store for Lazada's biggest online sale of the year.

At the Lazada Super Brands Sale happening on July 11 to 16, you don’t have to. Whatever your budget is, there are quality items that you can get from your trusted premium brands like Canon, Samsung, L’Oreal, Penshoppe, Delsey, Bosch, and many more.

If you’re a power user (meaning you tend to run several task-intensive programs at once), and you need a dependable all-around laptop, go for the Lenovo Ideapad 310 Intel Skylake. But if you only need a device for light tasks such as typing and Internet browsing here and there, a Lenovo Yoga 300 is not only handy and flexible, it’s also budget-friendly.   Delsey Helium Aero Trolley Case (P7,250.00) vs Delsey Spacieux Laptop Backpack (P2,400) A big adventure requires a reliable companion. To make sure your luggage arrives intact, bring with you a Delsey Helium Aero Trolley Case. It’s light but it’s durable. It can keep up with you wherever you decide to go.

Whether you want something that can be readily available for use at home (New Infant-to-Toddler Rocker) or a portable play area (Jumperoo Swing) for when you’re visiting relatives or going on a vacation, there’s something for you, parents. Fisher-Price products are proven safe for children, and are tried and tested worldwide. Pyrex 2.5 L Teardrop Bowl (P1,190.00) vs Pyrex 8\" Easy Grab Square Baking Dish (P599.00) Quality dishware is also an investment. Did you know that poor quality containers may affect the taste of food or easily break if used frequently? Premium brands like Pyrex have various products for cooking and baking like the Pyrex 2.5 L Teardrop Bowl and the Pyrex 8” Easy Grab Square dish.   Penshoppe Two-toned Cigarette Fit Jeans (P699.00) vs Penshoppe 2-in-1 Bundled Basic Roundneck Tee  (P399.00) If you’re tired of your usual denim pants, spice things up a little with a pair of two-toned cigarette fit jeans. It’s comfortable but gives you an edgy look. If you want to keep it low-key, go for a basic roundneck tee. You can wear it around the house, in the mall, or while doing your errands.

Fortunately, these heritage brands were quick in partnering with LazMall, ensuring consumer access to their products even with the abruptly changing quarantine policies in the metro. Below is Lazada's press release.] Filipinos have local brands they know and love, with these staple products always in their grocery carts. With the onset of the pandemic, all types of businesses were affected – from small mom-and-pop businesses to big, established corporations.  Here, we take a look at two heritage Filipino brands that made quick decisions to diversify their strategies in moving online, proving that old players indeed have new and fresh ideas to cater to the ever-evolving consumer market.  A household name for decades, Swift was established in 1978, growing in popularity in the '80s and '90s. Its role in Filipino pop culture was cemented when the Philippine Basketball Association named a team after their signature hotdogs – the Swift Mighty Meaties. At that time, almost every grocery cart had Swift products in it, equating the brand to quality food for Filipino families.  For the 40-year-old brand, setting themselves apart for the millennial and Gen Z generations was tough as competition became fiercer with modern marketing and technology, along with a bevy of younger and hip new brands.  “The real challenge for us was to find ways to be relevant to the younger millennial and Gen Z market, as they are not as familiar with our brand compared to the older generation. Beyond innovating our products, we knew we needed to innovate how consumers can access them,” said Nikki Dizon, Century Pacific Group General Manager. The COVID pandemic didn’t make it any easier for the brand. As restrictions were put into place and fewer people went out to buy their essentials, Swift had to think fast to keep their business on track.  “Prior to the pandemic hitting the country, we were mainly available in supermarkets, market stalls, and groceries. We had no e-commerce footprint as it was a challenge for us to find platforms that supported cold chain logistics, a roadblock for door-to-door deliveries to our customers,” Nikki added. The brand saw an opportunity to widen their e-commerce presence and onboarded with Lazada in May 2020.  “We were one of the first fresh/frozen brands to onboard on the platform via Lazada Fresh. We found our transition to be seamless, as Lazada provided us with the right tools we needed to get started on our eCommerce journey. In tandem with giving our brand a refresh, we fashioned our eCommerce presence look and feel to better cater to the tastes of modern consumers. Within a few short weeks, we were able to expand our reach and access a new set of customers through the platform,” the Swift representative explained. The swift move to e-commerce paid off for the brand, seeing incremental sales since their onboarding just two months ago. From struggling to break into the awareness of the younger millennial and Gen Z market, the brand found their sweet spot through their quick pivot to adjust to the current situation.  Starting out in 1990, NutriAsia has grown from a small manufacturer of ketchup, soy sauce, and fish sauce to the successful giant it is today. Their brands have become signature staples in every Filipino pantry, including Datu Puti, Silver Swan, UFC, Mang Tomas, and Golden Fiesta.  NutriAsia consistently observes top-of-mind awareness with their consumers – whether it is in big supermarkets or small sari-sari stores, their products are a constant feature that Filipinos always have stocked up for home cooking.  Being a successful heritage brand, NutriAsia didn’t want to rest on their laurels. Prior to the pandemic, they were already taking baby steps in entering the e-commerce space, onboarding on LazMart in November 2019. As the COVID-19 situation progressed, this meant having to expedite plans to further expand their presence on digital channels.  “Prior to the COVID-19 situation, we were enjoying more than 95% distribution across all offline retail channels. We were hesitant to pivot to e-commerce at first since our core categories – soy sauce and vinegar – were experiencing healthy sales offline. We didn’t know if Filipinos were willing to purchase these items online because they can easily get these in their local neighborhood stores,” said Maybelle So, NutriAsia E-commerce Manager.   Ramping up their e-commerce footprint, NutriAsia put up their flagship store on LazMall last May. Since the onboarding, they saw their sales grow month-on-month, triggered by the quarantine measures and the changes in consumer’s shopping and consumption behavior.  “We saw our consumers purchase larger amounts of products online, as more and more families stayed and cooked their meals at home. Our essentials category saw a significant amount of sales since we opened our LazMall store,” said the e-commerce manager.  Even in their infancy stage in the e-commerce space, NutriAsia saw a big opportunity to sustain its market leadership even in the midst of the pandemic.  “We were conservative about strengthening our e-commerce presence at first as we didn’t know if our market would respond well. But even with these promising results seen in a short amount of time, we are continuously exploring and learning how to further cement our brand on this new and exciting channel,” Maybelle concluded.  As these established brands are already known and loved by Filipino consumers, the e-commerce space is a totally new ballgame for both NutriAsia and Swift. But in order to remain relevant for more years to come, they knew that they had to quickly innovate and keep pushing out new ways to reach their consumers of all demographics in every part of the country.  “The lockdowns have changed shopping behavior in a big way, especially for our frozen processed meat category. We anticipate e-commerce to play an even larger part in our business at Swift, seeing that more people prefer the ease and convenience it provides.\" Nikki Dizon reiterated, \"We want to sustain our competitive edge by continuing to be present in different channels for shoppers, winning every demographic, and catering to when and how they want to purchase their products.”  On NutriAsia's end, Maybelle So said, “While our offline presence is already strong, we are still concentrated on amplifying and strengthening our presence on digital channels. We’re continually testing and learning new ways on how to further expand our reach and target new customers to patronize our brands. We want our consumers to find us on any channel, whether at the supermarket or on our virtual stores.” “We are continually growing the roster of brands Filipinos know and love on Lazada. We’re glad to be a trusted partner that helps these Filipino heritage brands bring their products safely and conveniently to consumers’ doorsteps. It is an exciting time for businesses and brands to make their mark on eCommerce, and we’re happy to be part of their journey,” said Carlos Barrera, Lazada Philippines Chief Operating Officer.  Shop and support your favorite Filipino local brands like NutriAsia and Swift products on Lazada’s 8.8 Bounce Back Sale from August 6-8 at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/nutriasia/ and https://www.lazada.com.ph/swift/. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/grocery-items-lazada","title":"7 grocery items you didn’t know you could buy from Lazada","date":"Jun 29, 2018 4:19 PM PHT","snippet":"Yes, you can order detergent and cooking oil online","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Does going out to shop for groceries feel extra difficult this rainy season?

Here's where to start","date":"Jun 29, 2018 4:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Novels? Komiks? Here are some Filipino favorites you could avail online","body":"MANILA, Philippines — When asked about Filipino literature, what books could you recall top-of-mind? Let me guess, Noli Me Tangere? El Filibusterismo? The sad truth is that many of us (this writer not excluded) simply know more about the literature overseas than within our country. It’s a disheartening reality, regrettable all the more since Filipino literature works wonders foreign books can inherently never achieve. Local literature gives us stories from the eyes of our fellow countrymen. Their voices are imbued with the experience of growing up subjected to the same prejudices, culture, and socio-political history that molded us. Filipino literature is a microcosm of who we are. We can attribute middling awareness to a multitude of reasons, from the lack of marketing to more cooperation needed between local publishers and bookstores for greater attention and distribution. However, with the growing clamor for quality “independent” Filipino music and film, isn’t it due time for Filipino literature to follow suit? Recommendations are a step towards the goal of higher demand. Though not as easy as video or music streaming — which could quickly be accessed within a tap of a finger — online shops can ease distribution woes. With that, here are some quality Filipino picks you can find on Lazada: Ang Nawawala by Chuckberry Pascual   Move over Sherlock Holmes; The Philippines now has its own quirky sleuth. Ang Nawawala, just like most of the Sherlock books, is a collection of short stories, each about a case handled by the smarmy baranggay hall receptionist, Bree (formerly known as Brigido). Though alone already strong, the stories compounded unveil deeper insight into Bree the accidental detective and the environment that surrounds her. Overall, the book is hilarious yet also touching look into society and self-love. Get this from Lazada for ₱250.00 Ang Ikatlong Anti-Kristo by Eros Atalia Nostradamus foretold that the world would fall to three Antichrists. Many believe that the first two were Napoleon and Hitler, respectively. But what if the awaited Third Antichrist came from the Philippines? Winner of the Grand Prize in the 67th Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, Ang Ikatlong Anti-Kristo is the story of the town of San Isidro and its most beloved priest, Padre Marcus. Seemingly blessed, Marcus has the divine abilities to tell the future and heal the sick. But what will Marcus do when he learns that his powers may not come from the God above? Get this from Lazada for ₱275.00 Ilustrado by Miguel Syjuco Ilustrado is the inventive yet moving novel that won the 2008 Man Asian Literary Prize. Its story starts off abroad with the body of author Crispin Salvador floating in the Hudson River. The case is declared a suicide by the local police. Surprisingly, Gone along with him is the manuscript of his final book: a supposed expose on the most influential families of the Philippines. Salvador’s protege, Miguel (Syjuco makes himself the protagonist), sets out to uncover the mystery behind his teacher’s suspicious death. Get this from Lazada for ₱936.00 Smaller and Smaller Circles by FH Batacan Having been brought to the big screen in 2017 by renowned director Raya Martin, Smaller and Smaller Circles is probably the most recognizable book on this list. Hailed as the first Filipino crime-detective story set in the Philippines, the book won author F.H. Batacan the Carlos Palanca Grand Prize for English Novel way back in 1999. Smaller and Smaller Circles is a tense thriller that follows two Jesuits priests cum forensic investigators who uncover a pattern behind a slew of child killings in the grimy slums of Payatas. Amidst the inefficiency and reluctance of the police, the two push on in the belief that a serial killer may be on the prowl. More than its suspense, Smaller and Smaller Circles delivers much drama in its portrayal of the systemized abuse in this country and the circles that perpetuate them. Get this from Lazada for ₱455.00 Trese by Budjette Tan and Kajo Baldisimo John Constantine + Buffy the Vampire = Alexandra Trese First published in 2005, Each Trese volume serves as a de-facto casebook of Alexandra Trese: bar owner/police consultant/de facto peacekeeper between the world above and below. May the case be a hit-and-run at Balete Drive (in which the victim is the street’s famous white lady) or a sting operation involving a human trafficking ring led by aswangs, Trese blends street grit, magic, and plain badassery to deliver satisfying horror-action in every story. Get Trese Vol. 3 for ₱200.00, and Trese Vols. 4, 5, & 6 (Set) for ₱490.00 at Lazada Tabi Po by Mervin Malonzo We Filipinos can’t seem to get horror off our minds. Maybe it's because of the rich mythology ingrained within our culture. With Tabi Po, the focus is on one of local legend’s most frightening creatures: the aswang. Tabi Po is a period komiks centered on Elias, a new-born aswang. Emerging from within a tree in the middle of the forest (much like the Lakas of Filipino lore), Elias finds himself with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Luckily, two other aswangs, Tasyo and Sabel, find Elias and guide him as he grapples with his new life as an aswang. Tabi Po is the much-needed localized take on western media’s obsession with anti-heroes. Much like the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and The Americans, the “heroes” Tabi Po makes us root for are the not the most righteous of characters — in this case, they’re rapacious yet charismatic literal man-eaters. Get Tabi Po Vols. 1 & 2 from Lazada for ₱517.00 Immersing yourself in a story that hits close to home is an experience like no other. There’s a shared experience that is deeply resonant.

An online survey of 345 respondents by Lazada Market Intelligence found that 47.4% of workers spend more on a payday meal versus a regular meal, against 41.9% who spend the same while 10.7% spend less. Of those that spend more, 26.2% of respondents said they spend 50% more while 21.2% claimed to spend twice as much for their payday meals. The survey also underlined the prevalence of generosity in Filipino culture. Around 55% of respondents said that they used their first paycheck to treat their family to lunch or dinner, while 37.5% said that the first thing they do when they get their bonus is to also take their family out. Lazada added that this tradition is so prevalent that 19.5% of respondents actually dread family and friends asking for a payday \"blowout.\" Paying bills On a more somber note, 88.1% of respondents said that a major chunk of their salary goes to utility bills, rent, and credit card payments. Nearly 74% of them also cited bills as being top of mind every 15th and 30th of the month. Their spending power is eroded even further as shown by the finding that 53.8% of respondents have had salary deductions for being late or absent. Meanwhile, long lines at ATMs topped the list of payday annoyances with 40.4% of respondents citing that. Another 24.4% cited payday traffic, while 15.7% mentioned crowded malls. Asked to choose a payday scheme, 48% said they prefer a bimonthly scheme, while 36.9% prefer to receive their salary weekly. Lazada data also showed that majority of payday shoppers are women.

Kira-kira hal ini yang dialami oleh gajah Sumatera, Yongki, yang ditemukan tewas dengan lidah membiru dan gading dicabut paksa. Terlihat sobekan besar di bagian pipi hingga rahang kiri dan kanan gajah malang itu. Pembunuh sadis telah mengambil paksa gadingnya.\" Tulisan di atas membuka sebuah petisi di Change.org yang dimulai oleh Wisnu Wardhana, seorang dokter hewan yang sering diminta mengautopsi gajah-gajah yang mati. Ia merasa terpanggil melihat kematian Yongki baru-baru ini. Kematian gajah dalam keadaan mengenaskan memang sudah sering terjadi di Indonesia, tapi bukan berarti harus dimaklumi. Wisnu ternyata juga menemukan bahwa produk-produk gading gajah dijual di toko online. Maraknya penjualan produk gading gajah dianggap sebagai pemicu banyaknya pembunuhan sadis yang terjadi pada gajah. Wisnu menemukan produk gading gajah dijual dengan bebas di toko online seperti Lazada.co.id, bukalapak.com, dan tokopedia.com. Menurut Undang-Undang No. 5 tahun 1990, menjual dan mengedarkan bagian-bagian satwa yang dilindungi adalah kejahatan pidana yang bisa dijebloskan kepenjara maksimal lima tahun dan denda 100 juta rupiah. Menanggapi petisi tersebut, ketiga situs menyatakan telah menutup postingan penjualan produk gading gajah dan segera memperbaiki kebijakan mereka. \"Ini adalah hasil yang luar biasa. Saya sangat mengapresiasi respon positif dan tindakan cepat dari pengelola toko online tersebut,\" kata Wishnu. \"Saya pun berharap agar Tokopedia, Lazada, dan Bukalapak dapat memberikan data penjual gading gajah tersebut kepada Bareskrim untuk ditindaklanjuti. Petisi ini juga akan saya sampaikan kepada Bareskrim sebagai bentuk dukungan masyarakat pada upaya memberantas perdagangan gading gajah,\" ujarnya. Kematian Yongki memang bukanlah yang pertama terjadi, tapi Yongki bukanlah seekor gajah biasa. Yongki adalah gajah jantan berusia 35 tahun yang telah menjadi anggota tim gabungan gajah terlatih dan pawang yang bertugas di sekitar Taman Nasional Bukit Barisan Selatan, Lampung. Yongki dan timnya berjasa memantau dan menjaga agar gajah-gajah liar dari dalam hutan tidak masuk ke perkampungan penduduk. Yongki juga pernah membintangi sebuah video klip oleh solois muda Indonesia, Tulus, dalam video klipnya yang berjudul Gajah. Selain Yongki, banyak juga gajah-gajah lainnya di Indonesia yang dibunuh dengan sadis hanya untuk diambil gadingnya. Petisi tersebut ditandatangani oleh lebih dari 28 ribu orang. —Rappler.com BACA JUGA: "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/style/mac-lipstick-lazada-sale","title":"Here's how you can get free MAC lipstick on Lazada","date":"Jul 28, 2018 12:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Super Brand Day begins from midnight of July 29 to 11:59 pm the same day.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Lipstick lovers, take note.

Here’s what to expect","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Online shopping is more than just a growing trend, it is a lifestyle that is here to stay. In 2016, a total of 1.66 billion people did their shopping online. And this number is only expected to grow up to almost 2.14 billion in just five short years.These numbers can be attributed to the fact that online shopping is a great benefit to both buyers and sellers alike – e-commerce can offer convenience, assortment, and opportunities that no one physical store can beat. To the shrewd businessman, these factors point to the conclusion that owning an online business is the way to go. But where to begin? Lazada.com.ph is the place to go for every aspiring entrepreneur. As the country's leading online shopping and selling destination, a partnership with Lazada paves the way to success. For those interested in starting a new venture, here's a sneak peek at the journey of owning an online business. – Rappler.com EF4C872D74E347E791C423F7D2123749/img/CA0793EA738549928C17CC015F10117A/lazada-journey-owning-online-business-6b_CA0793EA738549928C17CC015F10117A.jpg\"> http://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/2B8DBD723B5845A0A586E1526D27C914/800x120.jpg \" border=\"0\" />  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/sucess-stories-lazada-brands","title":"Setting up shop and finding success in the digital age","date":"Apr 18, 2017 11:52 AM PHT","snippet":"How three different businesses found success with Southeast Asia’s biggest online shopping and selling site, Lazada","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Not too long ago, setting up a business exclusively meant setting up a physical shop, to shell out huge amounts of cash just to make one’s brand known to as many people as possible. But we all know this is no longer the case today. Various websites and even social media pages allow businesses to thrive even without having to do these two things. In the digital age, online businesses can become just as successful as their traditional, brick-and-mortar counterparts with the platform that’s best for them.  Lazada.com.ph hosts different types of businesses – from small start-ups to some of the most famous brands in the world. Here are stories of three businesses that achieved success in this online platform. Manette Calupitan: Turning passion to profit Manette Calupitan is a longtime online shopping fan. So when she opened her own store a decade ago, she decided to do so on the same medium. She named her shop Beauty Magnet Trading after her full name, Maria Magnetta. She calls it her \"pride and glory.\" “I want to be able to give [my customers] the 'power to attract.' This is Beauty Magnet's tagline. Because I know that the more confident a person is, especially with regard to their physical appearance, the more they attract good things in life,” she says.  To get her business off the ground, Manette worked round the clock and did everything from checking to packing orders to familiarize herself in all aspects of her business. Her biggest challenge now are competition who drop the prices of their own products in a bid to attract customers. However, Manette says Beauty Magnet remains in business because it fulfills its promise to deliver high quality, authentic products. Today, Beauty Magnet has grown from being just a distribution channel for local and imported health and beauty products to also developing its own line of professional skin whitening solutions: Skin-A-Peel and Lumina Skinnovation. The business remains online, too, as Manette has been selling her products mainly on Lazada for the last 2 years. She credits Lazada for helping her business “a great deal\" in gaining exposure among customers. Lazada is constantly present for customers through its ad placements on different websites. It has estabished a trustworth image among online shoppers, particularly with its cash-on-delivery mode of payment. Reni Valenzuela: Customer first Veteran entrepreneur Reni Valenzuela started Fresherb Philippines Enterprises 12 years ago, “a Christian company in the herbal, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry” that offers affordable and high quality hair grower tonics and shampoos for men and women. You might have already seen his products during a trip to a drug store, salon, or health shop. Sales from these physical shops have always been strong. Reni is proud of the fact that he's never had to rely on shelling out millions for advertising or celebrity endorses. Instead, his success is backed by the high quality of his products.   For 5 years now, Fresherb has also offered a money-back-guarantee to assure customers that their products do work as promised. So far there had only been 10 people who have asked for a refund, and only three were actually qualified. Two years ago, Reni decided to take Fresherb to Lazada. Since then, “things got better for us.” “I found Lazada to be an excellent platform and effective tool for promoting and marketing products,” he says. Out of 20,000 partners in Lazada, Fresherb currently ranks in its Top 200. Fresherb is looking into launching new products and exploring a bigger market. PanManhattan Marketing Corporation: Building a green future Creating environmentally-conscious solutions is PanManhattan Marketing Corporation’s business. Haresh Daswani, its general manager for 7 years now, says PanManhattan focuses on research and development, and distribution of innovative products such as water-saving showerheads that reduces water consumption up to 50%, among many others. All these sound well and good, yet Haresh says one of their biggest challenges is making the public realize that they need practical, eco-friendly products in their everyday lives.  Two years ago, PanManhattan decided to sell via Lazada to make their brand and products more visible across the country. Now, the Muntinlupa-based company receives orders from as far as Tawi-Tawi in Mindanao. “Lazada takes care of its customers and suppliers at the same time. They are very helpful to the suppliers to make it as easy as possible for us to fulfill our orders for our customers,” Haresh says. “It is hassle free on our end, which means the customers get their orders soon and are happy with what they get.” PanManhattan fills a need by innovating with products that satisfy its customers. Expansion plans focus on launching more products while creating more job opportunities. Paying it forward Now that they’re enjoying success with their respective businesses, Manette, Reni, and Haresh share sound advice to those looking to start their own. Manette, who provides affordable starter packages and basic training for budding entrepreneurs, says that online sellers should remember three key things: pick products that cater to their personal passion, sell on platforms that can help widen their reach, and to simply be honest to customers. “It’s easy to make a profit but it’s hard to establish customer trust, which is what you should aim for,” she says. Reni advises them to just “go for it” and to consider doing these things: sell good products that will make people happy, provide excellent quality, communicate your products clearly to the public, and capture your market with sincerity and concern. Lastly, Haresh says the road may be tough in the beginning but budding entrepreneurs must remain steadfast. “It will always keep changing but you just have to ready for it,” he says, noting that emphasis should be put on customer satisfaction, price, and social media promotion. – Rappler.com Grow your business online.

The event's origins date back to the 1960s when account records were kept by hand. On the books, red ink indicated loss and black ink meant profit. The event has proven to be such a huge draw among consumers, which means an increase in the \"black\" columns.  Here in the Philippines, we get our own version of Black Friday through Lazada’s 11.11 Online Revolution. It starts today (November 11) and will run until December 12. During this period, Lazada will be offering big discounts of up to 95% off, flash sales (for as low as P11 per product!) and exclusive deals for its 12,500 partner brands, both local and international.  Perks of the month-long shopping event include: During the media launch held last November 3, Inanc Balci, CEO of Lazada Philippines, shared: “This [year's online revolution] is significantly bigger than last year’s.” From selling only 300 items in 2012, Lazada’s online revolution event has grown exponentially, with more than 100,000 items sold on a single day last year.

Working from the company’s headquarters in Makati City, the customer support team is comprised of 250 agents who have passed a “selective process” and are going through regular trainings. As frontliners, they ensure that clients are satisfied with the firm, its products, and its services in the end. Meanwhile, Balci and department heads meet every Friday to discuss problem areas. To identify issues accurately, “we send a survey to a portion of the customers who have received their items. This is a very specific, very detailed survey with 120 touch points,” the CEO shared. Delivery woes The Philippines being an archipelago, delivery still needs ironing out even for a major online retail channel like Lazada. Outside Metro Manila, Lazada has hubs in Pampanga, Batangas, Cebu, and Davao. For these areas, they plan to activate Lazada Express to gain more control and rely less on third party logistics. “The delivery promise differs from city to city. So when the customers buy, we try to give them an accurate approximation of when they will receive the item,” Balci said.  They need to make sure that the item arrives at the consumer’s doorstep within the specified period. In case of delay, they will try to compensate consumers for the dissatisfaction they have caused. Delays, however, are happening “less and less every day – and significantly less in the last 4 weeks because we had a big change in our logistic operations,” he clarified. The firm is working on delivering to areas themselves, improving its footprint across the country through Lazada Express. Supporting merchants, brands Apart from end-consumers, Balci said that they also pledge support to the slew of merchants hosted on their marketplace platform. Lazada is currently home to 1,600 sellers and more or less 110,600 items. The target is to reach 900,000 products by end-2015. It also reaches out to 1.5 million consumers to date. To further boost these figures, the online retailer is set to hold its 3rd birthday sale on March 24 to 26. The shop fest will feature flash sales, some of its revenue makers – electronics and gadgets – and discount vouchers for night shoppers. These efforts are in line with the expansion that Lazada is striving to reach by December 2015. “Looking ahead, Lazada will continue to focus on increasing its assortment range, expand our logistics infrastructure, and payment solutions to further enhance the effortless shopping experience for our customers,” Balci said. – Rappler.com   An independent business writer, Shadz Loresco follows stories on entrepreneurs, technology, and finance.

The Mobile Power Sale will be a one-day-only event only through the Lazada Mobile App and will feature steep discounts for customers. Highlights of the flash sale include an iPhone 6 available for P27,999 ($632), the Cherry Mobile Me Vibe at P 2,999 ($67), the Meizu MX4 at P12,000 ($271) and its own best-selling powerbanks at P499 ($11). Lazada also said it will be giving away prizes on the day itself to shoppers. Mobile commerce has been booming in the country for the past few years driven by the widepread adoption of smartphones. According to a recent survey done by research firm TNC, 53% of all respondents from Metro Manila own a smartphone. For 2015, it is estimated that the country will  see a 22% year-on-year increase in smartphone adoption, according to a recent report by market intelligence firm International Data Center (IDC).  The rise of smartphone use in the country has led to a further shift in retail habits, with Lazada reporting that mobile traffic constitutes more than 50% of daily traffic on its website. E-commerce as a whole though is still dwarfed by traditional retail through Southeast Asia but it is expected to grow exponentially. The ASEAN e-commerce market is $500 million to $1 billion in size, or 0.2% of total retail sales, and is expected to increase 5-fold to as high as $35 billion by 2020, according to a securities report released last year by Investment Bank UBS. This expected rise has led traditional retail giants to set up similar services, with the country’s largest retailer, SM, being the latest to do so late last year. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/sale-series-lazada-ph","title":"Sale series to boost country's e-commerce – Lazada PH CEO","date":"Jan 23, 2015 3:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The online shopping site wants more Filipinos to buy online and become e-commerce shoppers for the rest of their lives","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Riding the early stages of the local e-commerce boom, the country’s leading online shopping site (based on page views per visitor daily, according to Web analytics source Alexa.com) rolls out its first huge, “crazy” sale in 2015. In a media meeting on Thursday, January 22, co-founder and CEO Inanc Balci said that his company wants more and more consumers nationwide to “get the encouragement to buy online, and [to] become online shoppers for the rest of their lives.” Called the Chinese New Year kick-off sale on Tuesday, January 27, this major event marks the beginning of a sale series for Lazada Philippines. This is part of the company’s aggressive efforts to increase e-commerce penetration in the Philippines. This “one-day only” shopfest comes in the wake of the month-long Online Revolution, the 2014 culminating sale that yielded one-day, higher-than-average volume of orders on two dates for Lazada: the start date November 11 with a 7-fold increase, and the end date December 12, 12-fold. Balci indicated that they are set to do another series of big sales this year, recognizing the activity as a growth driver not only for them but also for the market. Events of this scale bring “a lot of logistics challenges; they make the borders flex,” Balci explained. He added that in a way, Lazada is helping Philippine infrastructure get better. Forecasting a surge of orders months before the big event, the online shopping site ensures that merchants, suppliers, and third-party logistics companies are all in the effort. “This flexes certain muscles, but in the end, we see that it makes everyone better. It makes our process better,” Balci said. Sale series as growth driver For the kick-off sale, Lazada is doubling the members of its logistics team in anticipation of a bigger demand. There were 800 workers in the warehouse for the company’s Online Revolution sale. To encourage customers, the kick-off sale brings together a big assortment of products, competitive prices, and shopping convenience. It will feature a night of sales promotion, 16 hourly flash sales, deals on tech and lifestyle items, hourly games, and discount vouchers from partners such as Smart Bro, Maybank, Citibank, BPI, and BDO. There will be mobile devices, fashion items, household essentials, and all sorts of merchandise on its virtual shelves, all tagged with the lowest prices. Lazada’s marketplace model allows its merchants to compete with their prices, sometimes the final amount falling lower than what some of these retailers offer offline. Among other brand and institutional partners are Cebu Pacific, Samsung and crowd favorite Xiaomi, a Chinese tech brand. The rise of online shopping According to a UBS Securities report, the ASEAN e-commerce market is $500 million to $1 billion in size or 0.2% of total retail sales. The opportunity set is as high as $35 billion by 2020. This means “business is thriving,” with the Philippines on track to becoming one of the top performers in two to 3 years. As such, Balci is optimistic that between 2015 and 2016, there is going to be an inflection point. “More and more people will buy [online] in the Philippines,” shared Balci. He was quick to add, though, that this will depend largely on the quality of customer service his company will provide over that period. This point he could not overemphasize: “This business will not succeed without the best service.” Since its inception in April 2012, Lazada has set up an in-house customer management crew, the cash-on-delivery system, and its own logistics unit to address several challenges in the archipelago such as low credit card penetration and inefficient supply chains. Now it has an almost equal penetration between the urban (Metro Manila, Metro Cebu) and rural areas. The Rocket Internet-backed group continues every day to build critical mass for the market. Online retail shares 0.3% of nationwide retail sales. The room for growth is massive, reflecting movements in the region. As Filipino netizens become more and more attuned to the use of mobile devices and remain one of the top active users on Facebook, Lazada is ready to take e-commerce to another level: mobile and social commerce. Willingly setting trends, it welcomes the arrival of traditional players such as The SM Store, which launched its online platform in December 2014. As its chief and other e-commerce experts know, this will only enlarge the market as consumers can take it as a sign that it is no longer scary to shop online. Building consumer trust Purchasing a fake item online remains a discouraging possibility in the country. Add this to the hard-to-please behavior of Filipino buyers. How does Lazada maintain the quality and authenticity of the products sold on its platform? As a retailer, it performs a quality check on its own inventory. As a marketplace, it deals with it this way: “Our merchants upload their products online. But what we do is, if we catch it (the fake item) before it goes online, we give a warning to the merchant; the second time, we take the merchant offline even if the merchant is our top merchant,” said Balci. “No excuses,” Balci said.  “Our business’ future depends on customer feedback,\" At any rate, what Lazada seeks to keep is its return customers. It lso aism to make a person purchase his first item on the Internet and see the online site as the best alternative to physical stores. Above all, Lazada wants to be known as the go-to place for online shoppers in the Philippines. And how it will handle a series of huge, “crazy” sales will be an indicator of its success. – Rappler.comAn independent business writer, Shadz Loresco follows stories on entrepreneurs, technology, and finance.

Lazada continues to inspire Pinoy entrepreneurs in achieving their dreams. Below is their story.] Starting a new business is definitely not a simple walk in the park. These hardworking Filipino entrepreneurs have successfully established and built their own brands and have become cult favorites on Lazada. We shine a light on their journey, their well-loved products, and customer service that consumers have come to trust when ordering from their stores. Each of them has experienced their own highs and lows, showing how they have embraced the benefits of e-commerce and their journey to success.  Evan has always been an entrepreneur at heart.  Her humble beginnings in business started when she was just 18, selling products on the now-defunct Multiply marketplace and sourcing her supplies from overseas manufacturers. “I love selling because it pays off instantly. You get that feeling of satisfaction every time you close a deal,” said Evan.  A single mom since her early twenties, Evan’s business was not only fueled by her entrepreneurial spirit; it was also a means to provide for her family. Throughout the years, she has been juggling working an office job and selling her goods online. Evan was contented with seeing her business grow to moderate success, providing a steady stream of income for her family. But things changed after her mother’s death in 2018. She was also an entrepreneur, selling handicrafts made from the native abaca fiber. Evan wanted to continue her mother’s legacy, and from that point on, she pivoted her business to sell abaca footwear, and Sundals was born. Evan first learned about the native crop during her time in college, discovering that while it was a common crop, it was often underutilized and discarded as waste. For this new venture, she sourced her abaca from micro-communities in Bicol, Cebu, and Laguna. The raw materials are 70% locally sourced, with each pair carefully handcrafted by local makers.  Initially, Evan launched Sundals through bazaars. But later, she realized the rent for booth spaces were eating a big chunk of her earnings while noticing that brick and mortar events weren't bringing her many customers. With this in mind, she thought of showcasing her products online through Facebook and Instagram. She even put up her own website—which brought in several challenges of its own. In search of better business opportunities, Evan discovered online selling with Lazada in 2019 through her brother. Upon researching on how to sell on the platform, she realized that this would help solve many of the challenges that she has encountered with other ventures – things like promotion and marketing, rent charges, and logistics and delivery. Since onboarding on Lazada, Evan’s sales have increased by 300%. It also enabled her to provide a better experience for her customers, such as lower shipping fees and accommodating cash-on-delivery requests. Through the tips and tricks she’s learned at the Lazada University portal and the seller community, and experimenting on utilizing the variety of tools on the platform, Evan shared, “It’s amazing how we get orders on Lazada with just uploading our products online; the customers just come.” Evan is now focused on her business full-time, managing Sundals with her husband. She plans to re-launch the brand this year, with a bridal collection in the pipeline.  Shop Sundals at https://www.lazada.com.ph/sundals. Jeffrey grew up in the province of Batangas, the home of barako coffee. He started working at a coffee farm as early as 4 years old, helping his family make ends meet. He would go to school in the mornings and pick coffee berries or civet droppings in the afternoons and on weekends.  When Jeffrey was 12 years old, his father died, leaving his mother alone to fend for him and his four siblings. Jeffrey did a lot of side-hustling to get extra income, especially in his college years. He did odd jobs such as working as a server at a canteen and volunteering to help with his classmates’ projects.  A computer science major, Jeffrey graduated and got a job as a software engineer in Manila. He eventually moved his way up and became a manager at his firm.  It was through his job in Manila that Jeffrey met his wife, Tatiana. On their wedding day, they gave away barako coffee beans as a token for their guests. It wasn’t long before people started to inquire about replenishing their coffee supply, even asking for favors to bring coffee all the way to Pampanga, where Tatiana is from. This gave them the idea to start a business. Partnering with the best coffee farmers and roasters, Ala Eh Barako was established in 2018, opening up shop on Lazada. At first, the two balanced their day jobs with selling online – working in Manila on the weekdays and traveling to Batangas on the weekends to manage the business. Eventually, the income generated from Ala Eh Barako sky-rocketed, motivating the two to focus on it full-time. The duo has since increased their manpower to a small team of five to cope with the rising demand, helping with packing and coordinating customer orders. With his programmer background, Jeffrey was able to draw data from Lazada and leverage additional accounting tools to track their daily progress on the platform.  The main motivation of Ala Eh Barako is to always deliver quality coffee to customers. The two are elated every time a positive rating or review is left on the Lazada store. Jeffrey recounted a recent review, “We have many loyal customers, but it is great to see feedback so we can constantly improve our products and service. One customer recently said we were accommodating with their queries and special requests, and that our coffee was of good quality – affordable with a premium taste. ‘Iba talaga ang Ala Eh Barako!’ This is always heartening to receive and read such encouraging comments. “If they’re not happy with the products, we either send a replacement or process a refund. Our product quality and customer satisfaction are always our top priorities, as this will help us grow our business even more,” Jeffrey added. “Our sales have doubled since we onboarded on Lazada. E-commerce has truly changed our lives; through Lazada, we are able to build our savings, and better support our family.\" Shop Ala Eh Barako at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/ala-eh-barako. Having been together for almost 10 years, Joy and her now-husband Rodel have always been partners in business. They started their entrepreneurial journey in 2010, shortly after graduating from college. “We were quite adventurous in our ventures – we sold everything from clothes to gadgets on sites like Sulit.ph, Facebook and Instagram,” Joy said. Drawing inspiration from her mother, they established their business, Bags on Demand. “My mother inspired us to manufacture our own products, not just source them from other suppliers. During our buy-and-sell days, we noticed bags would always be top sellers and started from there,” Joy added. In the infant stages of the business, they would produce bags only when customers place their orders. Eventually, people started to take more notice of their products and inquired about ready-to-buy styles. This drove the couple to make more bags and set up their online shop, putting Bags on Demand on Lazada in 2015. Their online shop eventually landed them a feature on the popular morning show Umagang Kay Ganda, which stemmed from a member of the production team buying one of their products online and eventually taking an interest in the story behind their business. The couple now owns a warehouse in Cabuyao, Laguna, where they design and manufacture all their products in-house.  Given the stability of the business on Lazada, this has afforded Joy and Rodel to focus on producing more designs and options for their customers. “When you’re an online seller, there’s a risk that your income will never be stable. But with Lazada, we know our income will never be zero,” said Joy. Apart from their own financial stability, Joy and Rodel were also able to help fund the education of a few of their relatives with their earnings. Today, Joy and her team are laying out their plans to take Bags on Demand to a bigger stage. She envisions the brand to go worldwide, bringing proudly Pinoy products to a global audience. Shop Bags on Demand at https://www.lazada.com.ph/shop/bags-on-demand. “We are proud and happy to have become a partner of our sellers in their journey to success. Now more than ever, we want to keep supporting our local SMEs through giving them access to all the tools and services on our platform, helping them bounce back and bring their e-commerce business to greater heights,” said Lazada Philippines’ Chief Operating Officer Carlos Barrera.

Harganya menjadi lebih murah karena telah didiskon.  Merespon terjadinya kasus ini, pihak Lazada telah menyatakan kesiapan mereka untuk mengambil tanggung jawab. \"Kami telah menghubungi pelanggan yang bersangkutan dan sedang menyelesaikan perihal ini. Kami tanggapi secara serius semua masukan dari konsumen mengenai produk yang dijual melalui website kami dan kami sedang menyelidiki,\" kata co-CEO Lazada Indonesia Elizabeth Craft melalui sebuah keterangan tertulis, Rabu, 15 Juli.  Secara khusus terkait dengan peredaran barang palsu di situsnya, Elizabeth menegaskan bahwa Lazada tak akan memberikan toleransi terhadap penjual yang diketahui menjual dan mendistribusikan barang palsu.  \"Lazada memiliki kebijakan untuk tidak mentoleransi penjualan produk tiruan di website kami. Pada kejadian tertentu dimana ada dugaan khusus terhadap penjual maupun produk yang dijual pada platform kami, tindakan tegas akan diambil, termasuk menghapuskan produk maupun penjual tersebut sesegera mungkin.  \"Kami berjanji bahwa konsumen akan menerima produk yang sesuai, baru, asli dan tidak rusak maupun cacat,\" ujarnya. Jual beli daring bermasalah tanggung jawab siapa? Budi tak sendiri. Andrew Atmadja juga rupanya pernah mengalami nasib serupa dan seperti Budi, membagikan pengalamannya melalui surat pembaca harian Kompas. Andrew bahkan telah berupaya untuk mengembalikan produk yang ia beli, yaitu krim tangan dengan merek L'Occitane. Namun hingga saat ini menurut pengakuan Andrew, upayanya belum memperoleh respon yang memuaskan dari pihak Lazada.   Tak hanya barang palsu, belakangan Lazada juga memiliki persoalan dengn pengiriman barang yang tak sesuai pesanan.  Rizki Kartadikaria yang memesan ponsel pintar Asus Zenfone 6 malah menerima dua kotak pewangi pakaian dari Lazada.

Sayangnya jika merujuk pada draf Rancangan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan (RPP) Perdagangan Elektronik yang tengah dipersiapkan oleh Kementerian Perdagangan, belum ada jawaban yang jelas untuk pertanyaan tersebut. (BACA: Efek kasus iPhone Lazada, penanggungjawab perdagangan elektronik belum jelas) Bagaimanapun, menurut Ketua Pengurus Harian Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Indonesia (YLKI) Tulus Abadi, pihak penyedia platform seperti Lazada tak boleh lepas tangan.  \"Konsumen berhak atas kompensasi dan ganti rugi jika dirugikan oleh penjual. Mereka (penyedia platform) harus bertanggungjawab, kan bagaimanapun mereka ikut menawarkan.

Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Inanc Balci joined the Rocket Internet-backed firm almost on a whim. Coming from a background in investment banking doing mergers and acquisitions, Balci’s focus sector was technology, media, and telecommunications – the perfect preparation for e-commerce. “One night, I got this call from a friend that Rocket Internet: a German-based company is in need of a professional who might be interested in their Southeast Asian expansion, I gave it a really good thought and the next thing I remember is that I’m on my way to the Philippines as part of Lazada – and the rest is history,” Balci said. The growth of Lazada has hinged on how well the company can make Filipinos comfortable with buying products online. To this end, Balci said that the Lazada team is always focused on making shopping as effortless as possible. For instance, Balci said that Lazada offers nationwide cash-on-delivery payment to their customers because credit card penetration in the Philippines is still low. Providing solutions Yet such solution comes with its own challenges. Sometimes the product arrives too soon, so the customer may not have money yet, Balci illustrated. Thus, Lazada returns to the customer’s address up to 3 times, so that they have a better chance of the customer having their cash-on-delivery payment ready. Lazada also offers other incentives to encourage Filipinos to try out their service as well as current customers to come back for more. For one, they offer free nationwide delivery to any part of the Philippines for orders above P1,000 ($22.60). They also have a no-questions-asked return policy. “So this is practically effortless and risk-free shopping that we’re offering to our customers,” Balci said. The company recently launched a mobile app, so that people can shop on their smartphones. Developing the product that is Lazada requires a lot of hard work, of course, which is a staple of Rocket Internet-backed companies. Because the bar is set very high, Balci said that the pace at Lazada is a sort of hyperdrive. “I continuously work wherever I’m, running meetings, regional calls, and addressing the day-to-day challenges 24/7,” Balci said. “It’s always a packed day, especially when you're running a company like Lazada, but it’s always rewarding.” Popularizing e-commerce in the Philippines   Giving credit to his team and meeting customers who use have used Lazada, are the most rewarding part of the job, Balci said. These customers enjoyed their Lazada shopping experience, and look forward to the company’s future developments. “We’re here for and because of our customers, and as much as it is, we want to make sure that we continue to strive toward providing them enviable online shopping experience with Lazada,” Balci shared. Balci does not necessarily consider other e-commerce players in the country as competitors. Given that e-commerce in the Philippines is still in its infancy, Balci believes that other companies in the space get Filipinos used to the idea of buying things online. “E-commerce is still in its early days in the Philippines,” Balci said. “We believe that more players will accelerate market growth and therefore provide benefit for everyone.” Online shopping habits One of the curious things about Filipinos who shop online is, they buy items not traditionally bought online, and Lazada’s main success drivers is technology products.. “A lot of shoppers are buying fashion items online as well and it is increasing very aggressively,” Balci said. Filipinos also tend to shop most avidly during the gaps of their day. “Most online shoppers would usually purchase during their lunch breaks, then at their afternoon breaks, and then when they are on their way home,” Balci said. And though e-commerce is still very young in the Philippines, the platforms that Filipinos use to shop online is already changing. “Since we have launched our app, we have noticed that more and more people are purchasing through their mobile phones more than purchasing through desktop and laptops, everything is highly mobile now,” Balci shared. No matter the shopping habits of Filipinos, Balci wants Lazada to be the online e-commerce destination for them, predicated on the promise of effortless and risk-free shopping. With many up-and-coming players in the market, he understands the enormity of the task ahead of him. “At this point, I would say that there have been great things that have been done in the past years that we have entered the market, but we also realize that there are greater things that need to be done in order to achieve our vision for the company,” he said. – Rappler.comRappler Business columnist Ezra Ferraz is also the chief content officer at ZipMatch, a tech company backed by Ideaspace Foundation, Hatchd Digital, IMJ Investment Partners, and 500 Startups.

Below is their press release.] This year's pandemic created a ripple effect that challenged people's livelihoods worldwide, including a lot of Filipinos in the country. Many of them have been pivoting online either as a new business venture or a side gig to diversify income streams. With the rising interest in e-commerce and digital ventures, Lazada launched LazStart in July, an online entrepreneurship and innovation program. The online program aims to introduce and upskill learners on running an online business with Lazada, and budding Gen Z entrepreneurs have been taking this opportunity to kickstart their e-commerce journey.  Partnering with various schools and universities in the country, LazStart introduces the basic concepts and principles of entrepreneurship, as well as the benefits of leveraging a digital platform to scale a business in the 21st century.  “Building and helping grow the local MSME economy is at the heart of what we do at Lazada. With the LazStart program, we aim to guide these young students on the path to becoming digital entrepreneurs by educating them on the foundations of e-commerce, as well as how to utilize all the available tools and resources on the platform to help them jumpstart their own businesses,” said Ray Alimurung, Chief Executive Officer of Lazada Philippines. Since its launch, LazStart has already inspired a number of young individuals to embark on their e-commerce journey with Lazada. 17-year-old Katrina Cacal always had an entrepreneurial spirit since she was a child.  She first started selling trinkets to classmates and friends when she was in 9th grade, eventually moving to small social media marketplaces to sell her wares. Already armed with experience running her own business, she quickly seized the opportunity to learn the ropes of operating on a bigger platform to further grow her business.  “I heard about the LazStart program through Lazada’s partnership with Treston International College. Since I already had an online business, I thought it would be a great opportunity to gain more knowledge to use for my store. I only expected to listen in, but the experience enabled me to also participate and interact with my peers to share my thoughts on how to improve our online businesses,” said Katrina.  A few days after the program ended, she onboarded Jomarkat General Merchandise on Lazada, selling essentials such as face masks and face shields.  “I chose to onboard on Lazada because of the convenience it provides me as a seller. [Lazada] would already take care of the logistics aspect of the business, which was something I had difficulty with when I sold on other online platforms. The shipping process is fast and convenient, and my products arrive to customers in good condition. It makes me happy to receive feedback from customers that they got their orders nice and quick,” said Katrina.    For Landscape Architecture major Joselle Fajardo, her business started out as a social endeavor with friends. Together with her friends, she co-owns two stores: Clothing Royale PH, selling ready-to-wear fashion items, and Bloom PH, an online reseller of local beauty products.  “As a new business owner with my friends, I thought the program was a great way to explore Lazada as a platform to sell our products and reach more consumers. Since we were all newbies to online selling, I wanted to learn all I could to help boost our business,” says Joselle.  On the other hand, Management Engineering freshman Vincent Sy desired to do something productive during the lockdown. He wanted to break out of his daily routine at home, so he signed up for the LazStart program out of pure curiosity. The opportunity worked out to his advantage as he now manages Comfy Homes Essentials, selling everyday household items like stoves, electric fans, and laundry and gardening tools. “I’ve always had an interest in e-commerce, but I didn’t know where to start. I saw the program advertised on social media and decided to take the opportunity. I thought it was just going to be a run-of-the-mill video Zoom lecture, but I actually learned a lot from the experience and gained a newfound knowledge of e-commerce platforms and doing online business,” said Vincent.  For the three young entrepreneurs, Lazada eased some challenges they encountered with their other ventures in starting a business online. “As a first time-seller, I appreciated that Lazada took care of me and guided me to help fix my online store. The team called me two days after I opened up shop, teaching me step-by-step on how to utilize all the tools available to become a better store,” said Vincent. “As a newbie seller, I appreciate that I won’t have to shoulder an overhead cost with setting up my store on Lazada. I was also hesitant at first because of scams being rampant online, but being on a trusted platform helps me be at ease that transactions done will be safe, both for my customers and myself as a seller,” said Joselle. As young as they are, they believe that there is no better time to set up your own business, especially with e-commerce’s continuous and robust growth and more local businesses going digital.  “When I was much younger and just started out with my business, I really thought long and hard if I should start now; I was so young, I really didn’t have any experience. But I realized that you really have to invest your time and effort to build your brand and expand. There’s no better time than now for you to explore and learn. You might encounter failures, but that would only help in your journey as an entrepreneur,” said Katrina.  “People shouldn’t let the fear of failure get in the way of trying to set up their business. And for those interested to start a business, it should be something that their passionate about. There would always be doubts, but if you’re doing something you really love, you can push through and overcome all the difficulties,” said Joselle.  “Our program participants come from different backgrounds and fields of study, which goes to show that anyone can be an entrepreneur. Lazada aims to be a part of their journey, to encourage and help them grow into successful online Filipino businesses,” said Ray.  You can support Katrina, Joselle, and Vincent's stores through the links below: For more information on the LazStart program, visit http://bit.ly/LAZStartApp - Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/goodrap/lazada-coronavirus-seller-recovery-program-filipino-entrepreneurs","title":"Lazada extends P100M worth of support and recovery program for sellers","date":"Apr 17, 2020 3:35 AM PHT","snippet":"Seller incentive package called Lazada Bounce Back Together program will aid thousands of existing and new SMEs on the platform","body":"[Editor's note: Small to medium enterprises (SME) are one of the hardest-hit sectors of the coronavirus pandemic because of the enhanced community quarantine.

I wasn’t much of an online shopper but my pandemic wedding turned me into one. I have no regrets, though. I wasn’t just able to get most of the things that I needed conveniently, but these little details helped complete the (limited, socially-distanced, and masked) wedding of my dreams.  Here are some of the things I bought from Lazada and Shopee and how they turned out during the actual wedding: There were only less than 20 people who needed to get an invitation. So, instead of getting a print studio to do it, we decided to DIY and saved tons of money. Get the envelopes for P17 each I only had a maid of honor and one secondary sponsor as part of team bride but that didn't mean we couldn't get matching shoes and socks! Get the socks for P60+Add the shoes to your wishlist (P3,995) My nephew couldn't go with us to the church to perform his role as the ring bearer but I made sure he was still all dressed up for the photos. Get the suspender and bow tie for P60 I was able to use this dainty headpiece for my ceremony and reception looks. Since it's affordable, I got a few more pieces for my bridesmaids, mom, and aunts. Get this headpiece for P47 My niece went out only once in 2020 to be at my wedding. Though she couldn't go to the church, we still dressed her up for the occasion. Get this dress for P932 Other than these pretty things, I also got essentials like face masks and face shields from Shopee. We made sure that all of our guests and suppliers were wearing proper protective equipment.  Are you getting married soon? How about instead of going out, try checking out Lazada and Shopee first for the things you need? Who knows, you might find it just like I did – and have a safe and beautiful event. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/skin-care-products-summer-lazada-sale","title":"How you can cop that summer-ready glow","date":"Apr 24, 2018 3:38 AM PHT","snippet":"These skincare products can give you that flawless glow — #nofilter needed","body":" Summer – it’s the time for relaxation, but for beach lovers and the Instagram-obsessed, months of preparation are involved.

Melalui akun Twitter-nya, Danis Darusman merekam kejadian tersebut saat ia membongkar dus pesanannya awal pekan ini. Belakangan diketahui oleh pengguna forum Kaskus bahwa Danis adalah seorang merchandise manager di Elevenia, sebuah situs perdagangan elektronik pesaing Lazada. Kamu bisa tonton videonya di jejaring media sosial Path di sini.   Tapi siapa yang harus disalahkan bila kasus seperti ini terjadi?     Merujuk pada draf Rancangan Peraturan Perundang-Undangan (RPP) Perdagangan Elektronik yang tengah dipersiapkan oleh Kementerian Perdagangan (Kemendag), jawabannya belum jelas.  (BACA: RPP e-commerce akan dorong bisnis online ke media sosial) \"Dalam matrix RPP saat ini belum ada kejelasan mengenai perbatasan tanggung jawab bila ada dispute dalam delivery barang.

Kan ada Penyelenggara Transaksi Perdagangan Melalui Sistem Elektronik (PTPMSE), perantara, dan pedagangnya sendiri,\" kata Budi. Keberatan idEA yang lain Selain persoalan belum jelasnya pembagian tanggung jawab bila terjadi perselisihan dalam proses transaksi, terdapat 4 substansi lain dalam RPP Perdagangan Elektronik yang menurut idEA harus dievaluasi dan diperjelas, yaitu:  1. Kesetaraan dalam proses law enforcement (penegakan hukum) Menurut idEA, jika RPP Perdagangan Elektronik ini nantinya sah dan berlaku, harus ada upaya dari pemerintah untuk memberlakukannya bagi pelaku usaha perdagangan elektronik yang berkedudukan di luar negeri. Jika tidak, kompetisi pasar perdagangan elektronik di Indonesia akan menjadi tidak adil. 2. Kewajiban KYC yang rumit yang bisa menghambat perkembangan pasar Kewajiban memiliki, mencantumkan, dan menyampaikan identitas subyek hukum (KTP, izin usaha, dan nomor SK Pengesahan Badan Hukum) atau dikenal dengan Know Your Customer (KYC) dinilai akan mempersulit pelaku usaha mikro dan kecil di sektor informal untuk masuk ke platform perdagangan elektronik dan pada akhirnya menghambat pertumbuhan industri. 3. Perizinan berlapis idEA juga menyoroti berlapisnya proses perizinan bagi pelaku usaha perdagangan elektronik yang meliputi tanda daftar khusus hingga sertifikat keandalan. Hal ini lagi-lagi dinilai berpotensi menghambat pertumbuhan industri.  4.

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian screen-shot and shared the pages during a virtual Senate committee hearing on online transactions on Thursday, September 3, attended by officers from Lazada and Shopee. “Siguro (Perhaps) we can forgive 'yung mga (those) pirated software, pirated movies and videos, but something that we consume is very dangerous, and this is being sold on online platforms,” Gatchalian said. A product called Paragis Cafe Latte Mix and other consumable items with the same brand claiming to be health boosters were on sale on Lazada at the time of the hearing. Meanwhile, Wheyl Co JUST Whey Protein Powder for Keto/Low-Carb Diet was on sale on Shopee. Its page said 1,200 units of the product had already been sold. Both products were named in separate Food Advisories on the FDA website as unregistered items, Gatchalian found. “The FDA verified through post-marketing surveillance that the above-mentioned food products are not authorized, and the Certificates of Product Registration have not been issued,” the FDA notice stated. “Since these unregistered food products have not gone though the evaluation process of the FDA, the agency cannot assure their quality and safety. The consumption of such violative products may pose health risks to consumers,” the notice went on. Gatchalian asked Lazada and Shopee to explain – especially since they had just presented the Senate panel with the measures they take to protect their customers. “What are they doing to stop this? Obviously, the answer is they’re doing something but as we speak right now…it’s still happening,” Gatchalian said. “The platforms are not doing enough to stop this kind of unscrupulous activity,” the lawmaker added. Lazada CEO Raymond Alimurung acknowledged “that is occurring.” “I would like to reiterate that the presence of a violation will not necessarily correlate to us not doing enough or not doing our responsibility,” said Alimurung, a doctor by profession. For pharmaceuticals and supplements, Lazada uses artificial intelligence to weed out dubious sellers from their roster, based on names and images of “hundreds and thousands” of products, Alimurung said. Only “whitelisted” or approved sellers can sign up on the platform. “There is still a chance that some of these are going to get through, and what we do is we respond to complaints and notices by regulators and add it to what we’re doing,” he added. Alimurung noted the “practical difficulty” of scouring 50 million products’ names and images. To avoid problems like this, the company “will probably need to go in a direction where no small seller can list on our platform, or the entire food and pharmaceuticals category will be deactivated.” “I understand the concern. We take it seriously and we’re doing a lot. But we would like to brainstorm with your body and the authors of the bill on how we would do it, because there is a practicality aspect that I think we need to jointly figure out,” Alimurung told the Senate panel. Earlier in the hearing, Shopee public affairs officer Jaimmie Hans Segovia said the company has “a procedure for taking down counterfeit items” as a way to protect intellectual property rights. She was not given a turn to speak about the FDA-flagged supplements sold on the platform. Senate Bill no. 1591, filed by Gatchalian, seeks to protect consumers as more online enterprises open because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez told the panel that more than 75,000 online businesses have registered with the Department of Trade and Industry since the pandemic took hold in March, followed by stay-at-home policies from the government. (READ: How the pandemic is crushing company earnings) Regulating these new businesses, many based in their owners’ homes, has been tricky for the government. How does it police – and tax – these nascent enterprises without strangling them? During the hearing, the Optical Media Board presented the “pandemic level” of proliferation of counterfeit movies, software, and unregistered electronic devices on sale on platforms like Lazada and Shopee. Gatchalian said new laws should set a proper “regulatory environment” without discouraging small business owners, many of whom were displaced from their former jobs, or unable to find one. Senator Pia Cayetano pointed out that fake and uncertified products are not limited to online stores. She said many counterfeit items are sold even in reputable malls – including supplements. Cayetano said she once joined a raid in a mall when she was practicing intellectual property law. Her client was out to round up fake Lacoste products. “Hindi tayo mamamatay kung may Lacoste na mabentang fake (We wouldn’t die if fake Lacoste is sold). I don’t think you’ll get a skin disease if you wear a fake shirt. But when it comes to food, or pharmaceuticals, or supplements, there could really be health concerns,” she said. However, “they happen online and offline.” “It’s a very valid concern and we need to find solutions, but I think we will go in the wrong direction if we’re simply saying that we should immediately close our doors to online platforms,” Cayetano said. “Let’s address that problem holistically,” she added.  Wheyl Nutrition Company, the distributor of JUST Whey Protein Powder, reached out to Rappler and said the FDA has lifted the warning on the product, which comes in several variants. Wheyl co-founder Jason Reyes showed Rappler certificates from the FDA showing the product line has been registered with the agency since 2018. The protein shakes were indeed unregistered in 2017, Reyes said. Wheyl received a warning from the FDA at the time even with their application pending with the agency, he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/fda-orders-shopee-lazada-stop-online-sale-medicines","title":"FDA orders Shopee, Lazada to stop online sale of medicines","date":"Jun 14, 2019 12:16 PM PHT","snippet":"The Food and Drug Administration says the sale of drug products online places 'the lives of the general public in danger and at risk'","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday, June 14, ordered online shopping platforms Shopee Philippines and Lazada Philippines to immediately stop the sale of medicines until they secure the proper llicenses. The FDA, an attached agency of the Department of Health, warned that the continuous sale of drug products online placed \"the lives of the general public in danger and at risk.\" The FDA said it served Shopee and Lazada \"summons with preventive measure order\" directing it \"under pain of direct or indirect contempt and/or other administrative sanctions\" to cease and desist from selling and offering drug products online. \"The FDA is adamant in implementing the law in order to ensure the safety of the Filipino people and the general public as a whole,\" it said. The FDA earlier said the growth of online sales of medicine carried significant risks to public health as there was no guarantee of knowing if medicines were real or if they were safe and effective. It urged the public to exercise \"extreme caution\" and to avoid the purchase of health products online. \"Buying medicines online over the internet can pose serious health risk....

Besides the Philippines, the Lazada online marketplace also operates across the region in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. A lot of the focus of this various meetings this week held as part of the ASEAN Summit 2017 focused on harnessing the potential of innovation to help spread the wealth more evenly. Some of the discussion topics took on ecommerce as a platform, which allows small-scale entrepreneurs to sell their goods across the country and also globally without the need for much capital. The platform is also arguably the most established of the digital ‘disruptors’ which have caught on tremendously in developed countries, as seen by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba edging traditional retailer Walmart to become the world’s largest retailer by merchandise volume last year.   Ingredients in place While well-established in the mature economies, ecommerce is also rapidly catching on in the developing world. Balci sees the potential of ecommerce in the Philippines as eclipsing other countries' development through ecommerce. “My goal is to make the Philippines number one in the world in terms of ecommerce penetration. I think this is achievable because the country used to have the largest SMS penetration in the world before smartphones and it is now number one in terms of Facebook penetration with 57 million accounts,” Balci pointed out. Filipinos also lead the world globally in terms of amount of time spent on social media, spending an average of 4 hours and 17 minutes a day on social platforms, according to a 2017 report by social media management platform Hootsuite and social media consultants We Are Social Ltd. What’s more, smartphone penetration is on a steep rise in the country at a rate of 117%, with total mobile subscriptions at 119 million last year. The rise has been so steep that market research firm IDC deemed the country the world’s fastest growing smartphone market in Q1 2016. The rise of smartphones bodes well for the future of ecommerce in a country where not everyone can afford laptops. Ecommerce can be done using affordable Android smartphones, Balci pointed out. So integrated has this been to Lazada Philippines' expansion that Balci now refers to the company as an Mcommerce site with the ‘M’ standing for mobile. He estimated about 60% of sales on its platform are done through mobile. By Balci's own estimates, however, the percentage of online retail sales in the country hovers at around 1 -2% of the total retail market presently. Much of this, he explained, is down to the twin challenges of reliable logistics suited for ecommerce and the low penetration rate of credit cards in the country. That may change, however, as the country’s two largest retailers are beginning to make investments into the field. The SM group, the country’s largest conglomerate which already explored ecommerce in the past, has formally entered logistics through a 34.5% stake in the country’s largest logistics firm: the 2GO group. Its retail rival the Ayala group, on the other hand, made an even more direct play by taking a 49% stake in online fashion platform Zalora Philippines. Ayala has also entered into a joint venture with Ant Financial, the world’s largest digital payments firm, in a move seen to spur the growth of digital payments in the country. Even the global big-hitters it seems are taking notice of the potential in the region with the Alibaba Group taking control of all the ASEAN Lazadas in a deal worth $1 billion last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/big-ticket-items-lazada-birthday-sale-march-27-2021","title":"Big-ticket items to watch out for at the Lazada Birthday Sale 2021","date":"Mar 26, 2021 4:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Plus other tips and tricks to remember to make the most out of it","body":"You’ve probably heard “happy birthday to you, Lalalalazada!” too many times already, seen their ads everywhere, the celebrity posts, and online party announcements.

While e-commerce is viewed by most observers as the future of retail, it has been slow to take hold in the country. It captured only 0.5% of the total retail market in 2015, a figure projected to rise to 4.7% by 2025, according to a Google Temasek study. \"The number one rule is to keep on investing in the Philippines,\" Ma said at a press conference after he received an honorary doctorate from De La Salle University on Wednesday, October 25. Last year, the Alibaba Group spent $1 billion to gain a controlling stake in Southeast Asia's dominant e-commerce platform, Lazada, and added a further $1 billion to increase that stake from 51% to 83% in June this year. \"In Southeast Asia, with Lazada and AliExpress, I honestly don't see any money coming back in 5 years. Luckily, we made a lot of money in China,\" Ma said. \"We come to countries like the Philippines not to make money from e-commerce initially, but to see what kind of infrastructure we can build for the Philippines that will enable Philippine small businesses to participate in e-commerce easier. That's the only thing for the next 3 to 5 years,\" he added. Building up e-commerce infrastructure The first part of Alibaba's plan is to build up internet marketplaces locally through Lazada, and set up the infrastructure to facilitate e-commerce trade that crosses borders. \"These marketplaces,\" Ma noted, \"will enable Filipino businesses to do business with China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Europe.\" The second part of Alibaba's plan for the country involves establishing a sophisticated mobile payment system. \"This will allow young persons and small businesses to reach the money and will eventually build up to a cashless society in the Philippines. This is what we want,\" Ma explained. To that end, Alibaba subsidiary Ant Financial entered into a joint venture with Globe Telecom and the latter's parent firm Ayala Corporation through a strategic investment in Globe's fintech arm Mynt earlier this year. The final piece of the puzzle is solving the country's logistics system, which is hampered by the archipelagic geography of the country. \"We also have Lazada's logistics system here. It's not good at the moment but if we continue to invest in the system for another 3 to 5 years we'll be ready,\" Ma said. Alibaba also broached the idea of eventually having training centers to help train entrepreneurs armed with the data that the group's platform provides. \"We are different from other multinational internet firms because when we come in here, the first thing we do is look for partners and enable them to be successful,\" Ma said. \"We'll build up the infrastructure here and let people get used to e-commerce. We don't expect to be successful next year; we're thinking in terms of 5 to 8 years,\" he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/beyond-the-buy/deals-vouchers-lazada-sale-december-12-2020","title":"Lazada 12.12 sale 2020: Deals and vouchers you shouldn’t miss","date":"Dec 11, 2020 2:17 PM PHT","snippet":"Get ready for the last big sale of 2020","body":"[Editor’s Note: Before you proceed, check out our previous recommendations for the Lazada 10.10 and 11.11 sale!

When a loan is approved, the credits go directly to the Lazada e-wallet, which can then be used to make purchases on the site. A slide shown at the event features the loan providers: Such moves somewhat mirror a recent trend wherein apps are trying to become all-in-one digital hubs, such as Grab, WeChat, and GoJek – big success stories, but one that may also hamper competition and innovation, some critics say.  For those experiencing trouble having items delivered to their home because no one's there to receive it, Lazada's customer collection points service may prove useful. Users can choose to have their packages delivered to pickup points at some SM Store branches in the Greater Manila Area; and sari-sari stores that are part of the GrowSari network. GrowSari is a company linking sari-sari stores directly to companies, cutting off middlemen traders, with the goal of increasing margins for the store. The collection point service was launched earlier in the year but will be expanded soon to include more locations.  Lazada also has a new \"pre-sale\" feature, which lets users pick and reserve items right away ahead of an upcoming big sale, say the 9.9 sale. Users will have to pay a 10% deposit on items available via this method, with payment to be completed on the day of the actual sale. It's useful for customers who want to make sure that they get the discounted item they want come sale day. – Rappler.com Get discounts off your purchases with this Lazada voucher code."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/xiaomi-brings-mi-8-lite-pro-to-philippines","title":"Xiaomi bringing Mi 8 Lite, Mi 8 Pro to PH","date":"Nov 9, 2018 4:44 PM PHT","snippet":"Both Xiaomi's Mi 8 Lite and Mi 8 Pro will go on sale on Lazada and Shopee on November 11, with Mi Authorized Stores to have them soon after","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Following the Mi 8 Pro's debut in London on Thursday, November 8, Xiaomi announced both the Mi 8 Lite and Mi 8 Pro would be making their way to the Philippines.  Xiaomi touts the two phones as being perfect for gaming and photography. The Mi 8 Lite takes advantage of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 system on a chip (SoC) processor, along with a 6.26-inch 19:9 full-screen display. It will use a 24 megapixel (MP) selfie camera and have rear 12MP + 5MP AI dual-cameras, all from Sony. Meanwhile, the Mi 8 Pro will sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 AIE chip and have a 6.21-inch full screen display.

Also touted is the pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint lock mechanism on the Mi 8 Pro.

For example, a user can take a photo of a shirt in real life through the Lazada app, and the app will look for a match in its listings. While It’s not yet clear how accurate the tool will be, it does look to be a convenient and useful alternative to text searches – especially if you don’t know what specific terms to use to search for a product you’ve seen in person.  “We created Lazada Image Scan, because we observed how people take photos of items they want to add to their shopping list. So, we translated that insight into a feature where you can take a photo on the Lazada app and instantly find the item to add to your cart in a snap,” says Ray Alimurung, Lazada Philippines’ chief executive.  L’Oréal’s Magic Mirror tool could prove to be useful for make-up lovers. The new tool uses augmented reality, letting customers see a preview of how make-up would look on them. For example, a buyer can select a certain shade of lipstick, and using their phones’ front camera, the tool shows how that color would look on them to see if it suits them.  New games were also introduced such as Moji-Go, which has users imitating emojis to win game coins that can be converted to vouchers; and LazCity Wonderland, which has players building a virtual city for brands, also for vouchers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/lazada-delivery-rider-shares-how-he-met-his-wife","title":"Kaka-add to cart mo 'yan!

The story of delivery rider Marlon Cajucom went viral after he shared how he met his future wife. Marlon, a rider for e-commerce site Lazada, met Jhasin May Benito after delivering parcels for her mother in October 2020. He once delivered a parcel late at night to Jhasin’s mother, Mama Grace.  “Natanong ako ni Mama Grace kung may asawa na ako, sabi ko wala pa po. Bakit daw ang sipag-sipag ko eh wala pa naman daw ako binubuhay, ang sagot ko po noong time na ’yun kasama ko po sa pangarap 'yung magpursige sa buhay,” he said. (Mama Grace asked if I have a wife, and I said none. She then asked why I was so hardworking if I am not feeding a family yet. It was my dream to persevere in life, I replied.) Mama Grace introduced Marlon to her daughter, and after 5 deliveries, the two developed feelings for each other.  Jhasin said Marlon is different from her ex-boyfriends, in that he is hardworking and persistent.  “Sobrang effort po siya noong nanliligaw siya sa akin kahit sobrang busy siya, nag-dedeliver ng flower sa bahay tsaka ramdam mo naman talaga ’yung love,” said Jhasin.  (He exerted so much effort back when he was courting me. Even if he was busy, he sent me flowers at home. I really felt the love.) The two got married last January 26, 2021.
