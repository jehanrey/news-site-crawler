JoyRide and MoveIt were also allowed to operate shortly before the Luzon lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, Angkas asked the government to allow them to operate and proposed safety and hygienic measures to make backriding more sanitary.  But presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said: “Angkas no longer has authority to operate unless they are able to get a franchise.” Roque, however, said the government might reallow pillion riding, or back riding, on private motorcycles after safety guidelines are drafted and approved. Roque said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has approved motorcycle pillion riding “in principle” and has formed a technical working group that would determine the safest and most effective manner to reduce the rate of coronavirus transmission.

Under the Free Motorcycle Ride Project for Medical Frontliners program of the ride-hailing service, the 1,000 Angkas riders who will provide free rides to health workers will be assigned near the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, and Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Based on an agreement between the Joint Task Force COVID Shield and Angkas, some Angkas riders will also be on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, and in Ospital ng Maynila and Fabella Hospital in Manila.  Task Force Commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said Friday that medical workers on their way home may approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of a free ride. Aside from this initiative, Angkas also turned over 1,000 protective barriers to the task force, which will help facilitate the distribution of the materials to qualified riders.  Eleazar said the barriers will be forwarded to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified recipients. He said motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives, and friends who work as medical frontliners will be prioritized in the distribution. According to Eleazar, this initiative from Angkas is “a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic.” “We in the JTF COVID Shield believe that there are a lot of people out there who continue to extend assistance to their troubled kababayans as revealed by the countless good deeds that we regularly see in the social media since the entire country was placed in community quarantine,” he said. The government has earlier allowed motorcycle pillion riding for essential workers or authorized persons outside of residence under MECQ, provided that they install protective barriers in the motorcycles and follow minimum health protocols. The motorcycle that should be used should also be privately-owned and not for hire. Previously, only married couples and live-in partners were allowed for motorcycle pillion riding, a limitation set in place to help prevent the further spread of the coronavirus disease. The quarantine status in Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal were reverted back to MECQ following the appeal of the medical community for a “timeout” amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases under eased quarantine guidelines."},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/56623/angkas-with-angeline-tham","title":"Angkas with Angeline Tham","date":"October 24,2018","snippet":"","body":"Last year, I met this petite girl that can pass for a college student. We were in the same group traveling to Spain. After our hi’s and hello’s and the usual getting-to-know-you questions, she mentioned she has this startup called Angkas. You’ve probably heard about Angkas which had the same controversy the past few months as Uber. Both are ride-hailing mobile apps, one is with cars and the other with motorbikes with the same vision of trying to solve the Metro’s traffic problem. Since the current laws did not evolve as fast as the tech sector, a clash of ideas and opinions is raging in social media pages. The woman behind The Ride.  It all started when Angeline Tham or Angie, had to go to the Philippines for three meetings all around the metro. It took her six hours to get to all her meetings, and she was late to all of them. Traveling around Asia, she realized that traffic is indeed a problem everywhere and realize that there was an opportunity for something like Angkas. Tell us something about yourself. I was born in Singapore and took up a business degree at Stern School of Business in New York University. I was a banker for JP Morgan Singapore for 5 years until I realized it was not for me. From then, I ventured out into my first start-up and never looked back. My business brought me to Manila for the first time, and I fell in love with the city. Now I live in Manila with my Filipino husband and toddler. How did you start Angkas? In Manila, cars are seen as the primary mode of transportation. But it’s really motorbikes. There are only 1.5 million registered cars with 50% of them located in Metro Manila. LTO records show 5 million registered motorcycles but unofficial reports its close to 14M. With this kind of statistics, we realize that there is a need to have a safer and better alternative to “Habal-Habal,” so Angkas was born. What are your goals for Angkas? Angkas wants to provide safe, reliable and affordable motorcycle transportation to its users. We achieve this by ensuring we only high-quality bikers onboard onto the platform. We do this through background screening, safety training, and exams. Angkas aims to professionalize the habal-habal industry and to give bikers the opportunity to be their own entrepreneurs with the platform. My own personal goal is to be able to train 14 million bikers to ensure safer roads and to give them an opportunity to make a living with dignity. Angkas had a big dispute with the LTFRB and some government agencies, besides that what else were your stumbling blocks? Though there were a lot of people riding habal-habals, there was a stigma towards riding a motorcycle for transportation. We had a hard time changing the mindset of riders that bikers are friendly, well trained and safety conscious. What do you need to do to be an Angkas biker? Bikers will need to own a 2011 or newer bike in good condition from our approved list of brands and models. He will have to provide relevant documentation such as Professional Drivers License, NBI Clearance, Police Clearance, Barangay Clearance, and OR/CR for the bike. He will then have to take our free training for safety, customers service and app usage and pass our written and practical exams with a pillion through an obstacle course. Once the biker passes, he will be provided with helmets, personal accident insurance, face masks and shower caps for sanitary purposes. Angkas is seen to be a disruptive technology; whats your tips for wannabe Tech entrepreneurs? If there is something you believe in, put all your passion into it and don’t give up. There will be a lot of obstacles and naysayers. Listen to what they are saying, find their point of view and tackle the issue from there. It can seem overwhelming at times as a disruptor, break down the problem and prioritize solutions that will give you the most impact. Angkas went through it all, from our office being raided, to our members being apprehended. But we held on because we believe we gave a dignified living to a lot of people. How do people react when they realize the CEO is a woman? They are usually shocked as tech is perceived to be a man’s world, more so for a business involving motorcycles. In fact, 50% of our staff are women. I like breaking the stereotypes, and sometimes that can even be in my favor."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1221997/grab-seeks-clarification-is-angkas-our-rival","title":"Grab seeks clarification: Is Angkas our rival?","date":"05:08 AM January 31, 2020","snippet":"Grab Philippines is looking for a way out of the procompetition restrictions that had so cost it millions of pesos in fines, by possibly arguing that a big enough rival has already come along.","body":"Grab Philippines is looking for a way out of the procompetition restrictions that had so cost it millions of pesos in fines, by possibly arguing that a big enough rival has already come along. The ride-hailing giant said on Thursday that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) should clarify if motorcycle taxis were now considered its competitors, after a former PCC commissioner said that barring the likes of Angkas would mean removing Grab’s “competition.” Grab was referring to Rep. Stella Quimbo, who earlier warned transport authorities that banning motorcycle taxis at the end of a pilot test meant that Grab would continue to monopolize the market.  This is an important distinction since the restrictions that currently bound the company—called voluntary commitments—are meant to keep it in check until a new and strong enough competitor emerges. “We cannot right away apply for release from voluntary commitments because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release,” Grab said.  These voluntary commitments result in penalties for Grab whenever it overcharges its passengers and prevents its drivers from working under other ride-hailing apps. But PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said that they would only consider this after motorcycle taxis had finally been legalized."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1352855/want-to-ride-angkas-buy-your-own-helmet","title":"Want to ride Angkas?

Following the national government’s decision to allow the resumption of operations of motorcycle taxis, Angkas told riders they could purchase full-face, quarter-face, modular and dual sport helmets through its partner stores at P760 to P2,636 each, depending on the type and brand.  According to Angkas, helmets may also be purchased with a discount through its product delivery service Angkas Pabili. It cautioned the public, however, against purchasing motocross, half-face and bike helmets that have no visors, as well as those with no regulatory stickers and straps and locks.  This is an added protective measure against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which prompted the government earlier this year to ban pillion riders on motorcycles except those transporting health workers. This has severely affected Angkas’ pool of 30,000 bikers, who were forced to shift gears and instead solely provide delivery services through Angkas Pabili and Angkas Padala.  Robert, an owner of a helmet shop in Pasig City, said that despite this new pronouncement, he had not increased the prices of his helmets, which are sold at P4,000 to P9,000. “We did not implement any price adjustment. But we did notice that there was an increase in demand compared with the time when we were still under [enhanced community quarantine], since more people were not allowed to go out then,” he said in an interview. In a recent statement, Angkas welcomed the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases’ (IATF) decision that would allow the resumption of the motorcycle taxi pilot program, saying transportation was the “core” of the reopening of the economy. “It has always been the advocacy of Angkas to provide inclusive transportation safely to the public, especially at this time of pandemic when 60 percent of the workforce need to go back to work and only 40 percent of public transport is available,” said George Royeca, Angkas chief transport advocate. To ensure that the virus is not transmitted between the driver and the passenger, Angkas would require the use of plastic shields that would serve as barriers, which has been approved by the IATF.  It would also embed a contact tracing capability in the Angkas software that would help detect the location of infected people if needed, while encouraging passengers to inform drivers if they have contracted COVID-19. The pilot study, which was conducted to measure the viability of using motorcycle taxis as public transport vehicles, ended in April.

This is to allow other operators to participate in the pilot run, the DOTr said in a statement Tuesday.  Last June, a six-month pilot run was approved in aid of legislation for Congress to further evaluate pending bills seeking to legalize the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles (PUVs). The pilot run was originally set to end on Dec. 26. The extension, however, will be an “expansion of the study” by allowing new motorcycle taxi service providers to participate in the pilot run to give the riding public more choices and push operators to provide a “higher standard of service,” TWG chairperson Antonio Gardiola Jr. said.  Last Nov. 20, the DOTr heard proposals from six other motorcycle-ride hailing firms, namely Citimuber, JoyRide, MoveIt, EsetGo, Sakay, and VroomGo. All were keen on participating in the pilot run. The extension of the pilot run will also provide the TWG more time to widen the scope of their study on appropriate standards and capacities for motorcycles to be considered safe, convenient, and eligible for franchise.  “We want to determine their operational readiness and compliance”, Gardiola said. “We also want to determine whether or not motorcycles are really a safe and viable form of public transportation. That is always our priority — the safety, security, and comfort of the riding public,” he added. The TWG has already submitted its recommendation, and a decision on the proposed extension is due for release in the coming days. The TWG was created to primarily gather data and determine the viability of motorcycles as a safe mode of public transportation. It is composed of representatives from the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office (LTO), and the Inter-Agency Council for Traffic (I-ACT).  Commuter group asks DOTr to publicize Angkas pilot run findings The commuter group The Passenger Forum (TPF) has appealed to the DOTr to reveal to the public its findings on Angkas’ six-month pilot run to let the public know the “exact data on the safety, viability, and the effects on road traffic of motorcycle taxis.” “We are hoping that they will not wait for us to write a Freedom of Information request before making the material public,” TPF Convenor Primo Morillo said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that their group also wants to find out Angkas’ compliance with the 60 kilometer-per-hour speed limit, the 10-work hour per day limit, accident insurance coverage and the company’s compliance with the fare matrix set by DOTr. Morillo said they will conduct a survey asking motorcycle taxi passengers about their experience during the Angkas pilot run."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1205519/biker-cap-in-pilot-run-anti-competitive-morally-wrong-angkas","title":"Biker cap in pilot run ‘anti-competitive’, ‘morally wrong’ – Angkas","date":"07:34 PM December 24, 2019","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Although it welcomes competitors, ride-hailing firm Angkas on Tuesday insisted that imposing a cap on the number of bikers during the pilot run for motorcycle taxis is “anti-competitive” and “morally wrong.” It appealed to the Technical Working Group tasked to monitor motorcycle taxis to remove the biker cap, pointing out that “there is merit to keep the status quo” for Angkas.  “There is merit to keep the status quo where Angkas bikers already have a proven track record for safety while still allowing other players to come in. Both are not mutually exclusive,” Angkas spokesperson George Royeca said in a statement. Last Friday, the TWG extended the six-month pilot run of motorcycle taxis for another three months, allowing two new players to participate.

It is also “misleading” to claim that Angkas only want monopoly over the pilot run as it has “never complained about the entry of two new players,” Royeca said. “What we aspire for is simple.

Task Force Commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said Friday that medical workers on their way home may approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of a free ride. Aside from this initiative, Angkas also turned over 1,000 protective barriers to the task force, which will help facilitate the distribution of the materials to qualified riders.  Eleazar said the barriers will be forwarded to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified recipients. He said motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives, and friends who work as medical frontliners will be prioritized in the distribution. According to Eleazar, this initiative from Angkas is “a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic.” “We in the JTF COVID Shield believe that there are a lot of people out there who continue to extend assistance to their troubled kababayans as revealed by the countless good deeds that we regularly see in the social media since the entire country was placed in community quarantine,” he said. The government has earlier allowed motorcycle pillion riding for essential workers or authorized persons outside of residence under MECQ, provided that they install protective barriers in the motorcycles and follow minimum health protocols. The motorcycle that should be used should also be privately-owned and not for hire. Previously, only married couples and live-in partners were allowed for motorcycle pillion riding, a limitation set in place to help prevent the further spread of the coronavirus disease. The quarantine status in Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal were reverted back to MECQ following the appeal of the medical community for a “timeout” amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases under eased quarantine guidelines."},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/56623/angkas-with-angeline-tham","title":"Angkas with Angeline Tham","date":"October 24,2018","snippet":"","body":"Last year, I met this petite girl that can pass for a college student. We were in the same group traveling to Spain. After our hi’s and hello’s and the usual getting-to-know-you questions, she mentioned she has this startup called Angkas. You’ve probably heard about Angkas which had the same controversy the past few months as Uber. Both are ride-hailing mobile apps, one is with cars and the other with motorbikes with the same vision of trying to solve the Metro’s traffic problem. Since the current laws did not evolve as fast as the tech sector, a clash of ideas and opinions is raging in social media pages. The woman behind The Ride.  It all started when Angeline Tham or Angie, had to go to the Philippines for three meetings all around the metro. It took her six hours to get to all her meetings, and she was late to all of them. Traveling around Asia, she realized that traffic is indeed a problem everywhere and realize that there was an opportunity for something like Angkas. Tell us something about yourself. I was born in Singapore and took up a business degree at Stern School of Business in New York University. I was a banker for JP Morgan Singapore for 5 years until I realized it was not for me. From then, I ventured out into my first start-up and never looked back. My business brought me to Manila for the first time, and I fell in love with the city. Now I live in Manila with my Filipino husband and toddler. How did you start Angkas? In Manila, cars are seen as the primary mode of transportation. But it’s really motorbikes. There are only 1.5 million registered cars with 50% of them located in Metro Manila. LTO records show 5 million registered motorcycles but unofficial reports its close to 14M. With this kind of statistics, we realize that there is a need to have a safer and better alternative to “Habal-Habal,” so Angkas was born. What are your goals for Angkas? Angkas wants to provide safe, reliable and affordable motorcycle transportation to its users. We achieve this by ensuring we only high-quality bikers onboard onto the platform. We do this through background screening, safety training, and exams. Angkas aims to professionalize the habal-habal industry and to give bikers the opportunity to be their own entrepreneurs with the platform. My own personal goal is to be able to train 14 million bikers to ensure safer roads and to give them an opportunity to make a living with dignity. Angkas had a big dispute with the LTFRB and some government agencies, besides that what else were your stumbling blocks? Though there were a lot of people riding habal-habals, there was a stigma towards riding a motorcycle for transportation. We had a hard time changing the mindset of riders that bikers are friendly, well trained and safety conscious. What do you need to do to be an Angkas biker? Bikers will need to own a 2011 or newer bike in good condition from our approved list of brands and models. He will have to provide relevant documentation such as Professional Drivers License, NBI Clearance, Police Clearance, Barangay Clearance, and OR/CR for the bike. He will then have to take our free training for safety, customers service and app usage and pass our written and practical exams with a pillion through an obstacle course. Once the biker passes, he will be provided with helmets, personal accident insurance, face masks and shower caps for sanitary purposes. Angkas is seen to be a disruptive technology; whats your tips for wannabe Tech entrepreneurs? If there is something you believe in, put all your passion into it and don’t give up. There will be a lot of obstacles and naysayers. Listen to what they are saying, find their point of view and tackle the issue from there. It can seem overwhelming at times as a disruptor, break down the problem and prioritize solutions that will give you the most impact. Angkas went through it all, from our office being raided, to our members being apprehended. But we held on because we believe we gave a dignified living to a lot of people. How do people react when they realize the CEO is a woman? They are usually shocked as tech is perceived to be a man’s world, more so for a business involving motorcycles. In fact, 50% of our staff are women. I like breaking the stereotypes, and sometimes that can even be in my favor."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1221997/grab-seeks-clarification-is-angkas-our-rival","title":"Grab seeks clarification: Is Angkas our rival?","date":"05:08 AM January 31, 2020","snippet":"Grab Philippines is looking for a way out of the procompetition restrictions that had so cost it millions of pesos in fines, by possibly arguing that a big enough rival has already come along.","body":"Grab Philippines is looking for a way out of the procompetition restrictions that had so cost it millions of pesos in fines, by possibly arguing that a big enough rival has already come along. The ride-hailing giant said on Thursday that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) should clarify if motorcycle taxis were now considered its competitors, after a former PCC commissioner said that barring the likes of Angkas would mean removing Grab’s “competition.” Grab was referring to Rep. Stella Quimbo, who earlier warned transport authorities that banning motorcycle taxis at the end of a pilot test meant that Grab would continue to monopolize the market.  This is an important distinction since the restrictions that currently bound the company—called voluntary commitments—are meant to keep it in check until a new and strong enough competitor emerges. “We cannot right away apply for release from voluntary commitments because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release,” Grab said.  These voluntary commitments result in penalties for Grab whenever it overcharges its passengers and prevents its drivers from working under other ride-hailing apps. But PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said that they would only consider this after motorcycle taxis had finally been legalized."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1352855/want-to-ride-angkas-buy-your-own-helmet","title":"Want to ride Angkas?

Following the national government’s decision to allow the resumption of operations of motorcycle taxis, Angkas told riders they could purchase full-face, quarter-face, modular and dual sport helmets through its partner stores at P760 to P2,636 each, depending on the type and brand.  According to Angkas, helmets may also be purchased with a discount through its product delivery service Angkas Pabili. It cautioned the public, however, against purchasing motocross, half-face and bike helmets that have no visors, as well as those with no regulatory stickers and straps and locks.  This is an added protective measure against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which prompted the government earlier this year to ban pillion riders on motorcycles except those transporting health workers. This has severely affected Angkas’ pool of 30,000 bikers, who were forced to shift gears and instead solely provide delivery services through Angkas Pabili and Angkas Padala.  Robert, an owner of a helmet shop in Pasig City, said that despite this new pronouncement, he had not increased the prices of his helmets, which are sold at P4,000 to P9,000. “We did not implement any price adjustment. But we did notice that there was an increase in demand compared with the time when we were still under [enhanced community quarantine], since more people were not allowed to go out then,” he said in an interview. In a recent statement, Angkas welcomed the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases’ (IATF) decision that would allow the resumption of the motorcycle taxi pilot program, saying transportation was the “core” of the reopening of the economy. “It has always been the advocacy of Angkas to provide inclusive transportation safely to the public, especially at this time of pandemic when 60 percent of the workforce need to go back to work and only 40 percent of public transport is available,” said George Royeca, Angkas chief transport advocate. To ensure that the virus is not transmitted between the driver and the passenger, Angkas would require the use of plastic shields that would serve as barriers, which has been approved by the IATF.  It would also embed a contact tracing capability in the Angkas software that would help detect the location of infected people if needed, while encouraging passengers to inform drivers if they have contracted COVID-19. The pilot study, which was conducted to measure the viability of using motorcycle taxis as public transport vehicles, ended in April.

This is to allow other operators to participate in the pilot run, the DOTr said in a statement Tuesday.  Last June, a six-month pilot run was approved in aid of legislation for Congress to further evaluate pending bills seeking to legalize the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles (PUVs). The pilot run was originally set to end on Dec. 26. The extension, however, will be an “expansion of the study” by allowing new motorcycle taxi service providers to participate in the pilot run to give the riding public more choices and push operators to provide a “higher standard of service,” TWG chairperson Antonio Gardiola Jr. said.  Last Nov. 20, the DOTr heard proposals from six other motorcycle-ride hailing firms, namely Citimuber, JoyRide, MoveIt, EsetGo, Sakay, and VroomGo. All were keen on participating in the pilot run. The extension of the pilot run will also provide the TWG more time to widen the scope of their study on appropriate standards and capacities for motorcycles to be considered safe, convenient, and eligible for franchise.  “We want to determine their operational readiness and compliance”, Gardiola said. “We also want to determine whether or not motorcycles are really a safe and viable form of public transportation. That is always our priority — the safety, security, and comfort of the riding public,” he added. The TWG has already submitted its recommendation, and a decision on the proposed extension is due for release in the coming days. The TWG was created to primarily gather data and determine the viability of motorcycles as a safe mode of public transportation. It is composed of representatives from the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office (LTO), and the Inter-Agency Council for Traffic (I-ACT).  Commuter group asks DOTr to publicize Angkas pilot run findings The commuter group The Passenger Forum (TPF) has appealed to the DOTr to reveal to the public its findings on Angkas’ six-month pilot run to let the public know the “exact data on the safety, viability, and the effects on road traffic of motorcycle taxis.” “We are hoping that they will not wait for us to write a Freedom of Information request before making the material public,” TPF Convenor Primo Morillo said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that their group also wants to find out Angkas’ compliance with the 60 kilometer-per-hour speed limit, the 10-work hour per day limit, accident insurance coverage and the company’s compliance with the fare matrix set by DOTr. Morillo said they will conduct a survey asking motorcycle taxi passengers about their experience during the Angkas pilot run."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1205519/biker-cap-in-pilot-run-anti-competitive-morally-wrong-angkas","title":"Biker cap in pilot run ‘anti-competitive’, ‘morally wrong’ – Angkas","date":"07:34 PM December 24, 2019","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Although it welcomes competitors, ride-hailing firm Angkas on Tuesday insisted that imposing a cap on the number of bikers during the pilot run for motorcycle taxis is “anti-competitive” and “morally wrong.” It appealed to the Technical Working Group tasked to monitor motorcycle taxis to remove the biker cap, pointing out that “there is merit to keep the status quo” for Angkas.  “There is merit to keep the status quo where Angkas bikers already have a proven track record for safety while still allowing other players to come in. Both are not mutually exclusive,” Angkas spokesperson George Royeca said in a statement. Last Friday, the TWG extended the six-month pilot run of motorcycle taxis for another three months, allowing two new players to participate.

However, Gardiola eventually said that the pilot run would continue, allaying fears of more transportation woes in the heavy traffic-ridden streets of Metro Manila.  During the interview, he noted that the public sentiment was a major factor in reconsidering their moves. “Because of the concerns, the sentiments, we are considering all sentiments, ‘yong recommendations, that’s why we came up with this study,” he said.

The proposed “backpack” design, which allows passengers behind motorcycle drivers, has dividers and handles between the riders and passengers to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. Back-riding on motorcycles with strict health protocols among couples and partners was initially allowed since July 10.  Earlier, the government task force approved the prototype of the “backpack” design that can be used by motorcycle-riding couples. Interior Secretary Eduardo Año also said that the new design of protective shields as well as the earlier approved design from Bohol Governor Arthur Yap both complied with the minimum health standards set by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease among those riding pillion in motorcycles.  “This second approved design is somehow simpler as it will only be strapped to the motorcycle driver and not mounted directly on the motorcycle itself, unlike the first design,” said Año. “We encourage the motorcycle-riding public to utilize these two prototypes na inaprubahan na din naman ng NTF kaya inaasahan natin na ang ating mga kababayan ay makikiisa at susunod sa pamantayang ito,” he also said. (We encourage the motorcycle-riding public to utilize these two prototypes which are both approved by the NTF. We expect the people to comply with this directive.) Año also stressed that only married couples and live-in partners were so far allowed for motorcycle pillion riding as part of health protocols against the coronavirus disease. However, he said he does not discount the possibility that more people will be allowed for pillion riding once the COVID-19 situation improves. The newly-approved protective shield is made of lightweight and high-density plastic to allow road visibility and has handles that can be used by the pillion rider, according to the Interior chief.

Galvez said the plan was discussed in a recent meeting that he, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and presidential spokesperson Harry Roque had with President Duterte. Angkas to resume operations has also earned the support of Vince Dizon, president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, who is serving as the government’s so-called testing czar in charge of overseeing the setup of coronavirus testing centers across the country. Dizon is also the presidential adviser on flagship programs and projects.  Earlier, Metro Manila mayors requested the IATF, the temporary body overseeing the government’s response to the health crisis, to allow the return of motorcycle taxis. On Monday, the task force endorsed to the House transportation committee a suggestion to extend the testing period for motorcycle taxis as regulators consider their legalization as a mode of public transport. George Royeca, Angkas’ chief transport advocate, said “we are ready and eager to serve, especially our commuters who are required to go back to work but are faced with a critical shortage in public transportation.”  Angkas, he said, recorded “not a single incident of virus transmission” when its motorcycles were tapped to provide rides for health-care workers during the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. In July, Angkas and another motorcycle ride-hailing company, JoyRide, pushed for the use of wearable plastic barriers to help prevent virus transmission between drivers and passengers, but the idea was eventually dropped. Also on Thursday, Roque said the President would hold a Cabinet meeting on Monday next week to discuss how restrictions on economic activities could be further eased. “We will revisit [the proposal to reduce] the 1-meter distancing in public transportation to .75 meters. The President has called for a full Cabinet meeting on Oct. 12 to discuss all these concerns,” the Palace official said. Citing a briefing given early this week by acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua, Roque pointed out that “we are only at 30 percent [capacity] in transportation because of that one-meter rule.’’ “So we need another 20 percent to help reopen the economy if we will remain [under] general community quarantine,” he said. “We will be discussing if we can further ease restrictions on the economy and open it up to 75 percent in Metro Manila and nearby provinces, where our economy is heavily dependent on.” —REPORTS FROM MARIEJO S.

In the motion filed last December 13, DBDOYC, Inc. that owns Angkas said the lifting would not only help the traffic problem in the metropolis but also aide riders who rely on Angkas for their livelihood.  “With the Christmas season upon us, the traffic situation in Metro Manila is bound to worsen with helpless and hapless commuters having to suffer limited options.  Worse, the scepter of jobs being lost by thousands of Angkas drivers looms large,” Angkas said in the 26-page motion. “Private respondent most respectfully implores the Honorable Court to consider such deleterious consequences in taking a second hard look at the TRO it had issued,” it added.  Angkas noted that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which acted as petitioners, would not be on the losing end if the TRO is lifted. “In contrast, it is clear that petitioners will not suffer any injury or damage if the TRO is lifted.  As the Court of last resort, it is hoped that it will not turn a blind eye to the harshness of the outcomes the TRO will lead to,” they said.  Aside from filing a motion, Angkas also complied with the SC order to comment on LTFRB’s petition. Last December 5, the SC issued a TRO against the preliminary injunction from the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 213, which prevented the LTFRB from meddling in Angkas operations. The Mandaluyong RTC’s decision in September 2018 allowed Angkas to operate for a while after LTFRB initially halted their business.

They also claimed that LTFRB violated the hierarchy of courts after they filed a petition before the SC even if the case at the lower court was yet to be settled. “The TRO potentially means the demise of private respondent considering it is being asked to close shop for an indefinite period of time […] Yet for a catastrophic consequence, private respondent [DBDOYC, Inc.] was not even given the slightest opportunity to be heard,” Angkas said. “For violating the doctrine of hierarchy of court and for failing to file a motion for reconsideration before filing the present petition, the Honorable Court at least should have asked the private respondent to comment on petitioners’ application for TRO instead of issuing it ex parte,” they added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1204664/angkas-hits-ltfrb-for-limiting-drivers-to-10000","title":"Angkas hits LTFRB for limiting drivers to 10,000","date":"04:55 AM December 23, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The labor group Partido ng Manggagawa on Sunday urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to withdraw its decision to reduce the number of drivers for the motorcycle-ride-hailing company Angkas from 27,000 to 10,000 by January.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The labor group Partido ng Manggagawa on Sunday urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to withdraw its decision to reduce the number of drivers for the motorcycle-ride-hailing company Angkas from 27,000 to 10,000 by January. “Almost 20,000 Angkas [drivers] are facing a sad Christmas and a bleak new year,” Wilson Fortaleza, spokesperson for the group, said in a statement. “Fostering competition in the motorcycle taxi sector is good but it should not lead to massive dislocation of [drivers].”  Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto also criticized the LTFRB decision, saying it was the “saddest Christmas gift” the government could ever give. “The gift of unemployment is the most heartless of all, the worst Christmas bonus, one that even Scrooge will not even dare think of,” Recto said.  Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite also disapproved of the LTFRB decision, saying “the Grinches” in the agency “just stole the cheer of Christmas” from thousands of Angkas drivers. More than 20,000 Angkas drivers staged a rally at the People Power Monument on Edsa in Quezon City on Sunday to protest the LTFRB decision to cut the company’s capacity and allow two other motorcycle groups, JoyRide and MoveIt, to participate in the safety test of motorcycles as taxis.  George Royeca, a spokesperson for Angkas, said the government’s decision would only encourage the proliferation of “habal-habal,” unauthorized motorcycles offering taxi service to commuters who want to beat traffic on Metro Manila’s heavily congested roads. “This is exactly what happened when Angkas suspended operations the last two times. [Commuters] who [couldn’t] book Angkas often [turned] to habal-habal,” Royeca said. On Saturday, the technical working group formed to study whether it was safe to use motorcycles as taxis denied that its decision would result in 17,000 Angkas drivers losing their jobs. It said it actually expected the number of drivers in the streets to increase to 39,000 because of the addition of JoyRide and MoveIt to the safety test.

The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) on Sunday said it is only following the guidelines set by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).  “We are very sorry but there are no exemptions based on the guidelines of IATF and the Department of the Interior and Local Government, ‘no angkas’policy tayo,” MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview. Pialago issued the remark after a Facebook post went viral recounting how a motorcycle rider was apprehended by an MMDA traffic constable even though he was just transporting his sister-in-law, who is a medical worker, to the hospital.  The rider, Michael Villanueva, said his sister-in-law was forced to alight from the motorcycle and his driver’s license was confiscated as he was also given a traffic violation ticket. Later on, the MMDA traffic enforcer allowed the frontliner to board Villanueva’s motorcycle after she was made to wait for a ride for about 30 minutes.  “Ang ending, pinasakay din sa ‘kin with violation ticket and 5,000 na tubusin,” he said. (She was eventually allowed to ride in my motorcycle but I still got a violation ticket and a 5,000 fine.) “This should be given immediate attention lalo na po sa mga city mayor. Mabigyan niyo po sana sila ng exemptions or maayos na service na may sapat na oras,” Villanueva further wrote in his post. (This should be given immediate attention, especially by city mayors. I hope the government gives them exemptions or transport services.)   While apprehending the motorcycle is in itself not wrong, Pialago acknowledged that the frontliner should not have been allowed to ride the motorcycle again. The traffic enforcer should have assisted the medical frontliner in finding a ride to the hospital. “‘Yung traffic constable, dapat nakipag-coordinate sa aming mobile base para nakapagpadala ng mobile para ibaba ang frontliner sa pinakamalapit na waiting area at i-coordinate doon sa mga shuttle services at libreng sakay,” the MMDA official said. “Hindi niya dapat pinabayaan at hindi pinasakay uli.

Pialago said the MMDA is now investigating the incident as it is also checking their resources such as CCTV footage to determine what really happened.

The interagency technical working group (TWG) overseeing a study meant to assess the viability of motorcycles as a means of public transportation has allowed Angkas to operate only in Metro Manila and Cebu City.  “Acting on several complaints, the LTFRB Region 10 (Northern Mindanao) office in Cagayan de Oro swiftly conducted the operation against several units of Angkas, which [were] reported to have been violating the terms of the motorcycle taxi pilot study,” the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said on Facebook. Aminoden Guro, LTFRB regional director, said six motorcycles were impounded on Dec. 23 on orders of LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III.  “Only Metro Manila and Cebu were given permits to operate for six months while the TWG is working on how to legalize Angkas,” Guro said in an online interview on Sunday. A photo accompanying the DOTr post showed five impounded motorcycles, while a separate picture featured LTFRB officials posing with six men in Angkas uniform.  Guro warned all Angkas drivers in Cagayan de Oro that the LTFRB would impound their motorcycles if they continued defying its order. “In fact, before the apprehension, I advised and warned Jerome Angcono, Angkas CagaÂ¬yan de Oro manager, not to operate,” he added. “Under current transport laws, motorcycles are strictly prohibited from being utilized as public transportation,” said the DOTr, adding that the TWG study would “help Congress formulate a new law which would enable motorcycles to be considered as a new public transportation mode.” Tension between the LTFRB  and Angkas spilled into the open in the run-up to Christmas after the TWG released a new set of guidelines for the second phase of the pilot test, igniting controversy because it placed a cap on the number of Angkas drivers. The transport network company (TNC) is allowed only 10,000 partner drivers under the new guidelines, compared to the 27,000 it employed in the first phase of the test. The word war between the upstart TNC and the government has only escalated since then, with the TWG releasing a statement on Saturday that accused Angkas of behavior that disregarded multiple laws, including conducting business outside designated pilot run areas. It also denounced the company for failing to disclose it was “99.996-percent owned”by a Singaporean, in violation of Philippine laws that state common carriers must be at least 60-percent Filipino-owned. Netizens did not take kindly to the apprehension of Angkas drivers.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) appealed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to seriously consider other options instead, such as allowing riders to use more than one ride-hailing app.  PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said this after the LTFRB has pushed for a 10,000 cap on drivers for each company in the motorcycle-hailing market, despite the obvious backlash on Angkas and its riders. The company said it currently has 27,000 riders in its system, more than 60 percent of whom would be forced to pick between new players JoyRide and MoveIt, without any assurance that they would even be accepted, let alone enjoy the same, if not better, incentives.  The LTFRB has defended its policy as a way to prevent Angkas from becoming a monopoly, it said. But the situation is not necessarily as simple as that, according to Bernabe.  “Being big per se is not necessarily bad. It’s the abuse of that dominant position [that’s bad],” Bernabe told the Inquirer in a phone interview. “With Angkas, its bigness was not like Grab which acquired its competitor and therefore became dominant and a monopoly. Here, [Angkas] grew out of its own efforts,” he said. “In a sense, you are taking away what Angkas has worked hard on obtaining, which is a driver base,” he said. Angkas, for its part, challenged transport regulators’ characterization of its operations as a “monopoly,” saying it was not fair for them to break apart the company to prop up the new players who will join the three-month extended pilot test to see if bikes are safe for public transport. In an interview with the Inquirer, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca rebuked the multiagency technical working group for willfully ignoring their input throughout the pilot run, and for railroading the decision to impose a cap of 39,000 riders split evenly within three companies. “It’s like they’re imposing moving targets.

It helps her avoid congested highways by taking her through residential streets, saving her almost an hour of travel. “It’s not [accurate] all the time,” she said. “But it does the job.” Critics, however, point out that Waze merely displaces the traffic into areas not normally traversed by vehicles, like subdivisions and inner roads. But now, even the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is pushing for the use of private roads to help decongest the main highways. Motorcycle taxis  As passengers of four-wheeled vehicles stew in heavy traffic, others breeze through on motorcycle taxis hired through the Angkas app. Angkas is currently undergoing a six-month pilot test which, if successful, may persuade Congress to amend Republic Act No. 4136, which bars the two-wheelers from being used for public transport. According to George Royeca, Angkas public affairs head, it takes 35 minutes to traverse 15 kilometers on a regular Angkas ride. Commuter groups have been pushing for the 10-10-10 principle, where it should take one hour to traverse 10 kilometers for a trip to be considered convenient and efficient. Maia Legson, a web designer working in Taguig City, is a regular Angkas passenger. For a fare of P188, it takes her 20 minutes to reach SM Aura from her house in Libertad. Two jeepney rides (P9 per ride) would take her an hour and a half. “At first, I was apprehensive because Angkas is expensive (compared to public transport). But when I think about the sacrifices I have to make and the difficulties I have to endure on the road, I think it’s a fair tradeoff.” Like Legson, 23-year-old Maedelle Vargas has also gotten used to booking an Angkas ride to get to her office in Taguig every day. “If I commute, it would take me five rides and over an hour to arrive, [plus] I would have to wake up early and leave the house around 6:45 a.m. just to arrive at 8 a.m.,” she said. “Even a normal Grab ride would take an hour and a half while Angkas will take 30-45 minutes.” But the speed and convenience do not make up for the glaring lack of options for regular commuters, said Dr. John Go of the World Health Organization. Safety also important “When we look at Angkas, we shouldn’t simply regard it as the ultimate solution, but also look at why it is being offered and whether there are alternative options,“ he said during a road safety conference. “Moving from Point A to B is important. But moving from Point A to B safely is [also] important.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For its part, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) maintains that it is doing its best to beef up the country’s public transport system starting with the light rail systems.

Mostly, opposition to Angkas come from operators of passenger jeepneys, who are poised to modernize their fleet in compliance with government regulation.  This city has been included in the pilot area of a study on the viability of making motorcycle taxis as public utility vehicles. The three motorcycle-hailing companies in the country are each allocated 1,000 units, but only Angkas has submitted its intention to deploy motorcycle taxis here.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has inspected 925 Angkas motorcycles although the fleet has not yet plied the city’s streets. Luzminda Lalaine Escobidal, chairperson of the PN Roa Canitoan Transport Cooperative, said giving Angkas permit to do business in the city would affect the earnings of their drivers.  “Angkas would affect our income, considering that we are paying millions for (modernizing) our fleet. How will we be able to pay for our units? We have invested so much,” Escobidal lamented. Escobidal said her organization and three other transport groups have manifested their opposition to Angkas before the city council. She claimed to have the city government’s support on their petition. LTFRB Region 10 director Aminoden Guro said it was up to the technical working work of the Department of Transportation to consider the petition of the transport groups. Angkas first operated here during the early part of 2019, even as the city was not part of the pilot study at that time.  Although later uncovered as illegal, Angkas’ operation was able to fill unmet demand for a means of transport that easily beat the gridlock in the city’s roads. With a population of around 700,000, the city hosts tens of thousands more during the day, who come here for study, work, business, medical attention, and transactions with government agencies. The urban habal-habal was also a better alternative for students and workers, who go home to villages, where jeepneys no longer ply late in the night. Angeline Tham, Angkas chief executive officer said the operation of Angkas is not a new concept since habal-habal had been here for decades. “What we’re doing is not anything different. What we are trying to do is professionalize the habal-habal industry to make things safer, more efficient, and provide training and insurance to the bikers and passengers,” Tham explained./lzb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1030081/dotr-ltfrb-to-appeal-ruling-lifting-angkas-suspension","title":"DOTr, LTFRB to appeal ruling lifting Angkas’ suspension","date":"05:04 AM September 10, 2018","snippet":"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) are coordinating with the Office of the Solicitor General to appeal a recent court ruling allowing motorcycle-hailing service Angkas to resume operations.","body":"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) are coordinating with the Office of the Solicitor General to appeal a recent court ruling allowing motorcycle-hailing service Angkas to resume operations. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III said that he and the DOTr would contest the ruling based on a law which stated that motorcycles for hire could not be considered public transport due to safety issues.  Legal option Delgra did not go into details but it was likely that the agencies would ask the Court of Appeals to reverse the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court Branch 213.  Valenzuela’s order blocked the DOTr and LTFRB from interfering in Angkas’ operations and from apprehending its riders while he hears Angkas’ original petition for declaratory relief. The LTFRB shut down the operations of the local transport network company (TNC) last year for allegedly operating without a franchise.  Not a TNVS Delgra asserted that motorcycles for hire like Angkas could not be considered transport network vehicle services (TNVS), a ride classification coined by the LTFRB to refer to privately owned cars being used as public utility vehicles. This was based on Republic Act No. 4136 which considered two-wheeled vehicles “unsafe.” According to 2017 government data on road safety, motorcycle crashes were the deadliest among other vehicle types with 24,000 cases that left 240 people dead and over 12,000 injured. But motorcycle advocates maintained that these fatal accidents could be avoided by legitimizing for-hike bikes and professionalizing the industry.  Delgra conceded that if there was “a clear public need to consider (two-wheeled vehicles) as TNVS, then we should amend the law via Congress.” But for now, the government was focused on modernizing mass transit starting with jeepneys, UV Express taxis and passenger buses to ease mobility and road safety, he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1218370/angkas-withdraws-raps-test-body-allows-more-motorbike-taxis","title":"Angkas withdraws raps; test body allows more motorbike taxis","date":"05:48 AM January 23, 2020","snippet":"An ad hoc government body conducting a pilot test for motorcycle taxis has agreed to raise the driver cap nationwide to 63,000 and may allow bikes-for-hire even after March 23, as transport regulators and pioneering bike service Angkas have struck a deal to end their dispute.","body":"An ad hoc government body conducting a pilot test for motorcycle taxis has agreed to raise the driver cap nationwide to 63,000 and may allow bikes-for-hire even after March 23, as transport regulators and pioneering bike service Angkas have struck a deal to end their dispute. Angkas has agreed to withdraw the cases it filed against the interagency technical working group (TWG) in the Mandaluyong and Quezon City courts, removing legal obstacles to the full rollout of the test run.  Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the TWG chair, Antonio Gardiola, said the group had agreed to raise the driver cap in Metro Manila to 45,000, or 15,000 each for Angkas and newcomers JoyRide and MoveIt. The earlier cap given to Angkas was 10,000, against which it successfully secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) from a Quezon City court. Had the cap been enforced, 17,000 of Angkas’ 27,000 drivers would have been displaced.  In addition, each motorcycle taxi-service provider can have 3,000 drivers in Cebu and another 3,000 in a new area, Cagayan de Oro City, which has an ordinance allowing “habal-habal,” Gardiola said. Thus, Angkas, MoveIt and JoyRide can each deploy up to 21,000 drivers, or a total of 63,000.  While the TWG still rejects “multihoming,” in which any rider can register and switch between multiple platforms, Gardiola said the group would put in place a “redistribution provision” that allowed any operator to take on the slots that the others could not fill. Only MoveIt has yet to fill its 10,000 slots. ‘Harmonious discussion’These concessions, Gardiola said, were hammered out during a “harmonious discussion” presided over by Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade after senators called on the official to reconsider his approval of the TWG recommendation to terminate the three-month test run, the second and final leg for Angkas but a first for MoveIt and JoyRide. Several lawmakers and commuter groups objected to the TWG recommendation, expressing concern that the interagency body flexed its muscles to force Angkas, a wildly popular service, to withdraw all its cases against the 10,000 cap. Angkas spokesperson George Royeca said the company had withdrawn both petitions for writ of preliminary injunction in the Mandaluyong and Quezon City courts as of Wednesday, as it “heeded the opinions of senators and the congressmen” who had wanted it to find common ground with regulators. “The cases were meant to show grievance on one of the conditions in the TWG guidelines and that’s what it was for and not for anything else. We are now in support of collaboration,’’ Royeca said. “We spoke with the Secretary [Tugade] yesterday. Everybody is involved and everybody wants to make it work for the riding community.”  In turn, the TWG lifted the threat of blacklisting Angkas for supposedly defying several provisions of the ad hoc body’s guidelines, Gardiola said. “Actually the blacklisting is not even directed at one player,” he said. The crackdown, Gardiola said, was also aimed at targeting fly-by-night outfits that offer motorcycle taxis unsafe on the road. But, the TWG’s recommendation submitted to Tugade’s office clearly singled out Angkas and its parent corporation, DBDOYC Inc., should a law be enacted to allow bikes-for-hire. On Wednesday, however, the two camps appeared ready to move on, with the TWG expressing openness to allowing motorcycle taxis to continue operating after the test ends on March 23. “Hopefully, we can get the success of the pilot for the necessary law to be passed,” Royeca said. In hindsight, he said, Angkas’ legal battle with the TWG was a ”testament to how good our democracy is.” “Everyone came together: you had the judiciary, you had the legislative, the people, the executive and the private sector all coming together despite all differences,” Royeca said. “It may not always be a straight line but we won’t stop because we do this for the people.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1063208/despite-scs-tro-angkas-to-continue-operations","title":"Despite SC’s TRO, Angkas to continue operations","date":"01:05 PM December 14, 2018","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The management of Angkas said Friday they will continue giving motorcycle rides to commuters even after the Supreme Court (SC) overruled a lower court’s decision that previously disallowed government from interfering in the ride-sharing app’s operations.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The management of Angkas said Friday they will continue giving motorcycle rides to commuters even after the Supreme Court (SC) overruled a lower court’s decision that previously disallowed government from interfering in the ride-sharing app’s operations. Angkas Spokesperson George Royeca said in a press briefing the SC decision never deemed Angkas as something legal or illegal, thus, the company believes they are still allowed to operate.  “Tuloy po ang pagbabyahe ngayon.  Let me reiterate lang po ang TRO po galing sa Korte Suprema ay ukol po sa injunction na na-grant ng RTC (Regional Trial Court),” Royeca told reporters in a venue near the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) office in Quezon City. “So wala pong desisyon tungkol sa Angkas na pagiging ilegal o legal sa daan,” he added.  And despite orders from the LTFRB to arrest riders and impound Angkas motorcycles, the ride-hailing firm vowed to support their riders, especially as some use it as their main source of income. “Angkas has always been here to support its riding community.  So we will support all of our bikers to the extent of the law,” he explained.  “Kung ano po ang kailangan nating gawin para mailigtas yung ating biker, gagawin po natin, basta po nasa batas.  So if it is paying fines, anything around that […] tutulungan po namin ang mga bikers natin,” he added. Last December 5, the SC issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to “prevent an injustice against petitioners (LTFRB) whose regulatory powers were being pared down”. Following the SC’s TRO, law enforcers from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) started flagging down Angkas riders, who can easily be spotted through their helmets which bear the app’s name and brand. According to Royeca, Angkas will file its comments to SC’s ruling, hopeful the high court would favor their side. “We hope that we can still continue to serve the riding public, we hope that our 25,000 biker-riders would still be able to take care of their families, especially now that it is Christmas time,” Royeca said.  “We still remain very hopeful that the Supreme Court will see the merits of Angkas and hopefully will rule in our favor,” he added./kga RELATED STORIES SC temporarily stops Angkas operations LTFRB says traffic enforcers start apprehending Angkas drivers Several Angkas drivers already apprehended — LTFRB"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1204247/angkas-protests-ltfrbs-10000-biker-cap-sunday-rally-set","title":"Angkas protests LTFRB’s 10,000 biker cap; Sunday rally set","date":"07:48 PM December 21, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas will hold a demonstration Sunday against the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to limit the number of its bikers next year.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas will hold a demonstration Sunday against the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to limit the number of its bikers next year. “RALLY KA, GHORL? #SaveAngkas,” the public transport firm posted on Facebook.

De Leon said they expected the evaluation report to be submitted this week, with days to go before the culmination of the pilot test on Dec. 26. He refused to give a definite answer on whether the pilot test would be extended, pending the results of the evaluation report and Tugade’s final approval.  The Inquirer is aware of four bikes-for-hire services raring to enter the market: Joyride, Habals Inc., Sampa and i-Sabay. But Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Technical Division Chief Joel Bolanos said in a television interview that they had received six applications from bike-hailing services. Sampa, i-Sabay and Joyride are already in various stages of operability. Earlier, Joyride vice president for corporate affairs Noli Eala confirmed that they had asked the DOTr to allow them to join the dry run. Angkas, which has been lobbying to extend the pilot test beyond the holiday season when traffic is expected to worsen, welcomed its possible extension.  In a statement on Sunday, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said he was grateful “that the government [was] seriously considering extending the test run for Angkas.” “It’s heartwarming to see that so many of our Filipino commuters support our service and have openly expressed their wish for Angkas to continue serving the public,”he added. According to Royeca, Angkas is open to “other competitors and grateful that many are now supporting motorcycle taxis” although he hopes they will also adhere to the same standards that the ride-hailing app has maintained throughout its operations. Angkas’ current accident rate is 0.003 percent, but the details of its actual safety record have yet to be disclosed to the public. To pave the way for motorcycles to be used as PUVs, however, Congress must first amend the law."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/310868/angkas-card-in-lapu-to-be-applied-online-put-on-hold","title":"Angkas card in Lapu to be applied online put on hold","date":"May 17,2020 - 02:49 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — After announcing that Lapu-Lapu City was under general community quarantine, Mayor Junard “Ahong” Chan reminded the Oponganons that they would still have to follow the guidelines given by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF-MEID) as they would start to allow some establishments to operate again and allow workers to go back to work.

Angkas operations head David Medrana said Thursday that aside from re-training their drivers, Angkas would introduce new vests and helmets. He said the new reflectorized vest would also contain the ID number of the Angkas driver “for additional visibility.” It will have side straps for passengers to hold on to during the ride.  “Since maraming passengers ang ayaw yumakap, nag-create na kami ng vest na mayroong hawakan sa side para doon na hahawak si passenger natin,” Medrana said in a press conference in Manila. (Since many passengers do not want to hug [the driver during the ride], we’ve added side straps to the vest.)  Medrana explained that it will be easy to identify the driver if he or she is involved in wrongdoing or in an accident through the reflectorized vest that also contains the driver’s ID number. Angkas has started re-training its drivers this month and has so far trained 12,000 of its riders. It hopes to finish the other 15,000 before the start of the pilot run. READ: Angkas re-training 15,000 drivers, eyes pilot run by end of June Angkas regulatory and public affairs head George Royeca said the focus of the pilot run is the safety as well as the education of passengers. “In the next couple of weeks, you’ll be seeing a lot of marketing collaterals and materials coming from Angkas para po i-push ‘yung ating (to push our) passenger-safety campaign,” Royeca said in the press conference.  “Ito pong kampanya, naka-emphasize po ‘yung safety ng pasahero para turuan ‘yung pasahero para maging co-rider at maging responsibilidad ng parehong pasahero at biker ang pagiging ligtas sa daan,” he added. (This campaign is meant to emphasize passenger safety and to train them to be a responsible co-rider.) No fare hike Despite the additional safety features, Angkas assured that its fares would remain the same. “Wala pong magbabago sa pamasahe ng Angkas (There will be no changes in the price structure). It will still be P50 for the first two kilometers and P10 per additional kilometer,” Royeca said. Last month, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) approved the pilot operations of motorcycle taxis in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu for six months starting June. The DOTr said it would use the six-month period to assess the level of safety of motorcycle taxis, their drivers’ discipline, and the overall experience of passengers. In 2017, the department tried to stop Angkas operations, arguing that two-wheeled vehicles are prohibited from being used as public utility vehicles under Republic Act No. 4316 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.

Avid commuters in Metro Cebu, where the test run for motorcycle taxis has continued today, expressed their support for the return of the motor taxis. Two workmates of a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company at the IT Park in Barangay Apas told CDN Digital that they are thankful for the return of the Angkas motortaxis because they now have another option to use when they return home from their 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. shifts. “Dako kaayo nang tabang kay siempre, book nalang ko segurado na makauli basta di lang mag-ulan,” said the BPO worker who asked for anonymity. So far, the Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTO-7), the main agency monitoring the operations of Angkas said there have been no complaints yet on their first day back. The LTO-7 will be monitoring their operations, implementation of health protocols, and the reports of customers regarding their operations. LTO-7 Director Victor Caindec assured that the Angkas have been inspected prior to their operations including the setting up of health protocols for the drivers. The Angkas has been given provisional permits to operate by the Technical Working Group (TWG) as part of the continuation of the pilot testing which means that no new players are allowed to ply the streets and the registered drivers in the past are the only ones allowed to operate. “Bisag wala sila girequire nagbutang og shield atong mga Angkas. Ang mga drivers ila pud gihangyo ang kada pasahero nga magsuot og helmet cap para iwas sa spread sa virus,” said Caindec in a phone interview with CDN Digital. The regional director reminded the drivers that they have a huge responsibility for the health and safety of their passengers and urged them to follow both traffic rules and health protocols. Customers are urged to report any erring drivers as this will be an integral part of the LTO-7’s report to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) at the end of the pilot testing, which will be determined by the national agency. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in Central Visayas (LTFRB-7) on the other hand, noted that there has not been a lot of riders going out on the first day. LTFRB-7 Director Eduardo Montealto, Jr., told CDN Digital that so far no complaints have reached them from both commuters and other franchised public utility vehicle (PUV) operators. The LTFRB-7 will be assisting LTO-7 in making the reports to DOTr on the pilot testing of motorcycle taxis, and LTFRB-7 will focus on Angkas’ role in the ecosystem of public transportation. This means they will focus on the impact of motorcycle taxis on the overall demand for public transport in Metro Cebu, how they compete with the other public utilities, and how they can be improved. “Ato gyong imonitor ilang operations labi na kung naay reklamo ang mga commuters, dapat moreport sila namo or sa LTO,” said Montealto. Montealto warns Angkas that the two transportation agencies in the region will be closely monitoring their operations and should they prove to be more disruptive than helpful, this will be reflected in their report to DOTr. Both Caindec and Montealto are encouraging the drivers to be always careful and prioritize the safety of their passengers.  /rcg"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/118208/angkas-and-the-business-of-sharing","title":"Angkas and the business of sharing","date":"05:10 AM December 16, 2018","snippet":"If the objection to Angkas, the motorcycle ride-sharing transport network whose operation has recently been ordered suspended, is that the service it offers is not safe and secure, then we may as well ban riding tandem itself, and revoke the licenses that had been given to other ride-sharing networks.","body":"If the objection to Angkas, the motorcycle ride-sharing transport network whose operation has recently been ordered suspended, is that the service it offers is not safe and secure, then we may as well ban riding tandem itself, and revoke the licenses that had been given to other ride-sharing networks. Let’s unpack these objections carefully. First, do two-wheel motor vehicles pose more danger to their riders and passengers than four-wheel vehicles? The answer may seem obvious: Two wheels don’t have the same stability as four wheels, and, therefore, are more dangerous. But, as a motorcycle rider myself, I have to disagree. I think a lot depends on driver experience, and on the inculcation in the general public of a road-sharing ethic.  Angkas riders who are trained to carry passengers on a regular basis are surely no less experienced than the average biker in negotiating Metro Manila’s crowded streets. Indeed, I imagine they would be safer drivers than the typical solo biker who might occasionally take a friend or family member as passenger. On the other hand, the objection regarding security (e.g., the danger of being held up or abducted) would equally apply to ride-sharing networks that use cars instead of motorbikes. In fact, such danger also lurks more or less equally in taxis, jeepneys, or buses. Come to think of it, it’s probably easier to jump off a motorcycle than from a taxi or a jeepney if one’s security is threatened.  Lastly, the law prohibiting the use of two-wheel vehicles as public utility vehicles may be there, but we have yet to hear of habal-habal drivers being arrested or prevented from plying their routes in remote upland areas where these modified motorbikes (that can take a dozen passengers) are the only means of public transport available. Here we go citing laws that were crafted long before the concept of a “sharing economy” entered the world of business. If we could reinterpret those laws to accommodate entities like Uber and Grab, which, strictly speaking, are not public transport companies that own and operate fleets of vehicles, why can’t the same adaptation be made to allow the local ride-sharing network Angkas to operate legally? I believe that what’s important, in the final analysis, is that someone can be held accountable when accidents happen. If they have the same driver and passenger insurance provisions as those found in the other transport networks, there should be no further reason to stop Angkas riders from offering their services to the commuting public.  That said, I believe it’s important to revisit the original idea that inspired the formation of the successful pioneering entities in the sharing economy — like Airbnb and Uber. This may help guide our legislators in designing new laws that would prevent the idea of sharing from being totally engulfed by the commercial twin with which it made its appearance in the market economy. The idea was simple enough. Some people have things that are in excess of what they personally need — living space, space in their vehicles, time on their hands, books and similar resources they have accumulated, etc. They may not be prepared to donate these to the government or any public entity, but, given the opportunity to do so, they might gladly share these with others, expecting almost nothing in return. Thus, we have carpooling, where neighbors take turns bringing and picking up their children to and from school, instead of each parent waking up every day to bring their child to school, or paying for school bus service. Outside the campus of every big university in the United States and Europe, one would often find the most marvelous secondhand bookshops. Rather than gather dust and use up precious space in cramped student apartments, these books are sold to booksellers for a pittance, and are in turn sold back to other students for just a little more.  That, too, is a form of sharing, but with a small difference — someone, in this case, the secondhand bookseller, manages the exchange. Airbnb and Uber take off basically from the same hybrid concept.  An entity is formed that manages the exchange of gifts among the participants and creates and maintains the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. For this, a small fee is collected. Ideally, there’s supposed to be no exchange of money among the participants in the sharing network. The fee that is collected should be just enough to compensate the employees of the network and take care of incidental expenses. Homeowners who let travelers use a spare room are content to collect a small fee for laundry and electricity and be rewarded by the friendship and gratitude they reap as hosts. Travelers get to enjoy virtually free accommodation with a dose of personal hospitality, instead of staying in impersonal high-priced hotels.  Regretfully, the spirit of sharing has been overshadowed by profit-making. Venture capitalists saw the potential of monetizing the spirit of gift-giving, and invested heavily in the new companies. This drove the sharing economy to become as grasping in its quest for returns as the conventional capitalism it sought to replace. The participants themselves soon dropped the veneer of sharing. Individual car owners were soon replaced by greedy entrepreneurs that bought fleets of vehicles intended for use in the Uber or Grab networks.  And, big landlords owning several houses began to edge out small homeowners who had initially networked with Airbnb. We must learn from these sad experiences as we search for new models of sharing in a world that seems bent on monetizing everything we value. public.lives@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/275638/angkas-teaches-ph-to-ride-a-bike","title":"Angkas teaches PH to ride a bike","date":"05:01 AM July 28, 2019","snippet":"While it has been an on-again, off-again relationship between the Philippines’ streets and motorbike ride-hailing service Angkas, the company is now back serving everyday commuters—at least for a few months, as recently ordered by the Department of Transportation (DOTr)—and is also more determined to educate riderson proper road safety precautions, awareness of which is still lacking in many parts of the country, says Angkas CEO Angeline Tham.“People in the provinces [still think] it’s baduy to wear a helmet, it’s not cool,” Tham says. “Which is crazy, since it’s the single most important piece of safety equipment when riding a motorbike.”","body":"While it has been an on-again, off-again relationship between the Philippines’ streets and motorbike ride-hailing service Angkas, the company is now back serving everyday commuters—at least for a few months, as recently ordered by the Department of Transportation (DOTr)—and is also more determined to educate riderson proper road safety precautions, awareness of which is still lacking in many parts of the country, says Angkas CEO Angeline Tham.“People in the provinces [still think] it’s baduy to wear a helmet, it’s not cool,” Tham says. “Which is crazy, since it’s the single most important piece of safety equipment when riding a motorbike.” She adds that this mentality is mostly because of lack of safety education, which many motorcycle drivers don’t have access to.  Citing survey data from Social Weather Stations, Tham says one out of three Filipino families owns a motorcycle, and that 50 percent depend on it for their livelihood. Most of them come from low-income households. “This means they have no formal training [on how to use a motorbike],” Tham adds.  She further laments the lack of institutions that provide such formal training, saying she knows of only one in Metro Manila. The three basic rules of motorcycle-riding—to always wear a helmet; don’t modify your bike; and take only one passenger with you—are also still not commonly known among Filipinos, she adds.  Angkas began operations in 2017, but voluntarily suspended service in the same year as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it violated Republic Act No. 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which banned two-wheeled vehicles from being used as public transport. In September 2018, Angkas returned to the streets after the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from interfering with the company’s operations. However, in December that same year, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on the lower court’s ruling, thus forcing Angkas to, once again, suspend operations—an order that Angkas riders defied. Due to public demand, the DOTr recently allowed a six-month test run of motorcycle taxis, which includes Angkas, to prove that it is, indeed, a safe mode of public transportation. Tham has expressed her gratitude for the ruling, and assures the public that Angkas has been doing its part in making sure that safety is top priority among their drivers. In fact, she says the company has even extended its training to riders who aren’t on their platform by conducting workshops in coordination with certain local government units, all in the name of education on motorcycle riding safety.  Tham says the company’s focus is to continue empowering motorcycle drivers in the country by giving them a voice through their platform. “If you look at Metro Manila, you would think that the Philippines is a car country. But if you look at research, there are only 1.5 million registered cars in the Philippines, 50 percent of which are in Metro Manila; the other half are spread out across provinces. Compare that to LTO’s (Land Transportation Office) data—there are five million registered bikes here in the Philippines. There is around an equal amount of motorbikes in Metro Manila, and the rest are spread out. But unofficial reports say there are around 14 million bikes, and LTO tells us there are around 800,000 to one million bikes added every year,” she says. “But we’re not minding them as much—why? There are statistics from government that say 50 percent of all accidents involve a motorcycle—I’m not surprised, given the way we use them. And this is what we want to change in Angkas. We give them insurance, helmets; we make sure they follow the rules. That’s what we’re changing, one biker at a time,” Tham adds. It all sounds ironic once we learn that Tham hasn’t learned yet how to ride a motorbike herself. A former banker, Tham, who hails from Singapore, says she started Angkas mainly as an entrepreneurial pursuit after her experience setting up Grab Bike and Grab Express here in the Philippines. Now, however, Angkas is both business and advocacy to this mother of one. “Joining Angkas can be very powerful for a biker and his/her family. They can supplement a full-time job, or plan their day around their work. I know of people taking up higher education courses who have put themselves through school thanks to Angkas, whereas normally they would have to stop working to do so,” she says. A driver can make up to P1,500 a day—which requires more than 10 trips—if they are on Angkas full time, P800 a day, if part time. The platform now has 20,000 drivers in its network, and operates in Metro Manila, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos. And it wants to do more. “We’re open to working with all government agencies that are aligned with us in [achieving] this common goal of making roads safer in the Philippines, and giving pride and dignity to those with two-wheeled vehicles,” she says."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/283400/blacklisting-angkas-ceo-to-spook-foreign-investors-lawmaker-warns","title":"Blacklisting Angkas CEO to spook foreign investors, lawmaker warns","date":"January 23,2020 - 04:48 PM","snippet":"","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos on Thursday rejected a fellow lawmaker’s proposal to declare as persona non grata the Singaporean chief operating officer (CEO) of motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, as it might scare away foreign investors. “Well nagulat ako ng konti kasi siyempre ayaw natin ng ganun, kung yung mga foreign investor bina-blacklist natin o ipe-persona non grata, baka wala nang pumasok sa Pilipinas.

Pimentel filed the resolution on January 16, 2020 or days before Angkas said it would drop its court case against the Department of Transportation (DOTr) technical working group which is conducting a pilot study on the operation of motorcycle taxis. “Tignan natin kung papano. Kung naglabag sila e di ayusin nila. We are now in the process of negotiating. LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) is now talking to all the players and the stakeholders,” Marcos said. Ownership issues One of the things Pimentel had pointed out in his resolution was that Tham initially owned 99.996 percent of Angkas, which he said was a violation of the Philippines’ ownership laws. Angkas’ chief transport advocate George Royeca, however, already said issues on ownership have already been rectified, with him now owning 60 percent of the company. Marcos said the Senate should also look into the ownership of all the ride-hailing firms participating in the government’s pilot program for motorcycle taxis. “I think in the entire process, you should be transparent…Ang LTFRB na dapat ang magsusuri ng lahat yan. Pero sa palagay ko let’s open the playing field. Let’s level it, wala nang palakasan at alamin natin kung sino talaga yung beneficial owner ng bawat isa,” Marcos said.

Let’s level it, no more ‘palakasan’ system and we should know for sure who is the beneficial owner of all the companies). Pimentel was earlier  linked to another transport app company, JoyRide PH. This after JoyRide executives addressed allegations that came out in social media that the senator had extended a letter of the company to Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade to include its bid in the pilot test of motorcycle taxis. Pimentel admitted he endorsed JoyRide’s letter join the first pilot test run for motorcycle taxis, saying there was a need to diminish a climate of monopoly in the blossoming motorcycle ride-hailing industry.

Even for someone as punctual as TNT forward Kelly Williams, who has never been late coming into a game throughout his 12-year career, his time was up.  As if traffic along C-5 Road in Taguig City wasn’t already horrible as it is, what made things worse on Wednesday night was a fire that razed a residential area around the time when Williams was on his way to Araneta Coliseum in Cubao coming from his home in Alabang for a 7 p.m. game against Blackwater.

Fortunately for Williams, his driver offered an idea that may not be ideal for the 6-foot-6 PBA star but was too hard to pass up.  “My driver said check Angkas, an Uber for motorcycles. Okay. Quickly got out of the car in the middle of the C5, the middle of traffic, found this guy under the overpass, he was surprised to see me. I got my helmet on, jumped on the bicycle and we got here for about 40 minutes,” said the chiseled Williams smiling. “Every stoplight, the other motorcycles pull up, double take, “Oh, what are you doing here?” “Hi guys!” It was fun, it was actually pretty fun but never again, make sure you plan ahead guys if you possibly get stuck in traffic. But it was a good experience for me. You get to see Manila in a different light. It was fun.” The 35-year-old Williams said he was getting desperate at that time and had even thought about crazy ways just to get to the game on time. “Anything. I considered running, I considered jogging. Whatever you got to do, crawl, walk or run. It was a good experience though, thank you to the cyclist. I think his name is Richard or something like that, he’s a lifesaver,” said Williams, who arrived at the Big Dome midway through the first quarter. Williams has had a colorful career, having won the PBA title six times and an MVP award plus several All-Star selections, but there was nothing like surviving the ride of his life.  “It’s just a comical situation, I’ve never done that in my entire career or been late like that for a game. But you know, 1 in 12 or 13 years isn’t bad, I’ll take it. It’s a good experience, fun,” he said.

Police Lieutenant Colonel John Kareen Escober, Pardo Police chief, said in an interview at Cebu City Hall that Joel Apor, 40, of Barangay Kinasang-an, Cebu City might have been shot dead because of a personal grudge. The victim’s wife told Escober that the day before (December 5), Apor had an argument allegedly with an Angkas driver in Panagdait Road in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City. Escober said that this was the most significant incident leading to the shooting because it happened a day before the killing.

I will be making an appeal to the Supreme Court on behalf of the riding public,” said Osmeña in a press conference on Tuesday (December 18). Last December 5, the Supreme Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) stopping the effect of a decision made by the Mandaluyong City Court that would allow Angkas to operate despite objections from transport sector regulators including the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The LTFRB had earlier filed a case against Angkas, asking the court to suspend its operations because of the lack of a franchise to operate a public transport system. Angkas, however, did not wait for any court decision and instead, voluntarily stopped its motorcycle-for-hire operations. In resolving the case in favor of Angkas, the Mandaluyong City court said there was no specific law prohibiting motorcycles from being used as public transport and prohibited the LTFRB from interfering with the operations of Angkas. LTFRB appealed to the Supreme Court, which resulted to the issuance of a TRO, just four months after Angkas resumed its operations. Public Osmeña reiterated that the TRO has made it more difficult for people to travel especially those living in the mountain barangays. “The habal-habal drivers already have their own legal case. I will be making an appeal on behalf of the riding public, which is really the real people suffering,” said Osmeña. “They are the highest priority,” he added. He also said that the decision is creating unrest and destabilization in areas where public transportation is limited. This gnawing problem of lack of public transportation pushed the mayor to bring the case to the SC in the hope of bringing back the operations of Angkas and other habal-habal drivers. “The prognosis, clearly, is that it is not healthy. Do you expect the students to walk? We don’t really need this kind of problem,” said Osmeña. Habal-habal support The appeal is just one of the ways Osmeña shows his support for the habal-habal industry, since the arguments arose on whether the habal-habal is a legal form of transportation. Last Dec. 13, Osmeña posted on his Facebook account that the suspension of the habal-habal drivers will seriously affect almost 30 mountain barangays in Cebu City, which despite belonging to a highly urbanized city, still suffer from the shortage of public transport. He said the city is allocating an additional budget of P200 million for the commissioning of free buses to transport passengers living in these mountain barangays. Last Monday, the City Council approved, during a special session, a P15 million allocation for a rice subsidy for 6,000 registered habal-habal drivers in Cebu City. The city is targeting to distribute all the emergency rice assistance before the end of December. The funds for the rice assistance will be taken from the city’s share from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor). Francisco “Bimbo” Fernandez, executive assistant to the mayor, said the mayor will issue an Executive Order (EO) as soon as possible to determine how to distribute the sacks of rice to the registered drivers. “The EO will cover how much and when we will order the rice from the NFA (National Food Authority), how to validate the registered drivers, and how to distribute the sacks of rice to the drivers,” said Fernandez. Fernandez said that the EO is necessary to regulate the distribution of the sacks of rice and to make sure that they are received by the proper beneficiaries. Osmeña said that the city already organized the habal-habal drivers in the barangays so that they can be registered with the city and be qualified as beneficiaries. “They told me it’s fiscally impossible. We have to make a mechanism, give them a ticket or something so that the drivers can claim their sack somewhere. We are going to try to rush it,” said Osmeña. ‘Politics’ Osmeña also dismissed the claims of the opposition that the emergency rice subsidy for the habal-habal drivers was a political ploy to boost his candidacy in the May 2019 elections. “That’s so unfair. I did not ask the Supreme Court to make that decision. When you help people who are suffering, they say it’s politics. If they accuse you of not helping people, they also call it politics. We are just helping people,” he said. “That’s their mindset that all of these is just politics. All I see are the habal-habal drivers who are affected,” he added. Legal battle The Supreme Court order is the latest episode in the legal battle between DBDOYC Inc., the company that owns the Angkas app, and the government agencies which insist that motorcycles for hire are unsafe as public transport. In a statement issued last December 13, Angkas said it would continue “our fight to serve commuters in a safe and efficient manner, as well as legitimizing our riders.” “We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will eventually rule in favor of the Filipino riding public,” the statement read. According to Angkas, the TRO will affect the livelihood of 25,000 biker-partners “a few days before Christmas, when their families need it the most.”"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/141377/how-safe-is-angkas","title":"How safe is Angkas?","date":"July 29,2017 - 10:53 PM","snippet":"","body":"GERARD Patrick Apurado needed to be at his workplace by 11 a.m. at Mactan Island, Lapu-Lapu City. Since he was not able to take the company’s shuttle ride after he woke up at 9 a.m., he opted to take Angkas, the newest motorcycle ride booking service in Cebu. “Taxi was not in my option because of the heavy traffic in Mandaue City. Then I remember that there’s this application “Angkas” where you get to book a biker and pick a destination,” Apurado told Cebu Daily News. Apurado, 25, a pastry chef, took a ride from their home in Barangay Capitol Site in Cebu City to Plantation Bay Resort and Spa at Mactan Island, Lapu-Lapu City, which is a distance of 19.1 kilometers. He arrived in his destination after 45 minutes and paid P238. Had he taken a taxi, he would have been on the road for two hours and have to pay from P350 to P400. He also finds Angkas motorcycles safer than habal-habal (motorcycle taxi) since the former offers free face mask and a helmet for its passengers.More importantly, there is also no need to negotiate fare since fare rates are fixed by the Angkas app prior to confirming a ride. ‘It’s safe’ For medical intern John Marlyx Dumas, 26, Angkas is a safer and cheaper option to habal-habal. Dumas booked an Angkas ride from General Maxilom Avenue to his home in Urgello Street, Barangay Sambag I, Cebu City, which is a distance of 2.2 kilometers. He paid P37 for his fare, or just a little over half of the P60 to P70 he usually paid for a habal-habal ride. Since Angkas riders are provided with helmets, Dumas said he felt safe. Moreover, details of the driver like name and number would appear in the application. “Mo-obey sad sila og traffic rules and careful sad sila sa pag-drive. Courteous kaayo sila and mo-text sila and magpaila na sila ang driver and kung hapit na moabot sa ilang pick-up point,” Dumas added. (They obey traffic rules and they are careful when they drive. They are courteous and they will text and introduce themselves and inform you if they are close to the pickup point.) ‘It’s unsafe’ But for Lawyer Ariel Inton Jr., former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member and founder of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection (LSCP), Angkas is unsafe for commuters. Among the reasons cited by Inton is that Angkas is operating without accreditation from LTFRB. “They are not registered Transport Network Company (TNC). Angkas and Wunder (Carpool) were told by LTFRB to stop their operations, but they did not follow,” Inton added. Since Angkas is not yet registered, Inton urged the LTFRB to regulate them for safer ride of the commuters. He pointed out that under the newly signed Department Order number 2017-011 or the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services and Franchise Issuance, motorcycles are not allowed as public transport conveyance. “Commuters choose speed over safety. Since mabilis ang motor, they will go for speed and sacrifice safety because of the traffic or other circumstances,” Inton said.

In a privilege speech during the first regular session of the city council for 2019 this afternoon, January 8, Councilor Pastor “Jun” Alcover Jr. claimed that it was “politics” that motivated Cebu City Representatives Raul del Mar (North District) and Rodrigo “Bebot” Abellanosa (South District) to file House Bill No. 6049, which proposes to recognize habal-habal as a legal mode of public transporation and to grant Angkas a franchise to operate. “I have nothing against legalizing habal-habal. In fact, I pushed a similar proposal before the House (of Representatives) in 2012. What I am against is the legalization of Angkas, a business entity, and misleading the public to think Angkas and habal-habal is one,” Alcover said in Cebuano. “Politics is dictating them to file this bill,” he added. Both Del Mar and Abellanosa are  allies of Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña under the local political party Bando Osmeña Pundok Kauswagan (BOPK). Alcover, who is allied with the opposition Partido Barug, also said that the Lower House during the 15th Congress of the Philippines apparently ignored the same proposal he authored in 2012 in his capacity as partylist representative of the Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy (ANAD). “Congressmen before did not pay attention to my proposal, House Bill No. 6046, or anything related to habal-habal. Because back then, it was not controversial. I only got one support from Congressman Ace Durano (Cebu fifth district),” recalled Alcover. The councilor earlier slammed Osmeña’s plans to engage in a legal battle  favoring the operation of the beleaguered Angkas, whose operation has been suspended by the Supreme Court based on a petition filed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) that questioned a lower court’s decision that upheld the operation of Angkas. A proposed resolution authorizing Osmeña to represent the Cebu City Government in an appeal to be filed before the Supreme Court (SC), which would pray for the lifting of  the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) that effectively suspended the operations of  Angkas, is expected to be discussed in the council’s regular session today."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/208974/angkas-files-motion-to-lift-tro-suspending-its-operations","title":"Angkas files motion to lift TRO suspending its operations","date":"December 21,2018 - 11:41 AM","snippet":"","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-sharing company Angkas has filed before the Supreme Court (SC) an urgent motion to lift the temporary restraining order (TRO) which effectively bars them from operating. In the motion filed last December 13, DBDOYC, Inc. that owns Angkas said the lifting would not only help the traffic problem in the metropolis but also aide riders who rely on Angkas for their livelihood. “With the Christmas season upon us, the traffic situation in Metro Manila is bound to worsen with helpless and hapless commuters having to suffer limited options.  Worse, the scepter of jobs being lost by thousands of Angkas drivers looms large,” Angkas said in the 26-page motion. “Private respondent most respectfully implores the Honorable Court to consider such deleterious consequences in taking a second hard look at the TRO it had issued,” it added. Angkas noted that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which acted as petitioners, would not be on the losing end if the TRO is lifted. “In contrast, it is clear that petitioners will not suffer any injury or damage if the TRO is lifted.  As the Court of last resort, it is hoped that it will not turn a blind eye to the harshness of the outcomes the TRO will lead to,” they said. Aside from filing a motion, Angkas also complied with the SC order to comment on LTFRB’s petition. Last December 5, the SC issued a TRO against the preliminary injunction from the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 213, which prevented the LTFRB from meddling in Angkas operations.

In a post on his official Facebook page, Osmeña announced that he has tapped the help of his political allies in the House of Representatives, Rep. Raul del Mar (Cebu City North District) and Rodrigo “Bebot” Abellanosa (Cebu City-South District), to push for the legalization of Angkas. “I have spoken to Raul and Bebot, and the two Congressmen of BOPK (Bando Osmeña Pundok Kauswagan) will move to fullylegalize Angkas,” said Osmeña. “Just because something is illegal doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Slavery was once legal and the aiding of escaped slaves was once illegal. The law is not perfect, which is why it is subject to change,” he added. The decision to tap his allies in Congress was on top of his plan to ask the city council to grant him an authority to file in the name of the Cebu City government an appeal before the Supreme Court (SC), on behalf of the riding public, to lift the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) it issued against the operation of Angkas. The city government is now also processing the distribution of sacks of rice to all 6,000 habal-habal (motorcycle-for-hire) drivers affected by the SC decision to suspend Angkas’ operations. Osmeña has been expressing his concern not only for the habal-habal drivers but also for the riding public since the High Court issued a TRO based on the petition filed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) against Angkas on the ground that Angkas should secure a congressional franchise before it could operate. The LTFRB and DOTr went to the Supreme Court to question the decision of a Mandaluyong City regional trial court (RTC) that granted the writ of preliminary injunction that was sought by Angkas. The RTC’s injunction allowed Angkas to resume operation last August. But after the SC released the TRO on December 5, enforcers from LTFRB and Land Transportation Office (LTO) were immediately ordered by the SC to apprehend Angkas drivers who continued to accept passengers. Last December 13, Angkas filed before the SC an urgent motion to lift the TRO. Wrong “It is wrong for ordinary hardworking people to be turned into criminals. If Angkas and other ride-sharing services are illegal, then they should be made legal. The law should adjust to people’s needs. The law is designed to serve the people. The people obey, but do not serve, the law,” said Osmeña. The mayor’s recent decision to ask help from Cebu City’s congressmen stemmed from a Facebook comment made by an Angkas driver identified as Jayson Labor Comedia who feared losing his only means of income. “Mayor, Angkas driver ko. Nawagtangan najud mig panginabuhi… mora namig mga kriminal tago2x sa mga LTO, LTFRB ug I-ACT (Inter-Agency Council on Traffic) paita namo aning sitwasyona mayor oy,” Comedia said. (Mayor, I am an Angkas driver. We lost our livelihood and we felt like criminals trying to hide from LTO, LTFRB and I-ACT enforcers. Our situation is difficult mayor.) Underground Angkas also feared that their drivers may be forced to go underground — that is, become unregistered or “habal-habal” drivers — if the Supreme Court will not lift the TRO. George Royeca, head of Angkas regulatory and public affairs, said they feared that their drivers might return to the habal-habal operation since they could no longer monitor them. By monitoring, he meant keeping track of their trips and fees and of their safety – in case they get into an accident. “So I think the roads are actually more dangerous right now because a lot of these drivers have come back to habal-habal,” Royeca said in a press conference in Manila Saturday. That would result in a “state of lawlessness,” he said. “So basically we have zero control right now because of the decision,” he added. But Royeca said they remained “hopeful that the Supreme Court will find merit on our case.” According to Royeca, the temporarily suspension of its operations has affected 25,000 drivers nationwide. He also said that the directive of Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade might not directly affect the decision of the SC. On Friday, Tugade directed the formation of a technical working group (TWG) to study the feasibility of using motorcycles as public transportation “I don’t know if the whole TWG would directly or somewhat influence the decision, but I think where we should look at is the plight of the Fiilipinos,” Royeca said. The TWG will consist of LTO, LTFRB, Philippine National Police–Highway Patrol Group, and Metro Manila Development Authority. Both houses of Congress — the Senate and the House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations, and law schools, will also be part of the TWG. /INQUIRER.NET"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/154929/new-life-angkas","title":"NEW LIFE FOR ANGKAS","date":"November 20,2017 - 11:18 PM","snippet":"","body":"Osmeña wants city to take over operation of motorcycle ride booking service to ease traffic Wisdom Lazaga wakes up at 5 a.m. on weekdays to avoid the gridlock during rush hour.But no matter how early he gets out of bed, the 23-year-old second-year Information Technology student of one of the universities in Cebu City would still come to class late at times even if his house in Barangay Pardo in Cebu City is ijust 7 kilometers from his school. “Grabe gyud kaayo ang traffic (The traffic is too much),” said Lazaga.He, however, found help in Angkas, a popular motorcycle ride booking service that started offering commuters an easy glide through the dense traffic in July 2017. Riding on one of the Angkas motorcycles cut down Lazaga’s travel time from at least an hour to less than 30 minutes.“Importante gyud kaayo ang Angkas. It’s just a click away. Safe siya. Gamit kaayo ilabi na sa rush hour. Walay overpricing, unya ang drivers duna gyuy professional license (Angkas is so important. It’s just a click away. It’s so useful especially during rush hour. There’s no overpricing, and the drivers have professional drivers’ licenses),” he said. But the convenience was temporary.Angkas officially suspended its operations last Saturday, a little over a week after transportation authorities temporarily shut it down for operating without a permit. As early as January this year, when Angkas started operating in Manila, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) already gave a warning that their operation was considered “colorum,” since they did not have the necessary franchise to operate. Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña earlier didn’t want to interfere until complaints started coming in, protesting the cancellation of Angkas’ operation. Now, the chief executive of Cebu City wants to take over Angkas’ operations. “Many people have been texting me about Angkas. Since Angkas is providing a real service to the public, the City Government will be studying how to take over Angkas’ operations by hiring their administrative personnel. We will provide Angkas’ service, hopefully using the current app. We will do this for free,” said Osmeña in his Facebook post. In a press conference, he further explained that the city will hire and adopt the company’s management services and use their online booking system. Since the city government is not capable of doing it, Osmeña said Angkas will have to provide the application.As soon as Angkas can provide the city with a proposal, he said it will soon act as  “dispatchers” of the motorcycles. Should the city hire Angkas’ services, Osmeña said the company will no longer get a share from the drivers’ earnings. The drivers will get 100 percent of their daily earnings, he said.“We will hire their consultancy services, but they (Angkas) will not collect from the drivers. Nobody will collect from the drivers,” he explained. In its previous arrangement, Angkas gets 20 percent from every booking of its riders. Osmeña stressed that he was accommodating Angkas for the Cebuanos and to help ease the worsening traffic situation. “Many people are asking to continue (the services of Angkas) and people have been pleading with me and I keep answering, ‘I’ll see what I can do.’ Maybe they think I am just paying lip service. No. I am serious. This is what the people want. This is what the people need,” he said. “Anything that has to do in providing services for the constituents of Cebu City, that is what I am concerned about,” he added. There are currently around 2,000 motorcycle drivers who are connected with Angkas. Osmeña said he is also planning to legalize and regulate the operations of habal-habal or motorcycle-for-hire drivers in the city. Ahmed Cuizon, LTFRB director in Central Visayas, said he had yet to get the full details about Osmeña’s plan to take over the operations of Angkas in the city. “I haven’t come across his statement yet. Why don’t I listen to it first and understand?” he told CDN over the phone.Cuizon said he also had to seek the guidance of their central office in Manila on the proposal of Osmeña.But he stressed that Angkas remains illegal since it has no authority to operate. “Like Uber and Grab, it (Angkas) needs authorization from LTFRB. Without that, they could not operate. That’s how it works. From the start, we believe that they (Angkas) lack the authority to operate,” Cuizon said. The LTFRB has repeatedly announced that Angkas’ operation is considered “colorum” as it has no authority to operate.Angkas does not fall under the transport network company category since the LTFRB could not issue franchises to two-wheeled vehicles. Under Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, motorcycles could not be used to transport passengers for a fee. Cebu Daily News tried but failed to reach Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas Director Alita Pulga through the phone on Monday. For now, the LTFRB has teamed up with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to provide livelihood opportunities for drivers who might find themselves without a job. “We understand that many of them depend on their (Angkas) operations for a living. So right now, LTFRB and DOLE are into talks on how to help these people. As soon as everything will be finalized (by our central office), it will cascade down to the regions,” Cuizon said. Two opposition Cebu City councilors, who are both lawyers, have reservations over the plan of Osmeña to take over Angkas’ operation. While he agreed that Angkas provides real services to the Cebuanos, Cebu City Councilor Raymond Alvin Garcia said the project must be studied further. “The government’s primary duty is to provide basic services to the community and not engage in a private business enterprise,” he said.Councilor Jocelyn “Joy” Pesquera shared the same sentiment. “I suggest that the City Legal Office study it considering that it will have implications if the drivers will collect fees,” she said."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/141381/angkas-anyone","title":"Angkas, anyone?","date":"July 29,2017 - 10:57 PM","snippet":"","body":" IT’S Friday-night rush hour, and there’s a pain-in-the-neck traffic standing between you and a couple of drink with your friends. Five or six years ago, this would have been the grounds to call it a night and head home, but with the advent of ride-hailing apps, things start to get better and more convenient. Now imagine breezing through traffic congestion, finding alternatives routes that no four-wheeled vehicle could pass through. With Angkas, you don’t need to stop at imagining. Available on both iOS and Android, Angkas is a motorcycle-hailing platform designed to provide access to fast, safe and affordable motorcycle transport. How it works Angkas is similar with booking a ride from Grab or Uber. Simply download the app, add your pick-up location and destination, and your biker will arrive shortly to bring you where you need to go. Cebu Daily News also took the chance to experience a ride, and without a doubt, a usual travel time of 30 minutes from Lapu-Lapu City to SM City Cebu only took 20 minutes, giving us ample time to relax before turning our game face. Becoming an operator Operators pass series of background checks before they can join Angkas, said Romelio Fernandez, a habal-habal driver-turned-Angkas operator. Background check, skills assessment programs and a three-month-long safety training will have to be taken before becoming an operator. About 300 motorcycles are now operating in Metro Cebu under Angkas. Fernandez said the app has enabled him to earn more and work depending on his availability. “The good thing about it (Angkas) you are your own boss, it is your own decision when to start taking passengers and when to call it a day,” said Fernandez. Safety is their top priority, said Fernandez. Since most riders are sensitive to dust and dirt, riders are equipped with helmets, a hair cap and a face mask upon taking a ride. Riders are also instructed on how to properly ride a motorcycle to avoid accidents. However, despite being told by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to stop their operations since the application is illegal and is risky for passengers, Fernandez said, “Why would they want to stop our operation when we are providing alternative options for riders in a safe way?” “We have always prioritized the safety of our passengers since day one, we do not overspeed,” he added. According to Fernandez, every ride comes with a P200,000 accident insurance for both the rider and the operator. And in the case of less-than-ideal weather conditions, they also provide riders with a raincoat. Fernandez said most of his riders are call center agents who work at IT Park. “When I started operating with Angkas, most of my riders were call center agents who were running late for their work” and wanted him to drive fast, said Fernandez. However, he said, Angkas drivers won’t drive beyond 60 kilometers per hour to avoid accidents. How the company earns According to Fernandez, before he could start taking passengers, operators will have to pay P300 for an Angkas load that is bought at their office in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City. Every operator has to consume the 300 load balance, which is equivalent to a 10-passenger-per-day mark, before they can reload and be hailed again using the app. Fernandez, who has been a habal-habal driver for three years now, said that even if he pays for the Angkas load, he still sees himself earning more than what he used to. Customers’ satisfaction matters to Angkas drivers, he added. “We provide our riders with helmet, hair cap and a face mask. But what’s nice about Angkas, you can see how much is the fare after placing your destination. But what makes it even better is that all the price are fixed,” he said. “Through the help of Google Map, our app can determine the distance between the rider’s pick up location and his destination,” Fernandez added.Each ride has a flag-down rate of P20 that is equivalent to a kilometer. The next kilometer cost P10. So beat the traffic! Just hail your self a motorcycle via your smartphone and be merrily on your way for that Friday night out with friends."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/211367/gabuya-reso-wants-tomas-to-appeal-scs-tro-vs-angkas","title":"Gabuya reso wants Tomas to appeal SC’s TRO vs Angkas","date":"January 08,2019 - 05:17 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines –A resolution authorizing Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña to appeal the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) the Supreme Court (SC) issued against the ride-hailing application Angkas was formally filed before the city council today, Tuesday (January 8, 2019). In the council’s first regular session for 2019, a proposed resolution was filed which grants Osmeña the authority to ask the SC to reconsider its decision of issuing a TRO that effectively suspended the operations of Angkas. The proposal, authored by Councilor Eugenio Gabuya Jr., tags Osmeña to represent the Cebu City Government. “The issuance of the Supreme Court puts the livelihood of 6,500 Angkas and habal-habal drivers in Cebu City at risk and deprives the commuters especially those from mountain barangays their only means of transportation,” Gabuya said in his resolution. “The city mayor, as chief executive of the city government, is empowered by the Local Government Code of 1991 to exercise such powers and perform such functions which may be deemed necessary for the efficient, effective, and economical governance the purpose of which is the general welfare of the city and its inhabitants such as to enhance the economic prosperity and social justice and to promote full employment among their residents,” he added.

Ex-officio Councilor Philip Zafra said the Angkas program was a welcome initiative, but the safety of passengers must be the prime consideration.“That (service of Angkas) is a logical thing to do for now amidst the demand for such kind of transportation brought by the worsening traffic congestion in the city. However, we should regulate them,” he said. Zafra, president of the Association of Barangay Councils-Cebu City Chapter, proposed that barangays be tasked to do the profiling of the motorcycle drivers. There are currently around 2,000 motorcycle drivers registered with Angkas. As soon as the barangay gets the necessary information on the motorcycle driver, Zafra said the driver would then be endorsed to the Cebu City Transportation Office (CCTO). “The driver would then be endorsed to CCTO to undergo traffic law seminar and orientation before he will be issued an ID,” he said. Mayor Tomas Osmeña had earlier announced that he would hire Angkas’ management services and adopt their online booking system. As soon as the company can submit their proposal to the city, the mayor said he will consider it as an emergency program. Osmeña also said that the national government has failed to address the concerns of the transport sector. With the program, he said, he will respond to the appeal of the affected riding public and regulate what is now considered illegal. Almost a year after Angkas was launched, it was declared illegal by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Delfin Adolfo of the Two-wheeled Motorized Vehicle Monitoring Coordination and Assistance Unit (TMV-MCAU) said they welcomed the development. He said it would help the drivers especially now that they are paralyzed by the decision of the LTFRB. “This is better. There will be no overpricing.

While bike-hailing is a fairly straightforward process, MoveIt has installed extra features to guarantee the safety of and continuous feedback from its drivers and passengers, said Eric Torres, operations mana­ger of the ride-hailing platform. For one, passengers can share their live location with friends and family who can track them while they’re on the ride, Torres said. MoveIt has also added a feedback mechanism in which drivers and passengers can rate each other. “That way,” Torres said, “we know how we perform, and we have a record also of how the customer was.” All the raw data will be fed directly to the multiagency Technical Working Group (TWG) during the three-month pilot test, which will run until March 23. “That’s the difference between the first and the exten­ded pilot test,” Torres said. The three-month test run is aimed at determining whether motorbikes are safe for public transport. There is big demand for motorcycle taxi service in Metro Manila where commuters often spend three to fours hours daily on the road while taking traditional public transport to get to work and home due to severe road congestion. As the names of its two competitors appear on the news, MoveIt busies itself with the prospect of entering a market long accustomed to and remarkably protective of Angkas, the country’s first motorcycle taxi service. The other newbie is JoyRide. “Of course, we need to make ourselves known to the riding public,” Torres said in an interview with the Inquirer. “The challenge like any other, is getting the right number of riders to run your fleet and then getting a good share of the customer base to take on your services.” Right now, around 1,414 drivers have joined MoveIt’s platform, which began initially as a parcel delivery service. Operating a fleet of motorcycle taxis has been among MoveIt’s goals since Trans-Serve Corp., its parent company, began in 2015, Torres said. But the firm had to shelve the service as bikes-for-hire are still banned under Philippine laws. So when the Department of Transportation announced the first pilot run in May, Torres said, MoveIt had expressed its intent to join. “But the department expressed pre­ference for one player for easier monitoring. We just respected that and we just focused on enhancing the app and preparing for parcel delivery.” Torres was confident that MoveIt, despite being a startup, could keep pace with its two other competitors, one of which has been in the running since 2017. The equalizer is the TWG guidelines, which provide a strict set of rules that the companies must follow. Of the guidelines, perhaps the most important requirement is to make sure that the drivers undergo a rigorous training process that not only assesses their navigation skills but also their ability to transport a “backrider” (passenger). For this, MoveIt has tapped Honda Safety Training Center, perhaps the only certified motorcycle training center in the country. There, drivers are taught the basics of road and traffic conditions, and undergo a separate vehicle inspection to test their bike’s safety and integrity. Applicant drivers can avail themselves of this training for free and for as many times as they need, said Torres. But it’s a careful process. “Not all who apply are accepted. So you see, even if the process itself is simple, we’re very careful especially when both the go­vernment and the public are watching.” Apart from the training, MoveIt’s riders are also given safety gear and service merchandise for which they must pay a “performance bond.” This bond acts like a deposit, which is refundable once they permanently leave the platform. “Under the new amended guidelines, the TWG will be gi­ven access to our database and dashboard,” Torres said. “They can now monitor our real-time operations.” The amended guideline is crucial if the TWG wishes to wrap up the test by March. During the first leg of the study, the group had to wait for Angkas’ monthly data before it could validate and assess the results. That, in part, caused the current confusion between Angkas and transport re­gulators, who are disputing the number of riders on the platform of the motorcycle taxi-service provider. Angkas claims to have 27,000 drivers, but the TWG only has over 2,400 drivers on hand. Drivers welcomeWill MoveIt be willing to accommodate some of the 17,000 Angkas drivers who will fall outside the 10,000 cap set by the TWG? “Of course,” Torres said. “We will try to fill up our slots as much as possible. We welcome all, even ‘habal-habal.’ But they’ll still have to go through the process to be fair to all applicants.” MoveIt would ensure that its rates are competitive to entice more riders on its platform, according to Torres. Riders, for one, can benefit from an 80-20 sharing scheme in their favor and from state-mandated insurance. Ultimately, MoveIt is looking to help make the three-month study successful. And the sooner the study is terminated, “the better for everyone involved,” Torres said. “If you just keep on extending the study, it could mean we’re not getting anything from the study,” he said. “The aim really should be to have meaningful data and analysis to send to Congress so that it can craft a law at the soo­nest possible time. The sooner they’re able to enact the law, [the] better not just for the motorcycle [drivers] but for the already troubled commuting public as well.”"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/208152/lto-7-starts-apprehending-angkas-habal-habal-drivers","title":"LTO-7 starts apprehending Angkas, habal-habal drivers","date":"December 15,2018 - 11:13 PM","snippet":"","body":"THE Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTO-7) has started apprehending drivers of motorcycle-hailing app Angkas and habal-habal or motorcycle-for-hire-drivers in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court that they are illegal.

Pring said her trip took two and a half hours to get to Ortigas from Makati, which involved riding a car first before switching to ride-hailing service Angkas just to reach her destination on time, as stated in her Instagram post earlier today, Dec. 18.  “TWO AND A HALF HOURS from Makati to Ortigas. I left the house thinking it’d take me max 1 1/2 hr to get to my event, but lo and behold, I had been in the car for 30 mins and the traffic was NOT MOVING,” she stressed. Pring, who donned a striped red-and-yellow dress, can be seen wearing a face mask and a helmet while on board the motorcycle in the series of photos.  “So I got out of my car, booked for an Angkas, took off my heels, put on some pants on top of my dress, and rode at the back of the kuya who brought me to work ON TIME. What a life we are living, Manila traffic!!!” she said. Pring then noted how important it is to be professional, and that people should still make it on time for meetings or commitments despite the traffic problem.  “We must always operate on professionalism and respect for the people we work with,” she said. “Be on time, make no excuses, and when you make mistakes, know to apologize and be better.” Pring went to Ortigas to host for Meralco’s Christmas party yesterday, Dec. 17. In October, militant group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan claimed that Metro Manila was experiencing a “mass transport crisis,” following the problems all three rail stations in the Metro experienced at the time. Navigation service Waze, meanwhile, claimed in the same month that Metro Manila is the world’s worst place to drive in. President Rodrigo Duterte back in June vowed that he would make the travel time from Cubao, Quezon City, to Makati reduced to just five minutes. /ra  RELATED STORIES: Pring to Busan: Joyce Pring enjoys first time in Korea LOOK: Joyce Pring goes public with engagement to Juancho Triviño Metro Manila now suffering a mass transport crisis — Bayan"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/132658/ignoring-the-experts","title":"Ignoring the experts","date":"05:08 AM August 13, 2020","snippet":"Last week, the Tacloban City Council pleaded with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to reconsider the mandated use of motorcycle barriers, as these are “hazardous,” according to the council, and an unnecessary cost burden to already cash-strapped riders.","body":"Last week, the Tacloban City Council pleaded with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to reconsider the mandated use of motorcycle barriers, as these are “hazardous,” according to the council, and an unnecessary cost burden to already cash-strapped riders. The Aug. 5 resolution cited findings by engineers and motorcycle experts that the required barrier/shield was a “question on safety, aerodynamics and maneuverability,” while also “already unnecessary” in preventing the spread of COVID-19 as riders wear face masks and helmets. Plus, since pillion riding on motorcycles is only allowed for couples living in the same house, they “have already been living or interacting closely to each other.”  The Tacloban City Council thus joined the chorus of concerned voices protesting against the motorcycle barrier policy. Those protests, however, continue to fall on deaf ears; Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, who required the use of backriding shields as vice-chair of the National Task Force Against COVID-19, has rejected the criticisms and even scolded citizens and experts for airing their apprehensions. “Ang daming pilosopo, ang daming critics, sabi, ganito, ganyan, ’di na kailangan ’yan,” an irked Año said during a forum in Bohol with Gov. Arthur Yap, whose motorcycle barrier design was the first approved by the NTF for use by pillion riders last month.  “Ang daming mga magagaling, sabi, ‘We are from the motorcycle associations, cyclists.’ Sabi ko naman, pagdating sa motor naniniwala ako na expert kayo, pero pagdating sa pandemic, huwag kayong magmamarunong kasi kailangan pag-aralan ano ba talaga itong virus na ito,” Año added. Año is standing pat on the requirement to use one of the two approved designs for motorcycle barriers, the second being the backpack worn and strapped on the driver as pushed by motorcycle taxi platform Angkas. During the recent turnover of Angkas motorcycle shields at Camp Crame, Año again assailed critics who questioned his knowledge of motorcycles, saying that he has been riding one since he was a junior officer and thus knows whereof he speaks. (Sure, but did he ever use a barrier then?) The DILG instead blames the alleged faulty construction and use of unauthorized models for the recent accidents involving riders with barriers, reiterating that the approved designs had gone through “stringent” studies before approval. None of these supposed studies, however, have been released for independent review and public scrutiny.  Who are these objectors that Año dismisses so cavalierly? One of them is the Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME). In a July 23 position paper, the group said that based on the science and engineering of how air interacts with moving bodies, also called fluid dynamics or aerodynamics, “the barrier may contribute negatively to safety, health, economy and the environment.” When the motorcycle is in motion, the PSME warned, the barrier attached to either the motorcycle or the rider, or held by the backrider, will increase aerodynamic forces and add to the drag and lift beyond the designed limit for the vehicle, thus destabilizing the motorcycle and endangering both the driver and the rider. Top motorcycle brands Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha hold the same view, saying the use of the barriers is “dangerous.” The brands that comprise the Motorcycle Development Program Participants Association, Inc. (MDPPA) pointed out in their July 21 statement that the shield would “create significant wind resistance when the motorcycle is in motion,” which would “drastically reduce” aerodynamic efficiency and also make it easier for crosswinds to throw the motorcycle off-balance even when running at low speeds. The MDPPA stressed that all motorcycle models undergo years of careful planning, design, and development carried out by a team of engineers to ensure the utmost safety of each unit that comes out of their factory floor. Thus, “any additional feature,” such as the barrier greenlighted by the IATF, would “negatively affect stability and handling of a motorcycle, thus, inevitably compromising the safety of its occupants.” Motorcycle riders comprising the Motorcycle Philippines Federation have also come out squarely against the policy. “Kinakatakot namin d’yan, yung wind dragging at saka wind lifting na tinatawag. Maski ikaw mabagal, dinaanan ka ng mabilis na bus o truck, maaaring magkaroon ng problema sa handlebar mo, mag-wiggle motor mo, madisgrasya ka,” MPF director Atoy Cruz said in an ABS-CBN interview.  “We’re asking for somebody, aerodynamics engineers who will suggest that this won’t be accident-prone. Local engineers wrote to IATF that this is dangerous. They did not listen,” Cruz said. Bafflingly, curiously, they are not listening still. What’s behind this inordinate, irrational insistence on a policy that experts themselves warn could be harmful to public safety?

He said some drivers would carry passengers but as “habal-habal” drivers, without using the app Angkas.

Secretary Arthur Tugade signed the General Guidelines for the Pilot Implementation of Motorcycle Taxis on Friday, May 10, 2019. This approval means that Angkas drivers can now operate within Metro Cebu, regulated by the Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTFRB-7) and Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTO-7). According to the DOTr guidelines, the Angkas drivers may run within 10 hours a days provided they comply with the requirements of proper helmets and gears including a vest-based strap to secure the passenger in place. Angkas motorcycles may only run up to 60 kilometers and must follow the speed limits along school, church, and hospital vicinities. The guidelines also stipulates a minimum of P20 for one kilometer. Surge caps will be adjusted by the LTFRB. LTFRB-7 Regional Director Eduardo Montealto Jr. said the test run for the next six months will allow further adjustments and feasibility giving primary focus to the safety of the public. Montealto said that this will allow the DOTr to properly study the operation of motorcycle taxis in Metro Cebu, including the mountain barangays which will be closely monitored so they can create a more specific guidelines. He also said that LTFRB-7 will be providing a report to DOTr in the next six months to assess the operations on a monthly basis. Montealto said  in order to operate, Angkas drivers must follow the guidelines set by the DOTr in general and the LTFRB-7 specific for Metro Cebu. “They have to comply with the pre-requisites before operating. One is to secure an accident & passenger insurance which is similar or even higher premium than the regular PUVs (public utility vehicles),” said Montealto. One of the striking guidelines for the Angkas to operate is that they should be able to provide insurance for the driver and the passenger in the case of an accident. Montealto urged the drivers to always put the safety of their passengers as a top priority in their service by maintaining their motorcycles and submitting their vehicles to regular mechanical check ups. The regional director expects that six months will be enough to identify what needs to be improved for the operating guidelines of motorcycle-taxis in general. /bmjo "},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/126860/governance-by-pique","title":"Governance by pique","date":"05:08 AM January 24, 2020","snippet":"After enduring a series of drastic and often illogical turns in public policy by government regulators this week, commuters can rest easy that the motorcycles for hire that they have come to heavily depend on to navigate hellish traffic will remain on the road for now.","body":"After enduring a series of drastic and often illogical turns in public policy by government regulators this week, commuters can rest easy that the motorcycles for hire that they have come to heavily depend on to navigate hellish traffic will remain on the road for now. Transport regulators and motorcycle taxi companies that have been at loggerheads agreed Wednesday to bury the hatchet and continue with the government’s test run of the service until at least March 23, after which the interagency technical working group (TWG) is supposed to submit recommendations that will help craft legislation to finally legalize the use of motorcycles for public transportation. Under the agreement reached between the Department of Transportation’s TWG and the motorcycle taxi companies participating in the pilot run, the rider cap in Metro Manila will be raised to 45,000 from 30,000, which means that pioneer company Angkas and newcomers JoyRide and MoveIt will be able to field 15,000 bikers each.  Cagayan de Oro was also added to the areas covered by the pilot run, which had previously been limited to Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. And the TWG agreed to lift the threat of blacklisting Angkas for supposedly defying TWG guidelines, while Angkas agreed to withdraw cases it had filed against the TWG. The road to this detente has been rough and revelatory—exposing, at the very least, the whimsical, power-tripping instincts of those in government charged to look after the public’s welfare, but are wont instead to engage in petty, spiteful actions when their egos get pricked.  Witness the behavior of TWG head and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board member Antonio Gardiola Jr., who, just ahead of the Senate hearings on bills seeking to regulate motorcycle taxis, announced the abrupt end to the pilot study meant to assess the safety and viability of using motorcycles for public transport, still two months ahead of the March 23 deadline agreed upon last year. His reason? The “legal rigmarole” Angkas was supposedly throwing at the TWG. How dare Angkas take them on, Gardiola et al. apparently thought, and so the piqued TWG decided to just ditch the task it needed to do. The study it was supposed to submit to Congress was obviously much bigger than any quarrel with Angkas, because it would inform the eventual law that would regulate the newfangled service that had sprouted on the roads out of desperate necessity, with the citizens’ needs once again overtaking the government’s ability to provide adequate and timely redress for the transport mess. However, while the paramount focus should be on alleviating soonest the ordeal of ordinary commuters, Gardiola, seemingly intent on bearing down on Agkas for whatever reason, would rather engage in naked power play and governance by pique than doing his job properly. The reaction was swift and unforgiving, and rightly so. The TWG was pilloried by the public and a number of government officials for its hasty, thoughtless actions, with Sen. Grace Poe and Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto slamming the decision to end the TWG study prematurely and declare all motorcycle taxis as illegal as an “act of revenge.” Indeed, the wording of the TWG recommendation to Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade to terminate the pilot run supports the speculation of Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, that the TWG “got pissed” at Angkas. For instance, the two rallies organized by Angkas riders in December last year resulted in “numerous social media statements disparaging the TWG,” moaned Gardiola et al.  What delicate insides these bureaucrats must have, quickly made sick by “disparaging” social media posts and blithely plotting to strike back by disallowing motorcyle taxis while millions of Filipinos are out there battling infernal traffic, pollution and crime every day on the streets as they head for work and home, the motorcycle-for-hire service meanwhile now providing many of them a cheap, fast and relatively safe alternative to jampacked buses and the MRT and expensive Grab or taxi rides to surmount the soul-crushing daily gridlock. Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite succinctly summed up the TWG charade: “One minute they are saying that they do not have enough data, the next minute they’re terminating the study without even having conclusive results. LTFRB member Antonio Gardiola’s immature action meant to spite Angkas for its legal actions would cause commuters and drivers undue suffering.” The widespread public rebuke appears to have knocked some sense into the TWG’s head for now, and motorcycle taxis have been given a reprieve. But, once again, what a spectacle of government folly for such a commonsensical, clear-cut issue."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/210411/fate-of-angkas-habal-habal-now-under-house-review-2","title":"Fate of angkas, habal-habal under House review","date":"January 03,2019 - 07:16 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — The move to legalize habal-habal (motorcycles-for-hire), also known as angkas, is now being reviewed by the Committee of Transportation in the House of Representatives.

Osmeña also posted a copy of the proposal, which stressed the need for a law to legalize habal-habal not only to provide a convenient, alternative mode of transportation but also to ensure the safety of the riding public. “It is of common knowledge that in cities, municipalities, and barangays in the country, there is a proliferation of motorcycles-for-hire known as habal-habal or angkas has been considered as the most convenient and cheapest means of transportation of the residents therein for lack of other means of transportation,” the proposal’s explanatory note read. “The amendment of Section 458(1)(vi) of Republic Act No. 7160-Local Government Code and Section 7 (c) Republic Act No. 4136 – Land Transportation Code will resolve the existing inadequacies in our laws and shall promote the safety and welfare of people who patronage motorcycles-for-hire,” it added. This is not the first proposal on legalizing habal-habal that was lodged by a Cebuano legislator. Aside from Del Mar and Abellanosa, another Cebuano lawmaker has also previously filed before the lower chamber of Congress a bill to legalize habal-habal operations. In his capacity as former congressman, representing Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy (ANAD) Partylist, now Cebu City Councilor Pastor ‘Jun’ Alcover Jr. filed House Bill No. 6046 in 2012, with the same goal of recognizing motorcycle as a legal mode of public transportation. Four years later, in 2017, Alcover also proposed before the city council to regulate habal-habal operations in Cebu City but it was junked after the Committee on Laws and Reviews reported that the council has no authority over it, with the absence of a national law providing such mandate. /rcg"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/208794/palma-angkas-has-practical-use-for-commuters","title":"Palma: Angkas has practical use for commuters","date":"December 19,2018 - 11:03 PM","snippet":"","body":"THERE should be a balance between safety and practicality. This was the appeal of Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma to the Supreme Court (SC) on thesuspension on the operations of the motorcycle-hailing application, Angkas. The prelate was particularly concerned over the fate of the 25,000 bikers who have lost their livelihood because of the ban of Angkas. “On a personal thought, while we are aware of the importance of security, I am also aware of the practicality of Angkas. I lived in a mountain barangay and over there, many people rely on motorcycles and Angkas,” said the prelate, who hailed from the town of Dingle in Iloilo province. “So, yes, let us be serious about security but let us also be kind and practical about other people who may not have other means of transportation,” he added. Palma said that he understood the duty of authorities to assess the safety of all public transports, but he urged the lawmakers to carefully study the system with a more humane approach. The prelate admitted that in his days as a priest, he was discouraged from using the motorcycle because of safety issues, and so he used cars. However, he also saw the necessity of using habal-habal (motorcycles- for-hire) to reach the remote areas where they conducted mission works and provided religious services to the faithful. Palma said that in these far-flung areas, the people have no other way to reach the towns without using motorcycles. Even during his growing years in the town of Dingle in Iloilo, the prelate had various memories of traveling on board a motorcycle despite this mode of transportation being known to be dangerous. “There was a time when my Mama would go (somewhere), she prefers to angkas (ride) on a motorcycle because it was convenient ug mahangin-hangin (and breezy). For many years, she did not hesitate to say that she liked to do angkas,” said Palma. Palma hoped that the national lawmakers could create regulations for Angkas and the habal-habal industry that would be beneficial to the public. “For motorcycles, we know the danger but we also know the practicality (of having to ride motorcycles),” he added. Temporary Restraining OrderLast December 5, the SC issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on the decision by the Mandaluyong City Court allowing Angkas to operate despite the objections raised by transport sector regulators, such as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The TRO was released just four months after Angkas began to operate again, in the wake of the Mandaluyong City Court ruling that said there was no specific law prohibiting motorcycles from being used as public transport. The Mandaluyong City Court, in the ruling dated Sept. 6, prohibited the LTFRB from interfering with the operations of Angkas. The LTFRB went on to appeal the ruling before the SC, which resulted in the issuance of the TRO. The LTFRB filed the case against Angkas in 2017, asking the court to suspend its operations on the ground that it lacked a franchise to operate a public transport system. Angkas, however, did not wait for any court decision and instead, voluntarily stopped its motorcycle-for-hire operations in November 2017. DebateMeanwhile, the opposition councilors in Cebu City continue to criticize the decision of Mayor Tomas Osmeña to file an appeal before the SC to lift the TRO on the operation of Angkas. Osmeña revealed last Tuesday (December 18) that he would ask the City Council for an authority to file an appeal before the SC on behalf of the riding public regarding the suspension of the motorcycle-hailing app. The opposition councilors said Osmeña should instead act on a proposed ordinance seeking to regulate habal-habal (motorcycle-for-hire) operations within Cebu City, as well as pass a law that would legally recognize habal-habal’s operation in the city. Councilor Pastor “Jun” Alcover Jr. said the mayor’s plan to join the legal battle in support of Angkas and the granting of rice subsidy to displaced Angkas drivers were “just band-aid solutions.” “Ang paghatag og bugas sa mga (Giving sacks of rice to) habal-habal drivers, it’s only a band-aid solution,” said Alcover. Alcover was the proponent of the proposed ordinance to regulate habal-habal operations by implementing a fixed fare matrix and to require habal-habal drivers to go through a registration process. Alcover slammed Osmeña’s plans to ask permission from the Bando Osmeña Pundok Kauswagan (BOPK)-dominated City Council to allow him to appeal the Angkas case before the High Court. “Nganong di siya mag focus sa pag-legalize sa habal-habal. Duna na may habal-habal, kulang nalang ang paglegalize nila. Ang Angkas, negosyo man na. Mawala ang importansya sa Angkas kung malegalize na ang habal-habal,” he added.(Why won’t he focus on legalizing habal-habal operations? We already have habal-habal, and the only thing they lack is to legalize them. Angkas is a business. Angkas will lose its importance once habal-habal is legalized.) During a special session held last Monday, Dec. 17, the City Council approved a resolution appropriating P15 million as rice subsidy for all Angkas and habal-habal drivers operating in Cebu City. The budget will be sourced from the city’s share from the income of Philippine Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) funds. In an earlier interview, Osmeña said he intended to provide sacks of rice to all the 6,000 habal-habal drivers in Cebu City affected by the SC decision on Angkas."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/280392/deny-heavy-passengers-we-didnt-order-that-to-angkas-twg-says","title":"Deny heavy passengers?

In a radio interview, the mayor said he argued for LGU regulation on Angkas and added that the House transportation committee will hold a hearing on the issue in Cebu City. Due to the ongoing construction of the underpass in Natalio Bacalso road, the mayor had been vocal in lobbying for LGU regulation of Angkas. City Councilor Joel Garganera said Angkas and habal-habal operators provide a viable transport alternative to Cebu City’s traffic congestion. “Habal-habal exists because our public transport is a failure. Our roads are very narrow and the alternative is two-wheel transport. But the safety of the passengers is at risk. But what choice do we have other than to get stuck in traffic?,” he told the reporters yesterday. “Angkas is also a way of professionalizing the habal-habal drivers so the passengers are not only assured of their safety but also protected from indiscriminate fare increases as well as being victimized by unscrupulous drivers,” he said."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/207913/cebu-city-hall-to-set-up-own-angkas","title":"Cebu City Hall to set up own ‘Angkas’","date":"December 13,2018 - 09:51 PM","snippet":"","body":"Cebu City Hall plans to set up its own version of Angkas, a motorcycle-for-hire (habal-habal) ride-hailing application, if only to provide an alternative transport choice for city residents especially those from the mountain barangays. “We are also exploring the legality of an LGU (local government unit) producing its own Angkas-like program to make up for the loss of Angkas.

Councilor Dave Tumulak said that availing of Angkas’ services is a great help for people who want to beat traffic and avoid being late from their scheduled meetings and other important events. “I am amenable to it (Angkas operations) provided that there should be safety (measures) among passengers and training among riders especially on speed limits and traffic rules,” said Tumulak, who is also the deputy mayor on police matters and the head of the City Council’s committee on public order and safety. He said that most Cebuanos now prefer motorcycle rides because of the growing congestion problems in the city. But the Land Transportation Office in Central Visayas (LTO-7) warned that Angkas’ operations, just like the operation of motorcycles-for-hire (habal-habal), remain illegal. Alita Pulga, LTO-7 director, said all motorcycles continue to be classified as for “private use only” under Department Order No. 2017-011 or the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services. She said that any motorcycle used to ferry passengers are considered as “colorum” while its driver may be meted with a fine of P6, 000. Unlike LTO, Francisco Ouano, operations chief of the Cebu City Transportation Office (CCTO), said they are prepared to allow Angkas operations in the city for as long as drivers are able to present their passenger helmets, a driver’s license and registration. Mayor Tomas Osmeña is also a staunch supporter of motorcycle-for-hire operations and even want this legalized to provide commuters an alternative mode of transport. Drivers told Cebu Daily News in an earlier interview that they are made to undergo safety training for at least three months before they are registered as Angkas driver. Each of the Angkas drivers is enrolled to insurance with a P200,000 coverage for the driver and the passenger. They also strictly follow regulations that include adherence to a maximum speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour and the assignment of face masks, helmets and hair cover to their passengers during the ride. “That would be the best thing to do as a driver. They have to observe proper hygiene and their priority should be safety,” said Tumulak. Wanting to further stress on the need to ensure passenger safety, Tumulak said he intends to call a meeting with Angkas operators. Arnel Tancinco, Osmeña’s executive assistant and former LTO-7 director, said they are now looking for means to legitimize motorcycle-for-hire operations in the city. Tancinco, whom Mayor Osmeña tasked to oversee motorcycle-for-hire operations in the city, said he would soon be meeting with the Council’s transportation committee headed by Councilor Nendell “Hanz” Abella, to discuss the need to pass a local legislation for the purpose. “If there’s a need to regulate (motorcycles-for-hire), we are supporting it. The dilemma is how or who has authority. I believe it’s the national government (who has authority to regulate), but there’s also a responsibility in the local government,” he said.

The LTFRB order came after the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on the ruling of a lower court preventing the LTFRB from interfering with the operations of the ride-hailing app. The regulatory board said in a statement that several drivers were stopped by traffic enforcers along Pasay Road corner Edsa and Ayala corner Edsa in Makati City on Thursday for illegally offering motorcycle rides to the public. One apprehended driver even covered the Angkas logo at the back of his helmet with an electrical tape, according to the LTFRB. “Marami ang pinara kung saan ang ilan ay napatunayang kamag anak, kaibigan, o kasintahan ang angkas, habang mayroon din ilan na sumubok pang magdahilan na di nakalusot sa LTFRB (Many were apprehended. Some were friends, relatives or partners of Angkas drivers. There were some riders who tried to skirt the LTFRB order,” it said. With this, the agency called on the riding public not to patronize these motorcycle rides as they are not registered with the government. This means that the driver will not be held liable for any accident that may happen to the passenger, the LTFRB said. “Hinihikayat ang publiko na wag tangkilikin ang mga motorsiklo na ginagamit bilang PUV dahil hindi ito rehistrado sa gobyerno. Kapag may nangyaring aksidente ay walang insurance ang pasahero at walang pananagutan ang driver,” it said.

In a separate statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) stressed that Angkas motorcycles are illegal.

The motorcycle-for-hire, locally known as habal-habal, had operated in various parts of the countryside for a long time now. I myself have experienced countless times riding this motorcycle service. Being a native of Leyte, I am familiar with motorcycle-for-hire since I was in the elementary grade. It is the only means of transportation in the mountain barangays that cannot be accessed by a 4-wheel vehicle. In fact, the single motorcycles being used to transport passengers are modified by putting a roof to protect the passengers from rain, and an extension to accommodate more passengers even up to 11 persons, with one passenger sitting on the tank in front of the driver – indeed an innovation, Filipino style. When I arrived here in Cebu for work after graduating from college, the single motorcycle-for-hire was not yet in demand as there are jeepneys and taxis. The same thing in the provinces, the motorcycles-for-hire exist only in the mountain barangays. People in the city are aware of the danger of single motorcycle running side-by-side with 4-wheel vehicles on the roads. But the heavy and monstrous traffic every day, which is a result of the increasing number of vehicles using the same unimproved roads, force people to ride on habal-habal. I experience hiring habal-habal every Sinulog because it is the only means of transportation that can pass through the traffic congestion in the heart of the city. I really appreciate its usefulness during these times. There was another incident when I hired habal-habal as I anticipated that I’d be late for my flight if I get swallowed by traffic. I was very much aware of the danger of riding on it from Cebu City, and passing the highways of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu. Based on my experience, the fear of accident was overtaken by the worry to be late. Truly, the single motorcycle I hired was not affected by the traffic jam because the driver found ways to overtake other vehicles. I just cautioned him to be extra careful. I arrived at MCIA before the boarding time schedule. I felt relieved. However, I was frustrated hearing the announcement that the plane’s arrival would be delayed, a fact which is almost as natural as traffic. In fact, it was delayed for almost 3 hours. It was only then that I meditated on my dangerous experience riding the habal-habal, especially in the city. I am pretty sure that I share almost the same experience with commuters on the daily traffic congestion especially during peak hours. Hence, people are divided on their stand on the Supreme Court decision stopping the motorcycle-for-hire with or without Angkas applications. When I interviewed LTFRB-7 Director Eduardo Montealto over DYHP RMN Cebu, I also understand his point because as per data, there is at least three accidents daily involving single motorcycles. So it is very dangerous to the riding public, worsened by the fact that it does not have passenger insurance. Until such time that motorcycles-for-hire are legalized, after undergoing heavy and thorough debates in Congress, franchise may be obtained, and there will be insurance for the riding public. In the meantime, the Supreme Court has already spoken on the matter. It should be respected."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/277805/no-more-motorcycle-taxis-after-march-23","title":"No more motorcycle taxis after March 23","date":"December 28,2019 - 10:38 AM","snippet":"","body":"No more motorcycle-hailing services like Angkas can operate after March 23, the multiagency technical working group (TWG) studying the viability of bikes-for-hire announced on Thursday, adding that it sees no reason to extend the pilot test a third time.

That’s what they can’t understand. When we have already submitted our recommendations to Congress, the study is terminated,“ he added. The announcement came amid heightened tensions between transport regulators and dominant bike-hailing service Angkas, which had been opposing the TWG’s recent decision to impose a 10,000 rider cap per company. The cap will take effect for the three-month extension of the pilot test, which will run from January to March 23. Angkas claims to have 27,000 riders at the moment, while the new players—Joyride and MoveIt—have 1,438 and 1,414 each. It appears, however, that Angkas has bigger looming worries than trying to keep the 17,000 riders on its platform. “There is still no law [amending Republic Act No. 4136 to allow bikes for public transport],” Gardiola said. “How then would all those riders be able to run on the road? Nobody can say, ‘Please consider them.’ The law covers all. If the law says bikes are not allowed, then they are not allowed. Who then will Angkas blame?” Asked whether this would be a realistic option given the worsening traffic problem gripping the metropolis, transport consultant and TWG member Bert Suansing said: “That’s no longer the problem of the TWG. They (motorcycle taxi drivers) will have to be apprehended on the road. That’s the problem of the enforcers already.” Gardiola took note of the trial-by-publicity the TWG had to endure in the past few days, after Angkas launched a #SaveAngkas online campaign that sparked public outrage. “If only we were asked about what the TWG’s initial findings are and what the study is about, then we have a lot to talk about. But we were limited to talking about the livelihood of those 17,000 riders …,” he said.

He isn’t bothered by habal-habal drivers contracted under Angkas, a motorcycle ride booking service in Cebu. “We are not afraid. Angkas drivers rely on bookings.

Most of the habal-habal drivers service tourists headed to Barangay Sirao, Cebu City, known for its celosia flowers or Temple of Leah in Barangay Busay.
