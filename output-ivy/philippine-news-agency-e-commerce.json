During the plenary session, the chamber approved House Bill 7805, or the proposed Internet Transactions Act, with 232 affirmative votes, six negative votes, and no abstention. The bill seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services, and digital financial services. The proposed e-commerce bureau will serve as the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one-stop-shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. Valenzuela City Rep. Wes Gatchalian, author of the bill, said the proposed bureau will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet. “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he said. Gatchalian said the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low-value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee, and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to publish the details of their merchants; fail to examine goods related to food, drugs, cosmetics, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or are already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” Gatchalian said.

During the National MSME Week e-forum, Pacheco said the number of registered online businesses surged from more than 1,600 online businesses that registered for the full year of 2019.  “That means to say that people are looking at ecommerce and that also means DTI needs to help a lot this particular MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises),” she added.  When the government announced lockdown measures during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the country in March, business activities in online platforms surged as some business owners migrated their physical stores to online shops while those who lost their jobs also started their online business.  With the increasing number of online businesses, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued a memorandum requiring online business owners to register their activities until July 31, 2020.  Those businesses with annual income of less than PHP250,000 are not required to pay taxes but are still encouraged to register their businesses.  In the same virtual forum, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian also urged the government to digitalize processes in business registration, particularly in local government units to ease doing business in the country.  Gatchalian added that through easing the processes of doing business in the country, more businesses will be encouraged to register their activities.  The DTI likewise promotes business registration even for small-scale businesses for them to easily access government’s support particularly during challenging times like the pandemic.  DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez on Monday said micro and small enterprises (MSEs) that tap the Covid-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises (CARES) program reached 23,477 with aggregate borrowings amounting to PHP3.38 billion.  Of the number, 3,711 applications were approved with loans amounting to PHP253.5 million.  The CARES program lends PHP10,000 to PHP500,000 to MSEs that were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic for them to sustain their businesses and save jobs of their employees.

We need to take into account the substantial developments in technology, the widespread use of (the) internet, and the growing e-commerce sector,” DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez said in a statement Sunday.  The eCommerce Act was signed on June 14 2000.  Lopez said there was an accelerated adoption of e-commerce during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) amid the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.  “To strengthen e-commerce in the country, DTI is supporting the various bills related to e-commerce, particularly House Bill 6122 or the ‘Internet Transactions Act’ authored by Trade Committee Chair Representative Wes Gatchalian,” he said.  HB 6122 seeks to establish an eCommerce Bureau that will, among others, focus on promoting the development of e-commerce in the country by building trust between sellers and consumers, stronger online consumer protection, safer e-payment gateways, easier online business registration, and formulating other policies and programs to increase the number of online merchants and consumers.  Aside from the Internet Transactions Bill, various related bills are being tackled in Congress that aim to promote the digital economy. These include HB 6927 on e-Government Act principally authored by Deputy Speaker Lray Villafuerte; HB 6926 and Senate (SB) 1469 on the national digital careers act; and SB 1470 on the National Digital Transformation policy.  Lopez said the country needs to update its 20-year-old eCommerce Act of 2000, the DTI is also bringing our eCommerce Philippines 2022 Roadmap up to date.  “With a strategy that focuses on ‘Security, Speed, and Structure’ to increase Sales, DTI is moving to further bolster e-commerce in the country. But we also need to strengthen protection of online consumers and online merchants, particularly our micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs),” he added.  The 2019 Google Temasek study indicated that e-commerce in the Philippines is expected to grow from USD2.5 billion in 2019 to USD12 billion in 2025.  Likewise, according to statistics from EuroMonitor, there is a huge potential for growth of online commerce given that it accounts for only 3.78 percent of total retail in the Philippines valued at USD63.2 billion.  “With e-commerce growing and evolving, we need to tackle structural and legal impediments to e-commerce and digital marketplace growth. The upshot is that this is expected to boost our economy in terms of opening markets to facilitate sales and consumption, upgrading traditional manufacturing and service, and developing new industries for business opportunities,” Lopez said.

In pushing for the swift passage of Senate Bill No. 1591, or the proposed Internet Transactions Act, the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs said e-Commerce provides consumers with time-saving options and access to the swift delivery of goods and services. “It also presents value for money because from the seller’s perspective, set-up costs are lower and operating costs are kept at a minimum,” Gatchalian said. However, he noted that the Philippines’ eCommerce is still at its developing stage despite the Philippines’ estimated 76 million active internet users and high internet penetration rate. Citing a study by Google and Temasek, the Philippine internet economy posted a Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of USD7 billion in 2019. The value pales in comparison with those of Malaysia (USD11 billion), Vietnam and Singapore (USD12 billion), Thailand (USD16 billion), and Indonesia (USD40 billion). The country’s eCommerce market remains at 1.6 percent of GDP. Gatchalian said it is paramount to enact SBN 1591 to resolve key concerns in the country’s e-Commerce industry such as lack of trust; Internet infrastructure; logistics infrastructure; payment mechanisms; lack of governing entity at the regional level that can fight cybercrime and settle cross-border disputes; difficulty in the process of returning the product; taxation; and online consumer complaints. “The Internet Transactions Act will pave the way for the establishment of a singular office that will be given the responsibility of carrying out provisions of this bill, ensure the implementation of the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 (RA 8792, and be the focal point in the monitoring and implementation of the Philippine eCommerce roadmap,” he said. “Kaakibat ng isang masigla, matatag, at tuloy-tuloy na pag-unlad ng eCommerce sa bansa ang pagkakaroon ng isang batas na poprotekta sa interes ng bawat Pilipinong mamimili at mangangalakal.

Lawyer Alma Marie Dalena, officer-in-charge of SEC-CEO, said the commission advises the public to exercise caution in dealing with firms soliciting investments using the social media and internet platform. “We are reminding the investing public that the certificate of incorporation is not enough for corporations to solicit investments. Before they can do that, they must first secure a secondary license from the commission,” Dalena said in a statement on Thursday. Dalena said the SEC is relentlessly conducting investor protection efforts, adding that would-be investors may email their office through seccebu@sec.gov.ph to verify if a certain corporation is authorized to engage in investment-taking. She also encouraged potential investors to regularly check the Advisories page of the Commission’s official website, www.sec.gov.ph. “The Enforcement and Investor Protection Department (EIPD) is proactive in identifying groups or individuals taking advantage of the (Covid-19) pandemic to scam investors. I’m encouraging the investing public to regularly check on the advisories posted on our website for additional guidance and information on the activities of these fraudulent entities,” she added. Tiara Jabutay, the information officer of SEC-CEO, told the Philippine News Agency in an interview Friday, that there are Cebuanos who filed complaints with their office after being victimized by online investment scams. “The location of the investment firms does not matter. What matters is the reach of their offer to the public. Some are having their operations in Manila and some are in other provinces but they have the same modus, that is to use online and social media in reaching their target audience and entice them to invest online,” she said in Cebuano. Jabutay said some investment firms use pyramiding recruitment as a scheme to lure investors. She lamented that while there are unsuspecting investors who fell into the trap of the scammers, there are individuals who, despite their prior knowledge about the negative report against a firm, still invest after being attracted to “easy money”. Dalena’s warning came after the SEC central office issued on Tuesday an advisory against investing in CROWD1 Asia Pacific, Inc., Sharebiz Ads/ Sharebiz Advertising/ Sharebiz Online Advertising Services, and Winners Ecommerce International Network Corp. (WINCORP). According to a statement, CROWD1, Sharebiz, and WINCORP neither have registered securities such as investment contracts nor have secured a secondary license to solicit and take investments from the public, as required under Republic Act No. 8799 or The Securities Regulation Code. The SEC said it has no record of Sharebiz and WINCORP being registered as corporations or partnerships. Under its scheme, CROWD1 offers membership packages worth PHP6,000 to PHP240,000, it said. An investor is entitled to bonuses by simply joining, sponsoring newer members, and recruiting more people. Sharebiz, meanwhile, offers three entry packages worth PHP330 to PHP1,100. An investor may earn by recruiting members, encoding captcha, selling products, and converting a portion of his/her earnings into the so-called BIZCOIN. This Camarines Sur-based firm also offers a BIZCOIN-focused compensation plan where one may invest PHP500 to PHP50,000 and earn a 42 percent interest every 20 days within a two-month period by simply logging in his/her account. WINCORP likewise offers entry packages worth PHP4,888 to PHP39,998 with 200 to 1,600 equivalent points. An investor may earn PHP1,000 daily, PHP20,000 weekly, or PHP30,000 monthly by selling products and recruiting members. The statement said the SEC warned that those who act as salesmen, brokers, dealers, or agents of fraudulent investment schemes may be held criminally liable and penalized with a maximum fine of PHP5 million or imprisonment of 21 years or both under the Securities Regulation Code. Republic Act No. 11469 or the \"Bayanihan to Heal as One Act\" further penalizes those participating in cyber incidents that make use or take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to prey on the public through scams, phishing, fraudulent emails, or other similar acts with two-month imprisonment or a maximum fine of PHP1 million or both. (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1068494","title":"Online selling made easy for MSMEs ","date":" April 29, 2019, 8:38 pm","snippet":"MANILA – Global e-commerce selling and logistics platform, Anchanto, launched Monday its \"free forever\" plan across Asia Pacific, except Indonesia and Korea, to boost the micro, small and medium enterprises' (MSMEs) e-commerce capabilities.","body":"MANILA – Global e-commerce selling and logistics platform, Anchanto, launched Monday its \"free forever\" plan across Asia Pacific, except Indonesia and Korea, to boost the micro, small and medium enterprises' (MSMEs) e-commerce capabilities.
