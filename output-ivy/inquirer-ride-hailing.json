After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.

Primo Morillo, The Passenger Forum (TPF) convenor, said on Tuesday that while competition was necessary to present riders more options, the best way to do so was to prop up the local transport network companies (TNCs) competing against Singapore-based Grab.  The nine local TNCs are Owto, GoLag, Ryde, uHop, Hype, Hirna, SnappyCab, e-Pick Me Up and Micab. “Homegrown TNCs should be supported rather than killed by allowing giant foreign-owned app-based ride-hailing firms to come in,” Morillo said.  He urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and the Department of Transportation to talk to the existing players about the kind of help they need which would allow them to compete before allowing another TNC to enter the market."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/286087/former-uber-ceo-kalanick-severs-ties-with-ride-hailing-giant","title":"Former Uber CEO Kalanick severs ties with ride-hailing giant","date":"06:41 AM December 25, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Travis Kalanick, who built Uber into a ride-hailing giant, only to be ousted as CEO over the company’s sexist “bro” culture, is cashing out.","body":"NEW YORK — Travis Kalanick, who built Uber into a ride-hailing giant, only to be ousted as CEO over the company’s sexist “bro” culture, is cashing out. Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1209152/pimentel-endorsement-wont-influence-decision-after-pilot-test-run","title":"Koko endorsement won’t influence TWG decision on ride-hailing apps","date":"08:57 PM January 04, 2020","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061236/2-new-ride-hailing-firms-get-ltfrb-accreditation","title":"2 new ride-hailing firms get LTFRB accreditation","date":"05:42 AM December 08, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.

Together, they’re expected to challenge Grab’s virtual dominance of the market after it acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  Around 33,000 drivers are currently on Grab’s platform, while the other TNCs have only between hundreds to 5,000 drivers.

In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.  But Gatchalian said Grab should also explain why it was imposing surge pricing even in the wee hours of the morning when there were fewer bookings and less traffic on the road. There should be more competitors for prices to go down, he added although he noted that while there were other TNVS companies, these were small players who could not go head-to-head with the current industry leader. “Without competition in the hail-riding industry, our poor commuters will always be at the mercy of high fares,” Gatchalian said. “This is why we are supporting the entry of other players in this industry, such as the TNVS GoJek, so that commuters would have choices and would not have to endure the high rates of Grab,” he added —With a report from Leila B.

These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/276393/the-cebu-city-councilor-who-sidelines-as-ride-hailing-driver","title":"The Cebu City Councilor who sidelines as ride-hailing driver","date":"December 22,2019 - 08:30 AM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Traffic jam outside the CDN Digital office was horrible on a Friday afternoon, December 20, and one of the building’s employees said she was heading to SM Seaside City Cebu for an errand. No ride-hailing apps accepted the request for vehicle except for one with a driver whose picture looked very familiar. The app says the driver has a blue Suzuki Vitara and the fare is P200. The driver pulled over the driveway of the CDN building in Barangay Mabolo 15 minutes later. As his first passenger entered the vehicle, the driver looked away. When the second passenger came, this reporter who covers the Cebu City Hall beat, the driver lets out a laugh. “Nakakita man mo sa akong picture sa app no?” he says. (You saw my picture on the ride-hailing app, right?) Behind the wheels of the car is Cebu City Councilor David “Dave” Tumulak, who earlier told City Hall reporters that he has applied to be driver for a ride-hailing app. That Friday afternoon, Tumulak says he just came from M.J Cuenco Avenue after a meeting. There is no more work for the day at his office at the Cebu City Hall so he decided to pick up passengers. That was when he received the request for a vehicle from the CDN Digital employee. ‘Driver for hire’ While he jokes about his government salary to be insufficient to pay for gas, Tumulak turned serious when asked why he decided to become a driver. “Sayang kaayo ang oras mag-drive from one meeting to the next. Daghan kaayong pasahero mag-atang. (Hours are wasted driving in getting from one meeting to the other) It is a waste of time and gasoline to drive alone. So may pa mag-driver ko aron makabayad ko sa gas (So I decided to become a driver so my earnings can pay for gas),” he tells CDN Digital. Tumulak reveals that he has been part of the ride-hailing app for two weeks. He applied in early December 2019 and was approved after two days. On Thursday, December 19, he earned P1,700, which is enough to have his tank filled with gasoline. And he is not even a full-time driver. His main mission in doing in being a driver is related to his role as a public servant. He enjoys driving around the city which also gives him the first-hand experience to see what is really happening on the road. It gives him the platform to better understand the plight of the drivers, whose livelihood are affected by the city’s worsening traffic situation. In these drives, he personally witnesses the experiences of motorists, pedestrians and commuters. Being a driver is his way of getting information, which he utilizes in formulating ordinances or legislations that will help the city government serve its constituents better. WATCH: David Tumulak answers questions from CDN Digital on the road  Passengers “Kun driver diay ka ba, madunggan man diay nimo tanan bisan og naa sila sa likod,” he shares with an amused voice. (When you are a driver, you can hear everything that your passengers talk about even when they are seated at the back.) He has since learned informative lessons and hilarious realities from his passengers. “Naay pasahero nga sabaan, medyo hugawan, sigeg panglibak, sigeg pagwapa,” says Tumulak. (There are passengers who are talkative, who are quite messy, who likes to gossip, or who uses the time on the road to put on make-up.) Some passengers have recognized him and when it happens, he gladly converses with them. Road issues That Friday, around 4 p.m. on the way to SM Seaside City Cebu, Tumulak pointed out that trucks were plying Sergio Osmeña Road on North Reclamation Area when there is an existing truck ban around that time. He points out the need to enforce measures such as the truck ban to make sure that efficient flow of traffic is observed with the expected holiday rush this month, December 2019. As the car moved forward to its destination, Tumulak noticed a light traffic situation at the South Road Properties (SRP) tunnel that afternoon while CDN Digital was on board his car. There were sacks, which might have fallen from a delivery truck, that were left unattended on the road. To resolve the situation, he called an official from the Cebu City Transportation Office in removing the sacks. He says this is one of the advantages of being a councilor-driver. Sitting as the Cebu City Council’s chairperson for the committee on disaster risk reduction and management, Tumulak is also able to conduct his own research that he can report to the body. He can easily respond to any incident while he is on transit. He gets to converse with his passengers, people from all walks of life, on the issues and challenges they face. As he receives the P200 payment for the drive, Tumulak showed off the money to this reporter. “Makapa-gas nako!” he says sounding victorious from a recent feat. (I can fill up my gas tank.) For Tumulak, being a driver is no different than being a councilor. Just like a councilor, a driver provides service to the public with the ultimate goal of providing convenience to passengers, a small but significant contribution to make their lives better. / dbs & celr"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/254428/local-ride-hailing-apps-vietnam-struggle-compete-grab","title":"Local ride hailing apps in Vietnam struggle to compete with Grab","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"HANOI — Vietnamese ride-hailing businesses are still struggling to grab market share even after the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia and complaints about the top ride-hailing app Grab.","body":"HANOI — Vietnamese ride-hailing businesses are still struggling to grab market share even after the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia and complaints about the top ride-hailing app Grab. After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said.

The nine local TNCs are Owto, GoLag, Ryde, uHop, Hype, Hirna, SnappyCab, e-Pick Me Up and Micab. “Homegrown TNCs should be supported rather than killed by allowing giant foreign-owned app-based ride-hailing firms to come in,” Morillo said.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1209152/pimentel-endorsement-wont-influence-decision-after-pilot-test-run","title":"Koko endorsement won’t influence TWG decision on ride-hailing apps","date":"08:57 PM January 04, 2020","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061236/2-new-ride-hailing-firms-get-ltfrb-accreditation","title":"2 new ride-hailing firms get LTFRB accreditation","date":"05:42 AM December 08, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.

In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.  But Gatchalian said Grab should also explain why it was imposing surge pricing even in the wee hours of the morning when there were fewer bookings and less traffic on the road. There should be more competitors for prices to go down, he added although he noted that while there were other TNVS companies, these were small players who could not go head-to-head with the current industry leader. “Without competition in the hail-riding industry, our poor commuters will always be at the mercy of high fares,” Gatchalian said. “This is why we are supporting the entry of other players in this industry, such as the TNVS GoJek, so that commuters would have choices and would not have to endure the high rates of Grab,” he added —With a report from Leila B.

These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/276393/the-cebu-city-councilor-who-sidelines-as-ride-hailing-driver","title":"The Cebu City Councilor who sidelines as ride-hailing driver","date":"December 22,2019 - 08:30 AM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Traffic jam outside the CDN Digital office was horrible on a Friday afternoon, December 20, and one of the building’s employees said she was heading to SM Seaside City Cebu for an errand. No ride-hailing apps accepted the request for vehicle except for one with a driver whose picture looked very familiar. The app says the driver has a blue Suzuki Vitara and the fare is P200. The driver pulled over the driveway of the CDN building in Barangay Mabolo 15 minutes later. As his first passenger entered the vehicle, the driver looked away. When the second passenger came, this reporter who covers the Cebu City Hall beat, the driver lets out a laugh. “Nakakita man mo sa akong picture sa app no?” he says. (You saw my picture on the ride-hailing app, right?) Behind the wheels of the car is Cebu City Councilor David “Dave” Tumulak, who earlier told City Hall reporters that he has applied to be driver for a ride-hailing app. That Friday afternoon, Tumulak says he just came from M.J Cuenco Avenue after a meeting. There is no more work for the day at his office at the Cebu City Hall so he decided to pick up passengers. That was when he received the request for a vehicle from the CDN Digital employee. ‘Driver for hire’ While he jokes about his government salary to be insufficient to pay for gas, Tumulak turned serious when asked why he decided to become a driver. “Sayang kaayo ang oras mag-drive from one meeting to the next. Daghan kaayong pasahero mag-atang. (Hours are wasted driving in getting from one meeting to the other) It is a waste of time and gasoline to drive alone. So may pa mag-driver ko aron makabayad ko sa gas (So I decided to become a driver so my earnings can pay for gas),” he tells CDN Digital. Tumulak reveals that he has been part of the ride-hailing app for two weeks. He applied in early December 2019 and was approved after two days. On Thursday, December 19, he earned P1,700, which is enough to have his tank filled with gasoline. And he is not even a full-time driver. His main mission in doing in being a driver is related to his role as a public servant. He enjoys driving around the city which also gives him the first-hand experience to see what is really happening on the road. It gives him the platform to better understand the plight of the drivers, whose livelihood are affected by the city’s worsening traffic situation. In these drives, he personally witnesses the experiences of motorists, pedestrians and commuters. Being a driver is his way of getting information, which he utilizes in formulating ordinances or legislations that will help the city government serve its constituents better. WATCH: David Tumulak answers questions from CDN Digital on the road  Passengers “Kun driver diay ka ba, madunggan man diay nimo tanan bisan og naa sila sa likod,” he shares with an amused voice. (When you are a driver, you can hear everything that your passengers talk about even when they are seated at the back.) He has since learned informative lessons and hilarious realities from his passengers. “Naay pasahero nga sabaan, medyo hugawan, sigeg panglibak, sigeg pagwapa,” says Tumulak. (There are passengers who are talkative, who are quite messy, who likes to gossip, or who uses the time on the road to put on make-up.) Some passengers have recognized him and when it happens, he gladly converses with them. Road issues That Friday, around 4 p.m. on the way to SM Seaside City Cebu, Tumulak pointed out that trucks were plying Sergio Osmeña Road on North Reclamation Area when there is an existing truck ban around that time. He points out the need to enforce measures such as the truck ban to make sure that efficient flow of traffic is observed with the expected holiday rush this month, December 2019. As the car moved forward to its destination, Tumulak noticed a light traffic situation at the South Road Properties (SRP) tunnel that afternoon while CDN Digital was on board his car. There were sacks, which might have fallen from a delivery truck, that were left unattended on the road. To resolve the situation, he called an official from the Cebu City Transportation Office in removing the sacks. He says this is one of the advantages of being a councilor-driver. Sitting as the Cebu City Council’s chairperson for the committee on disaster risk reduction and management, Tumulak is also able to conduct his own research that he can report to the body. He can easily respond to any incident while he is on transit. He gets to converse with his passengers, people from all walks of life, on the issues and challenges they face. As he receives the P200 payment for the drive, Tumulak showed off the money to this reporter. “Makapa-gas nako!” he says sounding victorious from a recent feat. (I can fill up my gas tank.) For Tumulak, being a driver is no different than being a councilor. Just like a councilor, a driver provides service to the public with the ultimate goal of providing convenience to passengers, a small but significant contribution to make their lives better. / dbs & celr"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/266183/ride-hailing-firm-grab-secures-1-5-billion-in-funding","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab secures $1.5 billion in funding","date":"04:39 PM March 06, 2019","snippet":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said on Wednesday it has secured $1.5 billion in fresh financing from a fund run by Japan’s SoftBank and will use a significant portion of it to expand in Indonesia.","body":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said on Wednesday it has secured $1.5 billion in fresh financing from a fund run by Japan’s SoftBank and will use a significant portion of it to expand in Indonesia.

LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).

Grab is the biggest ride-hailing firm in Southeast Asia, and has strengthened its hold on the market since buying US rival Uber’s operations in the region last year.  But the Singapore-headquartered firm has come under scrutiny from regulators in several countries due to concerns about its dominant position. The Malaysia Competition Commission proposed fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company’s competitors.  This had the effect of “distorting competition” by creating barriers to Grab’s rivals, it said. “It is important that barriers to entry for new players remain low, and for existing players to have the ability to grow and compete on merits to ensure that competition can remain healthy,” said Iskandar Ismail, the watchdog’s chief executive.  In addition, a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit will be imposed should Grab fail to take action to address the competition concerns. Grab has 30 days to respond to the watchdog, after which a final decision will be made. The company said they had complied fully with competition laws and were “surprised” by the proposed fine. “We believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms,” a Grab statement said. Last year, Singapore fined Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged. /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1139335/tnvs-strike-fails-to-paralyze-ride-hailing-services","title":"TNVS strike fails to paralyze ride-hailing services","date":"05:01 AM July 09, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) drivers staged an unprecedented “transport holiday” on Monday to protest the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) policies on granting franchise applications, although its effect seemed minimal.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) drivers staged an unprecedented “transport holiday” on Monday to protest the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) policies on granting franchise applications, although its effect seemed minimal. There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.  Different TNVS groups will conduct a much-awaited dialogue with the LTFRB regarding their concerns today. These include charges that the agency was constantly adding new requirements and changing the process for acquiring the provisional authority that TNVS drivers needed to go online."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248409/solon-wants-indonesian-ride-hailing-app-compete-grab-ph","title":"Solon wants Indonesian ride-hailing app to compete with Grab PH","date":"04:29 PM March 31, 2018","snippet":"House Deputy Minority Leader Luis Campos Jr. on Saturday said an Indonesian ride-hailing app should compete with transport network company Grab in the Philippines following the latter’s acquisition of Uber.","body":"House Deputy Minority Leader Luis Campos Jr. on Saturday said an Indonesian ride-hailing app should compete with transport network company Grab in the Philippines following the latter’s acquisition of Uber.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday assailed Arcade City for its continued defiance of the cease-and-desist order against it, as the agency pointed out that the app is encouraging the establishment of illegal transport network companies (TNCs), as well as the activation of unregistered transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Arcade City’s business model promotes illegality by espousing that TNCs no longer have to be accredited to be able to operate in the country. Arcade City also claimed that its drivers need not apply for a franchise from the government for them to ferry passengers.  Lizada said this is why when Arcade City app goes online on Monday, enforcers from the LTFRB, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Land Transportation Office and the Philippine National Police’s Highway Patrol Group will be implementing the power the law against the unregistered ride-hailing app. Lizada warned that members of the law enforcers will be operating undercover as they themselves would avail Arcade City’s services to apprehend drivers and impound their vehicles.  “We cannot afford any more irregularities such as this. We need to protect the riding public,” Lizada told the Inquirer. After Arcade City was ordered this week to cease operations for the second time, it taunted the LTFRB by saying that the board does not understand how its technology and model work. “Arcade City does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company. Driver entrepreneurs may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, but Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers,” it said in a statement. Based on its website, the app would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens.” These tokens could either be sold or used within Arcade’s ecosystem for services and bonus features. Lizada said that on top of apprehending Arcade drivers for “colorum” operations, the LTFRB will also coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications Technology and the US Embassy to “protest” the actions of the company’s founder and CEO, Christopher David.  “He is making a mockery of our rules and regulations,” Lizada said of David, who packages his company as a supposed alternative to Uber. Uber ceased operating as a TNC by Monday, running counter to the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order for it to remain in operations while a review on the deal of its acquisition by Grab is being conducted. The PCC feared that Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry gives Grab a monopoly of the industry.

Local start-up Filo Technologies, which was founded late last year, said it intends to launch its private-hire car booking services within the next two weeks.  It is up against local firm Ryde and India’s Jugnoo, which both debuted earlier in the week, and incumbent Grab, which acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations two months ago. Filo founder Jason Tan, 41, who is from the shipping and logistics industry, told The Straits Times yesterday (May 5) fares will be lower than those for taxis and comparable to other private-hire car services. Fares will also fluctuate based on demand and supply, he added.  To attract drivers, Filo will collect a 12 per cent commission – lower than Grab’s 20 per cent – which will be capped at S$400 (US$300) a month, said Mr Tan. He is currently recruiting 300 licensed private-hire car drivers to drive for his app – through social media and word of mouth – and aims to have 2,000 drivers in time for the launch. The company, based at Vision Exchange in Jurong East, has a start-up capital of S$50,000. Mr Tan said this money comes from his own pocket and investors, and he has plans to raise more funds.  His rivals currently have deeper pockets – Jugnoo has raised US$16 million, Ryde has US$1.5 million, and Grab, US$4.1 billion, according to tech website Crunchbase. Competition in Singapore’s ride-hailing sector looks set to get more intense, with firms such as Singapore’s MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) Foundation, Malaysia’s Dacsee and Indonesia’s Go-Jek looking to join the fray. Still, Mr Tan is undeterred. “The passenger-driver (matching) platform is just the start. We will have other more attractive services on the app in the coming days,” he said, but declined to reveal more. He is also promising attractive promotions for customers, but was tight-lipped about what they will be. “Based on my research, as long as there are no more than five players, the market should be able to accommodate all of them,” he added.  Asked about the sustainability of the new entrants, Mr Li Jianggan, founder of Momentum Works, a tech investment firm, said the companies could be counting on the Government regulating the ride-hailing industry in the future, to have more than one player. “At some point, this means regulating pricing and incentives.

Micab CEO and cofounder Eddie Ybañez said the company had received enough commitments from taxi operators to scale their current pool of drivers to 15,000 in September from the current 6,500.  The problem, however, is that its entry has been mired by so-called phantom bookings that began in June. Rides are booked, but later cancelled. As a result, drivers became less willing to activate the Micab app because of the phantom bookings, which nearly doubled in two months’ time, from 15,000 in June to more than 29,000 this month, he said.  Micab, one of the few transport network company (TNC) entrants accredited in April, was part of the promise to keep the market competitive. It was supposed to give consumers a choice, after Grab became a monopoly through a regional takeover of rival Uber. Micab first recognized these phantom bookings by looking into passenger accounts that have cancelled at least three times in short intervals.  But before the company could stop these phantom bookings, its drivers would have already wasted time and fuel, an unnecessary cost just when the prices of basic goods are increasing. “They’ll switch on the meter only when the passenger finally gets in. So the risk actually is that the driver goes there and then there is no one there,” he said, noting there were no refunds in these cases. Most of these bookings were then followed by a call recruiting the Micab driver to switch to Grab, he said. The person on the other line would even give a counteroffer. These calls came from cellphone numbers that have “sequential” last digits, suggesting the accounts were bought in bulk, the official said. “Our conclusion is this is just one entity. It’s like a campaign,” he said. To address the issue, Ybañez said the company had recently used an algorithm automatically banning phantom bookings after three cancellations done in short intervals.  He said they were still monitoring the results. The problem, however, is that people behind this campaign can register new numbers. Asked if Micab has already reached out to authorities, he said a legal team was still examining options. If the issue is not resolved by the app’s algorithm, the best they could do is to “minimize” the number of incidents, he said. Nevertheless, the Cebu-based cofounder is only asking for fair play. “We just want this to stop,” he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/247018/p2fb-ride-hailing-drivers-in-us-earn-less-than-minimum-wage-study","title":"Ride-hailing drivers in US earn less than minimum wage, says study","date":"03:33 PM March 04, 2018","snippet":"A recent study has discovered that drivers from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are barely making any profit plying the streets of the United States.","body":"A recent study has discovered that drivers from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are barely making any profit plying the streets of the United States.

On the regulatory front, the increased competition could impact the move by Singapore’s competition watchdog to stall the Grab-Uber merger, which is being investigated for suspected infringement of competition laws. Whether the watchdog will lift its interim measures blocking the Grab-Uber union, however, hinges on the newcomers building up a critical mass of users and drivers to compete effectively with Grab, say experts. Meanwhile, the swift appearance of contenders will keep Grab on its toes, and commuters less anxious of falling prey to take-it-or-leave-it fares.

Taxi companies in the United States, Europe and other countries have complained Uber and similar ride-hailing services have an unfair advantage because they are not covered by regulations that affect the established industry. In December, the Shanghai city government detained and fined 12 unlicensed drivers who received business through the Didi Dache app. In South Korea, the chief executive of Uber’s local subsidiary was charged in December with operating an unlicensed transport company. Police in New Delhi say they are considering similar charges. A French court has ordered Uber to remove from its app any language suggesting it was legal for its drivers to act like taxis."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999719/grab-philippines-brian-cu-ltfrb-regulation-of-tncs","title":"Grab head welcomes LTFRB regulation of ride-hailing firms","date":"05:40 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country.","body":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country. “The new Department Order, which we welcome, strengthens Grab’s position that the fare structure with the P2 per minute component is legal,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement.  “Since the [issuance of] DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr [Department of Transportation] and the LTFRB,” he added.

The general director of land transportation, Djoko Sasono, said on Thursday evening that the ministry had issued a prohibition letter signed by transportation ministry Ignatitus Jonan on Nov. 9.  “Following the rise in the number of motor vehicles that are not official public transportation and carry people and goods based on internet applications, we took actions to prohibit them,” he said at a press conference on Thursday evening as reported by kompas.com. “Whatever the name, the operations similar to Go-Jek, Go-Box, GrabBike, GrabCar, Blue Jek, Lady Jek are all prohibited.”  He said that that the operation of application-based transportation did not meet the requirements of a 2009 law on traffic and public transportation and a 2014 government regulation on public transportation. The Ministry also sent the prohibition letter to the National Police and all local administrations and local police across the country.  “The requirements of public transportation are [that the vehicles] have at least three wheels, have legal standing and possess a public transportation business permit,” he said. Djoko said he did not mind start-up businesses. Still, he stressed that it would be a problem if private vehicles were used as unlicensed public transportation. Home-grown Gojek launched its application in Android and iOS in January and has been downloaded at least 5 million times as of Thursday. It competed directly with Malaysia-based GrabBike, which also provided service with automobiles as GrabCar. US-based Uber also found popularity among the Jakartans in the past year as its costs are cheaper than regular taxis. Online-based transportation has been serving people in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Bali and other big cities with more than 20,000 drivers.

Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/285726/grab-must-return-p14m-to-riders-pay-p2-m-fine","title":"Grab must return P14M to riders, pay P2-M fine","date":"05:30 AM December 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year. Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

The LTFRB accredited Hype, giving app-based drivers as well as commuters an alternative to Grab, and eliminating Grab’s “virtual monopoly” of the industry that apparently followed after its acquisition of its rival Uber last month.  LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III noted, however, that it would be up to Hype and other TNCs they would later accredit how they would market themselves to lure drivers and commuters to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  Bu LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said drivers would still need to obtain accreditation from their chosen TNC for accountability purposes. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to accrediation from the LTFRB, namely: Hirna, Go Lag, Micab, and Owto.  Delgra said they hope to accredit the other applicants once they have complied with the LTFRB’s requirements. For one, he said, these TNCs must show proof that they are able to accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry to the ride-hailing industry comes amid mounting complaints against Grab for its high fare and picky drivers. Brian Cu, Grab’s country head, has nevertheless assured the public that apart from passenger complaints mechanisms, they have in place in their system the ability to detect and determine if a driver is deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip.

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

Grab Philippines is already preparing to revive GrabBike, a service the government had stopped nearly four years ago since there were no guidelines then. Lawmakers have yet to pass a bill that would legalize motorcycle-taxis, while regulators still needed to conclude a pilot test that would determine if motorbikes were safe for public transport.  But with perception over motorcycle-taxis changing over the last few years due to public outcry over unreliable mass transport and road bottlenecks, Grab said it was ready to provide solutions. “We’re getting ready on our end in case it opens up. We’re setting up our training facilities, the design of the jackets and materials that are needed, training the trainers, but we haven’t trained the drivers yet,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu.  Cu told reporters last week on the sidelines of the launch of GrabKitchen that the firm was willing to invest and train drivers, but they needed certainty on the fate of motorbikes. He said Grab intended to maximize the 15,000-rider cap set by the government. To do so, he said the firm would allow its current fleet of bikers, or the 20,000 GrabFood partners, to also use GrabBike.  Demand for GrabFood usually has a down time at certain points of the day, usually after lunch. The rider can then opt to switch to providing GrabBike services. Asked why the ride hailing giant would still venture into motorcycle-taxis, he said it was a “natural fit” for a firm operating in congested urban areas like Metro Manila. GrabBike is also present in other countries, such as Vietnam. If plans fall into place, the move will allow Grab Philippines to further expand its presence in the life of the commuting public, even at a time when the ride hailing giant has been flagged by regulators for alleged privacy and competition violations. For now, Cu does not consider motorcycle-taxis, such as Angkas or JoyRide, competitors of Grab’s four-wheeled ride hailing services. “I think it serves a different market. So if you’re saying we’re competing with Angkas, or JoyRide, or with motorcycle taxis, it’s as if you’re saying we’re competing with the UV express, with the jeeps, with the trains,” he said.

In an online press briefing, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said that aside from the plastic dividers, they are also proposing to make motorcycle taxis “much like a shuttle service with pre-registered passengers for select companies.”  All these offers and more were submitted by Angkas to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), he added. According to Royeca, allowing Angkas to be a shuttle service for select companies will ensure contact tracing for those who might later test positive for SARS-COV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  “To date, Angkas has a base of four million users that can help add to the government’s contact tracing database,” the Angkas official said. Also, Royeca said Angkas proposed that passengers must provide their own helmet and face mask to limit contact between the rider and passenger.  Royeca further said all of their bikers will be subjected to COVID-19 testing. “We hope to work with the IATF and the Department of Health (DOH) to monitor the results and eventually recommend guidelines that can be adopted by both private motorcycles and motorcycle taxis alike. If the design is approved by the government and the medical experts, we commit to make the final shield design mold for free to the public,” Royeca expressed.

The San Francisco-based company expects to be valued at $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion, falling well below prior estimates that rose as high as $120 billion, in a sign that investors may be taking a more cautious approach to ride-hailing after the stock performance of Uber’s rival, Lyft.  Even so, Uber is on track for one of the largest IPOs in history. The company plans to sell 180 million shares for between $44 and $50 each. Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1324085/house-panel-backs-return-of-motorcycle-taxi-ops-in-gcq-areas","title":"House panel backs return of motorcycle taxi ops in GCQ areas","date":"12:56 PM August 19, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The House committee on transportation has endorsed the resumption of operations of motorcycle taxis in Metro Manila during general community quarantine (GCQ) in a move to augment public transportation in the nation’s capital region.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The House committee on transportation has endorsed the resumption of operations of motorcycle taxis in Metro Manila during general community quarantine (GCQ) in a move to augment public transportation in the nation’s capital region. The committee made the recommendation to the Department of Transportation (DoTr) and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) to allow the resumption of operations of motorcycle-hailing services such as Angkas as long as they follow health and safety protocols.  Samar Rep. Edgar Sarmiento, who chairs the transportation committee, said the move would help ease the burden of the commuting public. Sarmiento said committee members favor the use of the motorcycle taxis since it has lesser risk of multiple transmission because one motorcycle can only accommodate one passenger.  Contact tracing is also easier because all bookings are automatically logged into the system of the ride-hailing mobile app, said Sarmiento. “The panel sees the importance of providing accessible public transport now that we are  back to GCQ and many members of the committee feel that our motorcycle taxis could fill the gap  in our prevailing transportation vacuum due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Sarmiento said in a statement.  Sarmiento, however, underscored that strict health and safety protocols must be observed such as the mandatory wearing of face shields. The lawmaker added that riders must be well covered from head-to-toe while passenger helmets must be disinfected after each use and must be also equipped with replaceable headcovers. As an added precaution, Sarmiento said that riders should also be required to undergo COVID-19 testing and be certified as coronavirus-free before they are allowed on the road. Passengers on the other hand should fill up an online contact-tracing form before they are allowed to book a ride, Sarmiento added. President Rodrigo Duterte has placed Metro Manila, as well as the provinces of Laguna, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan, under GCQ from Aug. 19 to 31 after a two-week reimposition of a stricter modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) which banned the operations of motorcycle taxis."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283620/antitrust-body-fines-grab-p23m-orders-p5-m-refund-to-riders","title":"Antitrust body fines Grab P23M, orders P5-M refund to riders","date":"02:51 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments. “The PCC has imposed a total fine of P23.45 million on Grab for breaching its pricing commitments during the 1st to 3rd quarters of the initial undertaking,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan said Monday.

For transparency, Balisacan said the company must also put in place a system-wide average fare cap to limit Grab’s ability “to unreasonably increase fares beyond pre-transaction levels.”  “While Grab’s commitments signal its willingness to behave within a competitive space and in accordance with the competition law, the PCC will keep a watchful eye on potential violations,” Balisacan said.

It would take some time, however, before customers get any compensation under what is called the “disgorgement mechanism,” the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said in a press briefing on Monday.  Essentially a state-mandated refund, the disgorgement will have a lag time of about two months after the PCC issues its order, assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration. Grab riders will see the overcharges refunded in their GrabPay accounts.  Investopedia defines disgorgement as an act of repayment for an ill-gotten gain, but this jargon can barely capture how many riders feel whenever faced by the daily dilemma of choosing either Grab’s unreasonably high prices or the poorly managed and outdated modes of public transportation. “That’s the concept of the disgorgement. It is something that is not due you but you obtained, and it is really because you are exercising market power,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  The PCC ruled on the refund of overcharges more than a year after Grab bought out Uber in Southeast Asia. Uber, however, is a minority shareholder in Grab. “So if you were not dominant, if you were not a monopoly, you should not have been able to impose this kind of excessive fare,” Bernabe added. The disgorgement forms part of a revised set of government conditions that the PCC had to renegotiate with Grab starting August, after the company’s operations remained problematic despite PCC’s earlier efforts to curb its anticompetitive behavior. August also marked the first year of Grab’s voluntary commitments to the PCC, in which the company’s operations were monitored for four consecutive quarters. Only the results of the monitoring for the first nine months were released so far, and the PCC said it fined Grab a total of P23.45 million for essentially overcharging its riders during this time.  But a little more than P5 million of this amount would be refunded to Grab riders, since the conditions imposed on the company were revised late into the monitoring period. Assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration, customers can use their refunds sometime in January next year, since the order was only issued this November. But the money will only be paid back as fast as Grab is willing to cooperate. So far, Grab Philippines has filed motions to reconsider the fines in the first six months of supervision, although the antitrust body has upheld the fines. Asked for comment, the company said it would now pay accordingly for the penalties imposed by the PCC so far. This means payment of P11.3 million in fine for Aug. 10, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018, and P7.1 million for Nov. 11, 2018, to Feb. 10, 2019; and P5.05 million in refund for Feb. 11 to May 10. Results of the fourth quarter monitoring—covering May 11 to August—have yet to be released. The fines declined over the months that the PCC monitored Grab, suggesting a disconnect between its compliance with the antitrust body and the improvement many riders hardly felt. A violation could lead to a fine of up to P2 million per breach, a separate fine from the refund that Grab should give back to its customers, the PCC said. The revised commitments for pricing will extend for one more year starting this month. Other conditions, such as those allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing apps, will be extended for four years. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); All this is in an effort to enable a viable player to enter the market and compete with Grab. There are other players in the market, but PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan has noted that Grab Philippines still controls “almost 99 percent” of the market. According to Bernabe, the PCC needs to give new companies more time to grow, since the entry of a big player does not necessarily mean a big enough competitor. Gojek, for example, has gained only 15 percent of the market in Singapore within a year, despite pouring a lot of resources into the market, Bernabe said. The company is trying to enter the Philippines but has been set back by government regulations. “We have observed that the competition in the marketplace has not really improved. And we don’t know if this will improve within a one-year period because the competition will depend on new entrants coming in or existing players growing bigger,” Bernabe said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1364257/angkas-allowed-to-resume-ops-under-extended-motorcycle-taxi-pilot-study","title":"Angkas allowed to resume ops under extended motorcycle-taxi pilot study","date":"02:41 PM November 24, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas is now allowed to operate back on Metro Manila roads under the extended motorcycle taxi pilot study.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas is now allowed to operate back on Metro Manila roads under the extended motorcycle taxi pilot study.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday issued a cease-and-desist order against OWTO as it had not yet been granted an accreditation to operate as a transportation network company (TNC).  OWTO, which presents itself as a “fair,” “safe” and “Filipino” TNC, should first consult with regulating bodies about the requirements for accreditation, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada. “Before anyone offers anything to the general public, particularly these TNCs, they must present their business design to the regulatory body. That is the LTFRB,” Lizada told reporters on Saturday.  “They need to know what are the things and the requirements na dapat makita ng mga riders sa app. They cannot just do it on their own without consulting the proper government agency,” she stressed. Lizada said that the accreditation of TNCs are still open, but processing of applications for Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) providers are still suspended.  The new TNC was reported to have scheduled a press conference on Dec. 18 at Amo Gastropub on Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City. Lizada said the firm should postpone the conference. “To the organizers of OWTO, it is best that you coordinate with the LTFRB before you do any press conference, before you do any packaging, before you do any marketing, because you need to know the basic requirements the law requires,” Lizada said. In a Facebook page post on Dec. 5, OWTO branded itself as a TNC that would give riders “reasonable value-for-money fares.” “It also empowers the driving partners with equitable take-home pays through the company’s lower commission take-out schemes. Life is fair with OWTO, you know,” the company said. The firm added that it would commit and comply with the government’s rules and regulations for the “greater good of the public.”  “Christmas time is fast approaching. Guess who’s coming to town? It’s definitely not for the naughty ones but for the ones who play it nice,” the company said on Facebook.

But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1318150/1000-angkas-drivers-to-provide-free-rides-for-health-frontliners-in-metro-manila","title":"1,000 Angkas drivers to provide free rides for health frontliners in Metro Manila","date":"02:45 PM August 07, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas has assigned its 1,000 riders to transport medical frontliners in Metro Manila to their workplaces and on their way home for free, amid the suspension of mass transport in Metro Manila and nearby provinces under the modified enhanced community quarantine.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas has assigned its 1,000 riders to transport medical frontliners in Metro Manila to their workplaces and on their way home for free, amid the suspension of mass transport in Metro Manila and nearby provinces under the modified enhanced community quarantine.   Under the Free Motorcycle Ride Project for Medical Frontliners program of the ride-hailing service, the 1,000 Angkas riders who will provide free rides to health workers will be assigned near the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, and Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Based on an agreement between the Joint Task Force COVID Shield and Angkas, some Angkas riders will also be on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, and in Ospital ng Maynila and Fabella Hospital in Manila.  Task Force Commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said Friday that medical workers on their way home may approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of a free ride. Aside from this initiative, Angkas also turned over 1,000 protective barriers to the task force, which will help facilitate the distribution of the materials to qualified riders.  Eleazar said the barriers will be forwarded to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified recipients. He said motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives, and friends who work as medical frontliners will be prioritized in the distribution. According to Eleazar, this initiative from Angkas is “a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic.” “We in the JTF COVID Shield believe that there are a lot of people out there who continue to extend assistance to their troubled kababayans as revealed by the countless good deeds that we regularly see in the social media since the entire country was placed in community quarantine,” he said. The government has earlier allowed motorcycle pillion riding for essential workers or authorized persons outside of residence under MECQ, provided that they install protective barriers in the motorcycles and follow minimum health protocols. The motorcycle that should be used should also be privately-owned and not for hire. Previously, only married couples and live-in partners were allowed for motorcycle pillion riding, a limitation set in place to help prevent the further spread of the coronavirus disease. The quarantine status in Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal were reverted back to MECQ following the appeal of the medical community for a “timeout” amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases under eased quarantine guidelines."},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/16432/netizen-ride-hailing-app-vs-the-lowly-jeepney-ride","title":"Netizen: Ride-hailing app vs the lowly jeepney ride","date":"12/18/2019","snippet":"","body":"VIRAL ngayon ang rant ni Angelo Ray with a Twitter handle of @artsybeaver as he compares the whopping fare difference between commuting using a ride hailing app and via jeepney.

But with public transportation still insufficient to ferry all commuters going back to work, bike-hailing companies like Angkas are lobbying to allow anew backriding although with even more additional safety precautions.  During a press briefing on Friday, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca unveiled their prototypes for a “backpack shield,” or high-density acrylic shields strapped to the back of the driver, to isolate them from passengers. The design is similar to the ones introduced by Jakarta’s bike drivers when it, too, laxed travel restrictions to revive its economy. They’re low-cost, drag-resistant, and deliberately sourced to minimize additional injury to the riders in cases of accidents.  “It’s not a question of whether we want to resume operations, but how we can help out in this crisis,” Royeca said. Since March, Angkas and the two other bike-hailing companies in the country, JoyRide and MoveIt, have been forced to pivot to food and item deliveries to help their drivers cope with the pandemic.  “Now that most people are allowed to return to work, our riders are excited to ferry passengers again, since that’s really what constitutes much of their income,” he added. For former Quezon Rep. Winnie Castelo, the times call for the need “to be more creative under this crisis.” The backpack shields are still in their prototype stage, as Angkas continues to study its aerodynamics and material to minimize physical harm to the riders. Castelo suggests to modify the speed limit for bikes to reduce the chances of road accidents. For Dr. Jun Belizario, dean of the University of the Philippines-College of Public Health, the shields are not a 100-percent guarantee against contracting the virus, “but it can help.” “We cannot wait for a vaccine to come before motorcycle taxis are allowed to operate again,” Belizario added. “We are suffering because of a lack of opportunities to earn a living compounded by the lack of public transport opportunities during the quarantine.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1113172/ltfrb-to-review-grabs-p50-cancellation-fee","title":"LTFRB to review Grab’s P50 cancellation fee","date":"05:09 AM May 03, 2019","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will review Grab’s P50 penalty for passengers who cancel rides.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will review Grab’s P50 penalty for passengers who cancel rides.

Grab president Brian Cu announced the imposition of the cancellation fee early this week  to “create a better ride-hailing ecosystem where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the platform.”  Under the new policy, GrabCar passengers who terminate a ride 5 minutes after getting a driver, or fail to show up at their designated pickup points within 5 minutes after the driver’s arrival, will be charged P50. The waiting period is shorter for those who book a GrabShare ride: 3 minutes.  The fee applies the next time the passenger pays in cash. Passenger accounts can also be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel a ride twice within an hour, thrice in a day, or five times in a week. The fees do not apply if the driver cancels within 5 minutes; if the driver is not moving toward the pickup point; or if they take 15 minutes or longer than the estimated time of arrival. Wrongly charged fees may be refunded within 48 hours. Drivers who unreasonably cancel passenger bookings or are selective of their destinations can also be locked out of the platform if they excessively ignore or cancel requests.

It makes New York the first major US city to limit the number of app-based rides and to impose pay rules, with authorities under pressure to act over pollution and worsening congestion.  The financial capital of 8.5 million is the biggest app-ride market in the United States, where public transport woes and astronomical parking costs have helped fuel years of untamed growth by the likes of Lyft and Uber. But that growth has brought New York’s iconic yellow cabs to their knees and since December, six yellow-cab drivers have committed suicide.  Those deaths have been linked to desperation over plummeting income. The increased competition has slashed the value of yellow cab taxi licenses from more than $1 million in 2014 to less than $200,000 today. The bill stipulates a 12-month cap on all new for-hire-vehicle licenses, unless they are wheelchair accessible, as well as minimum pay requirements for app drivers – regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).  The TLC, which regulates taxis and is a powerful force in New York politics, commissioned a study recently in a bid to underscore the chaos and push city authorities into taking action. That report recommended a guaranteed income of $17.22 an hour for drivers – the city’s $15 minimum wage is due to come into effect at the end of 2018 – plus a supplement to mitigate against rest time. Uber hit back Wednesday, saying the 12-month pause would threaten one of the city’s “few reliable transportation options” – a swipe at a burgeoning subway crisis – “while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion.” “Uber will do whatever it takes to keep up with growing demand and we will not stop working with city and state leaders… to pass real solutions like comprehensive congestion pricing,” a spokesperson said. ‘Workers prevailed’  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, vowed to sign the bill into law, claiming that it would “stop the influx of cars contributing to the congestion grinding our streets to a halt.” “More than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation,” De Blasio said. It comes after the city was forced to shelve plans in 2015 to cap the number of vehicles operated by Uber, after the multibillion-dollar corporation fought tooth and nail against the legislation in a slick ad campaign. The Independent Drivers Guild, which represents more than 65,000 app-based drivers such as those from Lyft and Uber, on Wednesday celebrated. “Workers and New York leaders made history today. It’s not easy taking on Silicon Valley behemoths, but we kept on fighting for what we know is right and today the workers prevailed,” said executive director Ryan Price. Most drivers in New York work full time and are often immigrants without higher education. They get into heavy debt to buy their vehicle license and have little other means of generating income. Around 85 percent earn substantially less than the equivalent of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, according to the TLC-commissioned study. Around 80,000 drivers work for at least one of the big four app-based companies in New York, compared to 13,500 yellow cab drivers, it found. Last year, London’s transport authority stripped Uber of its license over safety concerns, but the corporation appealed the decision and was allowed to continue operating while the case was heard. In June, a British judge overturned the earlier decision and granted the ride-hailing app a 15-month permit.   /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/988698/grab-passengers-face-fine","title":"Grab passengers face fine","date":"07:24 AM May 09, 2018","snippet":"Amid mounting complaints by commuters against drivers, and vice versa, ride-hailing giant Grab said on Tuesday it might impose charges on passengers who would cancel their bookings, in the same way that Uber had.","body":"Amid mounting complaints by commuters against drivers, and vice versa, ride-hailing giant Grab said on Tuesday it might impose charges on passengers who would cancel their bookings, in the same way that Uber had. Cindy Toh, Grab marketing head, said the company might start charging the cancellation fees before July as part of its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and rider experience after acquiring Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  Toh said the company was keen on protecting not just its riders but also its driver-partners. “Of course when passengers cancel, the driver you book is already en route to your location. They spend money on that; that’s time away from their business,” she said.  Uber charge Uber used to impose charges based on how far the driver had already traveled before the trip’s cancellation, or when a rider cancels more than one ride within a short period of time.  Despite public impression that drivers are more likely to cancel bookings, figures from Grab show that drivers back off their commitments only 8 percent of the time, compared with 12 percent by passengers, according to Toh. She said the company had yet to set the amounts to be charged, as it was still studying various schemes, adding that it would only impose fees “within the limits” of the waiting time—the time a passenger’s ride is supposed to show up at the pickup point. Standard waiting time Grab currently does not impose any penalty on passengers who cancel bookings within the standard waiting time of seven minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare. Passengers who cancel three bookings after the waiting period get “deprioritized,” which means they should expect to be served later than others in their succeeding bookings.  Grab currently allows its drivers to cancel 5 percent of their trips. Those who cancel more than 10 percent may face sanctions such as suspension or blacklisting from the platform, Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said. Some patrons of the ride-hailing service expressed concern that some drivers might exploit the cancellation fees. Twenty-two-year-old Julian Elona, who uses Grab often to get from Manila to Eastwood, Quezon City, said the ride-hailing company needed to first protect passengers from abusive drivers before implementing such a scheme. “It might get to a point that if the driver and passenger disagree [on their arrangement], the driver might hold out on the rider who would then be forced to cancel and pay the fee,” Elona said. “What if you’re faced with picky drivers who force you to cancel, or if you’re rushing and have no choice but to cancel your booking? It might be unfair for the passengers,” said Jazzmin Carilla, a 21-year-old public relations writer and frequent Grab user. Commuters’ group The commuter welfare group, National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP), said it recognized that drivers, too, had rights against passengers who frequently canceled their trips. “However, [Grab] should first set guidelines on when it is acceptable to cancel a ride. Why should you be penalized if the driver cannot immediately fulfill your riding requirements?” said NCCSP head Maricor Akol. “There must be a standard time allotment wherein passengers are allowed to cancel … [but] at the same time, [Grab] has to come out with a comprehensive plan to issue penalties so the riding public cannot renege on their bookings,” Akol added. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Of the five other transport network companies (TNCs)—Owto, Micab, Hirna, GoLag and Hype—only Owto charges a cancellation fee, which amounts to P50. Grab, Hype, GoLag, Owto and Micab were recently allowed to operate in Metro Manila and other large urban areas, while Hirna is available in Pampanga province and the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Iligan, Davao and Iligan. Go Jek An Indonesian TNC, Go Jek, has also expressed interest in challenging Grab’s domination in the Philippines. Aileen Lizada, board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, noted that Go Jek had been used to charging unregulated surge rates of up to five times in Indonesia. “I told them that here, up to times two only. I asked them if they could survive. They said they need to study [Philippine regulations],” Lizada said. “Go Jek is big, so we need to study [their application] well as we need to protect the local players,” she added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1028933/grab-owto-hype-allowed-to-charge-p2-per-minute-travel-fee","title":"Grab, Owto, Hype allowed to charge P2 per minute travel fee","date":"06:05 AM September 06, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has authorized transport network companies (TNCs) Grab, Owto and Hype to charge riders a P2-per-minute travel fee, citing the need to adjust fares to maintain the ride-hailing industry’s viability.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has authorized transport network companies (TNCs) Grab, Owto and Hype to charge riders a P2-per-minute travel fee, citing the need to adjust fares to maintain the ride-hailing industry’s viability. Signed on Tuesday, the board’s Memorandum Circular No. 2018-19 also ordered all TNCs to issue electronic receipts showing the fare breakdown.  The order would take effect 15 days after its publication in a national newspaper, according to LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III. The memorandum is applicable only to TNCs with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) or private vehicles that can be booked for solo or carpooled rides. Of the six ride-hailing apps accredited by the LTFRB, only Grab and local players Owto and Hype offer TNVS.  Fare components The others — GoLag, Micab and Hirna — are taxi-hailing TNCs which already have the P2-per-minute travel fee integrated into their fares following the recalibration of their meters, a process which started in July.  At present, all TNCs share the same fare components: a P40 base fare, a P10- to P14-per-kilometer rate, a price surge of up to two times the regular rate, and the now-authorized travel rate. The LTFRB memorandum also meant that Grab, which was earlier ordered to pay a fine of P10 million for unilaterally imposing the P2-per-minute travel fee, could now reinstate it. Drivers complain Grab drivers earlier complained that since the suspension of the travel charge in April, their income had dropped considerably due to rising fuel prices. The memorandum was issued on the same day the board reversed a July 9 order directing Grab to reimburse passengers who were charged the travel fee through rebates for future rides.  However, the LTFRB stood firm on the P10-million fine it imposed on the company. In reaction, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said the TNC would file an appeal in connection with the stiff penalty, this time in the Department of Transportation. The board’s decision authorizing the travel rate partly stemmed from calls made by House transportation committee chair and Catanduanes Rep. Cesar Sarmiento, Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon and Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo on behalf of the drivers. For TNVS coalition head Winson Esteras, having the fee approved was just the first step in keeping drivers’ incomes sustainable amid fuel price increases and rising inflation."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1126444/taxi-park-in-jams-mexico-citys-zocalo-to-protest-ride-apps","title":"Taxi park-in jams Mexico City’s Zocalo to protest ride apps","date":"07:26 AM June 04, 2019","snippet":"MEXICO CITY – Taxi drivers snarled traffic in downtown Mexico City on Monday in their latest protest against Uber and other ride-hailing apps.","body":"MEXICO CITY – Taxi drivers snarled traffic in downtown Mexico City on Monday in their latest protest against Uber and other ride-hailing apps.

The protesters want the apps banned, arguing that the apps are unfair competition because those drivers are more loosely regulated and don’t have to pay licensing fees. Several cabbies said the ride-hailing apps have cost them 40% of their earnings.  But many Mexico City residents say the apps provide a service superior to that of most taxis, in terms of safety, reliability and comfort, and are competitive on price.

This is to allow other operators to participate in the pilot run, the DOTr said in a statement Tuesday.  Last June, a six-month pilot run was approved in aid of legislation for Congress to further evaluate pending bills seeking to legalize the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles (PUVs). The pilot run was originally set to end on Dec. 26. The extension, however, will be an “expansion of the study” by allowing new motorcycle taxi service providers to participate in the pilot run to give the riding public more choices and push operators to provide a “higher standard of service,” TWG chairperson Antonio Gardiola Jr. said.  Last Nov. 20, the DOTr heard proposals from six other motorcycle-ride hailing firms, namely Citimuber, JoyRide, MoveIt, EsetGo, Sakay, and VroomGo. All were keen on participating in the pilot run. The extension of the pilot run will also provide the TWG more time to widen the scope of their study on appropriate standards and capacities for motorcycles to be considered safe, convenient, and eligible for franchise.  “We want to determine their operational readiness and compliance”, Gardiola said. “We also want to determine whether or not motorcycles are really a safe and viable form of public transportation. That is always our priority — the safety, security, and comfort of the riding public,” he added. The TWG has already submitted its recommendation, and a decision on the proposed extension is due for release in the coming days. The TWG was created to primarily gather data and determine the viability of motorcycles as a safe mode of public transportation. It is composed of representatives from the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office (LTO), and the Inter-Agency Council for Traffic (I-ACT).  Commuter group asks DOTr to publicize Angkas pilot run findings The commuter group The Passenger Forum (TPF) has appealed to the DOTr to reveal to the public its findings on Angkas’ six-month pilot run to let the public know the “exact data on the safety, viability, and the effects on road traffic of motorcycle taxis.” “We are hoping that they will not wait for us to write a Freedom of Information request before making the material public,” TPF Convenor Primo Morillo said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that their group also wants to find out Angkas’ compliance with the 60 kilometer-per-hour speed limit, the 10-work hour per day limit, accident insurance coverage and the company’s compliance with the fare matrix set by DOTr. Morillo said they will conduct a survey asking motorcycle taxi passengers about their experience during the Angkas pilot run."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1204497/riders-warn-of-going-back-to-habal-habal-amid-ltfrbs-10000-bikers-limit","title":"Riders warn of going back to ‘habal-habal’ amid LTFRB’s 10,000 bikers limit","date":"01:34 PM December 22, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Biker-partners of ride-hailing firm Angkas at risk of getting laid off due to a new government policy during the extended pilot run of motorcycle taxis may just have to return to being colorum riders or “habal-habal”.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Biker-partners of ride-hailing firm Angkas at risk of getting laid off due to a new government policy during the extended pilot run of motorcycle taxis may just have to return to being colorum riders or “habal-habal”.

Galing kami sa mga habal-habal, galing sa pagsasakay nang ilegal,” Romeo Maglunsod, an Angkas biker-partner, said in a press conference in Quezon City.

Parang mag-uunderground lang kami,” he added. (So they will not essentially take our livelihood from us. We will just go underground.)  The extended pilot run will start on Monday, December 23, which means that 17,000 of the total 27,000 riders of Angkas would be rendered jobless from this point since LTRFB imposed a limit of 10,000 bikers per transport network company (TNC) for Metro Manila and 3,000 bikers per TNC for Metro Cebu. Two new motorcycle taxi service providers will join Angkas during the prolonged pilot run in the National Capital Region. The extended Motorcycle Taxi Pilot Implementation will on March 23, 2020. Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection President Ariel Inton said the recent move of the government to impose a cap on the number of bikers will “result in chaos in the streets” as riders may opt for illegal activities. “Nasa legal na sila and you’re turning them back in the end in doing something illegal just because of setting a cap without any study,” he said in the same press conference. Sunday’s #SaveAngkas Unity Gathering was held at the Kalayaan Shrine along Edsa.  Senator Imee Marcos attended the rally and urged authorities to stop the pilot testing “in the spirit of Christmas” and instead come out with the decision on whether or not to recognize motorcycle taxi as a public utility vehicle (PUV). Marcos earlier filed Senate Bill No. 409, seeking to legitimize and regulate motorcycles for hire as PUVs. “Matatapos na itong pilot testing, hanggang ngayon hindi pa sila nagdedesisyon. Sa diwa ng Pasko, nananawagan ako sa ating mga awtoridad na tigilan na itong mga pilot testing na kunyari mas safe pero hindi naman safe,” she told reporters in an interview in the sidelines of the event. (The pilot testing was supposed to end soon but until now authorities have not yet decided on the legitimacy of motorcycles as PUVs. In the spirit of Christmas, I am calling on authorities to stop this pilot testing that pretends to be safer but it’s not.) “Kinukuhanan ang labing-pitong libong riders ng kanilang hanapbuhay at higit sa lahat, nawawalan ng trabaho at ‘yun pa, napipinsala pa at naha-hassle pa ang sangkatutak na Christmas shoppers at ang publiko,” she added.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and Joint Task Force COVID Shield commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar received the donations.  All forms of public transportation are banned from Aug. 3 to Aug. 18, as the national government reverted Metro Manila and the nearby provinces to MECQ in response to health-care workers’ call for a “timeout,” to ease the pressure of rising COVID-19 cases on hospitals. “While they call this a timeout, this is a time for us to reinforce and help our health-care workers,” Año said. “This does not mean they’ll be taking a break—their work continues and they will find it harder to get to work because of the lack of public transportation.”  Eleazar identified the 10 hospitals whose front-liners may avail themselves of the free rides: the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, East Avenue Medical Center, Ospital ng Sampaloc, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, Quezon City General Hospital, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, Quirino Memorial Medical Center and Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital. He said, “The hospitals that [the] DOH (Department of Health) [has] listed are in Metro Manila, but Angkas riders can also [transport] them (front-liners) to nearby provinces, especially those under MECQ, if that’s where they live.”  The PNP will distribute the barrier shields donated by Angkas to medical front-liners who use motorcycles to go to work, Eleazar said. According to Angkas, the riders will be on standby at the partner hospitals at the end of the health-care workers’ shifts. The Angkas service will run until Aug. 18, the end of MECQ. Health-care workers in the provinces who object to the government’s plan to deploy them to Metro Manila should be “professional” and honor their oath to save lives, Malacañang said on Friday. “Although I am a lawyer, if you are a professional, you should know what to do. As a doctor, as a medical professional, their job is to save lives,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said.  He added: “I believe that our front-liners will be true to their sworn duty.” Roque made the remarks after some health-care workers and doctors who are part of the “Doctors to the Barrios” program opposed a plan by the DOH to pull them out of their communities to augment Metro Manila’s fatigued front-line workforce. They warned that this deployment will put geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas at risk of COVID-19 transmission. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said, “We are doctors and we are working in government. We took an oath to protect the health of our country.

Galvez said the plan was discussed in a recent meeting that he, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and presidential spokesperson Harry Roque had with President Duterte. Angkas to resume operations has also earned the support of Vince Dizon, president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, who is serving as the government’s so-called testing czar in charge of overseeing the setup of coronavirus testing centers across the country. Dizon is also the presidential adviser on flagship programs and projects.  Earlier, Metro Manila mayors requested the IATF, the temporary body overseeing the government’s response to the health crisis, to allow the return of motorcycle taxis. On Monday, the task force endorsed to the House transportation committee a suggestion to extend the testing period for motorcycle taxis as regulators consider their legalization as a mode of public transport. George Royeca, Angkas’ chief transport advocate, said “we are ready and eager to serve, especially our commuters who are required to go back to work but are faced with a critical shortage in public transportation.”  Angkas, he said, recorded “not a single incident of virus transmission” when its motorcycles were tapped to provide rides for health-care workers during the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. In July, Angkas and another motorcycle ride-hailing company, JoyRide, pushed for the use of wearable plastic barriers to help prevent virus transmission between drivers and passengers, but the idea was eventually dropped. Also on Thursday, Roque said the President would hold a Cabinet meeting on Monday next week to discuss how restrictions on economic activities could be further eased. “We will revisit [the proposal to reduce] the 1-meter distancing in public transportation to .75 meters. The President has called for a full Cabinet meeting on Oct. 12 to discuss all these concerns,” the Palace official said. Citing a briefing given early this week by acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua, Roque pointed out that “we are only at 30 percent [capacity] in transportation because of that one-meter rule.’’ “So we need another 20 percent to help reopen the economy if we will remain [under] general community quarantine,” he said. “We will be discussing if we can further ease restrictions on the economy and open it up to 75 percent in Metro Manila and nearby provinces, where our economy is heavily dependent on.” —REPORTS FROM MARIEJO S.

Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest.  Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1056789/list-grab-ph-controversies-and-issues","title":"LIST: Grab PH controversies and issues","date":"04:56 PM November 24, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.","body":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.

De Guzman is in critical condition after an accident in a Grab ride, causing him to sustain “severe traumatic brain injury.” A viral Facebook post from Marko’s cousin, Steffi de Guzman, said Marko and his friend, Alia booked a Grab car last Oct. 26 along Taft Avenue, Manila. She said the Grab ride was allegedly running too fast and was driven by a sleepy Grab driver.  She then said the Grab car collided into another car before crashing into a Light Rail Transit (LRT) post. Marko, then sustained a fractured skull after the incident. With the incident, Grab said they are constantly communicating and offering financial assistance to Marko’s family. An investigation was also launched as both drivers affected were facing “court arraignment.” READ: Grab says it is ‘continuously reaching out’ to support critically hurt rider ‘System downtime’ The ride-hailing company also faced technical issues such as the recent glitch on its computation of fares.  Last Oct. 25, its application experienced a glitch, making the fares decrease to a minimum on all services regardless of the overall distance of the trip. GrabCar and GrabShare fares were at P80 pesos while its six-seater services were at P120.

READ: Grab PH probes cause of ‘system downtime’ glitch LTFRB penalty This year, the company also received a P10-million penalty as imposed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for overcharging its customers. The LTFRB revealed in a document that Grab must reimburse its passengers for the P2-per-minute travel charge through rebates. READ: LTFRB orders Grab to pay P10M for overcharging customers Grab then, filed a motion for reconsideration to reverse the LTFRB decision, claiming the decision was “contrary to law” as Grab followed the Department of Transportation Order (DO) 2015, which allows ride-hailing firms to set their own fares. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, after Grab changed their fare structure, a DO was released, DO 17, which states that transport network companies should have “pre-arranged fare as per the LTFRB.” Grab explained that the LTFRB failed to establish that DO 2015 “has been impliedly repealed by any subsequent issuances of DOTr.” READ: Grab appeals P10-M fine for overcharging customers P12-million fine vs Grab merger violations Aside from the LTFRB, the country’s anti-trust body, Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), also fined Grab in its merger with Uber for causing “undue difficulties” that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal. Last October, PCC imposed a P12-million fine against Grab after violating pre-merger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber was also fined P4 million for the same set of violations.

After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1217885/dotr-twg-raises-motorcycle-taxi-pilot-run-biker-cap-to-15000-per-operator","title":"DOTr-TWG: Motorbike taxi rider cap in NCR up to 15,000 per firm","date":"07:47 AM January 22, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) Technical Working Group tasked to oversee the motorcycle taxi pilot run has agreed to raise the biker cap from 10,000 to 15,000 per service provider","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) Technical Working Group tasked to oversee the motorcycle taxi pilot run has agreed to raise the biker cap from 10,000 to 15,000 per service provider This is after the TWG met with the three ride-hailing firms – Angkas, JoyRide and MoveIt on Tuesday afternoon and agreed on certain guidelines for the pilot run, TWG chairman Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Antonio Gardiola Jr. revealed Wednesday.  The TWG earlier imposed a 39,000 overall biker cap for motorcycle taxi operations, where operators will be allowed to have 10,000 bikers each for Metro Manila and 3,000 bikers each for Metro Cebu. “On the part of the TWG and DOTr, we also conceded on some points by raising the cap. Originally, we have that 39,000 total cap for areas in Metro Manila and Cebu, ngayon po ay tinataas natin yan for Metro Manila, each player will have 15,000 each and for Metro Cebu, they will have the same, 3,000 each,” Gardiola said in an interview on ABS CBN News Channel.  During the meeting, Gardiola said the three firms also agreed to withdraw all cases filed against the TWG and that no case will be filed against it during the course of the pilot run. “We agreed that all cases filed against the TWG will be withdrawn. They agreed on that. And during the period of the study, no cases will be filed, constraining the TWG on some aspects, especially on the guidelines. And another thing is that we agreed to a cap, that there must be a cap,” he said.  The meeting with the three operators came after the TWG earlier terminated – then resumed the motorcycle taxi pilot study. Shortly before a Senate hearing on Monday, Gardiola said the TWG recommended the termination of the pilot study and that motorcycle-taxis will be declared illegal and will be impounded.

However, affected customers—who currently number around 3.2 million—will receive anywhere between less than a peso to P100, depending on the cost of the rides they took during the four-month period.  That’s because only P5 million of the total P23.45-million fine imposed by the PCC can be disbursed among its customers, according to Grab legal counsel Miguel Aguila. The remaining P18 million will be paid directly to the Philippine government before Dec. 15, Aguila said.  Split evenly among affected Grab riders, P5 million would net each passenger an average of P1.50, the lawyer said, although computations are still being finalized to be proportionate to the amount spent on the ride. In short, a customer who spent P1,000 on Grab rides would potentially get 10 times more than one who spent just P100, Aguila said.  The affected passengers would be reimbursed via GrabPay wallet hopefully by December, he added. Grab country president Brian Cu maintained that the company had “always been compliant” with the fare matrix set and approved by transport regulators. Still, the company chose not to dispute the PCC’s decision meant to curb Grab’s monopolistic hold on the ride-sharing market, he added. Despite facing nine other players in the ride-hailing service sector, the company has cornered nearly 99 percent of the market, according to the PCC. But Cu admitted that Grab had “deviat(ed)” from the acceptable fares-in-range set by the PCC because of uncontrollable factors, among them the flux of Grab cars, booking demand and traffic conditions.  These factors affect the surge rate and the P2-per-2-minute travel time fees, the only two variables in the transport network vehicle services fare matrix, Cu said. The other components of the fare—the flagdown and per kilometer rate—are fixed at P40 and P13, respectively, he added. “We believe we have explained these factors to the PCC and articulated [their] potential effect on our current pricing,” the Grab official said. “However, we respect the decision of the board.” Cu assured riders that the firm would take on the fines in full instead of passing on the burden to its driver-partners and passengers. Several companies like Indonesian firm Go-Jek and Chinese Didi Chuxing are seen making an attempt to challenge Grab’s dominance of the local ride-hailing business, which has become increasingly lucrative due to the severe lack of mass transit options in urban areas."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/27223/uber-sets-sights-on-10-billion-ipo","title":"Uber Sets Sights on $10 Billion IPO","date":"03:17 AM April 12, 2019","snippet":"The global ride-hailing giant, Uber, is seeking a valuation close to $100 billion — an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the report said.","body":"The global ride-hailing giant, Uber, is seeking a valuation close to $100 billion — an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the report said.

On Wednesday, shares were trading down more than 10 percent from the $72 offering price.

It has to, under this much scrutiny. It’s policing the drivers made social-media-famous for overcharging or the all-too-common and obnoxious practice of leaving would-be riders hanging without canceling the rides they booked. But it’s a numbers game, according to Grab Philippines head Brian Cu, with 600,000 ride demands daily and only 35,000 drivers to satisfy them. And the passengers are always on the losing end—it’s either they can’t book a ride, or they overspend when they do.  It’s not an entirely hopeless situation. We may have said goodbye to Uber—which is sorely missed and generally considered to be the lesser of evils when it came to ride-hailing apps—but as of today the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has approved operations for a total of five of these companies, with the goal of challenging the monopoly that Grab has on the market. But we can’t fail to notice that in doing so, the government is expecting these companies to relieve the burden on the Filipino commuter, a band-aid solution if there ever was one, because we don’t necessarily take cabs for the sake of blowing money on a solo ride. It’s most often because the lines and the general inconvenience of public transport are a huge deterrent. Bridges and bypass roads under the “Build, build, build” project are expected to improve the situation, with the Department of Public Works and Highways claiming to foresee a “drastic improvement” in road traffic conditions by 2020. There are also reports that traffic has improved slightly on Edsa in the last month. But it seems that even with better traffic, we still can’t help our commuters find an immediate way to go from point to point without them enduring the Hunger Games for flagging down rides or getting on jeeps or buses. A recent example: A road incident last Monday was enough to cause hours of traffic, with commuters forced to walk kilometers to get home.  Maybe more trains, better trains, or new trains in other areas are the solution, but these aren’t going to happen in the next six months, so in the meantime there’s an unreasonable drain on commuters’ time, productivity and income, as well as a real and unavoidable cause of unhappiness. And those who opt to buy cars to avoid commuting—described by many Filipinos as the “worst part” of their day—are not helping, but just contributing to Metro Manila’s “carmageddon.” App-based transport services themselves add to the traffic, with up to 15,000 cars added on the road per day. It’s a vicious cycle, and not one to be improved by infrastructure alone, or by regulating ride-hailing apps which are privately owned and whose prices aren’t subject to strict regulation. It’s time to stop blaming Grab and other private companies for what should be a government responsibility.  kchuarivera@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/123415/disservice-to-commuters","title":"Disservice to commuters","date":"05:08 AM August 19, 2019","snippet":"Developments last week have been favorable to the commuting public, which has long been suffering from a near monopoly in the ride-hailing sector.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) started by pointing out that a year after Uber left, ride-hailing has remained uncompetitive, referring to Grab as the very dominant player in this service. A virtual monopoly leaves the riding public with no alternative. Competition, on the other hand, forces players to improve efficiency and lower prices. The near-monopoly position of Grab explains the numerous complaints on fare surges even beyond rush hours, canceled bookings and other aggravations that riders have to endure since no alternative service exists.  At about the same time as the PCC announcement, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta) called out the the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for sitting on the applications of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. The next day, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade directed the LTFRB to approve all complete but pending applications of these ride-hailing drivers. The Department of Transportation ordered the LTFRB to immediately release certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to qualified ride-hailing driver-applicants. Tugade also directed Transportation Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon and the LTFRB to comply immediately with Arta’s directive to automatically approve all pending TNVS applications and issue them the corresponding CPCs.  Arta’s action followed complaints from TNVS drivers alleging irregularities in the processing of their TNVS applications by the LTFRB. According to the complaints, their applications already had the complete requirements, but they could not operate as drivers and operators while waiting for the issuance of the CPCs. Aside from these developments, the PCC announced that it would also renegotiate the conditions that Grab had previously agreed to when it sought the PCC’s approval of the Grab-Uber deal, which resulted in the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia.  Those conditions, called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hope that they would improve market conditions, particularly the maintenance of reasonable fares that existed when Uber was still around. But those hoped-for improvements have not materialized. Exactly a year after PCC’s decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority lamented that the dominance of Grab (the surviving firm in the agreement with Uber) remains unchallenged, and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market. It said the market continues to be uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of smaller transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. The PCC gave only a hint of what the new commitments would be, saying they would include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its fare surges, instances of driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. The commitments should be designed to prevent Grab from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, according to PCC Chair Arsenio M.Balisacan. They may also include measures that will allow smaller players to grow, or for formidable new competitors to enter the market for the benefit of the riding public. Last year, PCC officials warned that Grab’s failure to comply with the commitments would be met with a fine of P2 million per breach, or even the “unwinding of the transaction.” It’s really a puzzle why the LTFRB appears to be acting in a way that commuters feel is against their interest, with the regulatory agency throwing up all possible roadblocks to the approval of more ride-hailing companies that can compete with Grab, or more driver-applicants to increase supply and bring rates down. It’s a good thing the PCC and Arta are keeping an eye on such government agencies that, by their continuing failure to protect commuters and do their job with dispatch, openness and efficiency, are a huge disservice to the public."},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/9004/ltfrb-denies-application-of-new-ride-hailing-company","title":"LTFRB denies application of new ride hailing company","date":"03/22/2019","snippet":"","body":" DENIED ang aplikasyon ng local subsidiary ng Go-Jek na makakuha ng accreditation bilang isang transport network company sa bansa.

The victim, Carla Antasuda, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in Quezon City on April 2, Police Major Elmer Monsalve of Quezon City Police District Crime and Detection Unit said over Teleradyo. Reports said Antasuda booked a ride through the ride-hailing app Grab past 11 p.m. at UP Techno Hub on April 1, to bring her home in Pasig City. She was able to book a Toyota Innova with plate number NDA-3563, driven by the suspect John Lester Alhambra.  The vehicle that arrived to pick her up, however, was a Mitsubishi Montero but with the same driver indicated on the app. Antasuda got inside the vehicle anyway, without knowing that another person, identified as Bryan Kennet Yumol, was hiding at the back.  The suspects later declared a holdup, but the victim resisted. She was stabbed several times and her body was thrown in a vacant lot in Barangay Sauyo, Novaliches, Quezon City. The victim’s remains were found at noon the next day. The two suspects were arrested later at night at the Sauyo Flea Market. Monsalve said that the Grab app was secure but some people find ways to take advantage. “Napaka-secure niyan. Kaya lang wala naman system na perfect. Nasa tao pa rin ang problema hindi sa platform. Ang problema mismo yung driver,” he said. (The app is secure, but no system is perfect. The problem is with the people, not the platform. The problem is with the driver.)  The police official suggested the riders to share their location to their family and friends through the Grab-tracking locator for their own safety. Alhambra and Yumol are now detained and facing charges of robbery with homicide.

Angkas Spokesperson George Royeca said in a press briefing the SC decision never deemed Angkas as something legal or illegal, thus, the company believes they are still allowed to operate.  “Tuloy po ang pagbabyahe ngayon.  Let me reiterate lang po ang TRO po galing sa Korte Suprema ay ukol po sa injunction na na-grant ng RTC (Regional Trial Court),” Royeca told reporters in a venue near the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) office in Quezon City. “So wala pong desisyon tungkol sa Angkas na pagiging ilegal o legal sa daan,” he added.  And despite orders from the LTFRB to arrest riders and impound Angkas motorcycles, the ride-hailing firm vowed to support their riders, especially as some use it as their main source of income. “Angkas has always been here to support its riding community.  So we will support all of our bikers to the extent of the law,” he explained.  “Kung ano po ang kailangan nating gawin para mailigtas yung ating biker, gagawin po natin, basta po nasa batas.  So if it is paying fines, anything around that […] tutulungan po namin ang mga bikers natin,” he added. Last December 5, the SC issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to “prevent an injustice against petitioners (LTFRB) whose regulatory powers were being pared down”. Following the SC’s TRO, law enforcers from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) started flagging down Angkas riders, who can easily be spotted through their helmets which bear the app’s name and brand. According to Royeca, Angkas will file its comments to SC’s ruling, hopeful the high court would favor their side. “We hope that we can still continue to serve the riding public, we hope that our 25,000 biker-riders would still be able to take care of their families, especially now that it is Christmas time,” Royeca said.  “We still remain very hopeful that the Supreme Court will see the merits of Angkas and hopefully will rule in our favor,” he added./kga RELATED STORIES SC temporarily stops Angkas operations LTFRB says traffic enforcers start apprehending Angkas drivers Several Angkas drivers already apprehended — LTFRB"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/107029/to-the-vet-or-grooming-salon-app-allows-owners-to-book-rides-for-pets","title":"To the vet or grooming salon?

An app allows owners to book unaccompanied rides for their pets, delivered by drivers who are trained in animal handling, as per news.com.au on Jan. 6.  The app was created by Australian business PetCloud, which is patterned after other ride-hailing services where you download the app and book a car or a taxi. Call it your Uber or Grab for your furry friends. Owners can also watch over their unaccompanied pets and make sure they’re safe by tracking the ride in real time on the app. But the service comes with its limits: it is only currently available in Australia and only portable animals can be serviced.  “We don’t have anyone offering horse floats or things like that — it’s not livestock transport,” Deb Morrison, CEO of PetCloud, said in the report. Morrison launched PetCloud five years ago, which began as a website and app to bring pet owners and pet sitters together. Now, it has evolved into a pet taxi service.  The app was intended for owners who may not have the time to drive their pets to appointments or owners who do not have vehicles, as per Morrison. It is also suited for persons with disabilities who are not be able to drive their pets. Vets and grooming salons can also book rides for pet owners for appointments. Pet owners must follow some rules should they book a ride for their pet. Dogs need to be in a body harness and with a leash upon pickup, whereas cats need to be in a carrier. “All pet taxi drivers have a pet car tether, that basically attaches to the car’s seat belt, and then the pet car tether clips on to body harness or cat carrier and they are placed on to the back seat of the car,” Morrison added. She believes the service would put a stop to appointment cancellations and no-shows since pets no longer have to depend on their owners to drive them to and fro. Although a niche service, this is not the first time a pet taxi service app was made available to the public. In 2015, a Singaporean startup launched PetMate, a transportation service that allows owners to also book rides for their pets through an app. Cody Cepeda/JB  RELATED STORIES: Dog missing for 3 weeks finds owner working in supermarket US town elects French Bulldog as mayor: ‘The most important election’"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/88811/uber-offers-riders-more-legroom-less-chatting-at-a-price","title":"Uber offers riders more legroom, less chatting at a price","date":"07:27 AM July 10, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Uber passengers can now get a more spacious ride and a less talkative driver — if they’re willing to shell out a few extra dollars.","body":"NEW YORK — Uber passengers can now get a more spacious ride and a less talkative driver — if they’re willing to shell out a few extra dollars. The ride-hailing giant launched “comfort” rides in dozens of cities Tuesday. Riders are guaranteed 36 inches of legroom in “newer” cars — meaning those that are under five years old — and they can request a preferred air temperature. Riders can also use the app to tell drivers they don’t want to chat, avoiding what some consider an awkward exchange.  Uber is responding to requests from business travelers and others who say they just want to work or rest quietly when they’re on their way to the airport. “It’s a way to set up an expectation up front…it takes some guess work out of the process,” said Aydin Ghajar, senior product manager at Uber.   In the early days of ride-hailing, when drivers for Uber and its main U.S. rival Lyft began picking up riders in their personal cars, riders were often chatty, asking the drivers lots of questions.  “It was so new and innovative that a lot of people were curious about other things they (drivers) did,” said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. “Over the years, it’s gotten more transactional.” Uber rolled out a “quiet mode” for Uber Black — its premium car service — in May, which left some drivers feeling like robots. “Some drivers like it, they don’t want to have to look at social cues,” Campbell said. “Other drivers feel that it’s a little dehumanizing…I do feel like in our society, everything is turning into an app, and we’re losing the lost art of conversation.” Comfort rides cost 20% to 40% more for time and distance charges than standard Uber X rides. The move could help Uber boost revenue, which could nudge the company closer to profitability.  “I think it would help maybe to boost those numbers up a little bit and maybe give some of the analysts on Wall Street something more to hang their hat on to remain bullish on the stock, based on the fact that the company still is not profitable,” said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust Company. Uber has yet to turn a profit and lost $1 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Executives have said it could take years to make money. It’s unknown whether the benefits offered by Uber Comfort will be enough to convince riders to cough up more cash. A five-year-old car is not really “newer,” it’s more “middle aged,” said Morgan. And at 6 feet, 5 inches tall, the additional legroom wouldn’t really be enough for Morgan — but it might be sufficient for people who are average height, he said. “They might try it once and see if it’s that much more of an improvement and worth it,” Morgan said. “If they can’t deliver it and it’s not that much more comfortable, then it’s like well, I’m not really going to pay up for it.” Uber declined to provide an average age for its drivers’ cars, and said age requirements for vehicles vary by city. Uber’s smaller rival Lyft offers “Lyft Lux” rides, which are in high-end sedans or SUVs with leather seats and more legroom. Lux cars are driven by drivers with a 4.85-star rating or above, and cost more than a standard Lyft ride or the company’s less-expensive Shared ride. But riders do not have the option of requesting a quiet, conversation-free ride. Uber already has some premium products that cost more than the basic Uber X. For example, Uber Black includes high-end cars driven by professional drivers and offers a “quiet mode.” Families or groups of six can choose Uber XL to get a van or SUV. Uber Select connects riders with highly rated drivers. On the other end of the spectrum, Uber Pool is the cheapest option, but riders have to share the car with passengers going to other destinations. Uber says its Uber Black product will generally cost more than Uber Comfort, but specific pricing will vary by city. Drivers who qualify for can make about 20% more on an Uber Comfort ride than Uber X ride, said Uber spokesman Steve Imm. But some drivers earned less during an Uber Comfort pilot, because their cars qualified for the pricier Uber Select or Uber XL options, and they couldn’t easily opt out of the Uber Comfort option, Campbell said. Drivers will now be able to opt out of Uber Comfort using the app, Imm said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/214601/grab-citi-forge-deal-cashless-payments","title":"Grab, Citi forge deal on cashless payments","date":"03:31 AM September 07, 2016","snippet":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting.","body":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting.

As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” said Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as a way for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region, enabling credit cardholders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions—in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depend on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam—markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards.

The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand.
