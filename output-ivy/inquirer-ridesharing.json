The announcement was made by Cat Avelino, Uber Philippines head of communications, on Friday as the company celebrated its fourth year of operations in the country.  The company, the local unit of San Francisco, United States-based Uber Technologies, currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, where it competes with main rival Grab. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines head of government relations and public policy, said there was growing demand in Pampanga, especially around the Clark Freeport Zone.  The Duterte administration has emphasized the development of Clark, which it sees as a solution to Metro Manila’s congestion woes. The Department of Transportation is currently expanding the Clark International Airport. It is also targeting to build a railway line linking Clark to Manila by 2022. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) earlier announced that the processing of driver applications would start on March 5. The moratorium was ordered since the LTFRB wanted a closer look at the ridesharing industry. It had been in place since July 2016.  Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) was capped at 65,000 for Metro Manila. Metro Cebu would get 1,500 cars while Pampanga was allowed 250 cars. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, who was present during the anniversary celebration, said the 65,000 cap in Metro Manila was enough to serve about 75 percent of the demand. She said there were currently around 59,000 ridesharing vehicles in the capital district serving around 52 percent of available demand. The cap would be reviewed every three months, Lizada noted. “We want to see the churn rate, we want to see the blacklisting of drivers,” Lizada said when asked about factors the LTFRB would review. For riders booking either Grab or Uber, the optimal waiting time should be two to three minutes instead of the current 10 to 15 minutes, she said. This will also be considered in the LTFRB’s regular review, she said. Uber Philippines said it serves around 1.6 million active riders and 32,000 drivers"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249456/ltfrb-hype-transport-system-tncs","title":"LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab","date":"11:30 PM April 18, 2018","snippet":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount.","body":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount. With the LTFRB’s accreditation of Hype, app-based drivers as well as commuters now have an alternative to Grab, eliminating its “virtual monopoly” of the industry, which was feared by some quarters following its acquisition last month of the Southeast Asian operations of Uber, its former rival.  LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III noted though that it would now be up to Hype and the other TNCs that would later be accredited how they would market themselves so that drivers and commuters would migrate to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that the drivers would still need to have themselves accredited by the TNC of their choice for accountability. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to be accredited by the LTFRB. These are Hirna, Go Lag, Micab and Owto.  Delgra said that the LTFRB would accredit the other applicants once they had complied with the requirements. For one, he said that these TNCs must show proof that they could accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry comes at a time when Grab continues to be criticized for its high fare and its picky drivers. Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, assured the public on Wednesday that, apart from the passenger complaints mechanisms already in place, his company’s system could also detect and determine if a driver was deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking that driver would be called to the Grab office for investigation.

This is according to a report released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global management consulting firm which conducted the survey in 10 cities in Southeast Asia including Metro Manila.  Titled “Unlocking Cities,” the report sought to assess the potential benefit of ridesharing in key Asian cities, namely: Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Surabaya, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Manila. One of the findings pointed to a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road during peak hours— from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 6 to 8 p.m. To come up with an estimate, BCG said it quantified the number of vehicles that could be taken off the road in a scenario where the mostly privately owned vehicles were substituted by ridesharing.  “In cities where private cars make up the majority of private transport, between 40 percent to 60 percent can be removed,” the report said, noting that this would be the case if ridesharing became the third, if not the second, most popular mode of transportation. Vehicle volume  There are about 2.4 million public and private vehicles in Metro Manila as of 2016, according to the Land Transportation Office. The BCG survey was conducted from September to October this year, covering approximately 300 commuters per city. This was around the same time Uber Philippines went back online after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board imposed sanctions on the transport network company for accepting new driver applications in spite of a government directive against it. The study covered ridesharing in general, which includes pooling and non-pooling. Among other benefits, the study said, ridesharing could also convince a good number of people not to own cars anymore. According to Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua, the company’s Uber Pool option—wherein rides are shared among people with common routes or destinations—accounts for 40 percent of their trips on average. Uber currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, and is exploring other areas like Pampanga province, he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/282522/biggest-ride-sharing-firm-in-china-eyes-ph","title":"Biggest ride-sharing firm in China eyes PH","date":"06:01 AM November 04, 2019","snippet":"China’s biggest ride-sharing company DiDi Chuxing is in talks with a Filipino group in a bid to end Grab Philippines’ virtual monopoly in the country, the Inquirer learned.","body":"China’s biggest ride-sharing company DiDi Chuxing is in talks with a Filipino group in a bid to end Grab Philippines’ virtual monopoly in the country, the Inquirer learned. DiDi’s entry in the Philippines—potentially the latest in its global expansion—will bring down prices and offer more options for commuters, said Ilocos Sur politician Luis “Chavit” Singson, who confirmed negotiations with DiDi.  “We want to break the monopoly of Grab,” Singson said of the Singapore-based ride-sharing giant in an interview last week. Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement. DiDi is one of the world’s largest mobile transport platforms. It offers a host of services from on-demand cars to e-bike sharing and food deliveries to more than 550 million users across Asia, Latin America and Australia, its website showed. “We think this will help Filipinos,” said Singson, a former governor and now mayor of Narvacan. He also chairs LCS Holdings and owns a range of businesses such as bus operator Partas, car dealerships and more recently, the construction of cell towers. Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, owns stakes in Uber, Grab, DiDi and Ola, a ride-sharing service in India."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/39558/ride-sharing-app-tripda-arrives-in-ph","title":"Ride-sharing app Tripda arrives in PH","date":"01:20 PM November 27, 2014","snippet":"A new ride-sharing smartphone app just rolled into town.","body":"A new ride-sharing smartphone app just rolled into town. Germany’s Rocket Internet launched its carpooling platform in the Philippines called Tripda amid current regulatory issues hounding the ridesharing service Uber.  Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said in a statement that Tripda links up drivers who have empty car seats with commuters taking a similar route. The company said this would benefit both parties since they would split the fuel tab and bring down the transportation cost. The app only allows passengers to pay the drivers in cash.  Within five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and expand to other regions later on. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel, making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights.  In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets. The Brazilian-born startup already has tens of thousands of registered users and has facilitated rides for thousands of passengers, the statement said. Philippine regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is in the process of revising its rules to accommodate technology-based transportation applications like Uber, which has met resistance from taxicab operators. Last month, the arrest of an Uber driver for operating without the necessary franchise drew flak from netizens, prompting the Department of Transportation and Communications to consider a more accommodating approach.  LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez could not be immediately reached for comment on Tripda Thursday.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab.

Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017.

Germany’s Rocket Internet launched its carpooling platform in the Philippines called Tripda amid current regulatory issues hounding the ridesharing service Uber.  Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said in a statement that Tripda links up drivers who have empty car seats with commuters taking a similar route. The company said this would benefit both parties since they would split the fuel tab and bring down the transportation cost. The app only allows passengers to pay the drivers in cash.  Within five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and expand to other regions later on. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel, making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights.  In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets. The Brazilian-born startup already has tens of thousands of registered users and has facilitated rides for thousands of passengers, the statement said.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016.

All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.

This is according to the “Unlocking Cities” report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global management consulting firm, which conducted the survey in 10 cities in Southeast Asia including Metro Manila. The results were made public Thursday.  In essence, the report wants to assess the potential benefit of ridesharing in key Asian cities, namely: Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Surabaya, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Manila. One of the findings of the report pointed to a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road during peak hours. Peak hours were pegged at 7 to 9 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.  To come up with an estimate, BCG said it quantified the number of vehicles that could be taken off the road in a scenario where the most widely privately owned vehicles were substituted by ridesharing. “In cities where private cars make up the majority of private transport, between 40 percent to 60 percent can be removed,” the report said, noting that this would be the case if ridesharing became the third, if not the second, most popular mode of transportation.  The BCG survey took place from September to October this year, covering approximately 300 commuters per city. This was around the same time Uber Philippines went back online after a spat with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board (LTFRB), which sanctioned the transport network company for accepting new driver applications in spite of a government directive urging against it. The study covered ridesharing in general, which includes pooling and non-pooling. Among other benefits, the study said ridesharing could also convince a good number of people not to own cars anymore. According to Uber Philippines General Manager Laurence Cua, the company’s Uber Pool option — wherein rides are shared among people with common routes or destinations — accounts for 40 percent of their trips on average. He did not clarify, however, whether or not this is on a daily or monthly basis. Since being introduced over a year ago, the demand for Uber Pool has been growing, he said, without giving more specific figures. “The demand is continuous there. We were surprised with the adoption (of Uber Pool) that a lot of people were actually willing to share (a car) with other riders,” he said.  Uber is present in Metro Manila and Cebu, he said.

The announcement was made by Cat Avelino, Uber Philippines head of communications, on Friday as the company celebrated its fourth year of operations in the country.  The company, the local unit of San Francisco, United States-based Uber Technologies, currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, where it competes with main rival Grab. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines head of government relations and public policy, said there was growing demand in Pampanga, especially around the Clark Freeport Zone.  The Duterte administration has emphasized the development of Clark, which it sees as a solution to Metro Manila’s congestion woes. The Department of Transportation is currently expanding the Clark International Airport. It is also targeting to build a railway line linking Clark to Manila by 2022. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) earlier announced that the processing of driver applications would start on March 5. The moratorium was ordered since the LTFRB wanted a closer look at the ridesharing industry. It had been in place since July 2016.  Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) was capped at 65,000 for Metro Manila. Metro Cebu would get 1,500 cars while Pampanga was allowed 250 cars. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, who was present during the anniversary celebration, said the 65,000 cap in Metro Manila was enough to serve about 75 percent of the demand. She said there were currently around 59,000 ridesharing vehicles in the capital district serving around 52 percent of available demand. The cap would be reviewed every three months, Lizada noted. “We want to see the churn rate, we want to see the blacklisting of drivers,” Lizada said when asked about factors the LTFRB would review. For riders booking either Grab or Uber, the optimal waiting time should be two to three minutes instead of the current 10 to 15 minutes, she said. This will also be considered in the LTFRB’s regular review, she said.

With the LTFRB’s accreditation of Hype, app-based drivers as well as commuters now have an alternative to Grab, eliminating its “virtual monopoly” of the industry, which was feared by some quarters following its acquisition last month of the Southeast Asian operations of Uber, its former rival.  LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III noted though that it would now be up to Hype and the other TNCs that would later be accredited how they would market themselves so that drivers and commuters would migrate to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that the drivers would still need to have themselves accredited by the TNC of their choice for accountability. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to be accredited by the LTFRB. These are Hirna, Go Lag, Micab and Owto.  Delgra said that the LTFRB would accredit the other applicants once they had complied with the requirements. For one, he said that these TNCs must show proof that they could accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry comes at a time when Grab continues to be criticized for its high fare and its picky drivers. Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, assured the public on Wednesday that, apart from the passenger complaints mechanisms already in place, his company’s system could also detect and determine if a driver was deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking that driver would be called to the Grab office for investigation. The drive could then be suspended or even removed from the platform. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978259/poe-urges-ltfrb-to-ensure-ridesharing-services-wont-be-disrupted","title":"Poe urges LTFRB to ensure ridesharing services won’t be disrupted","date":"06:21 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should ensure that services of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to commuters would not be disrupted, Sen.

Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement.

According to Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, they may file a case against the DOTC and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for not taking into consideration the impact of letting Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) operate in the country.  “We are now relegated to second choice,” Suntay said on Wednesday as the DOTC released the order legitimizing the operations of smartphone ridesharing applications. The move also marked the first time a country created a framework to accommodate technology transit services, according to an Uber official. The DOTC order outlined the new classifications, including those covering the so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) like Uber, Grabcar, Easy Taxi and Tripda.  In an earlier interview, Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya had said the move would allow TNC “to exist within our regulatory framework” while the LTFRB would be able to start finalizing a memorandum circular outlining specific regulations and requirements for the TNVS and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them (traditional taxi cabs) to modernize and compete,” Abaya had said, adding: “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS.”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” he told reporters. Suntay disagreed, saying the move would ultimately hurt their business. He said the transit application platforms have an unfair advantage over “regular” cabs since the former do not operate their own cars. He said that services like Uber, which provides a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, also benefit because their fares are not regulated unlike regular cabs. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models. The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. In addition, only sedans, Asian utility vehicles, SUVs, vans or other similar vehicles will be accredited. Operators will also be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNC and registered with the  LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details needed to be ironed out with LTFRB, including the regulation of fares which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an e-mailed statement."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1418943/woman-raises-125000-for-safer-ride-sharing-service-amid-spike-of-anti-asian-american-attacks-in-us","title":"Woman raises $125,000 for safer ride-sharing service amid spike in anti-Asian American attacks in US","date":"04:36 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.","body":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States. On how she came up with the idea, Maddy Park admitted that it was out of fear for her safety whenever she commutes via trains in New York, as per WABC on April 6.  “Last week I took the train. It was a 30-minute commute and I realized every minute of that commute I was terrified,” she was quoted as saying. “I was scared that any moment in time someone might say a racial slur or attack me. Worst of all I thought that if something were to happen to me, nobody would stand up,” Park added.  Park, who admitted that while she could afford to take the taxi, many other Asian Americans cannot. So, she donated $2,000 of her own money to set up Cafe Maddy Cab on Instagram with her friends. Through the said initiative, Park and many other donors help out Asian American women, elderly persons, members of the LGBTQ+ community and low-income essential workers hail a cab for free.  To her surprise, her initiative inspired many others across the US to help the Asian American community during these dire times. “People who are donating are people from all across the nation, across all races, ethnicities and they just sent me messages saying, listen, we really want you guys to be safe too and we’re donating so that more people can take rides in the city,” Park was quoted as saying. “It really opened my eyes to how many people are actually supporting the Asian community in New York City,” Park added.   Park has raised $125,000 as of yesterday, April 13, nine days after she launched Cafe Maddy Cab. A total of 1,122 have so far been paid for by Cafe Maddy Cab. Those who want to avail themselves of the said services or donate to the initiative can go to this link provided by Park. Ian Biong /ra RELATED STORIES: K-pop idols, Asian American stars call to #StopAsianHate as hate crimes surge in US Hundreds rally in Atlanta to support Asian American community after fatal shootings"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/771517/moa-allows-grab-to-operate-at-naia","title":"MOA allows Grab to operate at Naia","date":"12:11 AM March 08, 2016","snippet":"GRAB, a regional ridesharing platform, will start serving passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) next week.","body":"GRAB, a regional ridesharing platform, will start serving passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) next week. David de Castro, a spokesperson for the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), said that airport officials and Grab would sign a memorandum of agreement on Mar. 10 with operations targeted to begin on Mar. 14.  The development marks the opening of the Naia terminals to popular ridesharing platforms which allow passengers to book rides in taxi cabs and private cars using their smartphones. The Philippines was the first country in the world to release regulations covering ride-sharing, legitimizing the business amid protests by traditional taxi operators. These rules, however, left it to MIAA to decide whether or not to allow ridesharing operations at the four Naia terminals.  “MIAA wanted to keep track of the vehicles picking up passengers, as well as the identity of the drivers,” Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chair Winston Ginez said in an interview on Monday. He added that there were also discussions with Grab’s rival, Uber “but the talks between Grab and MIAA were more advanced.”  Grab has been aggressively expanding in the country, either through new areas or product lines. It recently started operations in Cagayan de Oro, its seventh location in the Philippines, in addition to Metro Manila, Baguio, Bacolod, Cebu, Davao and Iloilo. Not all its services, however, pass regulatory scrutiny. The LTFRB last January ordered the company to halt its GrabBike service, saying it was unsafe for passengers to book motorcycle rides until regulations were passed. Apart from car and bike bookings, Grab offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines. It recently launched GrabJeep, a free service where passengers can ride in air-conditioned and Wi-Fi enabled jeepneys that currently operate on Edsa."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/714914/uber-lauds-ltfrb-for-approving-accreditation-in-2-days","title":"Uber lauds LTFRB for approving accreditation in 2 days","date":"06:53 PM August 20, 2015","snippet":"Uber Philippines lauded the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for the quick approval of its accreditation under a regulatory framework that makes the country the first in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services.","body":"Uber Philippines lauded the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for the quick approval of its accreditation under a regulatory framework that makes the country the first in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services. “We are extremely proud of the result of our work with the government to lay the groundwork to pass regulations for app-based ridesharing services,” Laurence Cua, Uber Philippines general manager, said in a statement.  “We will continue to pave the way in the Philippines with new technology that will help commuting in Metro Manila safe and convenient for the community,” Cua said. He added that Uber, together with the local government, would help reduce traffic congestion.  The LTFRB held a sting operation against an Uber driver in October 2014, after receiving complaints from taxi operators regarding the lack of franchise of the private vehicles. Following consultations to modernize the regulation on public utility vehicles, the Department of Transportation and Communications created the new app-based transport category with the LTFRB issuing the memorandum circulars in May.  The LTFRB said it would start a crackdown on “colorum” vehicles on Friday (Aug. 21). Uber’s application for accreditation as a transportation network company was approved within 48 hours of submission, Cua noted. Uber submitted the required documents on Monday afternoon and was approved Wednesday morning. “We are proud to have worked closely with the LTFRB and the DOTC to make Philippines the first country in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services,” Uber said in a statement. “The accreditation will enable Uber to expand and bring safe, reliable and convenient rides to more cities in the Philippines,” it said.  “TNVS (transportation network vehicle service) applications are now being submitted on a daily basis to LTFRB,” Karun Arya, Uber communication lead for South Asia and India, said through email. “Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners’ TNVS application submissions,” Arya said on Thursday. He said Uber has been working with their partner-drivers to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB.

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248318/grab-buys-uber-pcc-sets-review","title":"Grab buys Uber; PCC sets review","date":"05:08 AM March 27, 2018","snippet":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network.","body":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network. Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/856456/uber-grab-vow-compliance-to-ltfrb-over-price-surges","title":"Uber, Grab vow compliance to LTFRB over price surges","date":"01:51 PM December 25, 2016","snippet":"Transport network companies Grab and Uber have vowed to cooperate with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) over the reported surge in their rates this holiday season.","body":"Transport network companies Grab and Uber have vowed to cooperate with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) over the reported surge in their rates this holiday season.

Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1077436/recto-seeks-to-legalize-motorcycle-ride-sharing-service","title":"Recto seeks to legalize motorcycle ride-sharing service","date":"01:27 PM January 25, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto has filed a bill defining types of motorcycles that may qualify as public utility vehicles (PUVs), and which would eventually allow motorcycle ride-sharing services.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto has filed a bill defining types of motorcycles that may qualify as public utility vehicles (PUVs), and which would eventually allow motorcycle ride-sharing services.

Try booking a ride, or more appropriately a flight, in this newly launched ride-sharing platform to reach your destination in no time.  The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

Who will pay for the cost to operate?  In an order released on Saturday, the PCC said the two transportation network companies (TNCs) should “maintain the independence of their business operations” for the “entire duration” of the commission’s motu propio review on the deal. The PCC, however, did not state when it intends to conclude its review. The PCC order came a day before the Uber app is scheduled to go offline, which is on Sunday, April 8.  Early this week, PCC and LTFRB officials met to discuss what would become of the ride-sharing industry with Uber’s exit from the Southeast Asian region. Lizada said that they stressed in that meeting that safety measures have been put in place by the board “to prevent any monopoly by any TNC,” which the PCC fears would happen.  For one, she noted, there are currently four new TNCs that have sought accreditation from the LTFRB. Once these TNCs – Lag Go, Hype, Owto and Pira – satisfy the LTFRB’s requirements, they will take the place of Uber, affording the riding public more transport options. Also, she said that TNCs could not increase their fares on their own as they are required to follow the fare structure approved by the LTFRB. As for the app-based drivers, the franchises that are given to them by the LTFRB are not exclusive to any TNC, which means that they get to decide on who they want to drive for. Rather than unbundle the deal entered by the two TNCs, Lizada said that LTFRB should instead be “called [out] to fast-track the processing of the new players.” It remains unclear how the PCC intends to enforce its order on Uber, especially that its employees are already on a four-month garden leave. The Inquirer also learned that Uber has only around 10 employees left in the country who are part of the transition team.  The Inquirer sought both Uber and Grab officials for comment on the PCC’s order but has yet to receive a reply as of writing. On Friday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu assured the National Privacy Commission that there would be no migration to their platform of the personal data of the 1.2 million Uber users, which may include credit card details. He noted that the data which would be transferred to them are only those of the drivers, who would have to give their consent to Grab. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/197586/global-investors-infuse-350m-into-grabtaxi-for-expansion","title":"Global investors infuse $350M into GrabTaxi for expansion","date":"02:19 AM August 21, 2015","snippet":"GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., operator of Southeast Asia’s biggest ridesharing smartphone application, raised another $350 million in a new funding round that would give it added resources to expand in the region, including the Philippines.","body":"GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., operator of Southeast Asia’s biggest ridesharing smartphone application, raised another $350 million in a new funding round that would give it added resources to expand in the region, including the Philippines. The development comes as the Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board begins regulating ride-sharing apps and as competition with one of its biggest rivals, Uber, heats up.  In a statement, GrabTaxi said on Thursday that the money was raised from global investors such as US-based Coatue Management, L.L.C., China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp. and Didi Kuaidi, “apart from support from existing shareholders.” This brings GrabTaxi’s total funding to about $700 million, making it one of the best funded startups in Southeast Asia.  GrabTaxi launched in Manila in July 2013 and later expanded into Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod and Baguio. It is also present in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. GrabTaxi said the money would be used to further develop its technology offering as it continues to invest in expanding its engineering offices.  GrabTaxi also plans to expand its private hire vehicle booking service, GrabCar, to as many as two more major cities in the Philippines this year, Natasha Bautista, head of Grabcar in the Philippines, said in a previous interview. Figures provided by the company showed that GrabTaxi operates across six countries, with 101,000 registered drivers serving about 10 booking per second in Southeast Asia. “We exist to solve the region’s transportation challenges. Diversifying into private cars and motorbikes has allowed us to touch people of varying income levels and commuting needs. We are the only app in the region that has such an extensive network and range of transportation choices,” Tan said in the statement. GrabTaxi has diversified its offerings beyond taxis to include private cars and motorbikes. GrabCar is a private hire vehicle service available in all countries where GrabTaxi is available. GrabExpress is an on-demand, same-day delivery service that is currently available in Manila. Both GrabCar and GrabExpress are available through the same GrabTaxi mobile app."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248533/philippine-competition-commission-will-review-grab-uber-deal","title":"Philippine Competition Commission will review Grab-Uber deal","date":"05:34 PM April 03, 2018","snippet":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week.","body":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/297177/rocky-road-ahead-for-sharing-economy-platforms-amid-pandemic","title":"Rocky road ahead for ‘sharing economy’ platforms amid pandemic","date":"11:50 AM May 13, 2020","snippet":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit.","body":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit. These companies are now bleeding more cash than ever, shedding workers and scaling back expectations for profitability amid heightened uncertainty about consumer trends and the economic outlook.  The sharing platforms had “tremendous momentum” in industries like transport and tourism and even apparel-sharing prior to the pandemic, said consumer markets analyst Steve Barr of PwC, which had previously predicted the sharing economy to generate $335 billion in revenue by 2025. “I think there’s going to be a very significant shift in consumer behavior,” Barr said.  One factor could be a move away from urbanization in dense cities — a major force driving the sharing economy. That could dampen the sharing economy “lifestyle” that had been building for people who opted to shun ownership, Barr noted.  Uber said in its quarterly update that it lost nearly $3 billion and its rides business was down some 80 percent in April, prompting cuts to 14 percent of staff. The rideshare giant said it has seen some “green shoots” in the recent weeks and is seeing strong revenue growth for its food delivery operation UberEats. However, an IBM survey released this month found more than half of those who used ridesharing apps planned to reduce or stop using these services completely. “Riders are to continue to have a strong aversion to getting in a vehicle with a stranger for fear of infection which will not be allayed until there is a vaccine,” said analyst Richard Windsor on his Radio Free Mobile blog. Arun Sundararajan, a New York University professor who researches the sharing economy, said he nonetheless sees some room for optimism for ride-hailing firms.  “I think we’ll see a shift to greater personal space control,” Sundararajan said. “A lot of people will move away from mass transit in densely populated areas.” This could bring more business to ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber or to “micromobility” platforms for bicycles and scooters, which the two companies also offer. The researcher said, however, that it may take more time to see a rebound for “pool” rides with multiple passengers, and that the health crisis might slow the trend in which people give up their personal vehicles for shared rides. Leading home-sharing platform Airbnb has cut 25 percent of its staff with the travel industry crushed, with some estimates of bookings down 50 percent from earlier this year. Sundararajan says things may not be so bleak for Airbnb, which has over the years learned to build consumer trust and allow people to host or stay with strangers. The startup has already unveiled a new sanitary protocol and guidelines on leaving spaces vacant between bookings. “As people start to travel again, they will be oriented toward spaces where they feel they have control,” he said. “They may not want to pass through crowded hotel lobbies or stay in places where they don’t know who was there before.” He said Airbnb might be better positioned than some hotel operators “because it doesn’t rely on an extremely high rate of occupancy to make its business model work.” As in other sectors, the sharing economy firms will need to rebuild consumer trust to get consumers back. Sundararajan said these firms have an advantage because they have been working for years on helping change consumer habits. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The platforms are better-situated to deal with this uncertainty and rebuilding trust because that’s what they’ve been doing for a decade,” he said. But behavioral economist Lucas Coffman of Boston College said trust can be difficult, pointing to the “reputational” system of rating developed by online platforms. “You also need to trust everyone who rode in your seat before you,” Coffman said. Some segments of the sharing economy may emerge stronger, PwC’s Barr says, such as corporate jets or high-end black car rides. “Safety is going to be the new experience,” he said. Saif Benjaafar, director of the University of Minnesota’s Initiative on the Sharing Economy, said the platforms have been part of a lifestyle trend to on-demand, collaborative services that are extending to new areas such as medicine and education. “There has been a shift in the traditional way of delivering products and services, and I think that will continue,” Benjaafar said. “I think people are getting used to the idea of going to an app and getting things whenever they need it.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the  Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Ride-sharing services — typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis — are gaining popularity in Metro Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps — arguing they represent unfair competition.  But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse.  GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise license from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said.  “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCarPhilippines  said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the  Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar  Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorization. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The  Philippines  is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies. Previously, only local and city governments had regulated the services."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248487/pcc-says-grab-uber-deal-will-create-virtual-monopoly","title":"PCC says Grab-Uber deal will create a ‘virtual monopoly’","date":"05:55 PM April 02, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. In a statement, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering a review of the deal regardless if the transaction falls under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. The Uber app, which has provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, will no longer be functional starting on April 9.  “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anti-competitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives on Monday. It was not clear if the statement preceded or followed their meeting.  The acquisition would likely have a “far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it is looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.” During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-sharing services, and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways – through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met – one of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable.  As of press time, PCC said that it does not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/979919/3-new-tncs-accredited-by-june-says-ltfrb","title":"3 new TNCs accredited by June, says LTFRB","date":"05:07 AM April 04, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) expects to accredit by June three new transport network companies (TNCs) that will compete with Grab and offer commuters more options.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) expects to accredit by June three new transport network companies (TNCs) that will compete with Grab and offer commuters more options.

This time, its pricing system came under fire from the party-list group 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-Utak), which called on a regulatory agency to take back Uber’s accreditation and deny the franchise applications of its partner vehicles.  In a petition filed early this week in the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), 1-Utak said the May 2015 department order that created the transportation network company (TNCs) as a new category of transport service was illegal for it granted such companies the power to set their own fares. The group cited what happened on the night of Sept. 8, when rates charged by Uber vehicles “dramatically increased” as heavy rains and flash floods paralyzed traffic and public transportation went scarce in many parts of Metro Manila.  “While other public utility services have to get LTFRB approval for any adjustment of fares or additional charges, TNCs and TNVS (transportation network vehicle service) can dictate and adjust their fares without any limitation,” said the petition signed by 1-Utak president Melencio Vargas and acting secretary general Joseph Florizel Cruz. The petition also argued that TNC member vehicles are not among those exempted from an “existing moratorium” on the issuance of certificates of public convenience for certain types of vehicles.  LTFRB chair Winston Ginez, who called for a meeting with Uber and GrabTaxi representatives regarding complaints on their pricing, “choosy” drivers, and other matters on Friday, noted that Uber’s fare indeed surged “about five times the usual rate” on Sept. 8. The board asked the two companies to submit their position papers “on when and how can LTFRB exercise its oversight function.” “We want to give them the opportunity to be heard. (The regulation) is important because we don’t want predatory pricing,” Ginez said. Under the May 2015 order of the Department of Transportation and Communications, which is cited by the 1-Utak petition, fares set by TNCs would be “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions of the market.” The LTFRB will hear the group’s petition on Sept. 23.  Donemark Calimon, the Uber representative in Friday’s meeting, said the surge in prices was “algorithmically dictated by the system based on demand.” He stressed that passengers are informed about it before they confirm the booking. Natasha Bautista of GrabCar, meanwhile, said the company would submit its position paper but she explained that surge pricing is not practiced under its current system. Cars or vans booked through TNC apps are called TNVS. According to board member Ariel Inton, the LTFRB has not yet issued a single TNVS franchise since the approved applications have only been given provisional authority."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1056789/list-grab-ph-controversies-and-issues","title":"LIST: Grab PH controversies and issues","date":"04:56 PM November 24, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.","body":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.

De Guzman is in critical condition after an accident in a Grab ride, causing him to sustain “severe traumatic brain injury.” A viral Facebook post from Marko’s cousin, Steffi de Guzman, said Marko and his friend, Alia booked a Grab car last Oct. 26 along Taft Avenue, Manila. She said the Grab ride was allegedly running too fast and was driven by a sleepy Grab driver.  She then said the Grab car collided into another car before crashing into a Light Rail Transit (LRT) post. Marko, then sustained a fractured skull after the incident. With the incident, Grab said they are constantly communicating and offering financial assistance to Marko’s family. An investigation was also launched as both drivers affected were facing “court arraignment.” READ: Grab says it is ‘continuously reaching out’ to support critically hurt rider ‘System downtime’ The ride-hailing company also faced technical issues such as the recent glitch on its computation of fares.  Last Oct. 25, its application experienced a glitch, making the fares decrease to a minimum on all services regardless of the overall distance of the trip. GrabCar and GrabShare fares were at P80 pesos while its six-seater services were at P120.

Grab denied the allegation, saying the message was not endorsed by its company. Grab Country Head Brian Cu said: “No that’s false. The message is not endorsed by Grab, it was probably crafted by a partner driver and shared among other drivers.” READ: Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila ‘Unjustified booking cancellations’ Last April, Grab Philippines punished nearly 500 drivers after an internal investigation on complaints that drivers inexcusably cancel passengers’ ride bookings.

In memorandum circular No. 2016-008, the LTFRB directed its technical division and all regional offices not to accept new TNVS applications with a proposed route in the National Capital Region “pending review of existing policies.”  “Pending review of existing policies, and other relevant and pressing issues of franchise to TNVS, the Board hereby orders the suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS application proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila,” the memorandum read. “All other issuances inconsistent herewith are deemed modified or superseded accordingly,” it added.  LTFRB clarified that the suspension applies only to new applications. “Current applications already filed will be processed and resolved upon in accordance with the rules,” it said.  Through a department order last year, the LTFRB classified vehicles operating under ride-sharing applications like Grab and Uber as a new mode of service called TNVS. “”Mobility is a key concern for our government. The object of Department Order No. 2015-011 is to encourage innovation across all forms of public land transportation in order to increase mobility on major thoroughfares, boost travel times, improve the quality, sustainability and reliability of public transport services, and respond to the needs of modern commuters,” the agency said.

But with regard to the accreditation of individual Uber partner vehicles, the company said this was still being done in batches. The LTFRB earlier said it would start apprehending unaccredited vehicles starting today.  “(The partners’) applications are being submitted on a daily basis to the LTFRB,” Karun Arya, Uber communication lead for South Asia and India, said through e-mail. “Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners’ TNVS application submissions.” TNVS stands for transport network vehicle services, the name given to partner vehicles of app-based TNCs or transportation network companies.  Uber is working with their partner-drivers to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB, Arya said. The LTFRB held a sting operation against an Uber partner driver in October last year after receiving complaints from taxi operators who, like their counterparts in several countries, cited unfair competition since Uber vehicles lacked a franchise yet were being allowed to operate like cabs. Despite protests and following consultations and public hearings, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) created a new transport category—the TNC and TNVS—for app-based services like Uber. The LTFRB later issued memorandum circulars on their regulation. Uber’s application for accreditation as a TNC was approved Wednesday within 48 hours of submission, Cua noted. “We are proud to have worked closely with the LTFRB and the DOTC to make the Philippines the first country in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/223550/biz-buzz-bangko-sentral-frontrunner","title":"Biz Buzz: Bangko Sentral frontrunner","date":"12:34 AM January 27, 2017","snippet":"We have all heard who the possible successors to outgoing Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. are.

It’s like last year’s presidential elections where there were several horses in the race and the frontrunner kept on changing so much that it was difficult to predict the outcome. As the July expiration of Tetangco’s term nears (and term extension now out of the question), the business community is anxiously waiting for President Duterte’s choice of successor to Tetangco, a highly acclaimed central bank chief who’s leaving big shoes to fill.  There’s now a lot of buzz that the new frontrunner is former banker and Monetary Board member Peter Favila, widely believed to enjoy the backing of Mr. Duterte’s political ally, former President and now Deputy House Speaker—and rumored future Prime Minister, if the Philippines shifts to a federal form of government—Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. To recall, Favila served as trade secretary during Arroyo’s 2005-2010 term. He was president of several banks—Security Bank, Philippine National Bank and Allied Banking Corp.—and likewise chaired the Philippine Stock Exchange at one point.  If Favila is chosen as the new BSP chief, it will break the Blue Eagles’ monopoly of the top BSP leadership (Tetangco, Rafael Buenaventura and Gabriel Singson Sr. are all Ateneo de Manila graduates). It may very well be the Tigers’ turn to lead. (Favila finished BS Commerce Major in Banking and Finance from the University of Santo Tomas, before taking an Advanced Management Program at Wharton). Another outsider widely believed to have a good shot at the BSP leadership is East West president and treasury veteran Antonio Moncupa Jr. But if Mr. Duterte chooses an internal appointment, the two incumbent deputy governors—Diwa Guinigundo and Nestor Espenilla Jr.—are seen both capable to become the next steward of this independent monetary entity.  We heard that the former frontrunner, Perfecto Yasay Jr., has lost his edge possibly because of mostly negative feedback when his name first cropped out as a candidate. Yasay’s biggest handicap as far as the BSP is concerned was his affiliation (as former lawyer and director) with the defunct Banco Filipino, whose officials were sued by the BSP for hazardous lending and lax collection policies and practices years ago. Nothing is cast in stone now and any dark horse, like in last year’s presidential elections, could emerge as the new BSP chief.  It’s all up to the new CEO of the land to make that much-awaited call to preserve the country’s monetary and financial stability. —Doris Dumlao-Abadilla Uber-frustrated If you think the roadblocks that ridesharing firms like Uber and Grab face have gone away after they meekly complied with regulators’ demands for surge pricing ceilings over the holidays, think again. As it turns out, being a ridesharing firm in the Philippines is as difficult as ever, despite the demonstrable benefits they’ve brought to the long suffering commuting public, especially in major urban centers like Metro Manila and Cebu.  According to a position paper written by Uber—a copy of which was obtained by Biz Buzz—the process of becoming a service provider for a ridesharing firm continues to be loaded with bureacratic red tape. Take for instance the documentary requirements. The process to acquire a permit to drive on a ridesharing platform requires anywhere from 16 to 21 documents to be submitted to regulatory agencies. And if you think that’s bad, just remember that a would-be Uber driver or operator will have to wait at least three months, and sometimes as long as six months, for his application to be processed. That means six months more for any single commuter to either suffer his or her commute on a creaking train or bus system, or worse, aggravate vehicular traffic by driving his own vehicle. “The Philippines needs progressive regulations to improve mobility,” the Uber position paper read. “Ridesharing has become a safe, reliable and convenient transport option for many Filipinos and a viable solution to easing traffic congestion.” But it quickly lamented that “the regulatory environment has made it increasingly tedious to amplify the benefits of ridesharing and make it more accessible to a wider driver and rider base.” As a result, “the Philippines has one of the highest costs and barriers to entry for ridesharing,” it said. Ouch. So what do ridesharing firms want? It’s simple, really. All the government has to do is implement some common sense proposals like streamlining processes and putting them online to help ensure that regulatory delays and red tape is reduced. “The existing paper document submission process is prone to errors, misplacement of documents, and leads to unnecessary delays in processing and difficulties in storing documents on the part of the regulators,” Uber said. “Regulations should prescribe ends, not means, based on specific public safety outcomes rather than the narrow methods for obtaining them,” the firm added. For Uber, this means that the goals of a proposed government requirement for cameras in all vehicles are already accomplished by its “de-anonymized” transport model, including GPS tracking and two-way accountability features. “Regulations should acknowledge the unique traits of ridesharing,” the firm said. “Ridesharing is demand-responsive, enabling drivers and vehicles to be on the road when they are needed.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); In fact, 41 percent of Uber drivers drive less than 10 hours per week. “Imposing 1900s era rules such as supply caps and professional driver’s license requirements can erode the contributions provided by ridesharing, particularly in solving traffic congestions in Metro Manila,” the firm added. (Halfway through the two-page position paper, it becomes evident to any reader that the entrepreneurs behind ridesharing services have become increasingly frustrated with archaic government regulations—perhaps as frustrated as the country’s long suffering commuters themselves.) “Ridesharing fights congestions in three ways: Consolidating trips into few vehicles across multiple users, reducing the overall need for car ownership, and complementing the use of public transit,” the company said. It also pointed out that 41 percent of Uber riders had eliminated or reduced usage of their personal vehicles because of the service. And perhaps, more importantly, Uber makes it easier to get around for commuters who work late nights such as BPO workers, when late night transportation options are limited. And despite these regulatory roadblocks, Uber’s own statistics provide an impressive picture of the benefits the service has provided: More than 682,000 active riders over the past three months, 7,000 active drivers during this same period and 211,000 riders for its new uberPOOL service. The question now is… will these rationale arguments of ridesharing firms convince innovation-resistant regulators and their stakeholders in the traditional transportation sector? Don’t hold your breath. —Daxim L.

The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716594/colorum-taxi-under-ride-sharing-app-tripid-fined-p200k-impounded-for-3-months","title":"‘Colorum’ taxi under ride-sharing app Tripid fined P200K, impounded for 3 months","date":"08:57 PM August 26, 2015","snippet":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.","body":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles and his brother Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Rep. Jericho Nograles have filed House Bill 6009  to end the disagreement between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and the LTFRB.  The dispute has led to a crackdown on Uber and Grab vehicles that do not have franchises to operate. READ: LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise  The House Bill 6009, or the Transport Network Service Act, seeks to institutionalize TNC as an alternative mode of public transport, and to regulate the operations of these services “to ensure that the paramount interest of the public is protected and conserved, while encouraging free enterprise and economic development.” According to House Bill 6009, the TNCs would only be allowed to operate if they are able to comply with all the requirements and secure a permit from the LTFRB.  The bill defines these companies and their drivers as “common carriers” for purposes of determining the liability and degree of diligence so that the presumption of negligence in case of breach of contract of carriage may apply to both. READ: Uber, Grab failed to inform drivers of LTFRB requirements The bill would require these ride-sharing and -hailing companies to secure a permit from the LTFRB and to oblige the TNCs to ensure that their drivers would comply with all the requirements and obligations set by law. The bill would require an Uber and Grab operator the following: The TNCs are also expected to strictly adopt a zero tolerance policy for drug or alcohol use among its drivers, and must ensure that the vehicles are safe and comfortable.  READ: LTFRB: Uber, Grab to blame for ‘mess’ TNC vehicles are also prohibited from exceeding the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity in its ride-sharing activities, the bill said. The Uber and Grab vehicles should also be not more than 10 years old, and must be road-worthy and compliant with vehicle emission standards, the bill added. In a statement, Davao City Rep. Nograles said the tiff between the TNCs and LTFRB is a “classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal,” especially because Uber and Grab remained a favored convenient form of public transportation. “Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” Nograles said. READ: ‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB PBA Rep. Nograles in the same statement said there is still a need to regulate Uber and Grab because these are relatively new modes of public transportation. He lamented that the operation of Grab and Uber would not have been an issue if the country had an efficient mass transport system in the Metro Rail and Light Rail Transits System. “The concept of Uber and Grab is new to us so therefore new regulations must be set to ensure that they are properly managed. Unfortunately, we don’t even need to go through this kind of trouble if only we have an efficient public transport system and an MRT that doesn’t break down too often,” he said The PBA Partylist earlier challenged LTFRB to first tackle “colorum” public vehicles instead of cracking down on ride-hailing companies like Grab and Uber.

Staging a rally outside the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) main office in Quezon City on Wednesday, members of Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) said that thousands of GrabCar and Uber are on the road due to the relatively easy procedures for their accreditation.  ACTO President Efren De Luna said that the relative ease of the accreditation process of said transportation network companies (TNCs) violates their rights as “legitimate” owners and operators of public utility vehicles who have franchises. “[Uber and GrabCar] contribute to worsening traffic and minimize our profit. Their accreditation is a violation of out rights as legitimate public utility vehicle owners and operators who hold franchise and are following the prescribed procedures. However, our rights have been disregarded by the LTFRB,” De Luna said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.  “Our problem is that there are too many cars on the road. But why is the LTFRB still accepting the application of thousands of GrabCar and Uber drivers?” he added. Meanwhile, De Luna claimed that the accreditation of the TNCs has sparked a more aggressive stance of the regulatory agency regarding the “phase-out” of PUVs.  He said that while drivers of PUVs are willing to “modernize” so that their service will be at par with the ones being provided by Uber and GrabCar drivers,  the “phase-out” of cars which are 10 years-old or older will pose as a threat to their livelihood. Citing data collated as of Sept. 23, the LTFRB said that it has received 3,903 units from TNCs and has received applications from 2,982 drivers for accreditation.

The improved security procedure involves requiring Uber drivers to periodically take profile pictures of themselves — or so-called “selfies” — to allow Uber to validate with its internal database whether the person driving the designated vehicle at any given time is the same one declared in the company’s records.  With the service called “Real-Time ID Check,” Uber said it would be able to reduce fraud, helping drivers protect their accounts from being compromised. This extra layer of protection can help ensure riders that the right person is behind the wheel. “We at Uber are constantly looking for ways to strengthen our technology-enabled security features,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a Taguig City on Monday. “We look into new solutions and test them to proactively use and maximize the capability of available technologies, and how these can be instrumental in our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and convenient rides.”  The new feature, which was launched initially in several countries where Uber operates, will require drivers to use a new feature on the company’s smartphone-based software that requires a selfie to be taken before they go online and accept rides. The photo taken by the driver is then compared to the one already on file with the account.  If the two photos don’t match, the account would be temporarily blocked while Uber representatives look into the situation, according to Cua. Following its initial release in the US last September 2016, Uber is rolling out the feature across 16 countries, namely South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, India, Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Cua said the number of complaints in the Philippines regarding situations where the identity of the driver does not match declared identity has been “extremely small,” most of which have been caused by previous drivers failing to log out of their Uber accounts before turning over the vehicle to another driver. Cua explained that the security feature would improve the peace of mind of Uber riders knowing that the identities of their drivers have been carefully monitored by the company.  SFM/rga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801152/grab-suspends-probes-allegedly-rude-driver-in-viral-post","title":"Grab suspends, probes allegedly rude driver in viral post","date":"02:47 PM July 30, 2016","snippet":"Transport network vehicle service Grab Philippines has suspended the driver tagged in a viral Facebook post who allegedly abused a passenger on Saturday amid an ongoing investigation.","body":"Transport network vehicle service Grab Philippines has suspended the driver tagged in a viral Facebook post who allegedly abused a passenger on Saturday amid an ongoing investigation. “We do not tolerate any behavior that threatens the safety and well-being of our passengers and drivers and this incident is not an exception,” Grab said in an advisory posted on its social media pages.  The ridesharing company was referring to the complaint of one Angel Ramos, who claimed that the driver of the GrabCar she hailed going to Makati was unreasonably irate and even threatened her that he was a police and he shoots people. This was after Ramos asked if she can go back to get her wallet, and if the driver had smaller bills to her P1,000-bill.

In a statement, Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over at the ridesharing giant in August said: “None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it.” Two members of the Uber information security team who has “led the response” that included not alerting users that their data was breached were let go from the San Francisco-based company effective Tuesday, according to Khosrowshahi.  The Uber chief said he only recently learned that outsiders had broken into a cloud-based server used by the company for data and downloaded a “significant” amount of information. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber.  Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Uber’s new boss Khosrowshahi learned of the incident. “You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later,” Khosrowshahi said. “I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it.” Khosrowshahi said that what he learned about Uber’s failure to notify users or regulators prompted corrective actions. Need to change  Uber has been notifying drivers whose license numbers were swiped, and offering them credit and identity theft protections. The company also said it has been notifying regulators, and monitoring affected rider accounts for signs of fraud. “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,” Khosrowshahi said. “We are changing the way we do business.” Khosrowshahi inherited a litany of scandals and a toxic workplace culture when he replaced Kalanick. Kalanick’s brash style has been credited with driving Uber to the leading spot in the smartphone-summoned ride market, but also blamed for fostering an atmosphere of impropriety and rule-breaking at the company. A planned tie-up with Japanese tech giant SoftBank suggests the ride-sharing giant is set to come of age in the business world, but it still faces a long road ahead. The deal would give Uber an additional $1 billion in capital and could allow SoftBank to acquire as much as 14 percent of Uber over time. While Uber has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, it is trying to move past scandals and missteps that have included executive misconduct, a cutthroat workplace, and potentially unethical competitive practices. One step toward the future was the hiring of Khosrowshahi earlier this 2017, which left founder Kalanick in the background. But Uber needs to clean up governance and other practices in order to meet its goal of a 2019 stock market debut that would open up the privately-held firm to greater scrutiny. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Under Kalanick, Uber reached an eye-popping valuation of $68 billion, unprecedented for a private firm. But at the same time, it has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators, and faces possible bans in cities for failing to live up to local rules. The deal with SoftBank is aimed at getting past the clashes between Kalanick and early investors like Benchmark Capital, which has sued the former CEO. SoftBank is expected to buy up shares from some investors by pumping in as much as $9 billion, in a so-called tender offer to Uber stakeholders. Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said earlier this November that some details are not yet final. Uber called the SoftBank deal “a strong vote of confidence” in the company’s long-term potential. But Uber has other issues as well. It is in court facing Waymo, the former Google Car unit, which has alleged the theft of trade secrets on autonomous vehicle technology, in a case pending in California. Uber’s use of software aimed at thwarting rivals like Lyft has also hurt its image, and could create further legal woes.

Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.

Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

Starting on November 4, a fleet of self-driving Hyundai Kona Electric SUVs will provide a free ride-sharing service in Irvine, California. “The pilot introduces BotRide to several hundred Irvine residents, including college students. The goal is to study consumer behavior in an autonomous ride-sharing environment,” said Christopher Chang, head of business development, strategy and technology division at Hyundai Motor Co. “We are going to learn about ecosystems, where the vehicles travel and optimize the customer experience. BotRide, is another example of Hyundai’s ongoing efforts to actively build expertise in mobility technology as well as the company’s commitment to providing more user-friendly mobility services to customers.”  Hyundai partnered with Pony.ai to build the self-driving system and with Via to create the BotRide on-demand ridesharing technology and application. Using the BotRide app, riders can hail an autonomous Kona directly from their smartphone. Via’s advanced algorithms enable multiple riders to share the same vehicle, outfitted with Pony.ai autonomous vehicle technology. The app directs passengers to nearby stops for pick up and drop off, allowing for shared trips without lengthy detours, or inconvenient fixed routes and schedules. Integrated Hyundai and Pony.ai technologies enable the BotRide vehicles to navigate complex road scenarios safely, according to the carmaker. The vehicles are equipped with Pony.ai’s latest sensor hardware and proprietary software to identify the precise position of surrounding vehicles, handle pedestrian traffic in urban areas, accurately monitor its surroundings, predict the behavior of other road users, and precisely plan actions accordingly. In addition to self-driving capabilities, BotRide is validating its user experience in preparation for a fully driverless future. “Through BotRide, Hyundai is leveraging cutting-edge autonomous vehicle and mobility technologies to introduce a new, safe, and convenient form of transportation to the public,” said Daniel Han, manager, Advanced Product Strategy at Hyundai Motor America. “The BotRide pilot represents an important step in the deployment and eventual commercialization of a growing new mobility business. In addition to the technology partners powering BotRide, the broader city and community ecosystem have also played an important role in making BotRide possible. The BotRide pilot can serve as an example of how cities and companies can come together to truly enable smart cities and smart transportation systems of the future.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/239824/apps-every-phone-likely-needs","title":"Apps every phone likely needs","date":"05:10 AM November 03, 2017","snippet":"Technology and the birth of diverse applications have made things easier for everyone, even altering our lifestyles.","body":"Technology and the birth of diverse applications have made things easier for everyone, even altering our lifestyles. Take a peek at some of the top lifestyle apps present in most smartphones.  1. Grab & Uber—The ridesharing revolution brought about by the on-demand service vehicle app has grown into a multibillion peso industry, especially in the Philippines that is yet to have its own efficient mass transport system. 2. Eatigo—Filipinos today are now known as the dine-out generation because of their time-strapped and on-the-go lifestyle and the Eatigo app is one of the favorite restaurant reservation apps of this generation.  Eatigo aims to connect empty tables with empty stomachs. 3. Spotify—This music and podcast streaming app has been rocking the world of music lovers since it was launched in October 2008. Available in Europe, most of the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Asia, Spotify allows music to be browsed through or searched by parameters such as artist, album, genre, playlist or record label.  As of June 2017, it had more than 140 million monthly active users and more than 60 million paying subscribers. 4. Netflix—Boasting a massive library of video content at an affordable price, Netflix has dramatically changed today’s viewing habits. Founded in 1997, Netflix started online streaming after 10 years when their titles were only limited to 1,000. Its success exploded in the first quarter of 2017 with 98.75 million subscribers and breached the 100-million subscriber mark shortly after its first-quarter report in April. 5. AirBnB—Travelers swear by AirBnB as the most seamless app to book your accommodation. You choose your location, your price range, amenities and the type of accommodation you want, key in your preferred dates and number of persons staying and AirBnB gives you a shortlist that would match your requirements and preferences. 6.

In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States.  Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars.  The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China’s Geely, to produce “tens of thousands” of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some “easy” trips may be made autonomously."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/59526/california-appeals-court-rules-uber-lyft-must-reclassify-drivers-as-employees","title":"California appeals court rules Uber, Lyft must reclassify drivers as employees","date":"INQUIRER.net U.S. Bureau","snippet":"A California appeals court on Thursday unanimously ruled against ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc, saying they must reclassify their drivers in the state as employees.","body":"A California appeals court on Thursday unanimously ruled against ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc, saying they must reclassify their drivers in the state as employees. While the ruling does not take effect before a Nov. 3 company-sponsored ballot measure that will give voters the chance to decide over the future status of gig workers, it narrows the companies’ options should their ballot fail.  The case emerged after California implemented a law, known as AB5, aimed at reclassifying ride-hail, food delivery and other app-based workers as employees entitled to benefits such as unemployment insurance and minimum wage. California in May sued Uber and Lyft for not complying with AB5. A California judge in August ordered the companies to reclassify their drivers as employees, a ruling the companies appealed under the threat of leaving the state altogether.  The appeals court on Thursday upheld the ruling. The judges said in a 74-page ruling that Uber’s and Lyft’s misclassification caused irreparable harm to drivers who as independent contractors miss out on employee benefits.  Remedying those harms more strongly served the public interest than “protecting Uber, Lyft, their shareholders, and all of those who have come to rely on the advantages of online ride-sharing,” the ruling said. Lyft and Uber in a statement said they were considering all legal options, including an appeal. “This ruling makes it more urgent than ever for voters to stand with drivers and vote yes on Prop. 22,” Lyft said, referring to the Nov. 3 ballot measure, which would repeal AB5 and provide drivers with more limited benefits. “Today’s ruling means that if the voters don’t say Yes on Proposition 22, rideshare drivers will be prevented from continuing to work as independent contractors, putting hundreds of thousands of Californians out of work and likely shutting down ridesharing throughout much of the state,” Uber said."},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/51251/government-fined-ride-sharing-services-now","title":"The Government Fined Ride-Sharing Services, Now What?","date":"Posted on July 14, 2017July 14, 2017","snippet":"","body":" I get touchy on the subject of ride-sharing services. Every time the government imposes a threat to halt or affect its operations, I get a little mad. My sentiment is shared among my officemates, most of which rely on booking a car when they are in a late-night situation, in between work meetings and shoots, among other incidentals in the professional life. Sure, it’s a privilege to afford this in a country where you can get a 10-kilometer ride for around P20.  But I hate how we seem to forget that transportation is a necessity. Furthermore, it’s a necessity that should be provided or overseen by the government. It’s why we have the Land Transportation Office, the Department of Public Works and Highways, and the Department of Transportation, among many branches in the government that oversee how we get from one point to another.  The necessity isn’t met well obviously. Take one look at how the Buendia platform of the PNR is too short for the train that people have to jump into a crowded train like ’80s action stars. Think of how the line of the MRT North Avenue snakes almost all the way to the next station. It’s not a joke at times when people say a flight out to Hong Kong is faster than going around Metro Manila. We didn’t place fifth in the rankings of worst traffic in the world for nothing. The solution that the government is seeking, on the guise of doing its job of regulating transportation companies, is hitting the outlier. They’ve blamed these companies for the traffic and have always tried to find ways to undermine how this private sector fulfilled a public need. Traffic is never a problem caused by just one factor, mind you, a concept we need to accept if we want solutions fast. If our trains worked well and if it didn’t take three hours to get to my job via the usual routes, wasting time and energy, I’d happily give up booking a ride via my phone.  The existing means of transportation are improved too slowly to see progress. All I have seen is a better ticketing system at the LRT and MRT. Convenient, but not exactly the urgent change we seek. Before Uber and Grab, I remember hearing how criminals would terrorize cab passengers, if not the ones driving the vehicles themselves. The only time I heard less about those incidences is due to the ride-sharing companies. What did the government actually do? And was it strong enough to back up the local taxi industry? I hope the P5 million fine they imposed on Grab and Uber goes into more trains or making our roads better. Every time they propose to suspend these services, I think of the time I was victimized by a taxi scam in which the police didn’t even seem to take my report seriously because the criminals only took my money and not my life. That’s why it feels unnerving if I need to go back to the old way. It feels upsetting how EDSA is lined with people hoping for a bus ride home. For all of us, I can’t help but feel that we’re being robbed and blamed for it simply because we try to make it work even when the government fails us.

Members of TopSpeed and Busypaps, two organizations comprising at least 250 Grab and Uber drivers, made the appeal as the LTFRB’s suspension order to temporarily stop receiving new TNVS applications was about to reach one year on July 21.  The new drivers who were prohibited to ply Metro Manila because of absence of a provisional authority (PA) from the LTFRB asked the regulatory body to lift the suspension order for them to be given permit and start earn a living. This development came after the LTFRB issued an order on July 21, 2016, suspending the acceptance of new applications for PA thus, prohibiting a number of drivers not to go out and pick up passengers for about a year now.  “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority (We are appealing to the good hearts of our LTFRB officials to heed our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues without provisional authority),” Bobby Coronel, founder of TopSpeed, said. According to Coronel, TNVS drivers have always wanted to fully comply with regulations but their applications were either not processed judiciously by the previous admin or did not make it to the cut off as a result of the suspension. Moreover, they cannot simply give up their livelihood, and LTFRB must understand their situation.  “Marami po sa amin, may binabayaran pa po na monthly amortization ng mga sasakyan (Many of us are still paying for the monthly amortization of cars),” TopSpeed lady driver Deseree Garcia said, while asking LTFRB to understand their situation. Meanwhile, other TNVS leaders also appealed to the LTFRB to act on the recently expired accreditation of transport network company, Grab. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3. In his Facebook post Monday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said it’s “business as usual” for the company and its partners. Cu added, they have submitted the requirements for the renewal of accreditation on time. But TNVS drivers said, they are still concerned with the current status of non-renewal of accreditation.

Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the  Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Ride-sharing services — typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis — are gaining popularity in Metro Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams.  The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps — arguing they represent unfair competition. But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse. GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise license from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said. “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCarPhilippines  said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the  Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar  Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorization. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The  Philippines  is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies. Previously, only local and city governments had regulated the services."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/724597/party-list-group-ubers-unfair-pricing-system-detrimental-to-puvs","title":"Party-list group: Uber’s ‘unfair’ pricing system detrimental to PUVs","date":"01:51 PM September 23, 2015","snippet":"A party-list group on Wednesday called for the suspension of the accreditation given by the Land Transport Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to popular mobile application-based ridesharing service Uber over its pricing system.","body":"A party-list group on Wednesday called for the suspension of the accreditation given by the Land Transport Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to popular mobile application-based ridesharing service Uber over its pricing system. During the hearing of its petition calling for the suspension of Uber’s accreditation over its pricing system, 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-UTAK) party-list group alleged that it is “unfair” for other public utility vehicles to wait for LTFRB approval to adjust its fares while Uber and other  transportation network companies (TNCs) can set and adjust their fares.  1-UTAK Chair Vigor Mendoza is assailing the legality of the department order issued last May which created TNCs as a new transport service category, saying that it granted such companies the power to set their fares. Mendoza said that their petition before the regulatory agency boils down to a single demand: to have an equal playing field for TNCs like Uber and public utility vehicles in terms of pricing.  He also cited the need of having “reasonable and affordable” pricing for TNCs, citing what happened on Sept. 8 when heavy rains pushed for the five-fold increase of the usual rate of Uber vehicles. “What drivers are seeking is equal treatment. If the law states that fare adjustments should undergo public hearing, it should be abided. You cannot provide a service which is unreasonably priced, even if it is efficient. What our law states is that fares should be reasonable and affordable,”  Mendoza said.  On their part, Atty. Grace Ann Lazaro, counsel for Uber, claimed that they are allowed to set their rates in accordance to the the department order which provided their accreditation as a TNC. “When Uber applied for accreditation, we believe that the overall board has examined the fare structure we submitted,” Lazaro said. However, LTFRB Chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said that the regulatory agency has oversight functions to peg the rates set by Uber and other TNCs. “We have the power to adjust the fare to what we think will serve the interest of the public,” Ginez said. The LTFRB is yet to decide on the petition as it gave 10 days for each party to send their respective position papers."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/234273/economists-oppose-caps-ride-sharing-permits","title":"Economists oppose caps on ride-sharing permits","date":"02:29 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"","body":" A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.  FEF – an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms – said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) were doing the riding public a beneficial service that the regular public utility vehicles have been unable to provide. The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings as well as safety and peace of mind due to the thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and to the feedback and reviews of the riding public, FEF said in a press statement on Wednesday.  Thus, FEF said it’s “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services. “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anti-competitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis,” FEF said.  The group said these ride-sharing services had shown the way on how public transportation should be managed:  through the use of technology and the market. “The market gives the riding public the power of choice.  Technology gives the riding public information and matches demand,” FEF said. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. The group pointed out that surge prices during peak hours encourage drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. In the case of consumers, such surge in pricing are seen to encourage riders to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods.  “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel, and oversupply,” FEF said. The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” FEF chaired is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo. Its vice chair is Romy Bernardo while the president is Calixto Chikiamco. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister/Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.

Uber said it had made available data from its platform dubbed Movement to the Department of Public Works and Highways. Among its earliest recommendations was to support the proposed extension of San Miguel Corp.’s Naia Expressway (NAIAx) project to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.  “Movement uses the power of big data to help government officials and planners understand the impact to travel times of the infrastructure projects and programs they roll out,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a statement. The solution uses data from thousands of trips both months before and after NAIAx was opened in June last year. Uber said the expressway shortened average travel times in and around the areas it serves.  Based on Uber’s estimates, Cua said the NAIAx extension would cut travel time between BGC and NAIAx in Entertainment City or the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) complex to about 20 minutes from 40 minutes. Cu said the Movement platform could also help government planners determine improvements in travel times once the BGC-Ortigas Center link, the proposed bridge between Binondo and Intramuros and the Skyway Stage 3 were completed.  SMC, a food and drinks giant that has diversified into infrastructure, earlier revealed that complete detailed engineering plans for the extension of the 7.7-kilometer NAIAx project going to BGC have been submitted to the government. SMC said the project would decongest Magallanes and the Edsa-Pasay area. The NAIAx extension also aims to cut travel time between Coastal Road and SM Mall of Asia areas and BGC to just 10 minutes. The NAIAx, a private-public partnership project that SMC opened last year, is a key part of Metro Manila’s tollroad network.

The Supreme Court stressed that firms should maintain a 60:40 ownership mix for all classes of shares, whether voting common shares or non-voting preferred shares.  2GO has a substantial foreign shareholder base in the form of the Kuwaitis and the China Asean Fund and, depending on whether their ownership is reckoned in terms of common or preferred shares, may or may not put the firm beyond the legal threshold, we were told. Uy’s lawyers are confident their side of the dispute is the winning side. Whether it will play out as they believe remains to be seen. Abangan! —DAXIM L. LUCAS While others are scrambling to leave the mining business amid an “unfriendly” regulatory regime, nickel miner Marcventures Holdings Inc.—under former banker Isidro Alcantara—sees the challenging times as an opportunity to bulk up and become a key player in the future. With a recent deal to buy two mining firms, Marcventures will scale up its nickel mining operations by about 33 percent and it will become the only Philippine firm extracting bauxite, a highly valued commodity used for the production of aluminum, used in the aerospace, transportation and construction sectors. Marcventures will merge with Asia Pilot Mining Philippines, which owns two mineral production sharing agreements (MPSAs) covering a combined 12,129 hectares of bauxite-rich mining site in Samar. It will also merge with the holding company of Brightgreen Resources Corp., which owns an MPSA for 4,860 hectares of nickel mining site adjacent to its current site in Surigao del Sur.  We heard that a mineral resource report by SRK Consulting has estimated the bauxite resource in Samar at more than 110 million metric tons. The merger will give Marcventure access to more than 20 million additional metric tons of nickel resource. By expanding its nickel mining capability, Marcventures seeks to stabilize its supply of nickel because in the next two years, it plans to invest in nickel-processing plants. This is in anticipation of the possible ban in the exportation of ore.Sources said Marcventures would invest some $150 million in a processing facility using rotary kiln electric furnace technology that will produce nickel pig iron, the raw material for stainless steel. Another $100 million will be invested in a vat leaching facility that will produce nickel hydroxide (said to be a cheaper technology than the high pressure acid leach perfected by the Sumitomo group).Marcventures is in serious talks with a Chinese group—one of its major buyers—that could be its technical and strategic partner for the processing facilities. —DORIS DUMLAO-ABADILLA Despite having a bumpy ride with regulators in its early days, it looks like the government is finally starting to look kindly on—and more importantly, appreciate—the local operations of global ridesharing giant Uber. Or if not the entire government, at least one important part of it. We’re talking about the Senate whose committee on public services recently recognized the value of ridesharing firms like Uber (and rival, Grab) and what they can do to reduce vehicular traffic congestion for long-suffering motorists and commuters, in Metro Manila and other growing urban areas around the country. Of course, you wouldn’t completely sense Uber’s elation at the positive first step going by their formal statement in reaction to the Senate’s positive move. “With Senate Bill 1284, the Senate Committee has recognized the value and contribution of ridesharing and carpooling as a viable solution to traffic congestion,” the company said. Of course, that’s just a preliminary victory for Uber and the ridesharing industry. There’s still a long way to go before they can rest easy. If only other regulatory agencies in the executive branch would open their minds and think of the welfare of commuters, instead of the welfare of aggressively lobbying traditional transport groups, right? —DAXIM L.

In a statement, Grab Philippines spokesperson Leo Gonzales said its drivers are required “to inspect the items for delivery and to refuse delivery of sealed packages that customers decline to open.”  READ: ‘GrabExpress’ partner a fatality in Quiapo blast “Grab will enforce more strictly, the rejection of all sealed packages for GE delivery, reinforcing the existing protocol on opening and inspecting all parcels prior to delivery,” Gonzales said.  “The circumstances of the package and its delivery are part of the on-going investigation, so we can’t comment on that. What we can emphasize is the protocol we trained our riders to follow,” he added. GrabExpress is the ridesharing firm’s on-demand delivery service in Metro Manila, which transports parcels straight from the user to the recipient with real-time tracking and notification.  Two blasts that occurred less than three hours apart rocked Quiapo on Saturday evening—the first happened at the office of lawyer and Imamate Islamic Center president Nasser Abinal and killed two people and injured four others, while the second at Norzagaray and Elizondo Streets injured two police officers. Police said the first explosion originated from a package delivered to the lawyer’s office. On Sunday, Grab Philippines confirmed that one of the two fatalities in the twin explosions was one of its drivers. Gonzales said it cannot be assumed or concluded yet that the driver did not inspect the package delivered to Abinal. He said the management decided to close down the account(s) directly linked to the Quiapo incident and to “mark any account with similar user profile.” “Even before the Quiapo incident, Grab has been in talks with the PNP Highway Patrol Group (HPG) for an anti-crime, anti-drug partnership campaign, which involves training of Grab drivers in spotting suspicious activities and reporting it to proper authorities,” he said. “Grab also reminds its partners to be extra vigilant and attentive to suspicious activities, encouraging GE partners to immediately report any dubious users and accounts,” Gonzales added.

In a statement, Grab said the deal was the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company,” which reflects the company’s leadership position in the region. “Grab is acquiring Uber’s rideshare and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia, and integrating them into Grab’s leading transportation and fintech platform,” the statement read.  Grab said Uber would take 27.5% stake in Grab, which it said was “reflective of the companies’ respective market shares.” “The acquisition accelerates Grab’s path to profitability in its core transport business, as it’s the most cost efficient Southeast Asian platform,” it said.  The acquisition, it said, “reflects Grab’s transport market leadership in Southeast Asia.” Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab said the acquisition of Uber “marks the beginning of a new era.” “We are humbled that a company born in SEA has built one of the largest platforms that millions of consumers use daily and provides income opportunities to over 5 million people. Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” Tan said. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region. Together with Uber, we are now in an even better position to fulfil our promise to serve our customers,” he added. Their trust in us as a transport brand allows us to look towards the next step as a company: improving people’s lives through food, payments and financial services.  Aside from Uber’s rideshare, Grab has also acquired Uber’s food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia. “Grab will also take over the Uber Eats operations to immediately become a major player in food delivery services,” it said. Grab said the GrabFood service would expand from two existing countries to all major Southeast Asian countries by next quarter. “This will be another great use case to drive continued adoption of the GrabPay mobile wallet and support Grab’s growing Financial Services platform,” it said. /cbb"},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/31461/uber-takes-to-the-sky-ubers-first-helicopter-rides-in-new-york","title":"Uber Takes to the Sky: Uber’s First Helicopter Rides in New York","date":"06:32 AM June 07, 2019","snippet":"Uber said Thursday it is readying its first helicopter rides, which will carry passengers between New York’s JFK Airport and lower Manhattan.

The news of the Uber Air debut was first reported by the New York Times, and confirmed by Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who tweeted the article with the comment: “Point to point multimodal journey planning and booking = no stress transport to and from JFK.”  The flights — which last about eight minutes — would begin July 9 with “dynamic pricing” expected to be around $200 to $225, with ground transportation included in the city and airport, Uber said.  The news confirms Uber’s ambitions to move beyond city streets with its “aerial ridesharing” efforts coordinated through its Uber Elevate team. “Uber Copter offers the first real demonstration of the Elevate experience,” said Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate.  The New York service will be offered to members of Uber’s loyalty programs. The flights will help gather data for a wide rollout of Uber air transportation in the coming years, according to Allison. While other helicopter services are available to New York airports, Uber is touting this as a “seamless” solution that includes all ground transportation and which can be booked on its smartphone app. Uber has previously announced plans for shared air transportation by 2023 between suburbs and cities, and potentially within cities in the United States and other countries. It has been working with partners to develop “flying cars” or small, electric aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability.   California-based Uber, the largest of the global ride-sharing firms, made a rocky stock market debut last month, raising $8 billion at a valuation of some $82 billion.

Raymund Liboro, head of the National Privacy Commission (NPC), said only the users’ registered name, e-mail address, and phone number were compromised. In a statement, Liboro said Uber Philippines, the local arm of the ridesharing company, had confirmed on Thursday that the extent of the impact was limited to these bits of information.  However, the NPC chief also noted receiving a report of “irregular processing” that suggests other data may have also been compromised, an allegation that the commission would still have to confirm in order to establish its link to the 2016 data breach incident. “We were informed that around 171,000 Filipino citizens consisting of drivers and passengers were affected by the breach. We understand this to be based on the mobile phone numbers included in the registry,” he said. “We were also informed that the exposure of the affected data subjects was limited to their registered name, e-mail address and phone number.”  It remains unclear if specific Uber users would be informed that they were hacked. The company’s US office last month made an admission of the breach, noting that the personal information of tens of millions of users worldwide had been compromised by a hack that Uber kept secret for more than a year. Prior to Thursday’s disclosure, Uber Philippines could only confirm that Filipino users were also affected by the hack, without giving exact numbers. 1.3M active riders According to Liboro, Uber Philippines reported having 1.3 million active riders in the country. The number of Uber drivers, meanwhile, is still up for validation but Liboro gave an estimate of below 100,000.  Uber’s explanation of the hack could be read on its official website. There is also an option for users to alert Uber if they think they’ve been hacked. Reached for comment on Friday, Uber Philippines neither confirmed nor denied if the company would actively inform users if they were among 171,000 Filipinos whose personal information had been compromised. Instead, Catherine Avelino, head of communications of Uber Philippines, referred the Inquirer to Uber’s blog post about the hack, stressing it has “everything we’re doing and have done.” Liboro said the NPC is now looking into the processes and procedures that Uber said it had taken “to ensure that this matter never happens again.” “We are paying particular attention to the steps taken to ensure that in the future, data breaches of this magnitude will not be concealed from regulators and from affected data subjects,” he said, noting that concealment of data breaches is a criminal offense. Liboro also said further assistance to affected users could be included in NPC’s compliance order for Uber. Uber Philippines previously claimed having no knowledge of the incident prior to the recent public admission made by its US office. Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information faces a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of less than P500,000. The necessary penalties, according to the law, would be imposed on people who, after learning about the breach, decided to conceal the fact, regardless of whether it was done intentionally or by omission."},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/80420/thoughts-on-commuting-again-when-ride-sharing-gets-annoying","title":"Thoughts on commuting again when ride-sharing gets annoying","date":"Posted on August 10, 2018August 13, 2018","snippet":"","body":" A few weeks ago, I went to a work event in Mandaluyong and by the time it ended, it was already rush hour. I tried booking a Grab going home but after five tries, I just decided to ride a bus instead of waiting out the traffic. Despite the fact that my laptop was heavy to lug around in a crowded vehicle, it actually felt great to commute from a far distance again—and pay a fare that’s less than P100. Back when ride-sharing apps didn’t exist yet, I was very patient with commuting. I don’t just mean within Makati, which is where I live. I would brave the heat, rain, traffic jams, and crowds just to get to various locations in Pasig, Quezon City, and Manila. This lasted until I started in my first job, and Grab was already operational then but I only used the app during emergency “I’m late!” cases. Many would ask me if it’s a hassle to commute from Makati to wherever. My answer would always be along the lines of “I don’t mind as long as it gets me to my destination safely.” Plus, let’s be real here, it’s cheaper than hailing a cab and booking a Grab or Uber. (RIP, Uber Philippines.) I also developed a decent sense of direction, as well street smarts, because I had to be aware of my surroundings. So, what changed my mind about commuting via public transportation in the past couple of years? A lot of things, and I’m not using time constraints or the stuff I carry as excuses. If you’ve seen the news, then you know that the MRT has been literally stopping in its tracks multiple times. So often that news outlets reported how many days the MRT had smooth operations until the next breakdown happens. Because of that, I avoided the train for fear that I might walk along the tracks, especially the elevated ones. The MRT was the fastest transport system I knew going to the north since it avoided EDSA traffic. If I wanted to ride a bus going the same route, I needed to leave early. The jeepney routes I know going to, let’s say, Quezon City may work despite it taking a bit longer. But these days, traffic jams happen even when it’s not rush hour. I also want to talk about safety precautions. I’ve elbowed a pervert in the face and caught petty thieves trying to steal from passengers in the jeep. I’ve also called out snatchers who tried to steal my phone. (Thank God for my fast stimuli.) Not to mention that I experienced jumping from the front seat of a moving jeep to escape an armed man. All of those happened years ago but when you’re given the option to book a car for yourself, you’ll take it, too. Even though it can get expensive. I still commute when I’m saving money or when I know I have enough time to get from point A to point B. But there really are days when I wished I wasn’t so dependent on ride-sharing services because when I can’t book a ride (my record is booking for three hours), I feel frustrated that I have to stay out until rush hour’s done. This needs to change. I realized that a huge chunk of my savings often goes to my personal Grab expenses. And if I wanted to go home ASAP, I might as well take the (not-so) scenic route. After all, it’s been a while since I dedicated my time to ride a bus or a train going to far distances. People might say “You won’t look fresh anymore if you commute.” But hey, that’s what makeup kits are for. It’ll get tiring too and that’s just part of the experience. I sincerely hope, though, that the government improves the public transport system in the country. Just imagine how life would be if the streets were easier to navigate, safer, less congested, and people weren’t as dependent on ride-sharing apps with insufficient number of cars. I know this isn’t going to happen overnight. So whatever mode of transportation you’re riding right now, I hope you’re having safe travels. (And that you won’t have to walk along the MRT railroad tracks.)  Art by Marian Hukom For the latest in culture, fashion, beauty, and celebrities, subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

Shares in Uber tumbled 10.75 percent to close at $37.10 on the second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Valued at some $82 billion in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector, Uber’s debut Friday was a major disappointment, losing 7.6 percent. The two-day meltdown left the Silicon Valley star with a cumulative loss of more 17.5 percent while ride-hailing rival Lyft has plunged 33 percent since its March debut.  Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor of finance specializing in IPOs, said it was highly unusual for a high-profile company like Uber to fall so quickly.   “But it’s a very difficult company to value, and I expect that there will be big upswings and downswings in the future,” Ritter said. Still, Ritter said the rocky opening is not necessarily an indication of the long-term value of Uber. “If a year from now its value goes up to $100 billion people will be no longer talking about the first two days of trading,” he said. ‘Remember Facebook’ Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi urged employees to look past the rough patch on Wall Street and stay focused on better days ahead, according to an internal email obtained by AFP.  “Remember that the Facebook and Amazon post-IPO trading was incredibly difficult for those companies,” Khosrowshahi said in the message. “And look at how they have delivered since. Our road will be the same.” He noted that Monday was a tough day for the stock market overall, not just for the San Francisco-based ride-share company with visions of becoming the “Amazon of transportation.” Khosrowshahi acknowledged that there were versions of Uber’s future in which the company does not prosper as hoped, but warned against being distracted by pessimistic voices in the market. “Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he said in the email. “We will be judged long-term on our performance, and I welcome that.” Troubled road ahead Richard Windsor, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog on technology, said Uber and Lyft have been pressured by their high valuations and intense competition. Uber and Lyft “are currently engaged in a life or death struggle to become the dominant ridesharing platform in the USA,” Windsor said. “Until this fight is settled, there is very little reason to invest in either company as while they slug it out rock bottom prices and incentives for drivers will continue to plague profitability.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Lyft shares Monday fell nearly six percent to $48.15, extending the steady decline for Uber’s smaller US rival. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said he expected the “valuation digestion process” to take some time and that he remained upbeat on Uber despite competition with Lyft and the long path to profitability. “We believe there is a large enough ocean for two boats as the ridesharing market domestically in the US is roughly $1.2 trillion and $5.7 trillion globally,” Ives said. “We expect ridership, drivers, and the monetization opportunities for Uber to increase markedly over the coming years. A core tenet of our bull thesis on Uber is around the company’s ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine.” Uber and Lyft face additional troubles, highlighted by last week’s protests from some drivers in the US, and regulatory roadblocks in many parts of the world. Thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike last week over revenue-sharing formulas and working conditions. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/20857/e-scooter-craze-injuries-pile-up","title":"E-Scooter Craze: Injuries Pile up","date":"01:02 AM February 09, 2019","snippet":"More than 1,500 people have been treated for injuries from using battery-powered electric scooters in the United States since the E-scooter craze began in late 2017, a Consumer Reports survey showed.","body":"More than 1,500 people have been treated for injuries from using battery-powered electric scooters in the United States since the E-scooter craze began in late 2017, a Consumer Reports survey showed. The nonprofit consumer magazine said its tally, based on reports from hospitals and emergency officials, is incomplete and does not include four reported fatalities linked to e-scooters. Still, it counted 1,542 cases of emergency treatment for scooter-related injuries after contacting 110 hospitals and five agencies in 47 cities where the two biggest scooter companies operate. The scooter rideshare craze, which enables consumers to rent and drop the two-wheeled devices for short trips, has been hailed as a potential revolution for urban transport. But a number of media reports have highlighted the potential dangers of scooter use either on sidewalks on city streets and roads. This week a 21-year-old Irish exchange student died after being struck by a car on his scooter in Austin, Texas, according to media.  Consumer Reports, which released its report Tuesday, said hospitals treated people for concussions, nasal fractures, forearm fractures, and other injuries, some requiring surgery. While major e-scooter firms encourage users to wear helmets, there are few regulations requiring them. The magazine said more than half of those contact in the survey had no detailed data for scooter injuries and that it was not possible to calculate the rate of incidents for distance traveled. It said many medical professionals suggested the total number of injuries is higher that the reported figure because hospitals don’t have the capability yet to accurately track specific scooter-related injuries. “Electric scooters are a promising new transportation option, but safety always must come first,” William Wallace, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports, was quoted as saying. Two US-based startups, Bird and Lime, have been growing rapidly, including internationally, and have reached valuations of more than $1 billion. Others in the segment include ridesharing group Lyft, Ford-back Spin and Skip. It may be complicated to assess the safety of scooters compared with bicycles, for example, without better data on how many people use scooters. Paul White, director of safety at Bird, said the injury figures lack context and don’t take into account that scooters reduce auto traffic. “Driving is much deadlier for everyone, as evidenced by the 6,000 pedestrians killed on US roads in 2017,” White said. “We are proud to provide a transportation alternative that gets people out of cars — not only to reduce car related fatalities, but to be part of a climate solution that will move cities forward into a safer, smarter future for us all.”  "},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/25736/lyft-ipo-sets-rollout-for-ride-hailing-sharing-economy","title":"Lyft IPO Sets Rollout for Ride-Hailing, Sharing Economy","date":"04:34 AM March 30, 2019","snippet":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share.","body":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share. Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest.  Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/42817/uber-takes-stake-in-online-grocery-group-cornershop","title":"Uber Takes Stake in Online Grocery Group Cornershop","date":"12:20 AM October 13, 2019","snippet":"Uber said Friday it agreed to take a majority stake in Cornershop, an online grocery provider in Chile, Mexico, and which recently expanded to Peru and Canada.","body":"Uber said Friday it agreed to take a majority stake in Cornershop, an online grocery provider in Chile, Mexico, and which recently expanded to Peru and Canada.

I think a lot depends on driver experience, and on the inculcation in the general public of a road-sharing ethic.  Angkas riders who are trained to carry passengers on a regular basis are surely no less experienced than the average biker in negotiating Metro Manila’s crowded streets. Indeed, I imagine they would be safer drivers than the typical solo biker who might occasionally take a friend or family member as passenger. On the other hand, the objection regarding security (e.g., the danger of being held up or abducted) would equally apply to ride-sharing networks that use cars instead of motorbikes. In fact, such danger also lurks more or less equally in taxis, jeepneys, or buses. Come to think of it, it’s probably easier to jump off a motorcycle than from a taxi or a jeepney if one’s security is threatened.  Lastly, the law prohibiting the use of two-wheel vehicles as public utility vehicles may be there, but we have yet to hear of habal-habal drivers being arrested or prevented from plying their routes in remote upland areas where these modified motorbikes (that can take a dozen passengers) are the only means of public transport available. Here we go citing laws that were crafted long before the concept of a “sharing economy” entered the world of business. If we could reinterpret those laws to accommodate entities like Uber and Grab, which, strictly speaking, are not public transport companies that own and operate fleets of vehicles, why can’t the same adaptation be made to allow the local ride-sharing network Angkas to operate legally? I believe that what’s important, in the final analysis, is that someone can be held accountable when accidents happen. If they have the same driver and passenger insurance provisions as those found in the other transport networks, there should be no further reason to stop Angkas riders from offering their services to the commuting public.  That said, I believe it’s important to revisit the original idea that inspired the formation of the successful pioneering entities in the sharing economy — like Airbnb and Uber. This may help guide our legislators in designing new laws that would prevent the idea of sharing from being totally engulfed by the commercial twin with which it made its appearance in the market economy. The idea was simple enough. Some people have things that are in excess of what they personally need — living space, space in their vehicles, time on their hands, books and similar resources they have accumulated, etc. They may not be prepared to donate these to the government or any public entity, but, given the opportunity to do so, they might gladly share these with others, expecting almost nothing in return. Thus, we have carpooling, where neighbors take turns bringing and picking up their children to and from school, instead of each parent waking up every day to bring their child to school, or paying for school bus service. Outside the campus of every big university in the United States and Europe, one would often find the most marvelous secondhand bookshops. Rather than gather dust and use up precious space in cramped student apartments, these books are sold to booksellers for a pittance, and are in turn sold back to other students for just a little more.  That, too, is a form of sharing, but with a small difference — someone, in this case, the secondhand bookseller, manages the exchange. Airbnb and Uber take off basically from the same hybrid concept.  An entity is formed that manages the exchange of gifts among the participants and creates and maintains the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. For this, a small fee is collected. Ideally, there’s supposed to be no exchange of money among the participants in the sharing network. The fee that is collected should be just enough to compensate the employees of the network and take care of incidental expenses. Homeowners who let travelers use a spare room are content to collect a small fee for laundry and electricity and be rewarded by the friendship and gratitude they reap as hosts. Travelers get to enjoy virtually free accommodation with a dose of personal hospitality, instead of staying in impersonal high-priced hotels.  Regretfully, the spirit of sharing has been overshadowed by profit-making. Venture capitalists saw the potential of monetizing the spirit of gift-giving, and invested heavily in the new companies. This drove the sharing economy to become as grasping in its quest for returns as the conventional capitalism it sought to replace. The participants themselves soon dropped the veneer of sharing. Individual car owners were soon replaced by greedy entrepreneurs that bought fleets of vehicles intended for use in the Uber or Grab networks.  And, big landlords owning several houses began to edge out small homeowners who had initially networked with Airbnb. We must learn from these sad experiences as we search for new models of sharing in a world that seems bent on monetizing everything we value. public.lives@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/55203/starting-uber-again-read-excited-reactions-after-the-15-day-hiatus","title":"‘Starting Uber Again’: Read Excited Reactions After the 15-Day Hiatus","date":"Posted on August 30, 2017August 30, 2017","snippet":"","body":" The LTFRB finally lifted Uber’s suspension after the ridesharing company paid a P190-million fine.

On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said during Wednesday’s special board meeting.  The LTFRB order comes just four days after the PCC told Uber and Grab to continue to operate independently in the country while it conducts its motu propio review on the deal, which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the board that while they intended to withdraw their petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC, they were constrained to do so because of the PCC order.  Earlier, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said that, under their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to extend their funding of the operations of the Uber app to April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. According to him, however, doing so would not only defeat the purpose of what PCC wanted, but would also put the riding public in danger since Uber would no longer have any back-end support in the country that would address complaints and take care of passengers in the event of an accident.  In issuing the order, Lizada said that, the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would adversely affect the riding public and the thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. “The soonest possible time that you [Uber] will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she said. Meanwhile, LTFRB also ordered Grab to “immediately” lower its surge pricing cap from twice the rate to just 1.5, as it processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. “This is to ensure that the fare will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said.  In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following Uber’s exit in the country. But Cu said they were not taking advantage of the situation as he pointed out that the price surge was due to the lack of drivers in their system. He explained that, while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. Cu noted that the reason Uber’s fare was lower than theirs was because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was at P5, while theirs was at P11. He added that, if Uber would not exit the country, its rate would soon be similar to theirs as it sought the LTFRB an increase to P12 per kilometer. /atm"},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/118030/filipinos-joining-applicants-for-calif-drivers-license-for-undocumented","title":"Filipinos joining applicants for Calif. driver’s license for undocumented","date":"07:52 AM January 27, 2015","snippet":"SAN MATEO, California — No more pedaling the bicycle or ridesharing with relatives and friends to work or to bring the children to school.

This month, the Department of Motor Vehicles started issuing special licenses to people who cannot prove their legal presence in the country. So-called irregular Filipino immigrants are among the people joining the long lines of applicants for a California driver’s license at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Roughly, one in four Filipinos are undocumented in the US, said Joanna Concepcion, of the Filipino Migrant Center, “and it’s important that Filipinos are well-informed about how this new law could benefit them. “ Since January 1, when AB60 — the Safe and Responsible Driver Act — became law, thousands of undocumented immigrants have applied for driver’s licenses. California joins nine other states to grant undocumented immigrants access to licenses but with applicable limitations.  Immigrant advocates say some applicants who previously held licenses under Social Security numbers that were not their own have been told they will need to meet with a DMV investigator. Undocumented immigrants who fraudulently obtained a California driver’s licenses before it was legal won’t be able to a new car until state authorities review their driving records.  The DMV expects to field 1.4 million applications in the fist three years of the program aimed at boosting road safety and making immigrants’ lives easier. According to Seth Ronquillo, of Asian American Advancing Justice, more than 400,00 Asian American undocumented could be eligible for the program. “You’re always afraid to be stopped by police, “ Ronquillo said, “they can take you car. “Some had to ride bikes to work or share a ride with someone,” he added. Application requirements According to the DMV, applicants must submit proof of identity and state residency and pass a written test to get a driving permit.  Those who don’t possess foreign government-issued identification on a list of approved documents can be interviewed by a DMV investigator to see if they qualify. Immigrants must come back at a later date and pass a road test to get a license, which will be marked with the words, “Federal Limits Apply.” Jessica Gonzalez, a DMV spokesman, was quoted as saying that, “those who have licenses from other states are not required to take a road test again. “ Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have said the program will improve road safety because more drivers will be tested and insured. A DMV study of 23 years of crash data found unlicensed drivers were more likely to cause a fatal collision. Undocumented Filipinos apply Protected by the TRUST Act that took effect on January 1, enabling the undocumented to cooperate with police without fear of deportation, some undocumented Filipino immigrants, are now coming out into the open to apply for driver’s licenses in various DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) offices. Danilo (not his real name), a professional in the Philippines working now as caregiver, and who has been in the Bay Area for more than seven years, told INQUIRER.NET he was eager to obtain a driver’s license because he needs it “for peace of mind.” “My work includes driving anywhere for my client — from doctors to hospitals, to stores and pharmacies and more importantly, to car shows not only in California but other states, “ Danilo said. When he and his paraplegic client (name withheld) goes out of state to do bids for a car show, Danilo said he fears that he might get pulled over by police who would impound his boss’ vehicle. Worse, he might go to jail for lack of a document. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “I was just lucky to have gone this far, but when we went to Arizona the other week for a huge national car show, I was worried that there would be check points along the way because we had to pass through Las Vegas and Los Angeles, for a total trip of 2,500 miles back and forth, “ he said. Danilo is one among thousands of undocumented immigrants who are hiding in the shadows but would like to become legitimate. “ I paid my taxes using my ITIN (Income Tax Identification Number), too, each year. “ He is ready. “I am going to the DMV and bring my proofs of identity and residence along with a friend who will accompany me because I also borrowed his vehicle that is covered with insurance.” Danilo will take his chances in obtaining the important document “so that I could drive safely without fear and also get a sense of legitimacy.” Similarly, Hermie, another undocumented Filipino construction worker, said that for the past two years he spent $7,000 to retrieve his impounded car. Under existing laws, vehicles are impounded by police if the driver cannot show proof of license and insurance coverage. Danilo and Hermie are among the few Filipinos who will fall in line at the DMV for a driver’s license. Other Filipinos are still hesitant. Supporters and opponents “It’s something that you’re lucky to have, something undocumented shouldn’t be allowed to have that privilege,” ABC News quoted one opponent of the program. “It’s not something that they should get (because) it legitimizes illegal immigration in a way they give a government document to somebody who’s not legally in the US.” However, supporters of the law contend it’s about “safety on the roads because folks have to take the tests.” Police are backing this law for road safety considerations; many hit and run cases involve unlicensed drivers fleeing the scene of an accident.

The ridesharing giant announced a series of partnerships to manufacture “vertical takeoff and landing” (VTOL) vehicles and put networks in place, a system dubbed Uber Elevate.  The partner cities working with Uber are Dubai and the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis in Texas. “The goal of these partnerships is to develop a new on-demand VTOL network to enable customers in the future to push a button and get a high-speed flight in and around cities,” Uber said in a statement.  The announcement came at a summit held in the Dallas area with partners in the project. “What started as a simple question ‘why can’t I push a button and get a ride?’ has turned, for Uber, into a passionate pursuit of the pinnacle of urban mobility — the reduction of congestion and pollution from transportation, giving people their time back, freeing up real estate dedicated to parking and providing access to mobility in all corners of a city,” said Uber chief product officer Jeff Holden.  “Urban aviation is a natural next step for Uber in this pursuit, which is why we are working to make push a button, get a flight a reality.” Uber’s goal is to have the first demonstration network in place in Dubai for the 2020 World Expo in that city, and another pilot in Dallas the same year ahead of “full-scale operations” in the Texas region by 2023. The announcement came a day after Silicon Valley “flying car” startup Kitty Hawk, reportedly backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, released a video of its airborne prototype and announced plans for deliveries of a “personal flying machine” this year. Uber’s plans appear more ambitious, and include partnerships with US-based Bell Helicopter, Brazilian manufacturer Embraer and Slovenia’s Pipistrel to produce flying machines for short distance urban operations. “Uber’s Elevate network is an exciting opportunity for Bell Helicopter to help transform how cities move people and products in the future,” Bell president and chief executive Mitch Snyder said in a statement.  Embraer CEO Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva praised the “unique opportunity to complement the air transport knowledge of a visionary and revolutionary ground transport company.” The Uber plan also includes partnerships for “vertiports” for the flyers to take off and land, along with changing stations for the transporters, which are expected to be mainly electric-powered. Uber’s agreement with Dubai Roads and Transport Authority calls for a joint study into pricing models, people movement and determining where routes should be created in the city. “The partnership will result in everything from hover and forward flight tests to actual flight operations in the Dubai area,” according to a joint statement. Uber has grown into the world’s largest venture-backed startup, with a valuation estimated at some $68 billion despite ongoing obstacles with regulators and taxi operators. In addition to ridesharing in some 80 countries, Uber is also testing self-driving cars in three US metro areas. Uber’s growth so far has not been dented by a series of embarrassing disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics and covert use of law enforcement-evading software.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab. FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. [To say that] one taxi car is equivalent to one ride-sharing car is simply not true,” he said. “It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/894929/grabexpress-partner-a-fatality-in-quiapo-blast","title":"‘GrabExpress’ partner a fatality in Quiapo blast","date":"03:15 PM May 07, 2017","snippet":"Grab Philippines on Sunday confirmed that one of the two fatalities in the twin explosions that rocked Quiapo, Manila Saturday evening was one of its “GrabExpress” partners.","body":"Grab Philippines on Sunday confirmed that one of the two fatalities in the twin explosions that rocked Quiapo, Manila Saturday evening was one of its “GrabExpress” partners.

LTFRB should have approved or rejected applications faster,” Ejercito said over Twitter.  “TNVS on the other hand shouldn’t have allowed units which have no papers at all into their system,” he said. Ejercito and Senator Grace Poe met with the LTFRB and transport network companies in a dialogue on Wednesday.  Poe and Ejercito are the chair and vice chair of the Senate committee on public services, respectively. In a closed-door meeting, the heads of the LTFRB, Grab and Uber agreed to a compromise: Uber and Grab drivers can operate while an appeal against a ban is being heard.  “We cannot fault LTFRB entirely. It is just doing its job as a regulatory body. Their concern on accountability of TNVS is legitimate,” Ejercito said. The senator earlier chided the LTFRB for cracking down on Grab and Uber, which he said “offer far better and more convenient services than regular taxis.” Instead of banning TNVS, Ejercito said the LTFRB should take action first on the complaints against the taxi drivers. “Kung ganito kayo kaingay at kadesididong patawan ng service ban ang Grab at Uber, dapat ganito rin ang aksyon ninyo sa mga reklamo sa regular taxis!” he said. But the senator later pointed out that Grab and Uber also need to address issues regarding its ride-hailing concept and dynamic pricing.  “Concept of Uber and Grab supposedly for private car owners to own a little on their free time through ride sharing. Supposed to be part time,” he said. Ejercito noted that some enterprising people have acquired fleets of cars being used as TNVS. “This is not the concept of Uber and Grab the way I understand it,” he said. He said having a fleet of cars functioning as TNVS is “unfair to the “legitimate” regular taxis who have franchise.” Nonetheless, Ejercito said “this Uber and Grab vs. LTFRB issue should serve as a wakeup call to regular taxi operators and drivers to improve their services.” The senator said he hoped to work out a compromise through legislation by regulating and defining the operations and functions of the TNVS. “Convenience of the riding public will be the prime consideration as government provides and improves services,” he said. Poe also filed Senate Bill No. 1501 or Transportation Network Services Act seeking to institutionalize and regulate ride-hailing services. CBB/rga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248912/uber-acquire-self-service-bicycle-firm","title":"Uber to acquire self-service bicycle firm","date":"12:37 PM April 10, 2018","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/182676","title":"SM, SM Prime, Ortigas Holding Firm, Funding, Investment, SM Prime Holdings Inc.","date":"08:10 AM November 28, 2014","snippet":"TRIPDA, a ridesharing smartphone application, “started” in the Philippines on Thursday but the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said drivers should wait first for the new government rules before charging customers for the service.","body":"TRIPDA, a ridesharing smartphone application, “started” in the Philippines on Thursday but the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said drivers should wait first for the new government rules before charging customers for the service.

We are now reviewing their position and our findings will be considered in our decision-making (on the rules),” Ginez said.  The Tripda model allows the linking of drivers who have empty seats in their vehicles with passengers traveling in a similar route. He said this model would likely be classified as an “online-enabled transportation service.” This is different from the car-for-hire rule being eyed for Uber.  He noted that drivers using the Tripda platform to ferry passengers before the new rules were out would be doing so at their own risk. “What is clear right now is private vehicles being used to ferry passengers, as the law now prescribes, require a certificate of public convenience,” Ginez said. The LTFRB chair’s comment was sought as Germany’s Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said it had launched its Tripda platform in the Philippines yesterday. As noted, the app was meant to encourage car pooling which, it said, was attractive to drivers and passengers since they could cut down costs by splitting the fuel tab. Given the model of the app, passengers will pay drivers only with cash, Tripda said in the statement.  The app is also relatively new but has met early success. Within the space of just five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and later on expand to other regions, Tripda said. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights. In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways and runs checks. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets. The Brazilian-born startup already has tens of thousands of registered users and has facilitated rides for many thousands of passengers, the statement showed. Technology-based transportation applications have been under government scrutiny and have met resistance from taxi cab operators. Last month, an Uber driver was arrested for operating without the necessary franchise but the action has drawn condemnation from netizens, prompting the Department of Transportation and Communications to consider a more accommodating approach."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/930533/ltfrb-only-3-cars-per-uber-grab-operator","title":"LTFRB: Only 3 cars per Uber, Grab operator","date":"06:24 AM September 14, 2017","snippet":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday.","body":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday. At a Senate briefing on the Department of Transportation budget, Delgra told Sen. Grace Poe that the LTFRB would issue a memorandum circular on this new requirement in “moving forward to solve this issue” on regulating the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS).  “We have to go back to the original concept of ride-sharing. We cannot allow that there are TNVS operators operating more than 20 or 30 units,” he told Poe who asked him whether the LTFRB would limit the number of vehicles to be owned by TNVS operators. Asked by Poe what would happen to operators with 10 or more units, Delgra replied: “We know we cannot simply drop them.”  He said he was aware that a large number of TNVS operators had gone to the extent of borrowing money from banks to “get a car so they would be able to put it in Uber or Grab.” According to Delgra, there will be a “transition period” for those who will be affected by the new requirement and they will be offered options.  “Considering the fact that they are actually maintaining a fleet already; they own 20 units under one name [so] they can go [into] taxi service. Second, they can also go into [the] shuttle service if they want. And third, they can also go into tourist transport,” Delgra said. The LTFRB earlier said it would come out this month with new regulations governing the app-based transport industry such as extending the validity of franchise given to drivers. Uber has 66,000 vehicles while Grab has over 52,000. Of these, however, only more than 3,700 are licensed to operate by the LTFRB."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/714285/ltfrb-approves-uber-accreditation","title":"LTFRB approves Uber accreditation","date":"11:08 AM August 19, 2015","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transport Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has approved on Wednesday the application of online-based transportation service provider Uber as an accredited Transport Network Company (TNC).  LTFRB says that effective Wednesday, August 19, Uber is now a registered TNC. As an accredited TNC, Uber partner drivers will need to register as common carriers with the LTFRB and pay a filing fee of at least P520.  Uber cars are required to install global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices. The approval of Uber’s application came two days after the ridesharing mobile application filed for accreditation ahead of the August 20 deadline imposed by LTFRB.  The TNC accreditation will allow Uber and other app-based service providers to operate legally in the country. The LTFRB will apprehend unregistered Uber taxis and other private vehicles operating as public utility vehicles (PUVs) starting August 21. Drivers of unregistered private vehicles operating as PUVs will be fined P200,000 and their vehicles will be impounded for three months."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282065/dotr-taps-paymaya-for-cash-free-payments-for-puvs","title":"DOTr taps PayMaya for cash-free payments for PUVs","date":"05:02 AM May 28, 2020","snippet":"The Department of Transportation has tapped PayMaya to provide digital payments for taxi cabs and ridesharing vehicles, formally called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) in the country.","body":"The Department of Transportation has tapped PayMaya to provide digital payments for taxi cabs and ridesharing vehicles, formally called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) in the country.

What were the parameters used, like demand and supply?” Poe asked in a statement on Monday.  The senator said “some formula would have been used because these figures, which are important to the riding public, cannot and should not be plucked out of thin air.” “In this age of algorithms, LTFRB should make public the factual basis of its decision. Ilabas nila ang minutes ng meetings and consultations para alam ng publiko (They should release the minutes of the meetings and consultation so the public will know),” she said.  “Such disclosure of a public document is what the FOI (freedom of information) rules, issued by the President, require. Tulad namin dito sa Senado (Like us here in the Senate), ang (the) transcripts are made public. Walang (Nothing) censored or hidden,” she pointed out. While clarifying that she was not questioning LTFRB’s order, Poe insisted that the agency should “explain the scientific basis of their decision.”  The senator also questioned if LTFRB conducted surveys among transport network vehicle service (TNVS) customers, whom she described as the “most important components in the ride-sharing business.”  The LTFRB recently issued Memorandum Circular 2018-003 which sets a “common supply base” for TNVS providers. The said base would mean that ride-sharing companies would share the pool, without exceeding it. The LTFRB earlier assured the public that the base would be reviewed every quarter and adjusted correspondingly based on “churning rate” or the number of vehicles that are no longer in the system. Poe, however, pointed out that the review “should not just be based on the churning rate, but on an “algorithm that determines supply and demand.” “The cap will also affect not just the TNCs but the livelihood of drivers of TNVS. Given that there are currently about 100k TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,” she added in the statement."},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/15627/move-over-grab-chinas-biggest-ride-sharing-firm-target-ang-pinas","title":"Move over Grab, China’s biggest ride-sharing firm target ang Pinas","date":"11/04/2019","snippet":"","body":" NAKIKIPAG-USAP ang pinakamalaking ride-sharing company sa China na Didi Chuxing sa isang Filipino group upang tapusin ang paghahari ng Grab Philippines, base sa report ng Philippine Daily Inquirer.
