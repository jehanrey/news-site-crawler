During a transportation committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Delgra expressed shock at the numbers provided by Uber and Grab on the number of ride-hailing and -sharing vehicles operating in Manila.  Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.  READ: ‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu for his part said of the 52,398 Grab cars, only 3,000 to 4000 have provisional authority from the LTFRB.  Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added. READ: DOTr: Grab, Uber must follow rules Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi for his part said as much as 60 percent of Uber drivers do not go full time, and that only less than 10,000 vehicles drive for the ride-sharing services at any point.  He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801057/uber-summoned-driver-accused-of-rape","title":"Uber summoned; driver accused of rape","date":"05:03 AM July 30, 2016","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City. LTFRB issued a show cause order to the transport network company (TNC) on Friday,  asking the firm to disclose details about the driver to help the complainant. Board member Ariel Inton said the agency had received a report that a 22-year-old woman was sexually abused on Wednesday afternoon by an Uber driver who picked her up at Camp Aguinaldo.  According to a report filed in the Quezon City Police District, the driver of a red Toyota Vios (ARA 3101), identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, suddenly embraced the victim and told her to hold his genitals while they were passing through Katipunan Avenue, near UP Town Center,  around 2:30 p.m. As the victim tried to break free from the suspect, he allegedly pulled her hair to force her to perform oral sex, but she managed to escape.  The LTFRB asked Uber officials to appear in a hearing on Aug. 10. Citing the board’s “frustrations,” Inton noted that Uber “doesn’t give the real identity of their ‘peers’ or driver/operator” as it invokes its privacy policy. “It has come to our attention that Uber does not disclose the name of the driver or any of its details to their passenger. When a crime is committed, it would be very hard for the victim to file a case because no detail with regard to the perpetrator is provided,” Inton said in a statement. LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra also ordered Uber to disclose the driver’s identity and other personal details, stressing that “it is a franchise requirement.” In a statement issued Friday afternoon, Uber said it had already removed the driver—  whom it did not name—from its platform and gotten in touch with authorities involved in the investigation. “First and foremost our thoughts are with the rider and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the reported incident and are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and stand ready to assist them in every way we can,” the company said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407501/maskless-uber-passenger-arrested-for-pepper-spraying-coughing-on-driver","title":"Maskless Uber passengers arrested for pepper spraying, coughing on driver","date":"12:32 PM March 16, 2021","snippet":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks.","body":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks. Uber driver Subhakar Khadka, 32, picked up three female passengers from the neighborhood of Bayview in San Francisco on March 7. Khadka claimed that one of his passengers was not wearing a face mask, so he politely told her that he cannot continue with the ride unless she wears one, CBS Los Angeles reported on March 9.  Despite the gentle reminder from the driver about the health protocol, the woman still refused to wear a mask. Instead, she started yelling and attacking him. The scuffle was captured on video and shared by the news outlet’s reporter Betty Yu via Twitter on March 9. It can be seen in the video that one of the women who shouted profanities at Khadka also coughed on him and grabbed his cellphone. She also ripped the face mask he was wearing.   “If I was another complexion, I would have not gotten that treatment from them,” Khadka said in the report, adding that he thinks the hostility was related to race. He also claimed that when the women eventually got out of his car, they pepper sprayed him from a gap in his passenger window. This forced him to vacate his vehicle because it became difficult to breathe. The suspects in the case were identified by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) in a March 11 release. One of them was Malaysia King, 24, who was arrested on charges of assault with a caustic chemical, assault and battery, conspiracy and violation of health and safety code. Arna Kimiai, 24, was also identified as another suspect but she did not immediately surrender to authorities. She is the woman in the video seen grabbing Khadka’s cellphone. Through her counsel, expressed intent to turn herself in, as stated in the release. She kept her word and was taken into custody on March 14.  Kimiai was arrested at the San Francisco County Jail for charges of robbery, assault and battery, conspiracy, and violation of health and safety code, a follow-up statement from the SFPD said. Lieutenant Tracy McCray, head of the department’s Robbery Detail, assured the public that the SFPD is committed to the case and that they are taking COVID-19 protocols seriously.

The order came Monday when a judge granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based.  The suit calls on the companies to comply with a state law that went into effect at the start of this year that requires “gig workers” such as Uber and Lyft drivers to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits. “The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,” Becerra said in a release.  “While this fight still has a long way to go, we’re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve.” Uber is backing a referendum in the state to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent.  The judge wrote in the ruling that Uber and Lyft could not indefinitely put off their “day of reckoning” when it came to complying with the law. Uber has argued that most of its drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits. “Misclassification hurts drivers and it puts the burden on taxpayers to pay for benefits that Uber and Lyft should be providing,” said San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera. “During this global pandemic, it’s even more important for drivers to get access to protections like unemployment insurance.” The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to comply with the order, which the companies can appeal.  Uber outlined proposals this week for a new type of relationship with gig workers, including its own drivers, that would keep them as independent contractors but with some guaranteed benefits. The ride-hailing giant described “a new model for independent platform work” in an 18-page document it hopes can be used as a blueprint for Uber and similar firms relying on independent workers. The company seeks “to deliver certainty for millions of independent contractors who will increasingly rely on independent work to help them face the economic challenges that lie ahead,” Uber said in its document. Uber proposed that gig economy companies be required to establish “benefits funds,” allowing gig workers to accrue and use the money for benefits or paid leave. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, writing in The New York Times, said that the current employment system is outdated and “forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net.” Uber argues that requiring drivers to be classified as employees would leave jobs only for a small fraction of its drivers and that costs would become more expensive."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900274/mother-of-uber-founder-killed-in-boating-accident","title":"Mother of Uber founder killed in boating accident","date":"12:15 PM May 28, 2017","snippet":"The mother of Travis Kalanick, founder of the on-demand ride service Uber, was killed in a boating accident and his father was seriously hurt, authorities and a company official said Saturday.","body":"The mother of Travis Kalanick, founder of the on-demand ride service Uber, was killed in a boating accident and his father was seriously hurt, authorities and a company official said Saturday. An initial investigation showed that Bonnie Kalanick, 71, died Friday after the boat she was in struck a rock in Pine Flat Lake near the central California city of Fresno, the Fresno County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office said in a statement.  “Last night Travis and his family suffered an unspeakable tragedy. His mother passed away in a devastating boating accident near Fresno and his father is in serious condition,” an Uber representative said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Travis and his family in this heartbreaking time.”  Authorities responding to a call of a boating accident found Kalanick’s parents on the shore of the lake. Kalanick’s father had moderate injuries, and his mother was dead, authorities said.  The boat sank in the lake and was to be retrieved to determine the circumstances of the accident. “An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday. This remains an ongoing investigation,” the Fresno Sheriff-Coroner’s Office said. Travis Kalanick runs privately-held Uber, which is valued at about $68 billion. In the past several months, the company has been rocked by disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics and the covert use of law enforcement-evading software.

Uber Philippines said on Thursday that it sought the government’s approval to increase the fare per kilometer (km) of uberX rides by about 58 percent to 110 percent, depending on the time of the day.  Under its proposal, the fare per km would rise to P9 to P12 from the current rate of P5.70 per km. Unchanged were the uberX base fare and time charge of P40 and P2, respectively, the company said. The proposed increase, filed with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board today, would help Uber drivers recover part of their expenses, it noted.  “The costs that driver-partners have to bear to maintain their vehicles is projected to increase due to several factors, including requirements under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines to further improve safety and quality of service, increasing fuel prices, and new excise taxes on petroleum,” Uber Philippines said. Under the newly enacted Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law, gasoline will be subject to a higher excise tax of P7 per liter.  Grab, which is Uber’s main rival in the Philippines, earlier this month sought the LTFRB’s approval to increase its fare per km to P11 to P15. This is higher than the previous range of P10 per P14. It also sought the increase of its per-minute running charge from P2 to P2.10. Last October 2017, the LTFRB approved a fare increase for the taxi industry. The new structure involved a flag down rate of P40 for taxis in Metro Manila and a per kilometer rate of P13.50. Taxis also charge P2 per minute of running time."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/186170/uber-technologies-expanding-in-ph","title":"Uber Technologies expanding in PH","date":"05:41 AM February 06, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region.","body":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region. But certain kinks, like the proposed  regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, needs further “reconsideration,” Michael Brown, Uber regional general manager, said in a rare interview in Manila this week.  Brown said Uber welcomed the release of the new guidelines, which has yet to receive the final approval of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya, as a way to move forward following a brief run-in with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in late 2014. He noted that Uber, whose growth has skyrocketed globally since it started in 2009 and is now valued at more than $40 billion, agreed with most of the new guidelines, which would require drivers here to get government permits apart from more stringent safety measures like criminal background checks.  “The Philippines would be the first jurisdiction in Asia to have this kind of regulation,” Brown said. The new rules  will likewise lend added legitimacy to Uber’s domestic business. Uber, which owns no cars and provides only the platform, has been recording fast growth since it officially began in Metro Manila in February 2014, Brown said.  It makes money by taking a cut out of the fare, usually 20 percent. Brown declined to give figures specific to the Philippines but said the Uber X product, for more compact vehicles, offers cheaper fares compared to standard taxis. The company expects to lure “tens of thousands” of  Filipino drivers over the next few years. He said plans to expand outside Metro Manila were also in the cards.  As noted, a thorny issue here is related to the regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, which can fluctuate depending on the volume of vehicles on the road. For example, prices can fall below regular  taxi rates during lean hours but they also climb significantly higher during “rush hours.” “We have made transportation less expensive for people and drivers are making more money than they have ever made. What we are advocating is that the government here should allow us to do what we do well,” Brown said. “We have expressed a desire for them [LTFRB] to rethink that aspect of the regulation,” said Brown, adding that their pricing model is regulated nowhere else in the world. Right now, the LTFRB is keen on regulating fares—its mandate under the law, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said in a separate interview. He said the draft had been submitted to Abaya and further meetings were likely required. “We know the economics of this [ business] and we will not be unreasonable. But we want to have the final say. We don’t want prices to be abused,” Ginez said.  He said he was hoping to release the final rules within the month."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/856560/after-ltfrb-warning-grab-uber-put-cap-on-price-surges","title":"After LTFRB warning, Grab, Uber put cap on price surges","date":"12:40 AM December 26, 2016","snippet":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season.","body":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season. In response to a 48-hour ultimatum issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Uber implemented on Sunday a limit to its surge pricing.  In a statement, Uber said the limit would remain in effect up to Jan. 15, 2017, to allow passengers to avail themselves of “more affordable” rides. It called on the public to use the Uber app’s “Help” feature should they have any concerns regarding their trip.  Grab, meanwhile, committed to place a cap on its rates from Dec. 24 to Jan. 30 next year “to ensure that the riding public will get the best service and rates during this season.” It gave no further details,  however, as to how much the limit would be. The company reminded its passengers to “double check” their destination and pickup points before confirming their booking so they will not be charged incorrectly.  The LTFRB on Sunday thanked Grab for its “immediate action” on the matter. But in the case of Uber, the board earlier that day issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the transport network company (TNC) for it come up with measures that would prevent “unreasonable” price surges. The LTFRB then noted that the company “did not heed” the board’s earlier directive for the TNCs not to take advantage of the increased demand from commuters. The board earlier reminded them that it can suspend or cancel their accreditation should the complaints persist. This was after it received reports that riders had paid as much as P28,000 just for a single trip. Before Uber announced the price cap, a note published on the company website said the LTFRB should also make a move.  Discussions since July Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua pointed out that since the LTFRB suspended the application of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) in July, there have been discussions with the agency concerning ways to address the growing demand and avoid price surges caused by the lack of vehicles. “We have seen increasing demand for Uber rides this holiday season, yet vehicle availability remained stagnant. We are optimistic that the LTFRB will soon lift the suspension on new TNVS applications, allowing more people to enjoy safe, reliable and affordable rides in the Philippines,” Cua said. Mounting complaints over price surges first became a concern for the LTFRB in September last year, particularly after a stormy night in Metro Manila when flash floods paralyzed traffic and rides became scarce in many parts of the capital. The LTFRB on Sunday renewed its call to the public to report any violation committed not only by TNCs but also by taxi drivers to the board’s 24/7 hotline 1342 or mobile numbers 09175501342 and 09985501342.

In a statement, PCC said it ordered both ride-hailing firms to keep separate and independent operations until the antitrust body wraps up its review of the acquisition.  PCC had issued a set of interim measures to preserve the same business conditions prior to the deal. This means riders and drivers should still be able to choose Uber as an alternative to Grab for the time being. The order echoes a similar move made by PCC’s counterpart in Singapore, which ordered Uber to continue operating the app for another week, or until April 15, due to similar anti-competitive concerns.  Feasibility Uber’s compliance to the order in Singapore “indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said.  This comes despite claims made by Uber officials that the company has officially left the market, leaving no one behind to man the app. The antitrust body, however, did not buy this explanation. Since Uber acquired a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s regional business as part of the takeover deal, it is not true that Uber has indeed left the country, Balisacan said. “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he said. Integration “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he added.  Last month, Grab announced it would acquire Uber in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. The deal has also put other competition authorities in the region on their toes. In the Philippines, PCC previously said the acquisition would result to Grab controlling around 80 percent of the ride hailing market in the country. This is a concern especially since Grab has been known for its relatively higher rider fees and how it discriminates against rider destinations. PCC officials raised these concerns during a public hearing with Grab and Uber representatives on April 5. Penalties Should Grab and Uber fail to comply in five working days, they would have to “show cause” within 24 hours after the end of the five-day period, according to an excerpt of the interim measures. The parties should then explain “why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” PCC did not list the possible penalties. However, according to the Philippine Competition Act, erring parties would have to pay P50,000 to P2 million for each violation. Moreover, they would have to eventually pay a similar amount for each day they did the violations until the parties fully comply with the order. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The duration of the review depends on the cooperation of the companies, Balisacan said in a previous interview. Under current rules, the review could end in a matter of weeks, or even extend up to six months. Not business as usual Representatives from Uber and Grab are yet to comment on the matter. However, during the public hearing on April 5, officials and lawyers from both companies wanted business to go as planned, noting that some of PCC’s concerns were unwarranted. Uber’s next move is yet to be seen. But according to Brooks Entwistle, Uber chief business officer for Asia Pacific, the company, which has been losing money in Southeast Asia, does not intend to return to the market. Falling apart “Our people are gone. Our funding is gone. Our marketplace is falling apart by every day as we transition [to Grab],” he said during the public hearing. In the same hearing, Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said the acquisition involves driver contracts as well as other data that drivers consented to give. The deal does not include the integration of both Grab and Uber systems, she said, therefore concerns such as Grab’s access to Uber’s pricing mechanisms were unnecessary. “We think, that if it means the commission is going to compel to reverse that business decision, we think that is a burdensome and disproportionate response to what is a valid management protocol,” she said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919650/number-of-uber-grab-vehicles-shocks-ltfrb","title":"Number of Uber, Grab vehicles shocks LTFRB","date":"01:11 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.","body":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801057/uber-summoned-driver-accused-of-rape","title":"Uber summoned; driver accused of rape","date":"05:03 AM July 30, 2016","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has called officials of Uber System Inc. to a hearing in connection with a rape complaint filed by a passenger against an Uber car driver in Quezon City. LTFRB issued a show cause order to the transport network company (TNC) on Friday,  asking the firm to disclose details about the driver to help the complainant. Board member Ariel Inton said the agency had received a report that a 22-year-old woman was sexually abused on Wednesday afternoon by an Uber driver who picked her up at Camp Aguinaldo.  According to a report filed in the Quezon City Police District, the driver of a red Toyota Vios (ARA 3101), identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, suddenly embraced the victim and told her to hold his genitals while they were passing through Katipunan Avenue, near UP Town Center,  around 2:30 p.m. As the victim tried to break free from the suspect, he allegedly pulled her hair to force her to perform oral sex, but she managed to escape.  The LTFRB asked Uber officials to appear in a hearing on Aug. 10. Citing the board’s “frustrations,” Inton noted that Uber “doesn’t give the real identity of their ‘peers’ or driver/operator” as it invokes its privacy policy. “It has come to our attention that Uber does not disclose the name of the driver or any of its details to their passenger. When a crime is committed, it would be very hard for the victim to file a case because no detail with regard to the perpetrator is provided,” Inton said in a statement. LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra also ordered Uber to disclose the driver’s identity and other personal details, stressing that “it is a franchise requirement.” In a statement issued Friday afternoon, Uber said it had already removed the driver—  whom it did not name—from its platform and gotten in touch with authorities involved in the investigation. “First and foremost our thoughts are with the rider and her family. We immediately removed the driver from the Uber platform when we learned of the reported incident and are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and stand ready to assist them in every way we can,” the company said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407501/maskless-uber-passenger-arrested-for-pepper-spraying-coughing-on-driver","title":"Maskless Uber passengers arrested for pepper spraying, coughing on driver","date":"12:32 PM March 16, 2021","snippet":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks.","body":"Two women were arrested for pepper spraying and coughing on an Uber driver who refused to give them a ride for not wearing face masks. Uber driver Subhakar Khadka, 32, picked up three female passengers from the neighborhood of Bayview in San Francisco on March 7. Khadka claimed that one of his passengers was not wearing a face mask, so he politely told her that he cannot continue with the ride unless she wears one, CBS Los Angeles reported on March 9.  Despite the gentle reminder from the driver about the health protocol, the woman still refused to wear a mask. Instead, she started yelling and attacking him. The scuffle was captured on video and shared by the news outlet’s reporter Betty Yu via Twitter on March 9. It can be seen in the video that one of the women who shouted profanities at Khadka also coughed on him and grabbed his cellphone. She also ripped the face mask he was wearing.   “If I was another complexion, I would have not gotten that treatment from them,” Khadka said in the report, adding that he thinks the hostility was related to race. He also claimed that when the women eventually got out of his car, they pepper sprayed him from a gap in his passenger window. This forced him to vacate his vehicle because it became difficult to breathe. The suspects in the case were identified by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) in a March 11 release. One of them was Malaysia King, 24, who was arrested on charges of assault with a caustic chemical, assault and battery, conspiracy and violation of health and safety code. Arna Kimiai, 24, was also identified as another suspect but she did not immediately surrender to authorities. She is the woman in the video seen grabbing Khadka’s cellphone. Through her counsel, expressed intent to turn herself in, as stated in the release. She kept her word and was taken into custody on March 14.  Kimiai was arrested at the San Francisco County Jail for charges of robbery, assault and battery, conspiracy, and violation of health and safety code, a follow-up statement from the SFPD said. Lieutenant Tracy McCray, head of the department’s Robbery Detail, assured the public that the SFPD is committed to the case and that they are taking COVID-19 protocols seriously.

The order came Monday when a judge granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based.  The suit calls on the companies to comply with a state law that went into effect at the start of this year that requires “gig workers” such as Uber and Lyft drivers to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits. “The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,” Becerra said in a release.  “While this fight still has a long way to go, we’re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve.” Uber is backing a referendum in the state to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent.  The judge wrote in the ruling that Uber and Lyft could not indefinitely put off their “day of reckoning” when it came to complying with the law. Uber has argued that most of its drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits. “Misclassification hurts drivers and it puts the burden on taxpayers to pay for benefits that Uber and Lyft should be providing,” said San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera. “During this global pandemic, it’s even more important for drivers to get access to protections like unemployment insurance.” The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to comply with the order, which the companies can appeal.  Uber outlined proposals this week for a new type of relationship with gig workers, including its own drivers, that would keep them as independent contractors but with some guaranteed benefits. The ride-hailing giant described “a new model for independent platform work” in an 18-page document it hopes can be used as a blueprint for Uber and similar firms relying on independent workers. The company seeks “to deliver certainty for millions of independent contractors who will increasingly rely on independent work to help them face the economic challenges that lie ahead,” Uber said in its document. Uber proposed that gig economy companies be required to establish “benefits funds,” allowing gig workers to accrue and use the money for benefits or paid leave. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, writing in The New York Times, said that the current employment system is outdated and “forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net.” Uber argues that requiring drivers to be classified as employees would leave jobs only for a small fraction of its drivers and that costs would become more expensive."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900274/mother-of-uber-founder-killed-in-boating-accident","title":"Mother of Uber founder killed in boating accident","date":"12:15 PM May 28, 2017","snippet":"The mother of Travis Kalanick, founder of the on-demand ride service Uber, was killed in a boating accident and his father was seriously hurt, authorities and a company official said Saturday.","body":"The mother of Travis Kalanick, founder of the on-demand ride service Uber, was killed in a boating accident and his father was seriously hurt, authorities and a company official said Saturday. An initial investigation showed that Bonnie Kalanick, 71, died Friday after the boat she was in struck a rock in Pine Flat Lake near the central California city of Fresno, the Fresno County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office said in a statement.  “Last night Travis and his family suffered an unspeakable tragedy. His mother passed away in a devastating boating accident near Fresno and his father is in serious condition,” an Uber representative said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Travis and his family in this heartbreaking time.”  Authorities responding to a call of a boating accident found Kalanick’s parents on the shore of the lake. Kalanick’s father had moderate injuries, and his mother was dead, authorities said.  The boat sank in the lake and was to be retrieved to determine the circumstances of the accident. “An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday. This remains an ongoing investigation,” the Fresno Sheriff-Coroner’s Office said. Travis Kalanick runs privately-held Uber, which is valued at about $68 billion. In the past several months, the company has been rocked by disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics and the covert use of law enforcement-evading software.

Uber Philippines said on Thursday that it sought the government’s approval to increase the fare per kilometer (km) of uberX rides by about 58 percent to 110 percent, depending on the time of the day.  Under its proposal, the fare per km would rise to P9 to P12 from the current rate of P5.70 per km. Unchanged were the uberX base fare and time charge of P40 and P2, respectively, the company said. The proposed increase, filed with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board today, would help Uber drivers recover part of their expenses, it noted.  “The costs that driver-partners have to bear to maintain their vehicles is projected to increase due to several factors, including requirements under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines to further improve safety and quality of service, increasing fuel prices, and new excise taxes on petroleum,” Uber Philippines said. Under the newly enacted Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law, gasoline will be subject to a higher excise tax of P7 per liter.  Grab, which is Uber’s main rival in the Philippines, earlier this month sought the LTFRB’s approval to increase its fare per km to P11 to P15. This is higher than the previous range of P10 per P14. It also sought the increase of its per-minute running charge from P2 to P2.10. Last October 2017, the LTFRB approved a fare increase for the taxi industry. The new structure involved a flag down rate of P40 for taxis in Metro Manila and a per kilometer rate of P13.50. Taxis also charge P2 per minute of running time."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/186170/uber-technologies-expanding-in-ph","title":"Uber Technologies expanding in PH","date":"05:41 AM February 06, 2015","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region.","body":"MANILA, Philippines–San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, operator of a wildly popular smartphone application that connects drivers and passengers,  is keen on expanding its presence in the Philippines with the upcoming release of landmark rules in the region. But certain kinks, like the proposed  regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, needs further “reconsideration,” Michael Brown, Uber regional general manager, said in a rare interview in Manila this week.  Brown said Uber welcomed the release of the new guidelines, which has yet to receive the final approval of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya, as a way to move forward following a brief run-in with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in late 2014. He noted that Uber, whose growth has skyrocketed globally since it started in 2009 and is now valued at more than $40 billion, agreed with most of the new guidelines, which would require drivers here to get government permits apart from more stringent safety measures like criminal background checks.  “The Philippines would be the first jurisdiction in Asia to have this kind of regulation,” Brown said. The new rules  will likewise lend added legitimacy to Uber’s domestic business. Uber, which owns no cars and provides only the platform, has been recording fast growth since it officially began in Metro Manila in February 2014, Brown said.  It makes money by taking a cut out of the fare, usually 20 percent. Brown declined to give figures specific to the Philippines but said the Uber X product, for more compact vehicles, offers cheaper fares compared to standard taxis. The company expects to lure “tens of thousands” of  Filipino drivers over the next few years. He said plans to expand outside Metro Manila were also in the cards.  As noted, a thorny issue here is related to the regulation of Uber’s pricing scheme, which can fluctuate depending on the volume of vehicles on the road. For example, prices can fall below regular  taxi rates during lean hours but they also climb significantly higher during “rush hours.” “We have made transportation less expensive for people and drivers are making more money than they have ever made. What we are advocating is that the government here should allow us to do what we do well,” Brown said. “We have expressed a desire for them [LTFRB] to rethink that aspect of the regulation,” said Brown, adding that their pricing model is regulated nowhere else in the world. Right now, the LTFRB is keen on regulating fares—its mandate under the law, LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said in a separate interview. He said the draft had been submitted to Abaya and further meetings were likely required. “We know the economics of this [ business] and we will not be unreasonable. But we want to have the final say. We don’t want prices to be abused,” Ginez said.  He said he was hoping to release the final rules within the month."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/856560/after-ltfrb-warning-grab-uber-put-cap-on-price-surges","title":"After LTFRB warning, Grab, Uber put cap on price surges","date":"12:40 AM December 26, 2016","snippet":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season.","body":"After being warned that they may lose their accreditation, ride-sharing services Uber and Grab complied with a government directive to address complaints over “price surges” this holiday season. In response to a 48-hour ultimatum issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Uber implemented on Sunday a limit to its surge pricing.  In a statement, Uber said the limit would remain in effect up to Jan. 15, 2017, to allow passengers to avail themselves of “more affordable” rides. It called on the public to use the Uber app’s “Help” feature should they have any concerns regarding their trip.  Grab, meanwhile, committed to place a cap on its rates from Dec. 24 to Jan. 30 next year “to ensure that the riding public will get the best service and rates during this season.” It gave no further details,  however, as to how much the limit would be. The company reminded its passengers to “double check” their destination and pickup points before confirming their booking so they will not be charged incorrectly.  The LTFRB on Sunday thanked Grab for its “immediate action” on the matter. But in the case of Uber, the board earlier that day issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the transport network company (TNC) for it come up with measures that would prevent “unreasonable” price surges. The LTFRB then noted that the company “did not heed” the board’s earlier directive for the TNCs not to take advantage of the increased demand from commuters. The board earlier reminded them that it can suspend or cancel their accreditation should the complaints persist. This was after it received reports that riders had paid as much as P28,000 just for a single trip. Before Uber announced the price cap, a note published on the company website said the LTFRB should also make a move.  Discussions since July Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua pointed out that since the LTFRB suspended the application of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) in July, there have been discussions with the agency concerning ways to address the growing demand and avoid price surges caused by the lack of vehicles. “We have seen increasing demand for Uber rides this holiday season, yet vehicle availability remained stagnant. We are optimistic that the LTFRB will soon lift the suspension on new TNVS applications, allowing more people to enjoy safe, reliable and affordable rides in the Philippines,” Cua said. Mounting complaints over price surges first became a concern for the LTFRB in September last year, particularly after a stormy night in Metro Manila when flash floods paralyzed traffic and rides became scarce in many parts of the capital. The LTFRB on Sunday renewed its call to the public to report any violation committed not only by TNCs but also by taxi drivers to the board’s 24/7 hotline 1342 or mobile numbers 09175501342 and 09985501342.

In a statement, PCC said it ordered both ride-hailing firms to keep separate and independent operations until the antitrust body wraps up its review of the acquisition.  PCC had issued a set of interim measures to preserve the same business conditions prior to the deal. This means riders and drivers should still be able to choose Uber as an alternative to Grab for the time being. The order echoes a similar move made by PCC’s counterpart in Singapore, which ordered Uber to continue operating the app for another week, or until April 15, due to similar anti-competitive concerns.  Feasibility Uber’s compliance to the order in Singapore “indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said.  This comes despite claims made by Uber officials that the company has officially left the market, leaving no one behind to man the app. The antitrust body, however, did not buy this explanation. Since Uber acquired a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s regional business as part of the takeover deal, it is not true that Uber has indeed left the country, Balisacan said. “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he said. Integration “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he added.  Last month, Grab announced it would acquire Uber in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. The deal has also put other competition authorities in the region on their toes. In the Philippines, PCC previously said the acquisition would result to Grab controlling around 80 percent of the ride hailing market in the country. This is a concern especially since Grab has been known for its relatively higher rider fees and how it discriminates against rider destinations. PCC officials raised these concerns during a public hearing with Grab and Uber representatives on April 5. Penalties Should Grab and Uber fail to comply in five working days, they would have to “show cause” within 24 hours after the end of the five-day period, according to an excerpt of the interim measures. The parties should then explain “why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” PCC did not list the possible penalties. However, according to the Philippine Competition Act, erring parties would have to pay P50,000 to P2 million for each violation. Moreover, they would have to eventually pay a similar amount for each day they did the violations until the parties fully comply with the order. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The duration of the review depends on the cooperation of the companies, Balisacan said in a previous interview. Under current rules, the review could end in a matter of weeks, or even extend up to six months. Not business as usual Representatives from Uber and Grab are yet to comment on the matter. However, during the public hearing on April 5, officials and lawyers from both companies wanted business to go as planned, noting that some of PCC’s concerns were unwarranted. Uber’s next move is yet to be seen. But according to Brooks Entwistle, Uber chief business officer for Asia Pacific, the company, which has been losing money in Southeast Asia, does not intend to return to the market. Falling apart “Our people are gone. Our funding is gone. Our marketplace is falling apart by every day as we transition [to Grab],” he said during the public hearing. In the same hearing, Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said the acquisition involves driver contracts as well as other data that drivers consented to give. The deal does not include the integration of both Grab and Uber systems, she said, therefore concerns such as Grab’s access to Uber’s pricing mechanisms were unnecessary. “We think, that if it means the commission is going to compel to reverse that business decision, we think that is a burdensome and disproportionate response to what is a valid management protocol,” she said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/242468/uber-offers-traffic-tech-apps-govt","title":"Uber offers traffic tech apps to gov’t","date":"05:14 AM December 14, 2017","snippet":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline.","body":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline. Uber said it had made available data from its platform dubbed Movement to the Department of Public Works and Highways. Among its earliest recommendations was to support the proposed extension of San Miguel Corp.’s Naia Expressway (NAIAx) project to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.  “Movement uses the power of big data to help government officials and planners understand the impact to travel times of the infrastructure projects and programs they roll out,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a statement. The solution uses data from thousands of trips both months before and after NAIAx was opened in June last year. Uber said the expressway shortened average travel times in and around the areas it serves.  Based on Uber’s estimates, Cua said the NAIAx extension would cut travel time between BGC and NAIAx in Entertainment City or the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) complex to about 20 minutes from 40 minutes. Cu said the Movement platform could also help government planners determine improvements in travel times once the BGC-Ortigas Center link, the proposed bridge between Binondo and Intramuros and the Skyway Stage 3 were completed.  SMC, a food and drinks giant that has diversified into infrastructure, earlier revealed that complete detailed engineering plans for the extension of the 7.7-kilometer NAIAx project going to BGC have been submitted to the government. SMC said the project would decongest Magallanes and the Edsa-Pasay area. The NAIAx extension also aims to cut travel time between Coastal Road and SM Mall of Asia areas and BGC to just 10 minutes. The NAIAx, a private-public partnership project that SMC opened last year, is a key part of Metro Manila’s tollroad network.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/767839/ltfrb-junks-all-cases-vs-uber-grab-transport-apps","title":"LTFRB junks all cases vs Uber, Grab transport apps","date":"09:17 PM February 23, 2016","snippet":"MANILA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has dismissed all motions filed by a transport group against the operations of vehicles under the ridesharing apps Uber and Grab.","body":"MANILA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has dismissed all motions filed by a transport group against the operations of vehicles under the ridesharing apps Uber and Grab. In a consolidated order made public on Tuesday, the LTFRB denied for lack of merit the petitions filed by 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-Utak) against the operations of the Transport Network Companies (TNCs) and issuance of franchise to their partner Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).  “We gave both parties ample time to air their pleas and contentions, and the Board decided to make a disposition that would promote better mobility and to the benefit the riding public,” LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said. 1-Utak said the department order permitting TNCs and TNVS has been violating the right to equal protection of other public utility vehicles covered by the moratorium on issuance of franchise. It added that TNCs could practice surge pricing while PUVs have to seek LTFRB approval for any fare adjustment.  Uber said the DO should be  presumed valid until nullified by higher courts and the LTFRB had no jurisdiction to determine constitutionality. Uber and Grab also said 1-Utak had no legal standing to oppose the TNC’s application and accreditation. Ginez said, “PUV operators and transport groups should welcome the challenge and competition for better public transport service, which would serve the best interest of the public safety and convenience.”  Another transport group, Stop and Go, has a pending petition in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court against the DO for TNCs and TNVS.  SFM"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/268916/uber-wins-1b-investment-from-toyota-softbank-fund","title":"Uber wins $1B investment from Toyota, SoftBank fund","date":"12:52 PM April 19, 2019","snippet":"TOKYO — Japanese car giant Toyota and investment fund SoftBank Vision Fund on Friday unveiled an investment of $1 billion in US company Uber to drive forward the development of driverless ridesharing services.","body":"TOKYO — Japanese car giant Toyota and investment fund SoftBank Vision Fund on Friday unveiled an investment of $1 billion in US company Uber to drive forward the development of driverless ridesharing services. The latest cash injection, expected to close in the third quarter this year, came amid fevered anticipation of Uber’s public share offering which is expected to be the largest in the tech sector for years.   Toyota has already invested $500 million in Uber as the firm races Google-owned Waymo and a host of other companies, including major automakers, to develop self-driving vehicles.  The latest investment, which also involves Japanese parts maker DENSO, will go to Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group in a bid to “accelerate the development and commercialization of automated ridesharing,” the firms said in a statement. Toyota and DENSO are stumping up $667 million and SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment arm of Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, will pour $333 million into the venture. It is already the top shareholder in Uber, holding 16 percent.   The Japanese car firm said it would also contribute “an additional $300 million over the next three years to help cover the costs related to these activities.” Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said driverless cars would “transform transportation as we know it, making our streets safer and our cities more liveable.” His firm is aiming to go beyond car rides to becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share, instead of own, vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike, share a ride or take an e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey — all using an Uber app on a smartphone. Uber is also seeing growing success with an “Eats” service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. ‘Sharing economy’ Last week, Uber filed official documents for its much-anticipated public share offering. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said it operates on six continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totalled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a “placeholder” amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. The Wall Street Journal said earlier this month that Uber was seeking to raise $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Media reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. Uber is the largest of the “unicorns” or venture-backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the “sharing economy” based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Its revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. And some analysts have voiced caution over the forthcoming IPO given a relative lacklustre debut for Lyft, the main US rival. Khosrowshahi has promised greater transparency as he seeks to restore confidence in the global ridesharing leader hit by a wave of misconduct scandals. In October, Toyota and SoftBank announced the creation of a joint venture to create “new mobility service” including driverless vehicles for services such as meal deliveries. The new company — called “Monet”, short for “mobility network” — is majority owned by SoftBank. SoftBank started as a software firm but has increasingly been pushing into investments under tycoon Son, one of Japan’s richest men."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978164/news-grab-uber-ride-sharing-southeast-asia-anthony-tan-internet","title":"Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia","date":"01:09 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"","body":" Private ride-hailing service Grab on Monday confirmed that it has acquired Uber’s operation in Southeast Asia.  In a statement, Grab said the deal was the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company,” which reflects the company’s leadership position in the region. “Grab is acquiring Uber’s rideshare and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia, and integrating them into Grab’s leading transportation and fintech platform,” the statement read.  Grab said Uber would take 27.5% stake in Grab, which it said was “reflective of the companies’ respective market shares.” “The acquisition accelerates Grab’s path to profitability in its core transport business, as it’s the most cost efficient Southeast Asian platform,” it said.  The acquisition, it said, “reflects Grab’s transport market leadership in Southeast Asia.” Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab said the acquisition of Uber “marks the beginning of a new era.” “We are humbled that a company born in SEA has built one of the largest platforms that millions of consumers use daily and provides income opportunities to over 5 million people. Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” Tan said. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region. Together with Uber, we are now in an even better position to fulfil our promise to serve our customers,” he added. Their trust in us as a transport brand allows us to look towards the next step as a company: improving people’s lives through food, payments and financial services.  Aside from Uber’s rideshare, Grab has also acquired Uber’s food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia. “Grab will also take over the Uber Eats operations to immediately become a major player in food delivery services,” it said. Grab said the GrabFood service would expand from two existing countries to all major Southeast Asian countries by next quarter. “This will be another great use case to drive continued adoption of the GrabPay mobile wallet and support Grab’s growing Financial Services platform,” it said. /cbb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/791497/transport-group-sues-abaya-for-allowing-uber-grabcar-to-operate","title":"Transport group sues Abaya for allowing Uber, Grabcar to operate","date":"03:44 PM June 20, 2016","snippet":"(Updated) A public transportation group on Monday filed a graft complaint against outgoing Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Winston Ginez for allowing the operation of Uber and Grabcar allegedly without a franchise.","body":"(Updated) A public transportation group on Monday filed a graft complaint against outgoing Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Winston Ginez for allowing the operation of Uber and Grabcar allegedly without a franchise. Jun Magno of the Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organization Transport Coalition (Stop & Go) filed the complaint against the two for allowing the operation of transportation network vehicle service (TNVS), such as Uber, Grabcar and U-Hop, without securing a franchise as required by law.  Magno said Abaya and Ginez approved a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order in 2015 which allows for “innovation across all forms of public land transport” to increase mobility, improve public transport and “respond to the needs of the modern commuter.” The department order allowed for the operation of TNVS even without securing a certificate of public convenience, Magno said.  Magno said the officials committed graft for giving undue advantage to Uber, Grabcar and U-Hop to the disadvantage of taxi operators and public utility vehicle drivers who lose income and passengers because of the influx of TNVS. He added that the influx of vehicles operating as TNVS worsened traffic in the metropolis.  “Even before the issuance of the respondents of the said department order and memorandum circulars, it already deeply affected the rights of the complainants’ officers and members being concerned citizens, taxpayers, operators and drivers of public utility vehicles. Many taxi drivers transferred to TNVS as they could allegedly have relatively good income, passengers of taxis and AUV express decreased tremendously as commuting public tried the use of TNVS resulting to loss of income of operators and drivers of these taxis and AUV express,” the complaint read. The complainant said only accreditations were issued to TNVS for provisional authority to ply the routes of the metro. He said these service vehicles were not yet issued a franchise, which is given only after going through a series of hearings and submitting requirements. Abaya and Ginez also allegedly committed graft when they caused undue injury to government by allowing TNVS to pay a measly amount of P520 application fee to operate, compared to a much heftier cost for taxi operators to obtain a franchise. Magno added that the officials allowed the TNVS to operate even without the guidelines from Congress as required for under the department order.  “No guidance was issued by the legislative branch of government… The transportation network companies (TNC) were only accredited but not to operate. Therefore, the operations of the TNVS including the TNCs are illegal,” the complaint read. In a statement, Ginez said Magno resorted to forum shopping after the Quezon city Regional Trial Court junked his plea for an injunction against the implementation of the department order allowing operations for Uber and Grabcar. He said Magno’s complaint has no basis and that the department order allowing for Uber and Grabcar to operate is consistent with existing laws. “The filing of a complaint against me and Secretary Abaya for allegedly allowing the operation of Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), such as Uber and Grab, is a desperate move by Mr. Magno of Stop & Go. After failing to convince the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in granting his prayer for injunction against DOTC and LTFRB in implementing the Department Order and Memorandum Circulars creating TNVS as a new mode of public transportation, Mr. Magno is resorting to pernicious act of forum shopping to dissuade us from providing our commuting public with safe, reliable, convenient and comfortable transportation that is sanctioned by our existing transportation laws,” Ginez said. “We are confident that just like the RTC of Quezon City, the Ombudsman will reject the baseless and unfounded allegations of Mr. Magno,” he added. JE/rga RELATED STORIES QC court junks plea to halt app-based vehicle service Court denies group’s bid to extend TRO on Uber, GrabCar permits"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248533/philippine-competition-commission-will-review-grab-uber-deal","title":"Philippine Competition Commission will review Grab-Uber deal","date":"05:34 PM April 03, 2018","snippet":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week.","body":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691221/regular-cab-operators-eye-lawsuit-over-uber","title":"‘Regular’ cab operators eye lawsuit over Uber","date":"05:32 AM May 14, 2015","snippet":"“Traditional” taxi cab owners are up in arms over the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order allowing smartphone ridesharing applications like Uber, Grabcab, East Taxi and Tripda to legally operate in the Philippines.","body":"“Traditional” taxi cab owners are up in arms over the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order allowing smartphone ridesharing applications like Uber, Grabcab, East Taxi and Tripda to legally operate in the Philippines. According to Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, they may file a case against the DOTC and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for not taking into consideration the impact of letting Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) operate in the country.  “We are now relegated to second choice,” Suntay said on Wednesday as the DOTC released the order legitimizing the operations of smartphone ridesharing applications. The move also marked the first time a country created a framework to accommodate technology transit services, according to an Uber official. The DOTC order outlined the new classifications, including those covering the so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) like Uber, Grabcar, Easy Taxi and Tripda.  In an earlier interview, Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya had said the move would allow TNC “to exist within our regulatory framework” while the LTFRB would be able to start finalizing a memorandum circular outlining specific regulations and requirements for the TNVS and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them (traditional taxi cabs) to modernize and compete,” Abaya had said, adding: “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS.”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” he told reporters. Suntay disagreed, saying the move would ultimately hurt their business. He said the transit application platforms have an unfair advantage over “regular” cabs since the former do not operate their own cars. He said that services like Uber, which provides a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, also benefit because their fares are not regulated unlike regular cabs. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models. The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. In addition, only sedans, Asian utility vehicles, SUVs, vans or other similar vehicles will be accredited. Operators will also be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNC and registered with the  LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details needed to be ironed out with LTFRB, including the regulation of fares which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an e-mailed statement."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/922685/uber-suspended-one-month-ltfrb-tnvs","title":"LTFRB suspends Uber for 1 month","date":"05:15 PM August 14, 2017","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has suspended for a month the operations of transport network company (TNC) Uber after it defied its July 26 order not to accept and activate new drivers into its platform.  In response, Uber issued a short statement, saying: “Uber received an order around 6 p.m. tonight (August 14) to completely stop operations. We are studying the order at the moment. We will update our riders and drivers as soon as we can.” In its cease-and-desist order that was released and took effect on Monday night, the LTFRB said that Uber was “irresponsible” when it continued to accept and activate new drivers into its platform.  It noted that what the TNC has done was “not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation,” but “unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country.” “The objective of the board now is to strike a gentle balance between innovation and the law for the public good… What takes precedence then? No doubt, it is the law. The law which defines fair and suitable regulation is the great equalizer in addressing and fulfilling the common good,” the order read.  Recognizing that their order meant that thousands of Uber’s drivers would lose income for a month, the LTFRB recommended that Uber extend financial assistance to its affected drivers as a “form of good faith.” “[T]heir accredited peer-operators would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions of [Uber],” it said. On July 26, the LTFRB ordered TNCs Grab and Uber to stop their acceptance and accreditation of new drivers as the agency ironed out issues concerning the ride-sharing industry. However, the LTFRB found out that Uber defied its order, with the TNC even releasing a statement that partly read that “applications are being accepted but not processed” by them. On top of this, the LTFRB was also able to activate three of its cars into Uber’s platform. In its hearing early this month, the LTFRB maintained that it was clear in its order that no applications should be received by the TNCs to “avoid raising false expectations” among drivers that they may engage in the public transportation service.  During the recent congressional hearing on the ride-sharing industry, Uber said that it has to date accredited around 66,000 vehicles into its platform. The board said that it recognized that the service provided by TNCs to the commuting public was “undeniably positive and beneficial.’ It noted though that “technological innovation is but a tool to enhance human convenience but may not dictate what may be morally acceptable social human behavior.” /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/926028/u-hop-ready-to-accommodate-displaced-uber-drivers","title":"u-Hop ready to accommodate displaced uber drivers","date":"05:14 AM August 28, 2017","snippet":"Representatives of the local transport network company (TNC) u-Hop have expressed willingness to accommodate Uber-accredited drivers and operators in their system.","body":"Representatives of the local transport network company (TNC) u-Hop have expressed willingness to accommodate Uber-accredited drivers and operators in their system.

Karen, who studies law at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told the Inquirer on Monday that while she understands that transport network companies should follow the rules on franchises, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should be more considerate since thousands of commuters rely on this “convenient” and “efficient” mode of transport.  She said that should the LTFRB push through on July 26 with its decision to apprehend app-based drivers who do not have franchises to operate, she would be forced to ride in taxis whose drivers are sometimes rude and refuse to bring passengers to their destination. Karen added that without the transport network companies (TNCs), her studies might be affected as commuting to school using other mass transport systems like jeepneys and trains would be too tiring.  Regular Uber user Jef Manalac shares Karen’s predicament, adding that some taxi drivers tamper with their meters or do not give the exact change. He noted that instead of focusing on a system that works, the LTFRB should crack down on “colorum” vans and taxis. However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada stood firm on Monday on their decision against the TNCs, pointing out that they “were simply cleaning up the mess that the TNCs created.”  “The board gave both TNCs the opportunity to comply [with our order] to show good faith. In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced nor will it succumb to pressure,” she told reporters. Last week, the LTFRB fined Grab and Uber P5 million each for violating the terms and conditions of their accreditation, such as the inclusion in their platforms of drivers who do not have franchises to operate. Lizada said the TNCs were not given the harshest penalty which was cancelation of their accreditation out of consideration for the riding public. By July 26 though, Grab and Uber drivers without franchises will be fined P120,000 and their vehicles impounded for three months should they continue to operate. Lizada warned that if TNCs defy the LTFRB’s order, “the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law considering that both [their] accreditations are under review.”  Of the estimated 56,000 drivers of the two TNCs, only more than 3,000 were given franchises by the LTFRB until it imposed a moratorium last year. Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed and a Grab driver, said that they have been trying to comply with the LTFRB’s requirements for the issuance of a franchise. He added though that should the agency push through with its order, they would have no choice but to comply with it. Despite the LTFRB order, Grab said in a statement yesterday that “at this time, we will not deactivate any of our partners.” “Grab will continue reaching out to the government to seek clarity on its order. We urge the LTFRB to convene the technical working group as soon as possible so we can discuss important matters affecting the TNC-TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry, more so the riding public,” it added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/920330/ltfrb-uber-lied-to-senators","title":"LTFRB: Uber ‘lied’ to senators","date":"11:28 AM August 04, 2017","snippet":"“Uber lied.”","body":"“Uber lied.” It’s strike two for Uber this week, as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) alleged on Friday that the transport network company (TNC) “lied” to the senators when it said that its passengers are covered by insurance “100 percent.”  READ: LTFRB shows ‘proof’ of Uber violation “The LTFRB notes that the statement given by (Uber Philippines public policy head) Yves Gonzalez during the Senate hearing is not true. For us, Uber lied,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Friday.  According to Lizada, it is also “not true” that Uber’s insurer is the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc., as the firm told them that “they no longer insured Uber after August [last year].” Lizada said that Uber’s insurer is UCPB General Auto Passenger Accident Insurance, to which the TNC has availed itself of a package that has “very limited coverage” for passengers.  Based on the LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular No. 2015-028, which set forth the guidelines for the three-year enhanced personal passenger accident insurance program, P200,000 would be given to the family of passengers killed in an accident. A schedule of payment was also set for various types of injuries and disability, ranging from P5,000 to P100,000. Passengers are also assured of legal assistance of P15,000, among others. While Uber’s insurance package also hands out P200,000 in case of death, its schedule of payment for injuries is limited. It requires passengers to have “total and irrevocable loss of all sight in both eyes; total loss by physical severance at or above the wrist or ankle of one hand or one foot together with the total and irrevocable loss of all sight in one eye; and total loss by physical severance at or above the wrist or ankle of both hands or both feet or one hand together with one foot” to be able to receive the maximum coverage of P200,000.” For injuries such as “total and irrevocable loss of all sight in one eye, and total loss by physical severance at or above the wrist or ankle of one hand or one foot,” a passenger is covered up to P100,000.  Lizada noted that unlike the insurance coverage of other public utility vehicles, Uber’s does not have a no-fault indemnity clause as well as an all-risk package. No-fault indemnity meant that a passenger can still claim insurance even if the accident is caused by the other party, such as a jeep or bus. An all-risk package would still cover passengers on “extreme conditions,” such as the vehicle they are in is out-of-line, or the driver is drunk or under the influence of drugs. “This is what we’re after–the safety of the riding public. We hope that the public would understand this,” Lizada said. Last month, the LTFRB ordered TNCs Grab and Uber “to cease with dispatch” the operations of their drivers who do not have a certificate of public convenience or provisional authority to operate. The crackdown on colorum transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers was however stayed after the TNCs filed a motion for reconsideration, to which the agency has yet to issue its resolution. On July 26, the LTFRB issued another order to the TNCs to stop the acceptance as well as activation of new TNVS. However, Uber defied this order by continuing to accept new applications. Over the weekend, the LTFRB was also able to activate three cars into Uber’s system. Uber was given five days to submit its written explanation why its accreditation, set to expire this month, should not be canceled."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/268458/uber-steers-toward-blockbuster-ipo-as-road-looks-rocky?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","title":"Uber steers toward blockbuster IPO as road looks rocky","date":"12:32 PM April 11, 2019","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber could become a $100 billion company with a massive share offering that will be a bellwether for tech startups looking toward Wall Street.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber could become a $100 billion company with a massive share offering that will be a bellwether for tech startups looking toward Wall Street. Media reports said the ride-hailing giant is seeking to raise some $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year.  That could result in a valuation close to $100 billion — an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported.   The Journal said details of Uber’s initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May. The IPO comes after a lackluster response to last month’s market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber. Lyft shares rose on the first day of trade and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were down more than 10 percent from the $72 offering price. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said Uber recently provided documents showing a potential price range of between $48 and $55 a share, implying a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report.  “Even a valuation in the $90 billion to $100 billion range would represent a healthy premium to the latest private valuation (some $76 billion) in August 2018,” said Matt Kennedy of the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “Uber will definitely be pegged to Lyft. So they can’t be too aggressive on valuation, given where Lyft is trading. Though it’s possible that some of the pressure on Lyft is related to investors looking to pick up Uber instead.” Analysts warn both Uber and Lyft will need strong growth to justify their lofty valuations, and face multiple challenges to their business model which has disrupted traditional taxi services and relies on drivers to be independent contractors. The ride-hailing firms are also investing in other “last mile” transport options such as electric bikes and scooters, and in the long run are looking to autonomous vehicles as a way to reduce dependence on private cars and reshape urban landscapes. Unicorn stampede Uber is the latest, and will be largest of the so-called “unicorns,” or venture-backed startups worth at least $1 billion, to look to Wall Street listings to expand their capital base. But some of the early enthusiasm about this unicorn herd has waned and there are hints that private investment rounds may have been priced too high. Pinterest, a virtual bulletin board that connects people with interests including food, fashion, travel and lifestyle, plans to trade under the symbol PINS on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinterest unveiled its IPO price range with an estimated valuation of some $11 billion, below the $12 billion in its most recent private funding round. Other big tech firms which could join the stampede include the business collaboration startup Slack and big data firm Palantir.

The LTFRB, in its cease-and-desist order that was released and took effect Monday night, said that Uber was “irresponsible” when it continued to accept and activate new drivers into its platform despite the July 26 order against it. “The objective of the board now is to strike a gentle balance between innovation and the law for the public good… What takes precedence then?

On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said during Wednesday’s special board meeting.  The LTFRB order comes just four days after the PCC told Uber and Grab to continue to operate independently in the country while it conducts its motu propio review on the deal, which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the board that while they intended to withdraw their petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC, they were constrained to do so because of the PCC order.  Earlier, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said that, under their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to extend their funding of the operations of the Uber app to April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. According to him, however, doing so would not only defeat the purpose of what PCC wanted, but would also put the riding public in danger since Uber would no longer have any back-end support in the country that would address complaints and take care of passengers in the event of an accident.  In issuing the order, Lizada said that, the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would adversely affect the riding public and the thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. “The soonest possible time that you [Uber] will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she said. Meanwhile, LTFRB also ordered Grab to “immediately” lower its surge pricing cap from twice the rate to just 1.5, as it processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. “This is to ensure that the fare will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said.  In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following Uber’s exit in the country. But Cu said they were not taking advantage of the situation as he pointed out that the price surge was due to the lack of drivers in their system. He explained that, while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. Cu noted that the reason Uber’s fare was lower than theirs was because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was at P5, while theirs was at P11. He added that, if Uber would not exit the country, its rate would soon be similar to theirs as it sought the LTFRB an increase to P12 per kilometer. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978890/drivers-start-massive-migration-to-grab-as-uber-exits","title":"Drivers start massive migration to Grab as Uber exits","date":"09:59 PM March 28, 2018","snippet":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people.","body":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people. It was the second day of an “onboarding” session for Uber drivers in Manila after Singapore-based ridesharing giant Grab acquired the Southeast Asian operations of its main rival.  Should Grab Philippines succeed in luring all of Uber’s drivers, it would corner about 90 percent of Metro Manila’s ridesharing sector, capped at 65,000 units by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). That prospect has consumers worrying about higher costs and poorer services, following the notion that fewer competitors provide fewer incentives for private enterprises to do better.  Standing beside a row of Japanese compact sedans and AUVs, ridesharing’s most popular car models here, Uber driver Patricia was indifferent to a business deal that had only served to disrupt her main source of income. “I have no choice but to move. I borrowed money to buy my car and I need to pay it off,” she told the Inquirer.  In ridesharing, Patricia found a way to make money on her own terms by transporting passengers using Uber’s technology platform whenever she had the free time. In exchange, Uber takes a 25 percent cut. Patricia was among dozens of drivers, some with their young children in tow, gathered outside the Megatent on Wednesday. Near the entrance, a Grab staffer was reading out names from a so-called master list provided by the LTFRB. Only those people in the list would be allowed to move to Grab. Uber will cease to operate in Southeast Asia by April 8 this year. But Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu told reporters they would continue to process and accept Uber drivers even after that date.  “We will continue this until all Uber drivers on the master list of the LTFRB are activated on our platform,” Cu said. The mood was lighter inside the air-conditioned Megatent, which could accommodate at least 1,000 people. Migrating Uber drivers, welcomed inside as “Uberkads,” were seated while waiting to be called again to submit their requirements. It was noontime and pastries from a local bakeshop chain were being distributed to the waiting drivers. In another part of the hall, Grab staffers were holding mini orientation sessions for their former rivals. Inside, the Uberkads mused about the driver-friendly features of Grab, such as the ability to see a passenger’s destination before accepting a trip. This is not allowed by Uber. Grab also offers better incentives, they said. They noted that one drawback with Grab was that drivers would need to keep a minimum amount of money in its system to continue booking passengers. It is from this fund that Grab takes it commission. According to Cu, services are also expected to improve. He noted that when there were two big operators, drivers simply switched networks when penalized for bad behavior, such as frequently canceling rides. “Now, there is a bit more weight to following the rules,” Cu said. He added that the enlarged network of Grab would help control prices, given the supply-demand algorithms utilized by the ridesharing sector, and improved waiting times. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said in a press conference Wednesday that fare hikes would also be strictly regulated. Moreover, new competition is on the way with local companies Lag Go, Owto and Hype each seeking to operate as a transport network company, the formal category for businesses like Uber and Grab. “So if you say there is no competition, soon there will be,” Lizada said. Later addressing the drivers on queue, Lizada urged them to follow regulations, ridesharing being a public service. “Let us start on the proper footing,” she said. Getting started is the most important issue for Rex Restauro, who has been an Uber driver for eight months. Restauro, who owns a computer shop, uses ridesharing to make extra income in the evening. He said he has no qualms about switching to Grab. “I’m in this industry anyway so it’s a waste to stop it now. Even if you have a day job, you can make money here,” he said. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/744754/qcrtc-stops-operations-of-uber-grabcar-for-20-days","title":"QCRTC stops DOTC, LTFRB from issuing permits to operate Uber, GrabCar","date":"12:09 PM December 04, 2015","snippet":"The Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) without a certificate of public convenience (CPC).","body":"The Quezon City Regional Trial Court 217 has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) without a certificate of public convenience (CPC). In a nine-page order, QCRTC Judge Santiago Arenas issued the 20-day restraining order against the implementation of Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) Department Order No. 2015-11, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Memorandum Circulars Memorandum Circulars 2015-15, 16, 17 and 18 and other issuances related to TNVS.  The said issuances pertain to accreditation, conditions and implementing guidelines to operate TNVS. DOTC, under DO 2015-11, was amended to promote mobility and encourage innovations in public transport.  The restraining order was granted in favor of Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organizatio  TransportCoalition (Stop & Go). In their petition, they assailed TNVS for being able to operate even without a CPC unlike other modes of transport like taxi.  CPC is an authorization issued for the operation of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a common carrier. Petitioner said what the car owners have to do is simply secure a membership from Transportation Network Companies (TNC), equip themselves with the necessary technology and can already operate once given a provisional authority. The petitioners blamed such an easy procedure for the increase in car sales, heavy traffic and decline in income of taxi operators and drivers. “This resulted in the increase in sales of cars and other motor vehicles… This could be one of the reasons of the present heavy traffic in the metropolis,” petitioner said. They also added that TNC and TNVS could be the reason for LTFRB’s continued denial of their application for CPCs.  The court said initial findings showed that Stop & Go met the requisites for a temporary restraining order including establishing a material invasion of their rights to operate public utility vehicles and grave and irreparable injury and damage specifically to their income “due to sudden uncontrolled increase in TNVS utility running the streets of Metro Manila.” With the restraining order, the court stopped DOTC and LTFRB from accepting, processing and approving applications from TNVS. The court set a hearing on Dec. 8 to determine if the restraining order will be made permanent or not.

The ride-hailing giant said Thursday it is offloading Jump, its bike and scooter business, to Lime, a company in which it is investing $85 million. Jump had been losing about $60 million a quarter.  “While our Rides business has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, we have taken quick action to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, focus additional resources on Uber Eats, and prepare us for any recovery scenario,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement. “Along with the surge in food delivery, we are encouraged by the early signs we are seeing in markets that are beginning to open back up.” On Wednesday, San Francisco-based Uber said it was cutting 3,700 full-time workers, or about 14% of its workforce, as people avoiding contagion either stay indoors or try to limit contact with others. Its main U.S. rival Lyft announced last month it would lay off 982 people, or 17% of its workforce because of plummeting demand. Careem, Uber’s subsidiary in the Middle East, cut its workforce by 31%.  Uber brought in $3.54 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 14% from the same time last year. Revenue in its Eats meal delivery business grew 53% as customers shuttered at home opted to order in. The company exited markets where its food delivery business was unprofitable, including the Czech Republic, Egypt and Honduras. But it added key accounts including Chipotle, Dunkin’ and Shake Shack, and it enabled delivery from grocery and convenience stores.  “At a time when our rides business is down significantly due to shelter-in-place, our Eats business is surging,” Khosrowshahi said on a conference call with investors. “The big opportunity we thought Eats was just got bigger.” Gross bookings grew 8% to $15.8 billion, with 54% growth in the food delivery business and a 3% decline in rides, on a constant currency basis. Uber’s bottom line was hurt in the first quarter when the value of its investments in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi, Singapore-based Grab and others plummeted by $2.1 billion as demand collapsed in those regions. The challenges are continuing in the second quarter. In April, rides were down 80% globally compared to last year, Khosrowshahi said. But rides have been increasing for the past three weeks and bookings in large cities across Georgia and Texas, two states that started re-opening, are up 43% and 50% respectively from their lowest points, he said. Demand for the Eats business grew 89% in April, excluding India, and “we’ve seen an enormous acceleration in demand since mid-March,” Khosrowshahi said.  Grocery delivery could be a part of Uber’s future in the U.S. “There’s going to be more room for more than one player,” Khosrowshahi said. “We’re in many of these cities already. So we just have the infrastructure to be able to get started in these cities … in a very low cost way.” Uber updated its driver app to make it easier for ride providers to pick up delivery work, and nearly 40% of drivers in the U.S. and Canada cross-dispatched to work for the Eats platform in April, the company said. But getting into grocery delivery would take time, and the boost in restaurant delivery is not enough to stem Uber’s losses, said Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization. “This is a brutal body blow to Uber’s path to profitability, and potentially even its existential future, because few rational people are wiling to put themselves into harm’s way to ride in a vehicle, and many drivers have their own concerns,” Schiffer said. “Uber customers would rather chew glass than sit in the backseat of one of those cars.” Uber’s investment in Lime came as part of a $170 million funding round, which also included Alphabet, Bain Capital Ventures, GV and other investors. Customers will still have access to electric Jump bikes and scooters in the Uber app, but Lime will run the operation. To help keep drivers and riders protected during the pandemic, Uber says it will require drivers and riders to wear a mask beginning sometime in the coming weeks. Lyft made a similar announcement Thursday.

The San Francisco-based company confirmed that its bookings more than doubled last year to $20 billion, with net revenue totaling $6.5 billion and an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion not counting China operations that it sold. The privately-held firm is valued at about $68 billion, making it one of the largest “unicorns” in the tech world.  It’s not required to disclose earnings information the way publicly traded companies must. Uber is in the process of hiring a second-in-command for chief Travis Kalanick, who remains in the driver’s seat as the company tries to plot a friendlier course with workers, riders and drivers.  Uber has been rocked by disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics and covert use of law enforcement-evading software. Kalanick, known for taking a hard line in battles with regulators and taxi operators, has been humbled by recent events which included the release of a dashcam video showing him berating and cursing at one of Uber’s drivers. Kalanick also made a hasty exit from a business advisory panel for US President Donald Trump after a consumer boycott campaign fueled by concerns that he was aiding a leader with regressive values. Uber’s workforce doubled last year and is on a similarly hot pace for growth this year, according to executives. While Uber did not disclose earnings for the first quarter of this year, the company said they were in line with expectations.

But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/246339/uber-settles-p41b-unpaid-vat","title":"Uber settles P41.15M in unpaid VAT","date":"04:55 PM February 22, 2018","snippet":"Update","body":"Update Global peer-to-peer ridesharing and transportation network Uber Systems Inc. has settled P41.15 million in unpaid value-added taxes during the second half of 2016, preventing the closure of its Philippine operations, the Bureau of Internal Revenue said Thursday.  In a statement, the country’s biggest tax-collection agency said that it was supposed to suspend Uber’s local business operations under its “Oplan Kandado” program following an audit of the company’s VAT compliance for the period July 1 to Dec. 31, 2016. The investigation was made under a letter of authority issued by revenue officers of Revenue District Office No. 47, East Makati, Revenue Region No. 8, Makati City, the BIR said.  A letter of authority is an official document that empowers revenue officers to examine and scrutinize taxpayers’ books in order to determine their correct tax liabilities. “Records of investigation showed that Uber is registered with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) as a transportation network company (TNC) with a pool of transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) operators and drivers who use its transport system to get clients/passengers for transport from one place to another. It provides pre-arranged transportation services for a fee using an internet-based application or digital platform to connect passengers with drivers using personal vehicles. It likewise ensures the compliance of its TNVS operators and drivers with the LTFRB,” the BIR noted.  “As such TNC, all of Uber’s earnings are derived from the transportation services made by its TNVS operators and drivers within the Philippines. Hence, its gross receipts from such sale of services is subject to the 12-percent VAT and not to the 3-percent common carrier’s tax,” the BIR explained. “Although Uber religiously filed its VAT returns on time, it declared its sale of services rendered within the Philippines amounting to P413.85 million as zero-rated sales, contrary to the ‘cross border doctrine,’” the BIR said. According to the BIR, the cross border doctrine meant that “no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority.” “Conversely, those destined for use or consumption within the Philippines shall be imposed with the 12-percent VAT,” the BIR added. “The act of Uber of declaring its sale of services as zero-rated and not paying the VAT due thereon is a clear violation of the Tax Code which is one of the grounds for its suspension or temporary closure. Section 115 of the Tax Code, as implemented through Revenue Memorandum Order No. 03-2009, authorizes the BIR to suspend or close the business operations of a taxpayer for a period of not less than five days for failure to: register; issue VAT official receipts or sales invoices; file correct VAT returns; or pay the correct VAT,” according to the BIR. To avoid closure, Uber settled its unpaid VAT dues last Feb. 13."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/267439/uber-acquires-middle-east-competitor-careem-for-3-1-billion","title":"Uber acquires Middle East competitor Careem for $3.1 billion","date":"04:25 PM March 26, 2019","snippet":"DUBAI — Ride-hailing service Uber announced on Tuesday it has acquired its Middle East competitor Careem for $3.1 billion, making it the largest-ever technology purchase in the region.","body":"DUBAI — Ride-hailing service Uber announced on Tuesday it has acquired its Middle East competitor Careem for $3.1 billion, making it the largest-ever technology purchase in the region. Uber said in a prepared statement that the $3.1 billion purchase consists of $1.7 billion in convertible notes and $1.4 billion in cash. Under the deal, Careem will keep its brand as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber, operating as an independent company led by its original founders.  ONE OF MIDEAST’S MOST SUCCESSFUL STARTUPS The Dubai-based Careem is among the Middle East’s most successful startups. Careem quickly became popular across the Middle East, particularly in countries like Egypt and Pakistan, in part because it introduced the option for riders to pay by cash rather than just credit card. It also launched in the region in 2012, three years before Uber.  Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the deal expands the U.S.-based company’s strength around the world. “With a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions, Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East, becoming one of the most successful startups in the region,” Khosrowshahi said.  Careem’s CEO and co-founder Mudassir Sheikha described the deal as a “milestone” for the company and for budding entrepreneurs in the region, as well as local and global investors.  Sheikha will lead Careem’s business under Uber and report to a board made up of three representatives from Uber and two from Careem. Saudi-based Kingdom Holding, one of Careem’s early investors, said the acquisition is an opportunity for both companies to expand and benefit from the region’s rapid growth.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/651819/dotc-taxis-must-upgrade-vs-uber","title":"DoTC: Taxis must upgrade vs Uber","date":"04:00 AM November 20, 2014","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—Taxi operators should modernize and improve their services instead of opposing technology solutions like ride-sharing app Uber.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—Taxi operators should modernize and improve their services instead of opposing technology solutions like ride-sharing app Uber. “People prefer to use these tech-based transport services because they are more convenient. It’s that simple. So my advice to taxi operators: Modernize, innovate and improve your systems and services,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a statement on Wednesday.  “Commuters say they feel safer taking these private vehicles-for-hire, that the fleet are newer, that app services are faster and more efficient. So why put a stop to what is clearly for their benefit? Poorer services should be upgraded to match their competition—not the other way around,” he added. Abaya’s statement was the latest effort by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to show that it was open to new technology solutions after the arrest last month of a private vehicle owner who had partnered with Uber. The incident drew intense criticism, mainly from Netizens.  The DOTC’s stance, however, also comes at a time when Uber is facing negative publicity worldwide. It is currently under fire overseas for comments reportedly made by one of its executives on how the firm can finance smear campaigns against journalists critical of it and how Uber personnel can access customers’ private travel information.  “We have not, do not and will not investigate journalists. Those remarks have no basis in the reality of our approach,” an Uber spokesperson said in an e-mail to Inquirer, referring to statements reportedly made by Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president of business, at a private event. The incident was first reported by Buzzfeed. Uber further clarified its privacy policy in a Nov. 18 blog post. “Uber has a strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver’s data. The only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes. Our policy has been communicated to all employees and contractors,” it said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to hold a hearing on Nov. 24 in line with a plan to update its rules to accommodate technology solutions like Uber, a ride-sharing service available in several countries. The LTFRB has identified the existing “vehicles-for-hire” category as the likely classification for Uber vehicles, it said. While considered “colorum” since these vehicles are operating without a transport franchise, the LTFRB has not taken any further action since the DOTC signaled its intention to work with the service. Ginez earlier said that the arrest in Manila stemmed from complaints filed by various groups, including the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association.  Uber has been facing challenges and even protests in other parts of the world, mainly by taxi operators, who say it and other similar apps allow the operation of illegal public transportation services which are regulated and require a government franchise or permit. During a recent hearing, congressmen criticized the LTFRB for allowing Uber to operate in the country despite the fact that its vehicles may be considered colorum."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/951794/uber-charges-passenger-over-18k-for-five-mile-ride-later-apologizes-for-error","title":"Uber charges passenger over C$18K for 5-mile ride, later apologizes for error","date":"07:05 PM December 12, 2017","snippet":"One Uber passenger will surely remember this ride after paying a hefty price for it.","body":"One Uber passenger will surely remember this ride after paying a hefty price for it.

When asked about the authenticity of the post, Kennard replied that the transport service was not backing down and refused to refund her friend. Upon the circulation of the tweet, many netizens vented their shock and frustration towards the surge of the trip’s cost, with some accusing Uber of ripping off the passenger.

Asians are typically depicted as war survivors or weakling nerds, so it is refreshing that Kwan (whose family belongs to the Old Rich) has now slyly yanked the covers off the world of elite families in China, Hong Kong and Singapore.  In Kwan’s books, males remain on top of the hierarchy. Mothers spoil their only sons and sacrifice everything for them.  Take the characters Bao Gaoliang and his wife Shaoyen, who worked hard to grow their medical supplies business inherited from earlier generations.  Gaoliang is now a party politician in China—and a billionaire.  Women power But Shaoyen flies economy while her only son Carlton relaxes in first class.  “Carlton can eat all the fancy Western food and, being a student under so much pressure, he needs all the rest he can get.  But for me, it’s not worth it.  I don’t touch airplane food, and I can never sleep on these long flights anyway,” she says. Carlton is charming but spoiled, with a taste for luxury.  His father threatens to disinherit him, “not completely … but giving him absolute control of everything would be a big mistake.” In the Philippines, women are at the helm of many family businesses (Tessie Sy-Coson of SM and Joji Gotianun-Yap of Filinvest come to mind).  But though times are changing, in some families, females, even wealthy daughters, count for little. The character of Jacqueline Ling says, “I’m a girl.  My grandfather was old-fashioned … and for people like him, girls weren’t supposed to inherit—they were just married off.  He put all his holdings in a labyrinthine family trust, stipulating that only males born with the Ling surname could benefit.” “It wasn’t really that loss of money that was affecting me the most,” Ling says.  “It was the loss of the privilege.  To suddenly realize that you are inconsequential even within your own family.”  How about in cases where all the children are female? Colette Bing, in love with Carlton Bao, has parents whose fortune eclipses that of his.  But Colette resists the injunction to marry a suitably matched counterpart and produce the next-generation heirs in turn. “Why did you send me to the most progressive schools in England if all you expected out of me was to get married at such a young age?  Why did I bother studying so hard at Regent’s?  I have so many goals, so many things I want to accomplish before I become anyone’s wife,” she says. Colette says she does not need a man to look after her.  “I am not going to get married and pump out babies just because you want a barrel full of grandsons.”  Her father then freezes her bank accounts. Social strata Social class is a weapon of the Old Rich, who scoff at the nouveau riche as Henrys (High Earners, Not Rich Yet). When patriarch A wakes up from a coma, he stops the clan’s spending.  A’s daughter-in-law B hates the spending restrictions, so she has an affair with scion C, whose wife D comes from another prominent family.  D’s grandmother E “retaliated by making sure every old-guard family in Southeast Asia shut their doors firmly” on the clans of A and C, so finally C “chose to crawl back to his wife [D] rather than run off with [B].” Even Chinese New Year is not spared.  Families visit each other in strict order, based on seniority, paying respects to the oldest (hint, richest) relatives first, the paternal side on the first day, the maternal side on the next. This often requires “complicated Excel flow charts, ang pow [red money envelopes] tracking apps, and plenty of Russian vodka to dull the migraine-inducing confusion of it all.” Filipino time appears to be also Hong Kong and Shanghai time, albeit done deliberately.  People arrive late to functions. “It’s a matter of face—no one wants to be the first to show up, in case they look too eager, so they try to outdo one another in lateness.  The last one to arrive is deemed the most important.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The right family connections are essential. Not having attended the proper school with the right crowd “eliminates you from participating in 70 percent of the conversations that occur during dinner parties at the best houses.” Such chitchat goes all the way back to childhood, since people are “all still completely obsessed with what happened when they were five.  Who was fat or thin?  Who wet her pants during choir practice?  Who’s [sic] father shut down Ocean Park for the day so that he could have a huge birthday party?” Are there crazy rich Filipinos in the books?  Evangeline de Ayala, a not-so-subtle allusion, appears briefly as a kind woman who says “swithart.”  Unfortunately, most Filipinas in Kwan’s books are still maids, and the lone Filipino a bartender, though a genius bartender in a swanky private jet at that.

The transport network company (TNC), however, stressed that it was not taking advantage of the situation, explaining that its rates were still within the bounds approved by the government.  Still, Grab’s surge pricing during Monday’s morning rush hour shocked a lot of commuters who were forced to look for other forms of transport. One of them was Joyce Yu who chose to take a bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip which would normally cost just P250.  Disappointed passengers Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares which ranged from P300 to P600.  A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set riders back by almost P300 when hours earlier, the same trip cost only around P150. Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times while it was processing the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. According to Grab Philippines government communications manager Fiona Nicolas, while they have already implemented the new surge rate imposed by the LTFRB, fares may remain high in the meantime due to the limited number of drivers. “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in their passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system rose only by around 30 percent.  Uber goes offline On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its Southeast Asian operations under a March 25 deal. Uber’s move was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive for it to cease operating as a TNC starting April 16 despite an order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue serving the public pending a review of its deal with Grab. To protect the public from a hike in Grab fares, the National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP) called on the LTFRB to speed up its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto. “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that [the] LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” NCCSP head Maricor Akol said. At the same time, the LTFRB called on the public to report to it picky Grab drivers, including those who force passengers to cancel their bookings.

The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances.

Grab Philippines, now the largest transport network company in the country, would shoulder bulk of the fine. Uber would still be asked to pay despite having left the country. The issue stems from a regional takeover deal earlier this year, wherein Grab acquired Uber’s operations here in Southeast Asia.  The PCC had flagged this, launching a review amid concerns the deal might come at the expense of the ride-hailing public. “The fines are imposed for causing undue difficulties on the PCC review and decision making process,” said PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo in a press briefing.  The review was later set aside after Grab committed to make certain changes in its operations, albeit the violations during the process have been underscored. These promised changes, or the voluntary commitments, are currently being monitored. A violation could lead to more fines, and even an unwinding of the deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments, she said. Broken down, both companies were collectively fined P4 million for failure to keep their businesses separate. Grab, for its part, has been penalized to pay P8 million for failure to maintain premerger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber, as the acquired party, was fined P4 million for the same set of violations.

Uber on Friday said the service, dubbed uberHOP, will be initially available only for people traveling between Makati City and Bonifacio Global City.  UberHOP will be available on weekdays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. then between  4:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.  Uber, which mainly competes here with rival mobile platform GrabTaxi and traditional taxi services, said riders save on the fare since the cost would be split with other passengers. For this pilot test, the introductory fee is a flat rate of P75 per ride and the passenger could share the trip with as many as five other riders on board a “large vehicle.”  According to Uber, the savings could amount to as much as 70 percent compared to an UberX ride. Since it is a flat fare, there will be no surge pricing mechanism, Uber said. “We’re testing uberHOP as a special pilot here because Manila suffers from some of the worst congestion in the world,” Uber said on its website.  “Congestion is more than just an annoyance; it’s a drain on our cities, our economies and our planet. Innovative solutions like uberHOP, that put more passengers in fewer cars – safely, reliably and affordable – help move us towards a brighter, cleaner and less gridlocked future,” it added. Uber pointed out that an uberHOP ride can only accommodate one person per request. That means that riders will need to book their own uberHOP rides separately, it said. UberHOP rides are booked in a similar manner to regular Uber trips although an app update might be needed for some users. It said passengers can select the uberHOP feature and the platform will pair the rider with a driver along with other people travelling in the same direction. As noted, this is only for the Makati City to BGC route. There are some key differences to a regular Uber ride.  Passengers will be asked to walk to a “suggested meet up spot” that comes with a scheduled time indicated in the app, which Uber said will be within “10 minutes or less.” The drop-off of point will also be suggested by the app. The uberHOP driver will not wait for late passengers, it said. At no point is the passenger allowed to contact the driver to make alternative arrangements. Moreover, passengers are also discouraged from cancelling rides. In a regular Uber trip, a passenger can cancel a request, but this comes with a P100 fee. Uber did not detail any penalty when cancelling an uberHOP but it noted that booking in this manner means a passenger is “making a commitment to both your co-riders and the driver.” “Cancellations damage both of their experiences, so please don’t leave them hanging,” Uber said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919966/ltfrb-shows-proof-of-uber-violation","title":"LTFRB shows ‘proof’ of Uber violation","date":"10:56 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"The accreditation of transport network company (TNC) Uber for another year may face rough sailing after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it was able to activate three cars into the Uber ride-sharing app days after the agency ordered TNCs to stop accepting new drivers.","body":"The accreditation of transport network company (TNC) Uber for another year may face rough sailing after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it was able to activate three cars into the Uber ride-sharing app days after the agency ordered TNCs to stop accepting new drivers. During a hearing on Wednesday on Uber’s alleged violation of the agency’s July 26 order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told the company’s representatives that the board’s personnel were able to register and include three cars on the Uber platform within an hour using a mobile phone.  On July 26, the LTFRB told TNCs Grab and Uber that “no further acceptance of additional accreditation of TNVS (transport network vehicles services) and/or activation of their accounts into (your) respective systems shall be allowed, effective immediately.” On Tuesday, the board ordered Uber officials to appear in the hearing on the alleged violation. Later that day, the company issued a statement explaining that “applications for vehicles are beingaccepted but not processed.”  At Wednesday’s proceedings, Uber legal counsel Joseph Castillo maintained that the company had made it “clear in the communication packages” given to new drivers that “activations will not happen even if we accepted” their applications. But Lizada showed Castillo how the LTFRB itself was able to obtain an account through the web portal used by Uber drivers. She said the agency over the weekend was able to add a car into the newly created account at 2:20 p.m. and have it activated at 2:58 p.m.  “What I find difficult to comprehend is that your partners can add vehicles into their accounts inside the confines of their room,” Lizada said. “I wonder how many operators are now putting vehicles in their respective accounts because this can be another way [to] circumvent [our orders].” Castillo said he would have to go back to Uber to determine if the “active” status of a car in the account meant that the drivers could already use the vehicle. LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III acknowledged that while TNCs are “ahead in terms of technology,” they still need to comply with government regulations. “[The] acceptance for accreditation [has] to stop precisely because we’re trying to address false expectations of prospective TNVS to get themselves accredited, or worse activated or get a booking,” he said. Lizada stressed that the board’s two meetings with Uber and Grab last month were done “in good faith to find an equilibrium” in addressing concerns of the ride-sharing industry. “We hope Uber will be patient enough to wait and be compliant. That’s all that we’re asking,” she said. The board has given Uber five days to submit a written explanation why its accreditation, set to expire this month, should not be cancelled in view of the alleged violation."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/952847/privacy-watchdog-171k-ph-users-affected-by-uber-data-breach","title":"Privacy watchdog: 171K PH users affected by Uber data breach","date":"06:40 AM December 16, 2017","snippet":"","body":" The personal information of 171,000 Filipino Uber drivers and passengers had been compromised in a hack that Uber Technologies Inc. deliberately hid from public knowledge for more than a year, according to the head of the government body looking into the extent and implications of the breach.  Raymund Liboro, head of the National Privacy Commission (NPC), said only the users’ registered name, e-mail address, and phone number were compromised. In a statement, Liboro said Uber Philippines, the local arm of the ridesharing company, had confirmed on Thursday that the extent of the impact was limited to these bits of information.  However, the NPC chief also noted receiving a report of “irregular processing” that suggests other data may have also been compromised, an allegation that the commission would still have to confirm in order to establish its link to the 2016 data breach incident. “We were informed that around 171,000 Filipino citizens consisting of drivers and passengers were affected by the breach. We understand this to be based on the mobile phone numbers included in the registry,” he said. “We were also informed that the exposure of the affected data subjects was limited to their registered name, e-mail address and phone number.”  It remains unclear if specific Uber users would be informed that they were hacked. The company’s US office last month made an admission of the breach, noting that the personal information of tens of millions of users worldwide had been compromised by a hack that Uber kept secret for more than a year. Prior to Thursday’s disclosure, Uber Philippines could only confirm that Filipino users were also affected by the hack, without giving exact numbers. 1.3M active riders According to Liboro, Uber Philippines reported having 1.3 million active riders in the country. The number of Uber drivers, meanwhile, is still up for validation but Liboro gave an estimate of below 100,000.  Uber’s explanation of the hack could be read on its official website. There is also an option for users to alert Uber if they think they’ve been hacked. Reached for comment on Friday, Uber Philippines neither confirmed nor denied if the company would actively inform users if they were among 171,000 Filipinos whose personal information had been compromised. Instead, Catherine Avelino, head of communications of Uber Philippines, referred the Inquirer to Uber’s blog post about the hack, stressing it has “everything we’re doing and have done.” Liboro said the NPC is now looking into the processes and procedures that Uber said it had taken “to ensure that this matter never happens again.” “We are paying particular attention to the steps taken to ensure that in the future, data breaches of this magnitude will not be concealed from regulators and from affected data subjects,” he said, noting that concealment of data breaches is a criminal offense. Liboro also said further assistance to affected users could be included in NPC’s compliance order for Uber. Uber Philippines previously claimed having no knowledge of the incident prior to the recent public admission made by its US office. Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information faces a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of less than P500,000. The necessary penalties, according to the law, would be imposed on people who, after learning about the breach, decided to conceal the fact, regardless of whether it was done intentionally or by omission."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/925898/ltfrb-uber-tncs-transportation-network-companies-public-transportation-grace-poe-aileen-lizada","title":"LTFRB lifts ban, orders Uber to pay P190-M fine","date":"07:10 AM August 27, 2017","snippet":"Uber welcomed the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) cutting short its suspension in exchange for a P190-million fine, but the ride-sharing giant kept silent on Saturday as to when it intended to settle the penalty.","body":"Uber welcomed the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) cutting short its suspension in exchange for a P190-million fine, but the ride-sharing giant kept silent on Saturday as to when it intended to settle the penalty. The LTFRB ordered Uber to pay the huge fine instead after lifting its one-month suspension, imposed on Aug. 14, that sparked public outrage and forced 36,367 vehicles off the streets.  “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” said Cat Avelino, Uber’s head of communications, in a statement. On its Twitter account, Uber said it hoped to resume service  “this coming week.”  The transport agency said late on Friday that it would grant Uber’s petition to resume operations in exchange for the P190-million fine — much stiffer than Uber’s P10-million offer. It also required the company to pay about P20 million a day in financial assistance to its drivers for lost earnings.  Sen. Grace Poe welcomed the lifting of Uber’s suspension but nevertheless expressed disappointment at the timing of the decision. Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, pointed out that Uber would be unable to comply with the LTFRB order at once because the banks are closed on weekends. The LTFRB handed down its ruling right before the start of a three-day weekend, thus depriving Uber the chance to immediately resume service. “I am quite disappointed that the LTFRB decision was issued late Friday afternoon, effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties,” Poe said in a statement. “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around Metro [Manila] with their families,” she added.  Because the country is commemorating National Heroes Day tomorrow, the earliest that Uber can only comply with the board’s order is on Tuesday. In its eight-page order, the LTFRB said that Uber’s fine was “commensurate to the penalty of suspension.” It added that based on the data submitted by Uber, the company earned between P7 million and P10 million daily from about 150,000 trips. “[The P190-million fine] is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the order read. Uber was suspended for defying an LTFRB moratorium on the acceptance of new drivers as the agency studied how to regulate the growing ride-sharing industry. Uber’s rival Grab followed the directive. After filing a motion for reconsideration on Aug. 15, Uber resumed operations, only to stop on the same day when the LTFRB board denied its petition. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance [to Uber drivers] remitted,” the board resolution said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Uber should continue to provide assistance to its drivers until it had settled the fine. She added that for Uber to resume operations, it should provide proof of compliance from its bank, indicating that the drivers had indeed received the amount due them. The board explained that Uber’s P190-million fine is only about a third of what it would have spent if it fully served its suspension. Uber would have also shelled out about P597 million in financial aid to its drivers for a month. But Poe said the LTFRB could have offered relief to a lot more people had it given Uber the chance to comply with the ruling at once. “If the LTFRB had allowed Uber to operate right away, then this could have served as a great relief to our people, most of whom rely on TNVS (transport network vehicle service) due to the comfort, reliability and safety they provide,” she said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The P190-million penalty, she also said, “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” Commuters had voiced out their disappointment in the suspension of Uber, saying services like these offered a convenient alternative, especially with problems with irascible and choosy taxi drivers who overcharged fares. Uber said this month it was accepting new applications for vehicles but was not processing them pending its discussions with the LTFRB. It also urged the government to simplify the accreditation process, with a representative telling Poe’s committee: “We cannot impose 1900s regulations on today’s technological innovations.” —With a report from AFP"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/269418/uber-looks-to-raise-up-to-9b-in-initial-public-offering","title":"Uber looks to raise up to $9B in initial public offering","date":"06:34 PM April 28, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts.","body":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts. The San Francisco-based company expects to be valued at $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion, falling well below prior estimates that rose as high as $120 billion, in a sign that investors may be taking a more cautious approach to ride-hailing after the stock performance of Uber’s rival, Lyft.  Even so, Uber is on track for one of the largest IPOs in history. The company plans to sell 180 million shares for between $44 and $50 each. Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/251538/pcc-cites-grab-price-hikes-decreased-service-quality-after-uber-acquisition","title":"PCC cites Grab price hikes, ‘decreased’ service quality after Uber acquisition","date":"03:12 PM May 28, 2018","snippet":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday.","body":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/724660/transpo-group-claims-uber-grabcar-worsen-traffic-in-metro","title":"Transpo group claims Uber, GrabCar worsen traffic in Metro","date":"03:59 PM September 23, 2015","snippet":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila.","body":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila. Staging a rally outside the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) main office in Quezon City on Wednesday, members of Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) said that thousands of GrabCar and Uber are on the road due to the relatively easy procedures for their accreditation.  ACTO President Efren De Luna said that the relative ease of the accreditation process of said transportation network companies (TNCs) violates their rights as “legitimate” owners and operators of public utility vehicles who have franchises. “[Uber and GrabCar] contribute to worsening traffic and minimize our profit. Their accreditation is a violation of out rights as legitimate public utility vehicle owners and operators who hold franchise and are following the prescribed procedures. However, our rights have been disregarded by the LTFRB,” De Luna said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.  “Our problem is that there are too many cars on the road. But why is the LTFRB still accepting the application of thousands of GrabCar and Uber drivers?” he added. Meanwhile, De Luna claimed that the accreditation of the TNCs has sparked a more aggressive stance of the regulatory agency regarding the “phase-out” of PUVs.  He said that while drivers of PUVs are willing to “modernize” so that their service will be at par with the ones being provided by Uber and GrabCar drivers,  the “phase-out” of cars which are 10 years-old or older will pose as a threat to their livelihood. Citing data collated as of Sept. 23, the LTFRB said that it has received 3,903 units from TNCs and has received applications from 2,982 drivers for accreditation. There were more drivers wanting to be accredited under Uber than GrabCar: with 1,808 applications for Uber compared to 1,174 for GrabCar. JE"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/724597/party-list-group-ubers-unfair-pricing-system-detrimental-to-puvs","title":"Party-list group: Uber’s ‘unfair’ pricing system detrimental to PUVs","date":"01:51 PM September 23, 2015","snippet":"A party-list group on Wednesday called for the suspension of the accreditation given by the Land Transport Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to popular mobile application-based ridesharing service Uber over its pricing system.","body":"A party-list group on Wednesday called for the suspension of the accreditation given by the Land Transport Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to popular mobile application-based ridesharing service Uber over its pricing system. During the hearing of its petition calling for the suspension of Uber’s accreditation over its pricing system, 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-UTAK) party-list group alleged that it is “unfair” for other public utility vehicles to wait for LTFRB approval to adjust its fares while Uber and other  transportation network companies (TNCs) can set and adjust their fares.  1-UTAK Chair Vigor Mendoza is assailing the legality of the department order issued last May which created TNCs as a new transport service category, saying that it granted such companies the power to set their fares. Mendoza said that their petition before the regulatory agency boils down to a single demand: to have an equal playing field for TNCs like Uber and public utility vehicles in terms of pricing.  He also cited the need of having “reasonable and affordable” pricing for TNCs, citing what happened on Sept. 8 when heavy rains pushed for the five-fold increase of the usual rate of Uber vehicles. “What drivers are seeking is equal treatment. If the law states that fare adjustments should undergo public hearing, it should be abided. You cannot provide a service which is unreasonably priced, even if it is efficient. What our law states is that fares should be reasonable and affordable,”  Mendoza said.  On their part, Atty. Grace Ann Lazaro, counsel for Uber, claimed that they are allowed to set their rates in accordance to the the department order which provided their accreditation as a TNC. “When Uber applied for accreditation, we believe that the overall board has examined the fare structure we submitted,” Lazaro said. However, LTFRB Chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said that the regulatory agency has oversight functions to peg the rates set by Uber and other TNCs. “We have the power to adjust the fare to what we think will serve the interest of the public,” Ginez said. The LTFRB is yet to decide on the petition as it gave 10 days for each party to send their respective position papers."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/915986/only-half-of-grab-uber-vehicles-have-rider-insurance","title":"Only half of Grab, Uber vehicles have rider insurance","date":"05:42 AM July 22, 2017","snippet":"The Insurance Commission on Friday called on Grab and Uber operators to secure insurance coverage required of public utility vehicles (PUVs), saying only about half of them had complied with the passenger personal accident insurance program (PPAIP).","body":"The Insurance Commission on Friday called on Grab and Uber operators to secure insurance coverage required of public utility vehicles (PUVs), saying only about half of them had complied with the passenger personal accident insurance program (PPAIP). “Based on earlier reports that there are a total of 50,000 Uber and Grab active drivers, and assuming that each driver corresponds to one vehicle, only 56.18 percent of the total Uber and Grab vehicles plying on the roads are covered by the mandatory passenger insurance,” Commissioner Dennis Funa said.  The Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc. had issued 21,353 certificates of insurance coverage for vehicles operating under Uber, and 6,719 certificates for vehicles used under Grab, Funa said. As for SCCI Management and Insurance Agency Corp., it had recorded only about 15 passenger personal accident insurance policies for Grab and Uber vehicles, he added.  “As public transportation in the Philippines continues to evolve, it is very important for all PUVs to have sufficient insurance coverage for the protection of the riding public in the event of an accident, and for the alleviation of the difficulty in paying hospital claims and death benefits to their passengers,” Funa said. In all, 392,299 vehicles were insured under the PPAIP last year, Insurance Commission data showed.  In terms of vehicle type, the jeepney segment had the highest share with 176,213 units insured in 2016, a decline of 2 percent. The sedan segment increased by 64.94 percent from 55,129 insured units in 2015 to 90,930 in 2016 due to the entry of Grab and Uber, Funa said. Under the PPAIP, PUVs are required to procure insurance coverage for their passengers, including the driver. The maximum death benefit is pegged at P200,000 per passenger, while the amount covering injuries is based on the type of injury sustained."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978847/after-grab-uber-merger-ltfrb-says-3-new-tnvs-to-enter-ph","title":"After Grab-Uber merger, LTFRB says 3 new TNVS to enter PH","date":"04:32 PM March 28, 2018","snippet":"Ride-hailing platform Grab’s imminent monopoly of the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) sector may be short-lived as the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced on Wednesday the upcoming entry of three new ride-sharing applications—Go Lag, Owto and Hype.","body":"Ride-hailing platform Grab’s imminent monopoly of the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) sector may be short-lived as the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced on Wednesday the upcoming entry of three new ride-sharing applications—Go Lag, Owto and Hype. LTFRB Board Member Atty. Aileen Lizada said three local ride-sharing companies Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their accreditation before the agency.  “So if you say that there is no competition, soon there will be, and any competition is good for any industry because it benefits the riding public,” Lizada said in a press conference at Grab’s processing center at Mega Tent in Libis, Quezon City. The announcement came days after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move that secured the Singapore-based company’s dominance in the region’s TNVS industry.  Lizada also allayed concerns that the merger would result in higher fares as public utility vehicle operators have to first secure the LTFRB’s approval before increasing their fares. “Grab on its own, just like any other public utility vehicle, cannot increase its fare on its own,” she said.  “We also have monitoring. We know ano yung range nila, and if there are complaints, we see them and read them sa Twitter as well as our Facebook account, LTFRB Citizen Enforcer, and @ltfrb for Twitter,” she added. Lizada said that with the Grab-Uber merger, the LTFRB would “all the more” be strict in implementing transportation rules and regulations. “We will not allow any infractions, any violations especially so with this merger. All the more that we will be strict in monitoring,” she said. Lizada explained that before approving any petition for fare increases, the LTFRB conducts public hearings where the agency’s board members, including representatives from the National Economic and Development Administration, deliberate on the petition.      /muf READ: Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/85073/ubers-second-center-of-excellence-in-asia-opens-in-pampanga","title":"Uber’s second Center of Excellence in Asia opens in Pampanga","date":"07:49 PM April 04, 2019","snippet":"MABALACAT, Philippines — Officials of the transportation network company Uber Asia Pacific on Thursday inaugurated the Clark Center of Excellence (COE), its second site in Asia, at the Skytech IT Park Building here.","body":"MABALACAT, Philippines — Officials of the transportation network company Uber Asia Pacific on Thursday inaugurated the Clark Center of Excellence (COE), its second site in Asia, at the Skytech IT Park Building here.

A self-taught opera singer and a musicology graduate, he lives in Durban, a city on the east coast of the country.  One of the reasons he thought of becoming a driver was to get a chance to find connections to share his talent, NPR reported on Saturday, July 13. Opportunity came when he booked Kim Davey on May 23. During the ride with Davey, she found out his penchant for opera and asked him to sing. She posted his video on Facebook, and Mngoma’s powerful voice has since racked up 696,000 views as of writing. Davey appealed to agents to help Mngoma’s dreams come true, given that he has had no opportunities in the country for his musical talent.   Local press quickly picked up his story and have helped put his dreams to motion. He received a donation worth R5,000 (over P18,000) from radio show “Breakfast with Martin Bester”. He also got connected with a musician through East Coast Radio to produce and release a single, as per the South African Jewish Report on June 27. The single “Feel the Love”, released on July 5, is not an opera song, but is still a step in his music career. Power of music and friendship More impressive than his vocals is the bond Mngoma has found with his passenger. He and Davey have been talking daily and have had a few reunions, one of which was on Friday, July 12. When he was on East Coast Radio to promote his single, she paid a surprise visit and both of them shared a tight embrace. Davey regularly updates her Facebook to promote his shows — he has been invited to perform in events such as private functions and a gala concert. It is also with her help that Mngoma is able to find sponsors to pay for travel or accommodations in shows outside of his city.  Mngoma has not given up his day job just yet, but up next is a chance to go to Hollywood. He has been chosen to attend the International Presentation of Performers (iPOP!) in Los Angeles, a convention in December which will connect him to international agents. The amount of R150,000 (almost P550,000) is being crowdfunded for his flights, visa, passport, new clothes and money to support his family while he is away.

At a Senate briefing on the Department of Transportation budget, Delgra told Sen. Grace Poe that the LTFRB would issue a memorandum circular on this new requirement in “moving forward to solve this issue” on regulating the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS).  “We have to go back to the original concept of ride-sharing. We cannot allow that there are TNVS operators operating more than 20 or 30 units,” he told Poe who asked him whether the LTFRB would limit the number of vehicles to be owned by TNVS operators. Asked by Poe what would happen to operators with 10 or more units, Delgra replied: “We know we cannot simply drop them.”  He said he was aware that a large number of TNVS operators had gone to the extent of borrowing money from banks to “get a car so they would be able to put it in Uber or Grab.” According to Delgra, there will be a “transition period” for those who will be affected by the new requirement and they will be offered options.  “Considering the fact that they are actually maintaining a fleet already; they own 20 units under one name [so] they can go [into] taxi service. Second, they can also go into [the] shuttle service if they want. And third, they can also go into tourist transport,” Delgra said. The LTFRB earlier said it would come out this month with new regulations governing the app-based transport industry such as extending the validity of franchise given to drivers. Uber has 66,000 vehicles while Grab has over 52,000. Of these, however, only more than 3,700 are licensed to operate by the LTFRB."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270509/uber-hits-fresh-headwinds-as-shares-extend-losses","title":"Uber hits fresh headwinds as shares extend losses","date":"04:00 PM May 14, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Uber shares went into a fresh skid Monday — more bad news for the global ride-hailing giant, which endured steep declines in its hotly anticipated market debut last week.","body":"NEW YORK — Uber shares went into a fresh skid Monday — more bad news for the global ride-hailing giant, which endured steep declines in its hotly anticipated market debut last week. Shares in Uber tumbled 10.75 percent to close at $37.10 on the second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Valued at some $82 billion in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector, Uber’s debut Friday was a major disappointment, losing 7.6 percent. The two-day meltdown left the Silicon Valley star with a cumulative loss of more 17.5 percent while ride-hailing rival Lyft has plunged 33 percent since its March debut.  Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor of finance specializing in IPOs, said it was highly unusual for a high-profile company like Uber to fall so quickly.   “But it’s a very difficult company to value, and I expect that there will be big upswings and downswings in the future,” Ritter said. Still, Ritter said the rocky opening is not necessarily an indication of the long-term value of Uber. “If a year from now its value goes up to $100 billion people will be no longer talking about the first two days of trading,” he said. ‘Remember Facebook’ Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi urged employees to look past the rough patch on Wall Street and stay focused on better days ahead, according to an internal email obtained by AFP.  “Remember that the Facebook and Amazon post-IPO trading was incredibly difficult for those companies,” Khosrowshahi said in the message. “And look at how they have delivered since. Our road will be the same.” He noted that Monday was a tough day for the stock market overall, not just for the San Francisco-based ride-share company with visions of becoming the “Amazon of transportation.” Khosrowshahi acknowledged that there were versions of Uber’s future in which the company does not prosper as hoped, but warned against being distracted by pessimistic voices in the market. “Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he said in the email. “We will be judged long-term on our performance, and I welcome that.” Troubled road ahead Richard Windsor, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog on technology, said Uber and Lyft have been pressured by their high valuations and intense competition. Uber and Lyft “are currently engaged in a life or death struggle to become the dominant ridesharing platform in the USA,” Windsor said. “Until this fight is settled, there is very little reason to invest in either company as while they slug it out rock bottom prices and incentives for drivers will continue to plague profitability.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Lyft shares Monday fell nearly six percent to $48.15, extending the steady decline for Uber’s smaller US rival. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said he expected the “valuation digestion process” to take some time and that he remained upbeat on Uber despite competition with Lyft and the long path to profitability. “We believe there is a large enough ocean for two boats as the ridesharing market domestically in the US is roughly $1.2 trillion and $5.7 trillion globally,” Ives said. “We expect ridership, drivers, and the monetization opportunities for Uber to increase markedly over the coming years. A core tenet of our bull thesis on Uber is around the company’s ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine.” Uber and Lyft face additional troubles, highlighted by last week’s protests from some drivers in the US, and regulatory roadblocks in many parts of the world. Thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike last week over revenue-sharing formulas and working conditions. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248905/grab-keep-uber-app-open-april-15","title":"Grab to keep Uber app open until April 15","date":"05:06 AM April 10, 2018","snippet":"In compliance with an order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), transport network company (TNC) Grab will keep the Uber app running until April 15 although this will not only defeat the purpose of the order but also put the riding public at risk, according to its officials.","body":"In compliance with an order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), transport network company (TNC) Grab will keep the Uber app running until April 15 although this will not only defeat the purpose of the order but also put the riding public at risk, according to its officials. “If we’re funding the app, where’s the competition?” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu asked in a press conference on Monday.  Earlier, the PCC ordered Uber to continue its services beyond April 8, delaying Grab’s takeover of its operations in the country. Separate, independent  The PCC directed the two TNCs to maintain separate and independent operations pending its review of the deal between the ride-hailing firms. According to Cu, they decided to extend the operations of the Uber app until April 15 as they expect to meet with PCC officials this week to further discuss the March 25 deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region.  Cu said that since March 25, Grab has footed the cost of its rival app’s operations in Southeast Asia as drivers and riders migrated to its platform. He pointed out that if the PCC would insist that Uber continue operating during the review, this would “diminish the point of what they want us to do.” According to Cu, the PCC does not seem to understand the premise of Uber’s extension of its operations in Singapore for another week. Uber’s premise “The premise [of Uber’s April 15 extension in Singapore] was to help in the transition, not to create an indefinite operational structure for a company that has already left the region,” he said.  Leo Gonzales, Grab Philippines public affairs head, pointed out that even if the Uber app continued to operate in the country, the PCC should realize there was no back-end support left to take care of passenger complaints and safety issues in the event of an accident. This was also the issue raised by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) which said that since the signing of the deal, only two Uber employees remained in the country to work on the transition. Cu also said that the PCC’s worry that Grab’s acquisition of Uber would create a “virtual monopoly” of the ride-sharing industry was a matter best left to the LTFRB. Let LTFRB decide “Unlike other companies, we are governed by the LTFRB. We fully trust … that it is operating in the best interest of the riding public. If PCC thinks [the deal is] detrimental to the riding public, they should take it up with LTFRB,” he said. Currently, the LTFRB is in the process of accrediting three new TNCs. A fourth TNC has expressed interest in joining the ride-hailing industry although it has yet to submit an application for accreditation. Cu maintained that even if Uber was now a part-owner of Grab, there was “no integration of operations as it remained separate, and we’re not assuming control of the Uber app.” He explained that even if Grab was funding the app’s operations, the system was still being handled by Uber’s main office in the United States."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/241359/uber-ph-checks-data-filipinos-included-hacked-accounts-uber-ride-hailing-firm-liboro-npc-hacking-uber-philippines","title":"Uber PH checks data if Filipinos included in hacked accounts","date":"03:24 PM November 24, 2017","snippet":"Uber Philippines had no prior knowledge of the breach that compromised the personal information of millions of users around the globe, but could neither confirm nor deny that any Filipino data was also hacked.","body":"Uber Philippines had no prior knowledge of the breach that compromised the personal information of millions of users around the globe, but could neither confirm nor deny that any Filipino data was also hacked. READ: Uber admits data from 57M riders, drivers stolen by hackers  This is according to Raymund Liboro, head of the National Privacy Commission (NPC), who called the local arm of Uber Technologies Inc. for a meeting on Thursday. However, the meeting failed to shed any conclusive light on the issue. “Based on what happened, they said they didn’t have information. That’s what they said. For now, they cannot rule out that any Filipino data was not compromised,” Liboro told the Inquirer in a phone interview in a mix of English and Filipino.  The ride sharing company, which helped change the face of transportation in some urban centers in the country, has been given until Saturday afternoon in order to verify whether or not Filipinos were also affected by the breach, he said. On top of this, NPC also reached out on Friday to the US Federal Trade Commission, which is a bipartisan federal agency tasked to protect consumers while promoting competition, in order to see “if they have confirmatory data” about the issue.  This develops days after Uber’s chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi disclosed in a blog post that the company had hidden the fact that it was hacked in October last year,  with “some personal information of 57 million Uber users” compromised. The hackers, however, were able to download names, e-mail addresses and mobile phone numbers of users across the globe and the driver’s license numbers of drivers in the United States. The company assured that no other piece of data was stolen, noting that the necessary measures have been taken. Later, news organizations reported that Uber paid hackers $100,000 in order to destroy the stolen data. “The question here is whether or not it’s a reportable breach. We think that it’s a reportable breach. It’s not enough to say that you were breached. You have to provide the vital information,” Liboro said. In a statement on Friday, NPC said that “Uber failed to provide the Commission with vital information [during] the meeting, especially on whether Filipino data are involved, citing limited information from their US Office.”  Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information face a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of less than P500,000. The necessary punishments, according to the law, would be slapped on people who — after learning about the breach — decided to conceal the fact, regardless if this was done intentionally or by omission. A circular released in December last year was even more specific about the responsibility of the parties involved to report. In NPC Circular 16-03, the commission should have been notified within 72 hours “upon knowledge or the reasonable belief” that a breach might have occurred. They don’t even have to be “absolutely certain about the scope of the breach” in order to report to NPC, the circular read. A top official of global leader in security software Trend Micro Inc. criticized how the ridesharing company handled the situation, noting that it “took the worst path possible” since it not only hid the fact but tied to sweep the issue under the rug by bribing the hackers. “Let me be clear. Paying cybercriminals is unacceptable. Failing to disclose a breach that impacts millions is intolerable. There is no way to prove that the cybercriminals deleted the data after receiving payment. That’s not how the digital world works,” said Mark Nunnikhoven, company vice president for cloud research in a blog post. /jpv"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/914805/ltfrb-stands-firm-vs-grab-uber-but-clarifies-services-not-suspended","title":"LTFRB stands firm vs Grab, Uber but clarifies services not suspended","date":"01:11 PM July 18, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) stood by its decision to go after Uber and Grab operators who continue to operate without franchise despite online petitions against it.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) stood by its decision to go after Uber and Grab operators who continue to operate without franchise despite online petitions against it. The LTFRB clarified that it has not suspended the services of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Grab but only those with Provisional Authority (PA) or Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) would be allowed to operate.  “The TNCs agreed to fully comply with the rules at the time they were granted accreditation. With their open and candid admission, it is clear that they have broken those rules grossly, putting at risk the tens of thousands of TNV’s without PA or franchise to commit colorum activities,” LTFRB Chairman Martin B. Delgra III said in a statement on Tuesday . The LTFRB earlier slapped a P5 million fine each for Uber and Grab for allowing some of their drivers to operate without permits and ordered the suspension of more than 50,000 ‘colorum’ drivers.  More than 20 Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS), the agency said, have so far been apprehended for operating without a franchise. READ: Ejercito hits LTFRB for stopping Grab, Uber ‘that provide better services’  “We cannot have one rule regarding colorum for them and another rule for the rest of the modes of public transport, i.e. bus, UV express, taxi and PUJ. Where service is imbued with public interest, no less than the safety and welfare of the riding public is concerned, regulations become priority,” Delgra said. He said the TNCs should also show “good faith” first by following the orders while the LTRFB creates a Technical Working Group (TWG) to discuss issues such as accreditation and pending applications, and “the core issues of accountability and dynamic pricing scheme as a way to move things forward.” “Right now, they are not cooperating,” the official said. While the TWG would help address the demand for such mode of public transport in a “rational, comprehensive and systematic manner,” Delgra said they expect the TNCs to be “candid, accurate, complete and transparent in submitting all the data and information the Board will need in addressing the issues.” A petition led by TNC driver Bobby Coronel on the website change.org, called on the LTFRB to ‘lift the suspension” on colorum drivers, citing the growing demand for TNCs services. “The demand for ride hailing services continues to grow….We cannot imagine a Philippines without ride-hailing services, can you?” Coronel said. Celine Amilhamja, INQUIRER.net trainee/JE/rga"},{"url":"http://business.inquirer.net/241499/bitcoin-uber-currency-not-without-risk","title":"Bitcoin, an ‘Uber’ currency, not without risk","date":"12:44 PM November 26, 2017","snippet":"PARIS — Bitcoin, which this week soared to a new record high of more than $8,000, is the monetary equivalent of Uber, since it bypasses central bank regulation and could be attractive for financially fragile countries, economists say.","body":"PARIS — Bitcoin, which this week soared to a new record high of more than $8,000, is the monetary equivalent of Uber, since it bypasses central bank regulation and could be attractive for financially fragile countries, economists say. Nevertheless, it is precisely the lack of oversight that opens up the users of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to risks and dangers, analysts warn.  “Bitcoin? It’s about ‘Uber-ising’ currency, about not having a central bank that decides the price,” said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at credit insurer Euler Hermes, referring to Uber, the ride-hailing app that has set the cat among the pigeons in the taxi sector in recent years. “Yes, it’s exactly that: it bypasses a central regulatory authority. That’s the genius of this invention,” agreed Yves Choueifaty, founder of the Paris-based asset management firm Tobam, which this week launched the first European fund investing in bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not regulated, but is traded on specialist platforms. It has no legal exchange rate and no central bank backing it. Launched in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software written by someone using the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is controlled and regulated by its community of users. Investors are already referring to it as “digital gold”, as the bitcoin soared to a new record high of more than $8,000 this week, a staggering rise in value from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year.  “We have no need for central banks,” said Yves Choueifaty, suggesting that institutional investors may be behind the recent sharp gains, even if insisted that there was “no bitcoin bubble.” The growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention: the CME Group of Chicago, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, has decided to launch a bitcoin futures marketplace. And prestigious US universities are offering courses in blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrencies are based. ‘Dollarization 2.0’ Virtual currencies could also prove attractive to economic players in countries such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, whose fiat currencies have been ravaged hyper-inflation. Caracas, for example, has had to issued a new 100,000-bolivar bill, when just a year ago, the biggest-denomination banknote was 100 bolivars.  “Think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country — such as the US dollar — some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0,” said the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, recently. Economists also suggest the bitcoin could be of interest to developing countries where individuals often find it easier to access the internet than traditional bank accounts. Nevertheless, central banks and the big financial institutions are concerned that virtual currencies can be used for illicit purposes and are highly speculative by nature. “It’s the exact definition of a bubble,” the head of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, warned recently in comments that immediately sparked an uproar on social media among bitcoin’s supporters. The head of the French central bank or Banque de France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, warned in the summer: “People are using the bitcoin today are clearly doing it at their own risk and at their own peril.” ‘No intrinsic value’ Nobel laureate, Jean Tirole, also insisted that the current bitcoin boom was a “bubble”. “It’s something that has no intrinsic value,” he told AFP on the sidelines of a conference in Paris this week. “It could collapse from one day to the next. I would be completely against French banks, for example, investing in bitcoin.” Euler Hermes economist Subran called on the financial authorities to make potential investors more aware of the risks. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “There’s a lot of money to be made. And a lot of money to be lost,” he said. “We’re seeing more and more people wanting to venture there, but they’re not fully aware of the risk.” Bitcoin has regularly suffered abrupt falls, for example, in cases of friction between the members of the community who oversee it and the members who produce it, when the regulatory authorities issue any warnings, or if there are data hacks. But more often than not, bitcoin quickly makes up any losses and some investors are predicting it will soon top the $10,000 level. Back in 2011, it had struggled to pass $1."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919535/defiant-uber-probed-execs-air-lament","title":"‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament","date":"05:43 AM August 02, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered officials of the transport network company Uber to appear in a hearing today, citing its alleged defiance of an order for TNCs to stop accepting new drivers.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered officials of the transport network company Uber to appear in a hearing today, citing its alleged defiance of an order for TNCs to stop accepting new drivers. The LTFRB said that despite its July 26 order for TNCs Grab and Uber to stop, Uber “willfully and contumaciously violate[d]” the directive. Uber was also given five days to submit a explanation why its accreditation should not be canceled.  The LTFRB is currently reviewing the accreditation of the TNCs. Grab’s accreditation expired last month and while that of Uber is set to expire this month. But in a text message to the Inquirer, Uber communications head Cat Avelino maintained the company had suspended new driver and vehicle activations since July 19, or eight days after the LTFRB issued an initial order for TNCs to stop accepting new applications.  “[W]e have not resumed since then. As a result, 14,000 riders are unable to book a ride every day,” Avelino said. Last month, the LTFRB ordered the TNCs to stop the operation of drivers who do not have a certificate of public convenience or a provisional authority to operate. But the crackdown on colorum vehicles was deferred after the TNCs filed a motion for reconsideration.  PH lagging behind Of the estimated 42,000 Uber and Grab drivers, only about 3,700 have permits to operate. In a press conference on Tuesday, the eve of the hearing, Uber regional and local officials noted how the country had fallen behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in appreciating the benefits of the ride-sharing industry. They also raised concerns over a recent proposal to impose a supply cap on Uber and Grab vehicles, while reiterating calls for the government to lift the year-old suspension on the acceptance of new member drivers. “One of the shames about the Philippines is that back in 2015, there was a real sense that there was a clear momentum in this country to have the first national ride-sharing regulations,” said Damian Kassabgi, Uber Asia Pacific head of public policy.  “But frankly, since then, you’ve seen countries around the region overtake (the Philippines) in relation to their understanding of the service, and the way they are putting a framework around it,” he said. Kassabgi noted that Malaysia recently passed legislation in support of ride-sharing without price controls or supply caps. Against core principles These are areas the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it wanted to regulate. In terms of caps, there was a proposal last week to put a limit on the number of ride-sharing vehicles on the road. The LTFRB also saw a need for their drivers to put in a minimum number of hours. Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said these proposals would go against the core principles of ride-sharing, which was flexibility for both passengers and drivers. “What I can tell you is that 60 percent of drivers use [Uber] on a part time basis,” Cua said, referring to drivers who work six hours or less. Citing fluctuations in supply and demand, Cua also warned that limiting the number of eligible ride-sharing applications that can be approved would be “damaging” to the industry. Uber Philippines alone has some 30,000 drivers and one million active users, Cua said. ‘Taxi way of thinking’ “Having these supply caps is very much a taxi way of thinking about the world,” Kassabgi, citing countries like Malaysia and Singapore which have tight controls on private car ownership. “We do not see this concept of supply caps because regulators [elsewhere] understand that this is a demand responsive service.” The LTFRB last month fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for continuing to add new drivers to their networks despite the moratorium imposed by the board in July 2016. The LTFRB at the time said it wanted to review existing policies covering such transport services. According to Cua, some 200,000 rider requests “go unfulfilled”  weekly because of the suspension."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249822/uber-points-ltfrb-order-failure-meet-pcc-condition","title":"Uber points to LTFRB order for its failure to meet PCC condition","date":"05:14 AM April 26, 2018","snippet":"Uber Philippines has blamed its failure to comply with one of the conditions of an ongoing review by the Philippine Competition Commission to a stop order issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).","body":"Uber Philippines has blamed its failure to comply with one of the conditions of an ongoing review by the Philippine Competition Commission to a stop order issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The review was triggered by the announcement by Grab of its regional takeover of Uber’s business here in Southeast Asia, a move which raised serious consumer concerns in the Philippines.  PCC reviewed the deal between the two firms, asking the stakeholders to delay the acquisition in the meantime. The interim measures were set to keep the findings of an ongoing PCC review accurate. One of the conditions was for Grab and Uber to continue working independently and separately until the the review is finished.  Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber agreed to extend the availability of its app to April 15 given the ongoing PCC review. In the Philippines, Grab said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease and desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15.  Commissioner Stella Alabastro Quimbo said on Wednesday that Uber and Grab Philippines recently submitted reports that explained both their compliance and non-compliance with the antitrust body’s conditions. “We’re still studying the documents that they provided. Of course, in the topic of penalties, you have to afford the parties due process. We’re still studying what the next steps may be, which could include a hearing,” she said in a phone interview. It would seem that Uber is in a tough spot, wherein following one regulator might come at the expense of disobeying the other. However, according to lawyer Anthony Abad, one of the proponents of the Philippine Competition Act since its early days in 1993, this does not necessarily have to end in a deadlock. “If they [Uber] want to, they certainly can. They can appeal but whether LTFRB would agree to the appeal is another question,” Abad previously said.  When asked if such an appeal would be considered, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada deferred from giving a categorical answer. Instead, she said in a text message that this would require a “collegial decision.” But apart from LTFRB’s consideration, the prospects of an extension of Uber’s operations still seem dim.

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which licenses about 180,000 drivers of car services and yellow cabs, called his behavior “ridiculous.”  “It’s 2018 in New York City, and this isn’t the way we live anymore,” commission spokesman Allen Fromberg said. The women, Alex Iovine and Emma Pichl, a couple in their 20s, were on their way from Brooklyn to Manhattan on Saturday when they exchanged what they called a “peck” on the lips. They said driver Ahmad El Boutari, who’s 35 and lives in Brooklyn, forced them out and a confrontation ensued.  A cellphone video taken by Pichl shows the driver saying that kissing in an Uber is illegal. “You can’t do this in the car,” the driver says.  “Kissing is not illegal,” one of the women responds. “Why are we not allowed to kiss in an Uber?” “It’s disrespectful,” the driver says. Fromberg noted that the city does not regulate behavior in Uber cars and similar services. But he called what the driver did to the women “an unacceptable and repugnant act that will not be tolerated.” The Taxi and Limousine Commission is investigating. Uber has behavior rules amounting to, basically, no sex in cars. But Iovine and Pichl said they were doing no such thing.  El Boutari told the Daily News that the women played loud music on their phones and one put her feet on the seat. But Iovine said that was not true. “We would never try to upset someone in their own car,” she said by telephone. Then, “after we had peck-kissed, sitting on opposite sides of the back seat and not even touching, I saw him looking at me in the rearview mirror,” she said. “He was very angry.” She said they were in lower Manhattan when the driver pulled over, opened a rear door and ordered them to “get out of my car.” During the altercation, when Pichl started recording the scene, “he grabbed Emma’s arm to try to get her to stop,” Iovine said. “It was kind of a scary experience.” Uber, which is based in San Francisco, has removed El Boutari’s access to its app, saying it does not tolerate discrimination. It said it is investigating. /cbb"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/203649/qc-judge-stops-dotc-new-permits-for-uber-grabcar","title":"QC judge stops DOTC new permits for Uber, GrabCar","date":"05:43 AM December 05, 2015","snippet":"A Quezon City court has ordered a 20-day suspension of the implementation of a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order permitting the app-based ride-sharing companies Uber and GrabCar to operate in Metro Manila.","body":"A Quezon City court has ordered a 20-day suspension of the implementation of a Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) order permitting the app-based ride-sharing companies Uber and GrabCar to operate in Metro Manila. Judge Santiago Arenas of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 217 issued the 20-day temporary restraining order (TRO) in connection with the petition filed by Stop and Go, a coalition of taxi operators and drivers.  The court blocked the DOTC from accepting further applications of app-enabled transport services, pending its decision after it hears on Dec. 8 the Stop and Go petition to ban them in the capital. “There is extreme urgency to issue a temporary restraining order to the petitioner to prevent grave and irreparable injury and damages because of their claim that they suffer less or low incomes and earnings is found to be persuasive,” said the court.  Judge Arenas clarified that the TRO does not apply to the existing operations of Uber and GrabCar. The TRO applies only to future applications and not the current operations of Uber and GrabCar, Arenas said.  “How can I include Uber and Grab, they are not impleaded as a party,” Arenas told the Inquirer as he lamented the negative comments he received on social media. “The TRO only seeks to restrain the government offices not to accept applications in the meantime,” Arenas said. “No further implementation of the order and circulars because their legality is being taken up in court,” he said. The court order also does not affect Uber and GrabCar operations in Cebu, the country’s second largest city, where the government has allowed Uber to operate 10 vehicles to help meet public transport demand during the Christmas season. The TRO covers the DOTC order which created the categories transportation network company (TNC) for the technology provider and transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) for the unit operators.  The court order also suspended the related guidelines issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The court order, dated Nov. 27, also suspended the accepting, processing and approval of TNVS applications. Stop and Go president Jun Magno, who received the court order on Thursday, hailed the TRO as an “initial victory.” “We just want the process to be equal,” Magno said. He questioned the “unlimited” applications for TNVS while there is a moratorium on issuance of franchises for other public utility vehicles. The Stop and Go petition claimed that Uber and GrabCar were given special treatment to operate without a franchise. “The income of taxi drivers was slashed by up to 50 percent because of the app-based transport, which does not follow tariffs imposed by the government,” Magno said. About 660,000 taxis ply their trade in Metro Manila, the Asian Development Bank estimated in 2010. Magno said Stop and Go was only questioning the operations of Uber and GrabCar. “If there are complications in the department order, the DOTC or the solicitor general can clarify it with the court,” he said. Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya said he had first to see a copy of the TRO and its contents before he could comment. LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez yesterday said the board had not yet received the court order. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The subject of the case, as far as I know, is TNVS. It has to be clarified with the court which aspects of the [department order] are being restrained. As you said, there are other denominations included in the [order],” Ginez said. The department order also covers the transport denominations of rapid bus transit, airport bus and premium taxi. Ginez said the LTFRB would comply with the court order and would request the Office of the Solicitor General to study the available legal remedies. On the issue of “unlimited” TNVS, Ginez said it was a policy issue as the moratorium was limited to existing transport denominations while the TNCs and TNVS were a new innovation. As of Nov. 9, the LTFRB has received 7,304 TNVS applications. Of the total, 5,660 are with Uber while 1,644 are with GrabCar. In a statement, Uber said the company was aware of the court decision and would study its implications on their partner vehicles. “Uber was not a party to the proceedings that resulted in the court’s decision and plans to coordinate closely with the DOTC and LTFRB,” it said. The Philippines was the first country to regulate these types of app-based services, to help make up for inadequate mass transport in Manila, Southeast Asia’s second most congested city after Jakarta, according to research firm Numbeo.

(PLDT), the country’s biggest telecommunications company,  is moving beyond the digital highway to Metro Manila’s roads through a partnership with popular ride sharing app Uber.","body":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT), the country’s biggest telecommunications company,  is moving beyond the digital highway to Metro Manila’s roads through a partnership with popular ride sharing app Uber. PLDT, with units Smart Communications and Voyager Innovations, announced Tuesday a multi-year, strategic agreement with Uber in the Philippines, which will include free in-car Wi-Fi and promotions through Smart’s network.  The development is the latest partnership in the telecommunications industry, which is seeking new ways to generate revenues in a digital age. It also comes as Uber in the Philippines gains legitimacy following the government’s recent move to regulate transport-related smartphone applications, ahead of other countries.  With the partnership, Uber riders will be able to use free Wi-Fi, using Smart and PLDT’s network infrastructure, while onboard Uber vehicles. The service will initially be available in Uber black vehicles, which refers to the app’s premium service, but will be rolled out across all Uber cars “over the next few months.”  Uber was established in 2009 and was first launched in San Francisco, United States. Today, it is being used in 335 cities across 60 countries and in the Philippines, it mainly competes with other apps like GrabCar and regular taxi services, which have raised their opposition against the ride-sharing industry as an unfair threat to their business. Smart said that through the partnership, Uber riders on Smart’s network would be able to avail themselves of promotions, discounts and so-called on-demand experiences. Smart subscribers in Metro Manila who are first time users of the app can get two free Uber rides worth up to P300 each, from Sept. 9 to Sept 30, it added. The Uber mobile app will also be pre-installed on all smartphones that come with Smart postpaid subscriptions.  “We’re excited to partner with Uber, the world’s leading technology company that is transforming urban mobility, to bring its innovative digitally enabled service to more commuters in the Philippines,” PLDT chair Manuel V. Pangilinan said in a statement on Tuesday. “Filipinos are early adopters of new technology and through this partnership with Uber, we’re providing our subscribers the opportunity to make their ride experience even more convenient and enjoyable,” he added. “In Smart, Uber has found the perfect fit to realize our common vision of providing an unrivaled user experience built on a strong foundation of reliability, convenience and network efficiency,” Mike Brown, Uber regional general manager, Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand, said in the same statement. “The Philippine government has shown tremendous leadership in recognizing the value of ride-sharing services like Uber and developing new sector specific regulations,” he added. Smart said Uber drivers also gain exclusive prepaid and postpaid mobile packages as well as exclusive phone offers. As noted, the move is in sync with strategies employed by domestic telcos to shift their revenues into more digital and Internet-based services. PLDT earlier announced that it would increase its 2015 capital spending to a record P43 billion from P39 billion, mainly to bolster its high-speed Internet infrastructure. The spending, which may remain “elevated” for the next two years, comes as PLDT sees a big decline in its traditional revenues such as toll earnings and wireless pre-paid business. These segments, in recent years,  are being displaced by the popularity of social media and instant messaging."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/923146/ltfrb-stands-ground-tells-uber-not-to-use-public-convenience-as-excuse","title":"LTFRB stands ground, tells Uber not to use public convenience as excuse","date":"12:53 PM August 16, 2017","snippet":"Do not use public convenience as an excuse to defy orders.","body":"Do not use public convenience as an excuse to defy orders.

LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada defended the agency’s decision to suspend Uber operations despite online criticisms from the public. “They say it’s for the convenience of the riding public. Uber keeps on saying convenience, convenience… pero [but], sir, it does not [equate] to allowing them to violate the law, even the orders of the Board,” Lizada said in an interview with DZIQ Radyo Inquirer 990.  “So kailangan lagyan ng preno [we need to put the brakes on], let them know who is the regulatory body, who regulates [whom]. We are here to execute the law. ‘Yun naman talaga ginagawa namin (That’s what we have been doing all along),” she added. READ: LTFRB: Uber still suspended  Lizada said that Uber did not comply with the LTFRB’s July 26 order disallowing the accreditation of new drivers and cars into TNCs’ platforms. On July 27, the LTFRB was able to enroll three vehicles into Uber’s system by just going to its website. “Doon namin nadiscover na pwede palang mag-add ng vehicles even kung nasa bahay ang kanilang mga partners (That’s when we discovered that one can add vehicles even at the comfort of one’s home) without necessarily going through their offices,” she explained. Uber also issued a statement on August 1 that it continued to accept applications for new vehicles, the official noted. “So ibig sabihin, [it is a] clear defiance of the July 26 order. That’s why we say that it is time that Uber takes another hit kasi it appears na hindi sila nadala sa fine (because it appears that they did not learn from being fined),” she said. LTFRB previously fined Uber, as well as Grab, with P5-million fee for illegal operations.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab.

However, Privacy Commissioner Raymund Liboro said they are yet to draft the order since they are still in the process of gathering information regarding the incident. Up to now, Liboro said that Uber still couldn’t pin down the level of impact the breach had on Filipino Uber users.  This follows the admission made by the company’s US office last month, noting that millions of personal information worldwide have been compromised by a hack that Uber deliberately hid for more than a year. Later, Uber Philippines said that Filipino data are included in the breach.READ: Uber admits data from 57M riders, drivers stolen by hackers In a press briefing on Tuesday, Liboro categorically said that they would file a compliance order regardless of the outcome of the investigation. He said it could include a requirement to put up help centers for Filipinos who may want to ask further information regarding the hack.  Moreover, this could even include an identity theft insurance, which is the practice of more advanced privacy authorities. “Other jurisdictions have other ways of remediating it. For example, in some advanced countries, the authorities would regard them to identity theft insurance. It really depends on the nature of the data itself. If warranted, we could go to that extent. But at this point, we haven’t gotten the whole picture yet,” he said.  The investigation develops as the NPC recently partnered with 10 other countries in the Asia and Pacific in order to help in information sharing for cross-border cases. Last week, NPC said the administrators confirmed its status as a Privacy Enforcement Authority (PEA) under the APEC Cross Border Privacy Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA). Liboro said this is “bad news for Uber” since this would make it easier to work with other privacy authorities whose countries were also affected by the hack.  Other members of the network include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, US, and Mexico. “We are using the network to reach out to our partners in the CPEA in this information gathering stage,” he said. The network was developed for cross border privacy rules (CBPR). Apart from aiding in the investigation, Liboro said this would also enable Philippine-based companies to get their data-privacy and protection systems certified with a local Accountability Agent.  For businesses, he said this would mean less hassle as certification would amount to meeting the privacy requirements of each member-country in the system. /jpv RELATED STORY NPC set to step in if Uber hack compromised PH users"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/100193/50-hour-is-ubers-average-trip-rate-for-new-by-the-hour-service","title":"$50/hour is Uber’s average trip rate for new by-the-hour service","date":"04:41 PM June 02, 2020","snippet":"After a pilot program proved successful in cities within Australia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, Uber announced on Friday that select U.S. cities will be gaining access to an Hourly ride option.","body":"After a pilot program proved successful in cities within Australia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, Uber announced on Friday that select U.S. cities will be gaining access to an Hourly ride option.

Uber’s last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. The senator noted that many TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride but this option, he said, would no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9.  Thus, Pimentel said, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB “to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry.” “The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,” he said.  READ: After Grab-Uber merger, LTFRB says 3 new TNVS to enter PH He said the LTFRB should strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country’s TNVS guidelines. “We need real competition, not potential competition,” said the Senate president. “As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service—and this is where the LTFRB must come in.” Pimentel also called on the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. “Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. They should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” he further said. /jpv"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1050953/driver-charged-after-teens-fatal-fall-while-surfing-on-roof-of-uber-ride","title":"Driver charged after teen’s fatal fall while ‘surfing’ on roof of Uber ride","date":"04:58 PM November 06, 2018","snippet":"A driver in New York has been charged with manslaughter after a teenage boy climbed on the roof of his car and fell to his death during the ride.","body":"A driver in New York has been charged with manslaughter after a teenage boy climbed on the roof of his car and fell to his death during the ride. Danyal Cheema, 24, an Uber driver, is facing the charge of second-degree manslaughter after Ryan Mullen, 15, died due to a traumatic brain injury from the fall, reported WABC yesterday, Nov. 5.  Cheema was driving a 2010 Toyota Highlander SUV when he picked up three teenage boys in Long Island past midnight on Sept. 23. The boys had been drinking and partying. The driver said he was offered $70 to let them climb on the roof of the car and “surf.” The boys took back their offer but later offered $40, which Cheema accepted.  Two boys, one of whom was Mullen, were atop the roop while Cheema drove. The third companion recorded them on a Snapchat video. When Mullen fell off the vehicle, his head struck the pavement and suffered from blunt force trauma, which fractured his skull. The driver took the boys to their destination, the house of Mullen’s friend. Mullen died in his sleep later in the day.  Cheema was arrested on Sunday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter during his arraignment on Monday, reported NBC News earlier today, Nov. 6. His bail is set at $200,000 cash or $400,000 bond. His license has been suspended and Uber has permanently removed him from the app. If convicted, he faces five to 15 years in prison. He is set to return to court on Friday.  Niña V.

Who will pay for the cost to operate?  In an order released on Saturday, the PCC said the two transportation network companies (TNCs) should “maintain the independence of their business operations” for the “entire duration” of the commission’s motu propio review on the deal. The PCC, however, did not state when it intends to conclude its review. The PCC order came a day before the Uber app is scheduled to go offline, which is on Sunday, April 8.  Early this week, PCC and LTFRB officials met to discuss what would become of the ride-sharing industry with Uber’s exit from the Southeast Asian region. Lizada said that they stressed in that meeting that safety measures have been put in place by the board “to prevent any monopoly by any TNC,” which the PCC fears would happen.  For one, she noted, there are currently four new TNCs that have sought accreditation from the LTFRB. Once these TNCs – Lag Go, Hype, Owto and Pira – satisfy the LTFRB’s requirements, they will take the place of Uber, affording the riding public more transport options. Also, she said that TNCs could not increase their fares on their own as they are required to follow the fare structure approved by the LTFRB. As for the app-based drivers, the franchises that are given to them by the LTFRB are not exclusive to any TNC, which means that they get to decide on who they want to drive for. Rather than unbundle the deal entered by the two TNCs, Lizada said that LTFRB should instead be “called [out] to fast-track the processing of the new players.” It remains unclear how the PCC intends to enforce its order on Uber, especially that its employees are already on a four-month garden leave. The Inquirer also learned that Uber has only around 10 employees left in the country who are part of the transition team.  The Inquirer sought both Uber and Grab officials for comment on the PCC’s order but has yet to receive a reply as of writing. On Friday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu assured the National Privacy Commission that there would be no migration to their platform of the personal data of the 1.2 million Uber users, which may include credit card details. He noted that the data which would be transferred to them are only those of the drivers, who would have to give their consent to Grab. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270061/driver-protests-strikes-cast-shadow-on-uber-ipo","title":"Driver protests, strikes cast shadow on Uber IPO","date":"01:02 PM May 08, 2019","snippet":"WASHINGTON — Rideshare drivers in major US cities were set to stage a series of strikes and protests Wednesday, casting a shadow over the keenly anticipated Wall Street debut of sector leader Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — Rideshare drivers in major US cities were set to stage a series of strikes and protests Wednesday, casting a shadow over the keenly anticipated Wall Street debut of sector leader Uber. Organizers in some cities were calling for a 24-hour stoppage while the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents both app and traditional taxi drivers, called on drivers to shut down all apps between 7:00 am (1100 GMT) and 9:00 am.  It was unclear how many drivers would take part in the work stoppage amid strike calls in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere. A similar action was expected in London, according to US organizers. The app drivers for Uber, Lyft, Via and other platforms are seeking improved job security, including an end to arbitrary “deactivations,” and a better revenue split between drivers and platforms.  In New York, the alliance was expecting most of its 10,000 app drivers to participate in the stoppage as well as some non-members. “Wall Street investors are telling Uber and Lyft to cut down on driver income, stop incentives, and go faster to driverless cars,” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York association, said in a statement.   “Uber and Lyft wrote in their (regulatory) filings that they think they pay drivers too much already. With the IPO, Uber’s corporate owners are set to make billions, all while drivers are left in poverty and go bankrupt.” In Washington, the Drive United association of drivers called for a protest at Reagan National Airport to support the actions in other locations. “We are asking riders not to cross the picket lines and to respect the strike,” said Drive United organizer Jeffrey Dugas. Drive United said the action was in solidarity with protests in the US and other areas of the world where drivers struggle with the independent contractor model.  “We’ve spoken with hundreds of drivers, and they know that it’s wrong for Lyft and Uber executives to make millions while drivers can’t afford healthcare,” said Stan De La Cruz, a member of the Washington group. In Los Angeles, organizers called for “apps off” for 24 hours starting at midnight (0700 GMT) and a series of protests at Los Angeles International Airport. IPO in the wings Uber is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) this week at an estimated valuation of some $90 billion, including its options and restricted stock unit. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in hundreds of cities around the world. The move follows a troubled market debut for Uber’s largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15 percent of its value since its March IPO. The strikes highlight the dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Uber’s rideshare “take rate” increased slightly to 21.7 percent in 2018 but that this will remain a hot point of contention for Uber. “We do see added risk from Uber aiming to take greater share of the fare from drivers and expect that the more Uber pushes here, the more drivers will fight back and protest, increasing the likelihood of regulations (particularly at the state level in the US and in Europe) of minimum wage guarantees,” Ives said in a research note. Uber said in a statement: “Drivers are at the heart of our service — we can’t succeed without them — and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.” Lyft drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the past two years and surpassed $10 billion, the company said in a statement. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs,” Lyft said. “On average, Lyft drivers earn over $20 per hour.” Both Lyft and Uber set aside some of their shares for drivers as part of their offerings."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/259101/govt-fines-grab-uber-p16m-causing-undue-difficulties-merger-review","title":"Gov’t fines Grab, Uber P16M for ‘causing undue difficulties’ on merger review","date":"04:44 PM October 17, 2018","snippet":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal.","body":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal. Top officials of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said Wednesday that the violations of these companies have made the review process unnecessarily difficult, despite clear orders against such actions.  Grab Philippines, now the largest transport network company in the country, would shoulder bulk of the fine. On the other hand, Uber would also be asked to pay despite having left the country already. The issue stems from a regional takeover deal earlier this year, wherein Grab acquired Uber’s operations here in Southeast Asia.  PCC previously flagged this, launching a review amid concerns that the deal might come at the expense of the ride-hailing public. “The fines are imposed for causing undue difficulties on the PCC review and decision making process,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo in a press briefing.  While the review was later set aside after Grab committed to make certain changes in its operations, the violations nevertheless still “prejudiced” the review process, according to Quimbo. These promised changes — called voluntary commitments — are currently being monitored. A violation could lead to more fines and even an unwinding of the deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments, she said. Broken down, both companies are collectively fined P4 million for failure to keep their businesses separate. Grab, for its part, has been penalized to pay P8 million for failure to maintain pre-merger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives, and service quality. Uber, as the acquired party, was fined P4 million or half of Grab’s fine for the same set of violations.  The company was given a reduced penalty since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered it to stop operations, despite PCC’s interim measures. Nevertheless, Uber was still fined because it was not entirely helpless in the LTFRB’s case. According to PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe, the company could have filed for a motion of reconsideration “if they were really keen on complying with the PCC order.” /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/198920/uber-deal-seen-boosting-pldt-e-commerce-concern","title":"Uber deal seen boosting PLDT e-commerce concern","date":"05:33 AM September 11, 2015","snippet":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., revealing details of its long-term strategy with ride-sharing app Uber, said it aimed to bolster its e-commerce business through the new payment methods for Uber users.","body":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., revealing details of its long-term strategy with ride-sharing app Uber, said it aimed to bolster its e-commerce business through the new payment methods for Uber users. At present, Uber transactions in the Philippines are made through credit cards, which cover between 3 and 4 percent of the country’s total population of about 100 million people.  The agreement with PLDT enables Uber passengers to pay their fares using PLDT’s Smart e-money platform and their ATM cards, Ernesto Alberto, PLDT executive vice-president and ePLDT president, said in a briefing. Alberto said the Smart e-money platform had about two million users while ATM holders in the Philippines number between 22 million and 24 million people.  “We are working on the Smart money as well as ATMs. This is the natural progression in terms of expanding the footprint,” he said. He did not comment on the timing but added that the two platforms would expand the base to about 20 to 25 percent of the population.  Uber itself is looking at other payment options in the Philippines, including cash-based transactions, said Mike Brown, Uber regional general manager, Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand. Cash payments would allow Uber to compete with rivals GrabCar and regular taxi services more broadly. “We recently rolled out cash in Vietnam as a payment option with excellent results,” Brown said.

The VCA on Wednesday said it had completed an investigation into the acquisition and transferred its conclusions to the Vietnam Competition Council for consideration.  The investigation found that Grab did not notify its purchase of Uber to market regulators and the deal could make Vietnamese taxi companies vulnerable due to a smaller market shares and changes in customer habits. The two violations are stated in sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 5 of the Competition Law.  The VCA added that within 30 days from receiving the documents, the council could make one of two decisions: returning the file for additional investigation (within 60 days) or suspending the case and open a hearing to issue a decision on the handling of the case. Grab announced on March 26 it had purchased Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.  Following the merger, Uber now holds a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, while Uber’s CEO has joined Grab’s management board. The VCA has sent a dispatch to Grab requesting information and documents related to the acquisition. However, Grab claimed that since the combined market share of both Grab and Uber in Vietnam was less than 30 percent, it did not have to inform the competition authority before proceeding and completing this transaction in Vietnam. The VCA held a working session with Grab’s legal representative on April 6, but the firm failed to provide evidence proving its claim. Grab is one of the most frequently used O2O (online-to-offline) mobile platforms across 195 cities in Southeast Asia. More than five million people use the combined platform daily. If the concentrated share of parties accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the market without informing the VCA before an acquisition, firms would be fined 10 per cent of their total revenue from the previous financial year.

The announcement was made by Cat Avelino, Uber Philippines head of communications, on Friday as the company celebrated its fourth year of operations in the country.  The company, the local unit of San Francisco, United States-based Uber Technologies, currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, where it competes with main rival Grab. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines head of government relations and public policy, said there was growing demand in Pampanga, especially around the Clark Freeport Zone.  The Duterte administration has emphasized the development of Clark, which it sees as a solution to Metro Manila’s congestion woes. The Department of Transportation is currently expanding the Clark International Airport. It is also targeting to build a railway line linking Clark to Manila by 2022. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) earlier announced that the processing of driver applications would start on March 5. The moratorium was ordered since the LTFRB wanted a closer look at the ridesharing industry. It had been in place since July 2016.  Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) was capped at 65,000 for Metro Manila. Metro Cebu would get 1,500 cars while Pampanga was allowed 250 cars. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, who was present during the anniversary celebration, said the 65,000 cap in Metro Manila was enough to serve about 75 percent of the demand. She said there were currently around 59,000 ridesharing vehicles in the capital district serving around 52 percent of available demand. The cap would be reviewed every three months, Lizada noted. “We want to see the churn rate, we want to see the blacklisting of drivers,” Lizada said when asked about factors the LTFRB would review. For riders booking either Grab or Uber, the optimal waiting time should be two to three minutes instead of the current 10 to 15 minutes, she said. This will also be considered in the LTFRB’s regular review, she said.

In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following the announcement that Uber would be stopping its Philippine operations. ‘Due to lack of drivers’  Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu maintained, however, that his company was not taking advantage of the situation, saying the price surge was due to the lack of drivers. According to Cu, while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in Grab’s system rose only by around 30 percent.  Cu also pointed out that Uber’s fare was lower compared to Grab’s because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was P5 while theirs was P11. In fact, had Uber’s pending fare hike petition been approved, it would be charging P12 per kilometer, making the two TNCs’ fare rates almost the same, he added. Three other TNCs are seeking accreditation from the LTFRB: Lag Go, Hype and Owto. LTFRB, PCC at odds Meanwhile, the LTFRB has ordered Uber to stop operations in the country by April 16, a directive that contradicted that of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).  “In the interest of all TNVS and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” Lizada said in the board meeting. The LTFRB order came just days after the PCC directed Uber and Grab to continue operating separately in the country pending its motu propio review of the deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. The PCC had expressed concern that the deal would give Grab a monopoly of the ride-hailing industry in the country. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the LTFRB that while they intended to withdraw their pending petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC in preparation for halting their operations in the country, the PCC order prevented them from doing so. Lizada said that while the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would affect the riding public and thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. Just for compliance “The soonest possible time that you will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she told the Uber representative. Earlier, Cu said that in line with their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to continue funding the operations of the Uber app until April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. The app was initially scheduled to go offline starting on April 9. He noted, however, that their action not only defeated the purpose of the PCC order but also placed the riding public in danger since Uber no longer  has any back-end support in the country to address complaints and look after passengers in the event of a road crash."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/105969/grab-uber-cant-violate-rules-no-one-can-follow","title":"Grab, Uber can’t violate rules no one can follow","date":"05:30 AM July 31, 2017","snippet":"JAKARTA — “We cannot have one rule regarding colorum for [Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS)] and another rule for… bus, UV express, taxi and PUJ,” declared Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chair Martin Delgra III.

But how can Grab and Uber be punished over rules that are impossible to follow? In 2015, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez legalized TNVS, the drivers or contractors and the apps that dispatch them. In July 2016, the LTFRB suddenly suspended processing of TNVS certificates of public convenience (CPCs). This was “pending review of existing policies.”  The “review” was so thorough that the halt was indefinite and still in effect today, a year later. Grab and Uber are legal, but drivers are not—and have no way to be. TNVS CPCs are valid for one year and expired during the “review.” Thus, last July 11, Grab and Uber each paid a P5 million fine.  Given this chaos, how can one name a driver without a CPC a lawbreaker — LTFRB precisely refused to process them! This recalls the “no plate, no travel” policy right before Easter weekend in 2015, when many plates were not yet released (“Is LTO’s ‘no plate, no travel’ rule unconstitutional?” 4/6/15).  First, consider due process. A law must be implemented justly and fairly. LTFRB cannot revoke TNVS CPCs through a vague, indefinite suspension. The public cannot even challenge a repeal never announced. And LTFRB confiscates people’s jobs or means of transport without due process. I had a memorable conversation one Uber ride from Ortigas to the Mall of Asia. I rode with a security guard who got a car loan and drove for Uber. He worked even longer hours to pay off the loan, but was proud to finally own his business. The LTFRB violates due process and basic fairness by suddenly depriving the  former guard of livelihood, leaving him unable to pay his loan. Even arbitrary interference with business models violates due process. Why ban surge pricing when taxi drivers demand extra fares? Why set minimum hours for drivers and destroy the ride-sharing concept?  This is not abstract philosophy. In the 2009 White Light case, our Supreme Court struck down a Manila ordinance prohibiting motel room rentals for less than 12 hours, to discourage “short time.” It decried a measure that “needlessly restrains the operation of the businesses of the petitioners as well as restricting the rights of their patrons without sufficient justification.” Second, consider our Constitution’s principles. Art. II, Sec. 20: “The State recognizes the indispensable role of the private sector, encourages private enterprise and provides incentives to needed investments.” Art. XIV, Sec. 12: “The State shall regulate the transfer and promote the adaptation of technology from all sources for the national benefit. It shall encourage the widest participation of private groups, local governments and community-based organizations in the generation and utilization of science and technology.” Art. XII, Sec. 6: “The use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good.” The LTFRB swore to uphold each line, written in the blood of patriots. Third, consider the economics of regulation. We cannot have laws for the sake of having them. As I wrote in “Uber: clash of law vs common sense” (11/14/15), the apps deliver accident-free, mugging-free, hygienic and odorless service without regulation. Clearly, LTFRB regulation has negative economic value. We must abolish the LTFRB, not the apps. The lesson is to never believe that law must halt the march of science or undermine common sense. Fortunately, it is no longer up to the LTFRB’s erratic style. Sen. Grace Poe, Senate committee on public services chair, has called for formal legislation on TNVS and will hold a hearing on Aug. 3. Poe might have a fourth mindset: Laws, like technology, evolve. Recall the movie “With Honors”: “The beauty of the Constitution is that it makes no set law other than faith in the wisdom of ordinary people to govern themselves.” React: oscarfranklin.tan@yahoo.com.ph, Twitter @oscarfbtan, facebook.com/OscarFranklinTan."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/197481/bir-looking-into-tax-compliance-of-uber-drivers","title":"BIR looking into tax compliance of Uber drivers","date":"07:51 PM August 19, 2015","snippet":"The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has started discussing with transport authorities ways to better track tax payments of transportation network companies or TNCs like Uber and their drivers, Commissioner Kim S.
