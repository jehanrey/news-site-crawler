The victim, Carla Antasuda, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in Quezon City on April 2, Police Major Elmer Monsalve of Quezon City Police District Crime and Detection Unit said over Teleradyo. Reports said Antasuda booked a ride through the ride-hailing app Grab past 11 p.m. at UP Techno Hub on April 1, to bring her home in Pasig City. She was able to book a Toyota Innova with plate number NDA-3563, driven by the suspect John Lester Alhambra.  The vehicle that arrived to pick her up, however, was a Mitsubishi Montero but with the same driver indicated on the app. Antasuda got inside the vehicle anyway, without knowing that another person, identified as Bryan Kennet Yumol, was hiding at the back.  The suspects later declared a holdup, but the victim resisted. She was stabbed several times and her body was thrown in a vacant lot in Barangay Sauyo, Novaliches, Quezon City. The victim’s remains were found at noon the next day. The two suspects were arrested later at night at the Sauyo Flea Market. Monsalve said that the Grab app was secure but some people find ways to take advantage. “Napaka-secure niyan. Kaya lang wala naman system na perfect. Nasa tao pa rin ang problema hindi sa platform. Ang problema mismo yung driver,” he said. (The app is secure, but no system is perfect. The problem is with the people, not the platform. The problem is with the driver.)  The police official suggested the riders to share their location to their family and friends through the Grab-tracking locator for their own safety. Alhambra and Yumol are now detained and facing charges of robbery with homicide.

It would take some time, however, before customers get any compensation under what is called the “disgorgement mechanism,” the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said in a press briefing on Monday.  Essentially a state-mandated refund, the disgorgement will have a lag time of about two months after the PCC issues its order, assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration. Grab riders will see the overcharges refunded in their GrabPay accounts.  Investopedia defines disgorgement as an act of repayment for an ill-gotten gain, but this jargon can barely capture how many riders feel whenever faced by the daily dilemma of choosing either Grab’s unreasonably high prices or the poorly managed and outdated modes of public transportation. “That’s the concept of the disgorgement. It is something that is not due you but you obtained, and it is really because you are exercising market power,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  The PCC ruled on the refund of overcharges more than a year after Grab bought out Uber in Southeast Asia. Uber, however, is a minority shareholder in Grab. “So if you were not dominant, if you were not a monopoly, you should not have been able to impose this kind of excessive fare,” Bernabe added. The disgorgement forms part of a revised set of government conditions that the PCC had to renegotiate with Grab starting August, after the company’s operations remained problematic despite PCC’s earlier efforts to curb its anticompetitive behavior. August also marked the first year of Grab’s voluntary commitments to the PCC, in which the company’s operations were monitored for four consecutive quarters. Only the results of the monitoring for the first nine months were released so far, and the PCC said it fined Grab a total of P23.45 million for essentially overcharging its riders during this time.  But a little more than P5 million of this amount would be refunded to Grab riders, since the conditions imposed on the company were revised late into the monitoring period. Assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration, customers can use their refunds sometime in January next year, since the order was only issued this November. But the money will only be paid back as fast as Grab is willing to cooperate. So far, Grab Philippines has filed motions to reconsider the fines in the first six months of supervision, although the antitrust body has upheld the fines. Asked for comment, the company said it would now pay accordingly for the penalties imposed by the PCC so far. This means payment of P11.3 million in fine for Aug. 10, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018, and P7.1 million for Nov. 11, 2018, to Feb. 10, 2019; and P5.05 million in refund for Feb. 11 to May 10. Results of the fourth quarter monitoring—covering May 11 to August—have yet to be released. The fines declined over the months that the PCC monitored Grab, suggesting a disconnect between its compliance with the antitrust body and the improvement many riders hardly felt. A violation could lead to a fine of up to P2 million per breach, a separate fine from the refund that Grab should give back to its customers, the PCC said. The revised commitments for pricing will extend for one more year starting this month. Other conditions, such as those allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing apps, will be extended for four years. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); All this is in an effort to enable a viable player to enter the market and compete with Grab. There are other players in the market, but PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan has noted that Grab Philippines still controls “almost 99 percent” of the market. According to Bernabe, the PCC needs to give new companies more time to grow, since the entry of a big player does not necessarily mean a big enough competitor. Gojek, for example, has gained only 15 percent of the market in Singapore within a year, despite pouring a lot of resources into the market, Bernabe said. The company is trying to enter the Philippines but has been set back by government regulations. “We have observed that the competition in the marketplace has not really improved. And we don’t know if this will improve within a one-year period because the competition will depend on new entrants coming in or existing players growing bigger,” Bernabe said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/285726/grab-must-return-p14m-to-riders-pay-p2-m-fine","title":"Grab must return P14M to riders, pay P2-M fine","date":"05:30 AM December 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year. Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1243610/grab-food-grab-express-resume-services","title":"Grab Food, Grab Express resume services","date":"02:48 PM March 17, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon. “Upon careful assessment of the situation on ground and after discussing with our regulators, we have resumed GrabFood and GrabExpress operations as of 1:30pm today, March 17, with skeletal delivery-fleet,” Grab country representative Brian Cu said in a statement.

Uber, however, is a minority shareholder in Grab. “So if you were not dominant, if you were not a monopoly, you should not have been able to impose this kind of excessive fare,” Bernabe added. The disgorgement forms part of a revised set of government conditions that the PCC had to renegotiate with Grab starting August, after the company’s operations remained problematic despite PCC’s earlier efforts to curb its anticompetitive behavior. August also marked the first year of Grab’s voluntary commitments to the PCC, in which the company’s operations were monitored for four consecutive quarters. Only the results of the monitoring for the first nine months were released so far, and the PCC said it fined Grab a total of P23.45 million for essentially overcharging its riders during this time.  But a little more than P5 million of this amount would be refunded to Grab riders, since the conditions imposed on the company were revised late into the monitoring period. Assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration, customers can use their refunds sometime in January next year, since the order was only issued this November. But the money will only be paid back as fast as Grab is willing to cooperate. So far, Grab Philippines has filed motions to reconsider the fines in the first six months of supervision, although the antitrust body has upheld the fines. Asked for comment, the company said it would now pay accordingly for the penalties imposed by the PCC so far. This means payment of P11.3 million in fine for Aug. 10, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018, and P7.1 million for Nov. 11, 2018, to Feb. 10, 2019; and P5.05 million in refund for Feb. 11 to May 10. Results of the fourth quarter monitoring—covering May 11 to August—have yet to be released. The fines declined over the months that the PCC monitored Grab, suggesting a disconnect between its compliance with the antitrust body and the improvement many riders hardly felt. A violation could lead to a fine of up to P2 million per breach, a separate fine from the refund that Grab should give back to its customers, the PCC said. The revised commitments for pricing will extend for one more year starting this month. Other conditions, such as those allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing apps, will be extended for four years. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); All this is in an effort to enable a viable player to enter the market and compete with Grab. There are other players in the market, but PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan has noted that Grab Philippines still controls “almost 99 percent” of the market. According to Bernabe, the PCC needs to give new companies more time to grow, since the entry of a big player does not necessarily mean a big enough competitor. Gojek, for example, has gained only 15 percent of the market in Singapore within a year, despite pouring a lot of resources into the market, Bernabe said. The company is trying to enter the Philippines but has been set back by government regulations. “We have observed that the competition in the marketplace has not really improved. And we don’t know if this will improve within a one-year period because the competition will depend on new entrants coming in or existing players growing bigger,” Bernabe said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/285726/grab-must-return-p14m-to-riders-pay-p2-m-fine","title":"Grab must return P14M to riders, pay P2-M fine","date":"05:30 AM December 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Wednesday ordered the ride-hailing monopoly Grab Philippines to return around P14 million in overcharges to its customers and to pay a fine of P2 million for too many driver-initiated ride cancellations this year. Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1243610/grab-food-grab-express-resume-services","title":"Grab Food, Grab Express resume services","date":"02:48 PM March 17, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon. “Upon careful assessment of the situation on ground and after discussing with our regulators, we have resumed GrabFood and GrabExpress operations as of 1:30pm today, March 17, with skeletal delivery-fleet,” Grab country representative Brian Cu said in a statement.

It would take some time, however, before customers get any compensation under what is called the “disgorgement mechanism,” the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said in a press briefing on Monday.  Essentially a state-mandated refund, the disgorgement will have a lag time of about two months after the PCC issues its order, assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration. Grab riders will see the overcharges refunded in their GrabPay accounts.  Investopedia defines disgorgement as an act of repayment for an ill-gotten gain, but this jargon can barely capture how many riders feel whenever faced by the daily dilemma of choosing either Grab’s unreasonably high prices or the poorly managed and outdated modes of public transportation. “That’s the concept of the disgorgement. It is something that is not due you but you obtained, and it is really because you are exercising market power,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  The PCC ruled on the refund of overcharges more than a year after Grab bought out Uber in Southeast Asia. Uber, however, is a minority shareholder in Grab. “So if you were not dominant, if you were not a monopoly, you should not have been able to impose this kind of excessive fare,” Bernabe added. The disgorgement forms part of a revised set of government conditions that the PCC had to renegotiate with Grab starting August, after the company’s operations remained problematic despite PCC’s earlier efforts to curb its anticompetitive behavior. August also marked the first year of Grab’s voluntary commitments to the PCC, in which the company’s operations were monitored for four consecutive quarters. Only the results of the monitoring for the first nine months were released so far, and the PCC said it fined Grab a total of P23.45 million for essentially overcharging its riders during this time.  But a little more than P5 million of this amount would be refunded to Grab riders, since the conditions imposed on the company were revised late into the monitoring period. Assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration, customers can use their refunds sometime in January next year, since the order was only issued this November. But the money will only be paid back as fast as Grab is willing to cooperate. So far, Grab Philippines has filed motions to reconsider the fines in the first six months of supervision, although the antitrust body has upheld the fines. Asked for comment, the company said it would now pay accordingly for the penalties imposed by the PCC so far. This means payment of P11.3 million in fine for Aug. 10, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018, and P7.1 million for Nov. 11, 2018, to Feb. 10, 2019; and P5.05 million in refund for Feb. 11 to May 10. Results of the fourth quarter monitoring—covering May 11 to August—have yet to be released. The fines declined over the months that the PCC monitored Grab, suggesting a disconnect between its compliance with the antitrust body and the improvement many riders hardly felt. A violation could lead to a fine of up to P2 million per breach, a separate fine from the refund that Grab should give back to its customers, the PCC said. The revised commitments for pricing will extend for one more year starting this month.

The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

As we become the everyday app, we continue our commitment to bring more consumers to their destinations faster, safer and more reliable,” Cu added.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1243610/grab-food-grab-express-resume-services","title":"Grab Food, Grab Express resume services","date":"02:48 PM March 17, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines resumed on Tuesday its delivery services but will operate with a minimum number of drivers amid the imposition of enhanced community quarantine on Luzon. “Upon careful assessment of the situation on ground and after discussing with our regulators, we have resumed GrabFood and GrabExpress operations as of 1:30pm today, March 17, with skeletal delivery-fleet,” Grab country representative Brian Cu said in a statement.

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

Grab’s surge pricing during the morning rush hour on Monday shocked a number of commuters, who were forced to look for other means of transportation just to get to work.  One of them was Joyce Yu who opted to take the bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip that usually costs her up to P250 only. Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares, which range from P300 to P600. A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set back riders by almost P300, when hours earlier the same trip only cost around P150.  Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times, while the government processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. Grab government communications manager Fiona Nicolas said that while they have already implemented the new surge rate that the LTFRB imposed, fares may remain high in in the interim because of the limited number of drivers that are currently in their system.  “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its former rival’s Southeast Asian operations. This was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive to Uber to cease its operations as a TNC, despite an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue to serve the public for the duration of the motu propio review on the deal. To protect the public from Grab’s exorbitant fares, the National Center for Commuters Safety and Protection called on the LTFRB to expedite its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto to provide the riding public an alternative.  “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” the group’s head Maricor Akol said.

Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that.

When consulted about the filing of cases against Saquilayan, Shahzad said they were still waiting for their lawyer’s advice.  He also confirmed that he accompanied Norial to Camp Crame for the clarificatory questioning by the IAS pre-charge investigator. On Oct. 7, Norial picked up her passenger from a coffee shop in Barangay Ususan, Taguig when she was being blocked by the car of Saquilayan, who was parking his car while waiting for his daughter who was buying food at the establishment. Norial needed to leave the driveway to go to her next destination, so she approached Saquilayan to ask him to leave the driveway but to no avail. At one point, Norial said the police officer hit her with his car door. Saquilayan, meanwhile, said it was Norial who assaulted him. Saquilayan arrested Norial on the spot and called for other police officers to bring the Grab driver to a nearby police station. Saquilayan filed alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority case against Norial. After almost a week, Norial was released for posting P3,000 bail after the Taguig Prosecutor’s Office decided to charge Norial with unjust vexation. The prosecutor said it did not find probable cause to charge Norial with alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority.

Under the new safety measures that Grab will impose once it resumes its operations, drivers must disinfect their vehicles after every trip, while payment for each trip will only be cashless.  These initiatives, Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said, put an “added cost for the drivers.” Grab proposed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to a P5 per-trip fee to passengers “to help cover sanitation measures for the drivers.”  “We made a proposal to raise the per-trip cost by a fixed amount to help cover these. However, there’s no decision out yet,” Cu told reporters in an online media forum on Thursday. “I believe it is around P5 per trip that will help cover sanitation measures for the drivers,” Cu added.  While there is no decision yet on their proposal, additional costs are mainly shouldered by the drivers and the firm itself, Cu pointed out, and there will be no adjustments to the rates. The firm assured the fees will go directly to drivers. Grab said it will still abide by the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for transport network vehicle services (TNVS). “So far, there is no adjustment in the fare. We will be following the standard fare matrix of the LTFRB. We haven’t made any requests to the LTFRB to raise rates,” Cu said. The ride-hailing firm will also lower its surge cap than that mandated by the LTFRB.  Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. Under the lockdown, mass public transport, including TNVS services, were suspended. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

Automotive journalist James Deakin earlier posted on Facebook his concern about a Grab partner-driver who apparently asked him to double his fare.  Some drivers, Deakin said, even presented a message which indicated that Grab authorized the “x2 fare” if the route reaches outside Metro Manila. Grab Country Head Brian Cu said the message was a hoax.  “No that’s false. The message is not endorsed by Grab, it was probably crafted by a partner driver and shared among other drivers,” he said in a press conference in Quezon City. “Ang rule natin kung ano ‘yung fare, that’s it. Walang dagdag, walang bawas [Our rule is that what the fare indicates, that’s it. No more, no less],” he stressed.  In his post, Deakin said the practice has to stop, as he called on the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to look into it. “This has got to stop. I’m currently working on an idea now that will take about a week to pump out. I really, really, really hope that the LTFRB will support it,” he wrote. “But in the meantime, while that’s cooking, I plead with the drivers who are taking advantage of the situation, don’t be so short sighted. Don’t ruin it for those who are trying to do the right thing,” he added. /jpv (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.12';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283620/antitrust-body-fines-grab-p23m-orders-p5-m-refund-to-riders","title":"Antitrust body fines Grab P23M, orders P5-M refund to riders","date":"02:51 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments. “The PCC has imposed a total fine of P23.45 million on Grab for breaching its pricing commitments during the 1st to 3rd quarters of the initial undertaking,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan said Monday.  Balisacan said the fine covers P11.3 million in penalties during the first quarter, P7.1 million for the second quarter, and P5.05 million for the third quarter. “To kick off the refund system, the disgorgement mechanism shall be applied on the third quarter fine, with Grab being ordered to refund P5.05 million to affected riders,” Balisacan said.  INQUIRER.net has sought for Grab Philippines’ comment about the PCC’s order, but it has yet to reply as of this writing. Earlier this year, Grab was also fined P6.5 million with PCC citing inconsistencies in Grab’s data about its pricing.

Balisacan said drivers now have the choice to operate with any transport network companies (TNCs) and will not be tied to Grab “by way of any agreement, policy or incentive.” Grab, Balisacan said, must also improve passenger experience by setting standards for completion rates of drivers. For transparency, Balisacan said the company must also put in place a system-wide average fare cap to limit Grab’s ability “to unreasonably increase fares beyond pre-transaction levels.”  “While Grab’s commitments signal its willingness to behave within a competitive space and in accordance with the competition law, the PCC will keep a watchful eye on potential violations,” Balisacan said.

It all started when Reddit user sabinijo detailed her frustrating experience in booking a ride through the Grab app last Monday, April 16.  Despite the driver being only two minutes away, the car wasn’t budging to pick her up. Eventually, she booked through her sister’s app and was able to get a ride. She still hadn’t cancelled the first booking and in the vehicle, she asked the driver if there was something wrong with the app.  “Lagi naman nagloloko si Grab (Grab always messes up),” replied the driver who used to work with Uber. “Mas maayos Uber (Uber is more organized).” When she recounted that her first driver did not move from his spot despite trying to contact him, she was told not to cancel the ride.  “Ay naku Ma’am, beterano yan! Naghihintay yan na kayo mag-cancel! Wag n’yong i-cancel Ma’am, bayaan nyo sya. Strikto Grab sa mga nagka-cancel,” was the driver’s advice. (Ma’am, he’s a veteran! He’s waiting for you to cancel! Don’t cancel it Ma’am, let him be. Grab is strict about those who cancel.) Finally, after more than 30 minutes, she noticed the car moving and that the ride had been cancelled. “Buti nga sa kanya! Maghapon nya nang babawiin yung rating nya; madaming ganyan na beterano na nananamantala!” noted the driver. (Good for him! He’ll have to recover his rating the whole afternoon; there are many veterans who take advantage.)  In an INQUIRER report, Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, said that the system can detect if a driver is stalling to cancel a trip. He explained that after an investigation, offending drivers face suspension or removal from the platform. Drivers’ woes The driver had his own troubles to share on what made working with the platform difficult. According to him, “incentives are lower” and “riders are harder to find” compared to his stint with Uber. He said before picking her up, it took him 15 minutes to get a passenger. He attributes this to people’s lack of interest in Grab’s service. He also cited that for him, the app is problematic as it takes a longer time to load the fare. Money woes plague him, said the driver: “Grab takes a bigger cut, and he has to constantly make sure his G-cash has credit because Grab immediately gets its take and if he runs out of credit, he can’t get riders.” Angelica (full name withheld upon request), a 23-year-old who works for a local media outlet, tells INQUIRER.net a driver told her that compensation was an issue for them. During her April 17 ride, she was told that Grab promos, which can deduct about P40 to P60 a ride, are not shouldered by the company. Like the previous driver, he felt that Grab takes too high a percentage. Despite customer complaints that the ride service is too pricey, he felt that they weren’t charging enough. READ: Grab PH admits failure to inform riders of P2-per-minute charge He also preferred to be paid in cash rather than card “so he can actually keep some of his earnings.” The company allegedly owes him P17,000 of his cut. And if customers feel neglected by the company’s customer support, so do drivers. He has experienced “unruly customers who don’t pay” but was not assisted by Grab on the matter. Earlier that day, his passengers did not pay the exact amount and he felt it futile to report it because “Grab barely responds.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Riders prefer Uber On the Reddit thread, users of both Uber and Grab said they had also experienced the hassle of forced cancellations. However, some said they still preferred Uber’s service, despite the app shutting down this week. “Uber has a better quality of drivers IMO (in my opinion), payment is quicker and I don’t have to pay for the toll (bring out cash),” said ygipaez. For baconcheesus, the best Grab drivers were former Uber drivers. “Sila yung matitino (They’re the decent ones).” Prodigaldaughterph observed that Grab only responded when a complaint was posted on social media. The original Reddit poster, sabinijo, said the customer support of both ride-hailing apps was disappointing but her issues with Uber were always resolved with refunds. She has since deleted the Grab app from her phone but has kept Uber’s in the event of “some miracle of sorts.” Angelica says she’ll keep using the service because there is “no other option when the car I drive is coding.” She adds, “But I’ve been trying to ride the bus as an alternative since I don’t trust the MRT.” JB RELATED STORIES: (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1208559/grab-users-dismayed-by-measly-refund","title":"Grab users dismayed by measly refund","date":"05:48 AM January 03, 2020","snippet":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated.","body":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated. In the past year, he had used the app almost every day. He estimates that he has spent thousands of pesos on the premium hailing service for a faster commute in Metro Manila.  But on New Year’s Eve, he was surprised to see a refund of only P27 split in three tranches: P15, P9 and P3. “It was frustrating,” he said. “Obviously I had spent much more than what I got.”  He’s not the only one. Millions of Grab passengers on Tuesday had also received almost the same amount, as Grab rolled out the P19.4-million penalty imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for charging beyond the acceptable fare-in-range during two separate monitoring periods. Each peso a user received stands for every P1,200 (for those who used the app in February-May) or P400 (May-August) he spent on the app.  PJ’s P27 rebate means he spent anywhere between P10,800 and P32,400 for the ride-hailing service. Beyond that, however, Commuters of the Philippines founder Julius Dalay said the recent rebate rollout was symptomatic of the government’s lax regulation of transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab, leaving passengers vulnerable to overcharging fares. While Grab maintains that it abides by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)’s fare matrix, the variables in the fare (P2-minute travel fee and surge rate) means it sometimes go beyond the acceptable fare-in-range set by the PCC. “This is more a symptom of regulation not being strengthened,” Dalay said in an interview. “Both the LTFRB and the PCC need to coordinate and put in place a system where they can better monitor if Grab is overcharging its passengers.” The LTFRB earlier launched an initial investigation into Grab’s alleged price-gouging practices and found that a large number of the complaints it filtered were not instances of overcharging, but the result of severe traffic doubling the time rate of the fare matrix.  A large part of this is the surge component, which is computed by adding time and distance and multiplying it to up to 2x. Grab uses an estimated travel time to compute its fares upfront, which could make other fares seem like “overcharging.” The two sample fare breakdowns shown by the LTFRB to reporters illustrated as much. In one of the sample fares that cost P478, covering 12 kilometers under 49 minutes, Grab had “overcomputed” the distance rate at P187.80 (P12x15 should have been P180) and the time rate at P122 (P49x2 should have been P98), but had adjusted the surge rate by P181. Another trip that cost P439, which took 43 minutes covering 10 km “undercomputed” its time rate: P62 (should have been P86). It then “overcomputed” its distance rate by P1.20. It’s why the initial results are inconclusive, said LTFRB technical division chief Joel Bolanos. For the LTFRB to charge Grab of overcharging, it must have proof that the excess computations are systematic, not outliers. Dalay added that there was also an issue with the way the rebates were rolled out. Passengers have no way of knowing if the rebates matched their actual expense. “The way that the rebates were computed is not transparent. There’s no counterchecking. While Grab can claim they have a system in place, people should still have the capacity to know how the rebates was obtained,” he said. Moving forward, he also urged Grab and other TNCs to be more transparent with their fare breakdowns so commuters can verify for themselves if they are being overcharged. “This is not only for the benefit of the passengers but also for them. So that when the time comes and regulators again question discrepancies, they can easily pinpoint where overcharging has taken place,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/941377/good-samaritan-grab-driver-shot-dead-gerardo-maquidato-jr","title":"Good Samaritan Grab driver shot in back of his head by lone carjacker","date":"05:52 PM October 29, 2017","snippet":"A Grab driver who went viral months ago for helping out a sick passenger was killed by a gunman who pretended to be a passenger, bringing with him the victim’s car on his escape.","body":"A Grab driver who went viral months ago for helping out a sick passenger was killed by a gunman who pretended to be a passenger, bringing with him the victim’s car on his escape. Gerardo Maquidato Jr., lauded by the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) as one of its “best drivers,” was shot dead on Bonanza Street, Barangay 189, Don Carlos Village in Pasay City on Thursday evening by a lone assailant.  According a report by case investigator PO3 Henry Manong, Maquidato sustained a lone gunshot wound in the back of his head. The slug exited through his left eye. The silver Toyota Innova with conduction sticker YV 7109 was also carnapped by the suspect on his escape.  A witness told the police that he was on Bonanza Street, Don Carlos Village at 7:45 p.m. on Thursday when he spotted a parked Innova with a broken front passenger window. He thought it was a case of a parked vehicle being vandalized until he saw a man in a white shirt pull out the body of a bloodied man in the driver’s seat.  The man dumped the body on the pavement and drove away in the Innova. The incident was captured on a closed circuit television camera. Chief Insp. Rogelio Hernandez, chief of Pasay police investigation, said police were looking initially at carjacking as the motive. He said they were still waiting for Grab to forward to them the information of Maquidato’s last passenger and the other bookings he received on that day. In a statement, Grab said it mourned for the “needless and untimely death of one of our best driver-partners.” “Grab condemns this sensless murder and is alredy collaborating authorities to esnure that justice will be served and perpetrators will be put behind bars,” it added.  According to Grab, it has reported at least six confirmed incidents of carnapping perpetrated by criminals pretending to be legitimate passengers. It said it had started cooperating with Task Force Limbas of the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group. Fearing for the security of other drivers, Bryan Cu, Grab PH country head, said the firm’s officials were still in talks with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to implement a “know your customer” scheme for its riders. This includes asking passengers to take a photo of themselves with a government issued ID. He also said they were in plans to subsidize the cost of dashboard cameras of its drivers and put trackers on their cars. “Grab is doing what it can to support its Grab partner drivers and ensure safety on the road,” he said on his Facebook video. In October last year, Maquidato was recognized as one of its best drivers after he gave a free ride to a sick passenger. On her Facebook post, Divine Lactao Ornum said she booked a GrabCar for her sister Prima, who was on her way to Quezon City from Pasay to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato did not ask for any payment for the trip. The post went viral and the Grab driver was praised of more than 100,000 people. On Aug. 22 last year, Prima died of complications due to diabetes. But Maquidato’s kindness for the Ornum family was not forgotten. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); In another post on Friday, Ornum said Maquidato even volunteered his car to ferry attendees of Prima’s burial. During the awarding in October, Maquidato invited Ornum’s family to share his award with them. The driver even gave some of the freebies he received to Ornum’s relatives. Come Christmas last year, Maquidato went out of his way and returned to Ornum’s house and gave Christmas gifts to her children relatives since Grab had given him his bonus. Ornum also called for justice for Maquidato’s death and help be extended to his family. “Kuya Gerardo, may you rest in peace,” Ornum said. “I hope that you meet my sister [in heaven] where she can finally thank you.” /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/984925/grab-to-roll-out-feature-that-will-hide-passenger-destination-from-drivers","title":"Grab to roll out feature that will hide passenger destination from drivers","date":"04:40 PM April 24, 2018","snippet":"Starting April 27, some Grab drivers will no longer see passengers’ destination before accepting bookings, Grab Country Head Brian Cu announced on Tuesday.","body":"Starting April 27, some Grab drivers will no longer see passengers’ destination before accepting bookings, Grab Country Head Brian Cu announced on Tuesday.

Cu, however, maintained Grab’s position that the main reason for the difficulty in booking a ride is the lack of cars. “We want to vastly improve our services; hence, our consecutive decisions to sanction 500 errant drivers over the week, and now the non-showing of the passenger destination and the auto-accept feature,” Cu said.

The ride-hailing giant said on Thursday that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) should clarify if motorcycle taxis were now considered its competitors, after a former PCC commissioner said that barring the likes of Angkas would mean removing Grab’s “competition.” Grab was referring to Rep. Stella Quimbo, who earlier warned transport authorities that banning motorcycle taxis at the end of a pilot test meant that Grab would continue to monopolize the market.  This is an important distinction since the restrictions that currently bound the company—called voluntary commitments—are meant to keep it in check until a new and strong enough competitor emerges. “We cannot right away apply for release from voluntary commitments because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release,” Grab said.  These voluntary commitments result in penalties for Grab whenever it overcharges its passengers and prevents its drivers from working under other ride-hailing apps.

In a phone interview with INQUIRER.net, Taguig police chief Colonel Celso Rodriguez confirmed that Norial was released after posting bail for an unjust vexation case filed by Police Captain Ronald Saquilayan at the Taguig Prosecutor’s Office. “Yes, na-release na po [si Norial]. Yes, nag-post ng bail for unjust vexation,” he said when asked for clarification if Norial was indeed released from Ususan, Taguig police.  (Yes, she was released. Yes, she posted bail for unjust vexation.) Norial is facing a case for alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority after being accused of hitting Saquilayan, chief investigator of Pateros police.  In the Taguig prosecutor’s resolution shared by Norial’s boyfriend, Miguel Shahzad, the prosecutor’s office said it found no probable cause to indict Norial for the said cases. Instead, she was charged with unjust vexation. “However, this Office finds probable cause to charge her [Norial] with unjust vexation under Article 287 (2) of the Revised Penal Code,” read the resolution. After clarification, the prosecutor’s office set the bail at P3,000, not P1,800, contrary to Rodriguez’s earlier statement. The prosecutor did not charge alarm and scandal against Norial because she was acting against a particular person or complainant and “not against the public per se or public order.” Alarm and scandal complaints are applicable to “any disturbance or scandal in public places.” There was also no probable cause for complaint of direct assault because the act of Norial hitting the lawman “cannot be characterized as serious,” the prosecutor said.  “While complainant [Saquilayan] alleged that he was hit by respondent [Norial] on his head, the same cannot be characterized as ‘serious’ to come within the purview of the crime,” read the resolution. The case of disobedience against a person in authority was also dismissed because Saquilayan “was not in the exercise of his duties at that time.” In another Facebook post on Tuesday, Shahzad said Norial is currently regaining her strength after being detained for nearly seven days. “Nailabas na po namin siya [Norial] after almost 7 days. Pumayat sya lalo pero we will do our best na ibalik ang sigla nya,” read the post. (Norial has now been released after almost seven days. She got slimmer but we will do our best to regain her normal strength.) When questioned if Norial’s camp will file a countersuit against the police officer, Shahzhad said they would first focus on “regaining Norial’s strength.” An altercation between Norial and Saquilayan started when the Grab driver asked the lawman to move his car that was blocking the driveway at the coffee shop in Taguig on Oct. 6. Saquilayan said in his complaint that Norial was “unruly and resisted” his arrest. He arrested Norial and called Taguig Sub-Station 4 personnel to transport the Grab driver to the police station.

This as the Transportation Network Vehicle Services firm bared a new system that will protect its drivers against unreasonable cancellation of food orders or no-show customers.  During the online hearing of the House committee on trade and industry, Grab spokesperson Atty. Nicka Hosaka said the new scheme may be implemented around August this year. “Currently , ang majority ng ating users (the majority of our users and) with our merchants as well, what really happens is if the delivery partner goes to our restaurants to order on behalf of the consumer, then the delivery partner will advance the payment… In the face of no show, Grab will reimburse the delivery partner 100%,” Hosaka told lawmakers.  “Moving towards August, we will be implementing this model whereby pagdating sa restaurant (once a food couriers arrives at a restaurant), the delivery partner will not need to bring out any cash. He will simply pick up the order and the restaurant already receives the payment straight via the app,” Hosaka added. Once the food courier has picked up the order, the courier will just receive the payment from the customer once the food items have been delivered.  “Ito ngayon ay meron tayong mine-maintain na driver wallet na tinatawag natin. So kung ano ‘yung kokolektahin niya from the eater, ‘yun naman ang made-debit sa kanyang wallet,” Hosaka said. (Food couriers have what we call driver wallet. So, whatever they collect from the customer, it will be debited from their wallet.) In case a customer does not show up to pick up their order, nothing will be taken away from their “driver wallet,” which has a maintaining balance of P1,500 to P2,000. This, however, can be cashed out by their food couriers anytime, said Hosaka. Under House Bill No. 6958 or the Food and Grocery Delivery Services Protection Act, filed by Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Alfredo Garbin Jr., cancellation of confirmed orders when the items are already in the possession of the delivery rider or in transit to the customer will be prohibited. The bill covers “instances wherein customers order food and/or grocery items for the purpose of pranking or those who have no genuine intention of availing of the services which causes damage and undue duress to the delivery riders and their corresponding service providers.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/995545/grabs-minimum-fare-questioned","title":"Grab’s minimum fare questioned","date":"05:04 AM May 30, 2018","snippet":"Officials from ride-hailing giant Grab came prepared on Tuesday to ask the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to lift the suspension of its P2 per minute travel charge.","body":"Officials from ride-hailing giant Grab came prepared on Tuesday to ask the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to lift the suspension of its P2 per minute travel charge.

During the hearing, Grab strategy and special projects head Anton Bautista explained that the minimum fare rate would apply only if a passenger’s trip was shorter than 3 kilometers. The move was to ensure that Grab drivers were “still well-compensated” even if they made short trips, he said.  His explanation, however, did not sit well with a visibly surprised LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III who said that Grab did not inform the board about its minimum fare. He also expressed confusion over its pricing scheme. “We were not informed [about Grab implementing a minimum rate] … [It’s] only today that we understood that there is a distinction between the minimum fare and base fare,” Delgra told reporters after the hearing.  No mention of minimum fare Earlier, he scolded Grab officials for their petition to reinstate the P2 per minute travel charge, noting that it did not say anything about a minimum fare. Asked when the TNC started imposing it, Grab legal counsel Miguel Aguila replied that the minimum fare took effect on June 5, 2017. While the LTFRB did not order the TNC to suspend the additional charge, it directed Grab officials to revise their petition and include an explanation of how their rates were determined. The ride-hailing app, which has dominated the local industry since taking over Uber’s Southeast Asian operations, has repeatedly been accused by PBA party-list Rep. Jericho Nograles of charging “illegal fees.”  It was Nograles who exposed Grab’s minimum fare rates during the hearing, which was supposed to take up the TNC’s petition to have its P2 per minute travel charge reinstated. The LTFRB ordered the suspension of the travel charge in April pending a review of Grab’s fare structure. In an interview, Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said much of the confusion stemmed from a “mix-up” between the minimum and base fares. He explained that Grab’s base fare of P40 was similar to the “flagdown rate” being implemented by taxis. But the minimum fare, he said, was computed using the base fare, on top of the P10 to P14 per km charge, the disputed P2 per minute charge and a surge-pricing rate if required. “We’ve never tried to hide anything from the general public. We have always been upfront with our fares,” Gonzales added. Drivers’ plea Winson Esteras, the head of a transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers’ coalition, said the reimposition of the P2 per minute travel charge would allow them to cope with rising fuel prices and heavy traffic. Esteras claimed that TNVS drivers were losing at least P100 to P383 a day with the suspension of the travel charge. As a result, they were less inclined to go online — resulting in fewer vehicles on the road for booking requests, he said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But for Nograles, who was present during the hearing, the bigger jeopardy might be imminent suspension should the LTFRB determine that Grab unilaterally imposed these fees without informing the agency. “The conduct of the management of Grab directly affects the livelihood of the thousands of the drivers working with [it],” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978164/news-grab-uber-ride-sharing-southeast-asia-anthony-tan-internet","title":"Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia","date":"01:09 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"","body":" Private ride-hailing service Grab on Monday confirmed that it has acquired Uber’s operation in Southeast Asia.  In a statement, Grab said the deal was the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company,” which reflects the company’s leadership position in the region. “Grab is acquiring Uber’s rideshare and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia, and integrating them into Grab’s leading transportation and fintech platform,” the statement read.  Grab said Uber would take 27.5% stake in Grab, which it said was “reflective of the companies’ respective market shares.” “The acquisition accelerates Grab’s path to profitability in its core transport business, as it’s the most cost efficient Southeast Asian platform,” it said.  The acquisition, it said, “reflects Grab’s transport market leadership in Southeast Asia.” Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab said the acquisition of Uber “marks the beginning of a new era.” “We are humbled that a company born in SEA has built one of the largest platforms that millions of consumers use daily and provides income opportunities to over 5 million people. Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” Tan said. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region. Together with Uber, we are now in an even better position to fulfil our promise to serve our customers,” he added. Their trust in us as a transport brand allows us to look towards the next step as a company: improving people’s lives through food, payments and financial services.  Aside from Uber’s rideshare, Grab has also acquired Uber’s food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia. “Grab will also take over the Uber Eats operations to immediately become a major player in food delivery services,” it said. Grab said the GrabFood service would expand from two existing countries to all major Southeast Asian countries by next quarter. “This will be another great use case to drive continued adoption of the GrabPay mobile wallet and support Grab’s growing Financial Services platform,” it said. /cbb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1127264/ltfrb-to-grab-explain-8000-colorum-drivers","title":"LTFRB to Grab: Explain 8,000 ‘colorum’ drivers","date":"05:18 AM June 06, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered Grab to explain why 8,000 of its driver-partners failed to get accredited as transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered Grab to explain why 8,000 of its driver-partners failed to get accredited as transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. The transport board will hear the side of the ride-hailing app on June 11. Earlier this week, Grab announced that on June 10, it would remove from its platform the 8,000 drivers who failed to beat the June 7 deadline to secure a franchise.  “If a Grab driver’s profile shows you that [his] LTFRB number is still [being processed], it only means two things: Either [he] applied but has yet to be accredited, or [he] really didn’t apply,” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III told the Inquirer. “What we want to hear from Grab is how many drivers really failed to apply at all,” he said.  Adverse effects According to Grab, the deactivation of the 8,000 “colorum” but active drivers would trigger longer booking periods and higher price surges due to fewer available rides.  But Delgra noted that the number of active drivers was much lower than those who had been given accreditation. “So if you’re talking about service disruption … ideally, if all those who were accredited were online, they should be able to serve all the bookings,” he said. According to LTFRB data, 45,522 TNVS drivers currently have either a provisional authority or a certificate of public convenience, allowing them to operate legally. Because Grab does not have an employer-employee relationship with its driver-partners, those who will be removed from its platform will not get benefits or subsidies. Grab promised only to assist them in renewing their franchise once the LTFRB opens 10,000 new slots for TNVS drivers on June 10.  A labor group, on the other hand, expressed support for the thousands of affected drivers and asked the LTFRB to extend the deadline for the franchise application as well as trim down the number of requirements for applicants. In a statement, Defend Job Philippines said aspiring TNVS drivers need to submit at least 13 documents just to secure a franchise from LTFRB alone. “While we support government efforts to ensure [the] safety and convenience of TNVS commuters, we believe that it remains the state’s responsibility to also ensure the livelihood and source of income of thousands of TNVS partners and Grab drivers for the sake of their families and dependents,” said Christian Lloyd Magsoy, Defend Job Philippines spokesperson."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1330126/grab-extends-service-hours-in-ncr-cebu-pampanga","title":"Grab extends service hours in NCR, Cebu, Pampanga","date":"11:50 AM September 02, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting Wednesday, ride-hailing app Grab will be extending its service hours in Metro Manila, Cebu and Pampanga.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting Wednesday, ride-hailing app Grab will be extending its service hours in Metro Manila, Cebu and Pampanga.

A statement from SPD read that “the footage provided by a responsible citizen showed that the female Grab driver, Florence Norial, was the one who assaulted the customer, P/Capt. Ronald Saquilayan, assigned at Pateros MPS (Municipal Police Station) at around 7:20 PM on October 6, 2020.” SPD director Brig. Gen. Emmanuel Peralta said the Hyundai Accent carrying Norial was behind the vehicle of Saquilayan, who was waiting for his daughter buying at the coffee shop at the time of the incident.  “Miss Norial, wanting to get ahead, came out of her car and knock rudely on the window and told Saquilayan to move his vehicle,” SPD said in its statement. “The cop politely told her that he was also a customer, but Norial insisting ordered the security guard to force Saquilayan but was refused. Again Norial, shouting on top of her voice, knocked on the windows of the cop’s vehicle and told him to leave,” police claimed.  Police said Saquilayan then asked a security guard for help and introduced himself as a police captain to Norial, but she “continued to berate him.” “While returning to his car, Norial tried to shut his vehicle’s door and got budged by the door when finally opened by Saquilayan. Norial with her right hand hit Saquilayan in his head and ran towards the Starbucks store,” police added. Saquilayan then arrested Norial and called for assistance from Substation 4 personnel, according to SPD. SPD said the footage “tells the whole story contradicting all the crooked claims” of Norial that she was the one assaulted by the officer. “And worst she maliciously used social media by posting her own footage while narrating different storylines to malign the cop Saquilayan and the whole Substation 4 personnel,” it added.  However, Norial’s boyfriend Mirza Miguel Shahzad said in a Facebook post that the footage presented by the police is “misleading.” “Misleading ung audio, sa first vid you can see sinasabi wala pa raw 2min ung tagal ng park sa driveway pero it is on the 6min-mark of the first video. Also, sa part na natulak sya nung pinto ng Ford Ranger, niliko ung camera nung nagvivid. Kita nyo naman po nagheheadlights sya pero di po pinapansin,” he said. (The audio is misleading. In the first video, they say that it has not been two minutes since the vehicle was parked in the driveway but it is still there on the 6-minute mark. Also, on the part where she was pushed by the door of the Ford Ranger, the camera was slanted. You can see that she was using her headlights but she was not given attention.) He also posted a video of the incident from another angle, which he said shows Saquilayan “pushed Norial” first before she slapped the policeman. “Sa second video, kita na tinulak sya before sya nanampal. Sa pagtulak gamit ng pinto kaya may sugat sya sa left elbow. Hindi po sya mauunang manakit unlike sa claims po ng nasabing pulis,” he added. (In the second video, you can see she was pushed first before she slapped him. She was pushed through the door of the vehicle that’s why she had a wound in her left elbow. She didn’t attack first, unlike the claim of the policeman.) Norial remains detained as of this posting, pending the resolution of the Taguig City Prosecutor’s Office on her case. Shahzad questioned why there is no resolution released yet. In a press conference, Saquilayan denied that Norial was denied her rights when she was arrested and said that “she had all the time” to call a lawyer. Shahzad, however, narrated a different story. “Never po kami binigyan ng chance na magfile ng complaint sa umpisa, never din po kami binigyan ng abugado that night hanggang madaling araw,” he said.

Cindy Toh, Grab marketing head, said the company might start charging the cancellation fees before July as part of its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and rider experience after acquiring Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  Toh said the company was keen on protecting not just its riders but also its driver-partners. “Of course when passengers cancel, the driver you book is already en route to your location. They spend money on that; that’s time away from their business,” she said.  Uber charge Uber used to impose charges based on how far the driver had already traveled before the trip’s cancellation, or when a rider cancels more than one ride within a short period of time.  Despite public impression that drivers are more likely to cancel bookings, figures from Grab show that drivers back off their commitments only 8 percent of the time, compared with 12 percent by passengers, according to Toh. She said the company had yet to set the amounts to be charged, as it was still studying various schemes, adding that it would only impose fees “within the limits” of the waiting time—the time a passenger’s ride is supposed to show up at the pickup point. Standard waiting time Grab currently does not impose any penalty on passengers who cancel bookings within the standard waiting time of seven minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare. Passengers who cancel three bookings after the waiting period get “deprioritized,” which means they should expect to be served later than others in their succeeding bookings.  Grab currently allows its drivers to cancel 5 percent of their trips. Those who cancel more than 10 percent may face sanctions such as suspension or blacklisting from the platform, Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said. Some patrons of the ride-hailing service expressed concern that some drivers might exploit the cancellation fees. Twenty-two-year-old Julian Elona, who uses Grab often to get from Manila to Eastwood, Quezon City, said the ride-hailing company needed to first protect passengers from abusive drivers before implementing such a scheme. “It might get to a point that if the driver and passenger disagree [on their arrangement], the driver might hold out on the rider who would then be forced to cancel and pay the fee,” Elona said. “What if you’re faced with picky drivers who force you to cancel, or if you’re rushing and have no choice but to cancel your booking? It might be unfair for the passengers,” said Jazzmin Carilla, a 21-year-old public relations writer and frequent Grab user. Commuters’ group The commuter welfare group, National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP), said it recognized that drivers, too, had rights against passengers who frequently canceled their trips. “However, [Grab] should first set guidelines on when it is acceptable to cancel a ride. Why should you be penalized if the driver cannot immediately fulfill your riding requirements?” said NCCSP head Maricor Akol. “There must be a standard time allotment wherein passengers are allowed to cancel … [but] at the same time, [Grab] has to come out with a comprehensive plan to issue penalties so the riding public cannot renege on their bookings,” Akol added. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Of the five other transport network companies (TNCs)—Owto, Micab, Hirna, GoLag and Hype—only Owto charges a cancellation fee, which amounts to P50. Grab, Hype, GoLag, Owto and Micab were recently allowed to operate in Metro Manila and other large urban areas, while Hirna is available in Pampanga province and the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Iligan, Davao and Iligan. Go Jek An Indonesian TNC, Go Jek, has also expressed interest in challenging Grab’s domination in the Philippines. Aileen Lizada, board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, noted that Go Jek had been used to charging unregulated surge rates of up to five times in Indonesia. “I told them that here, up to times two only. I asked them if they could survive. They said they need to study [Philippine regulations],” Lizada said. “Go Jek is big, so we need to study [their application] well as we need to protect the local players,” she added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1193293/grab-no-overcharging-of-fares-amid-pcc-fine","title":"Grab: PCC fine not due to ‘overcharging’","date":"02:03 PM November 22, 2019","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1070973/grab-suspends-food-delivery-service-along-black-nazarene-parade-route","title":"Grab suspends food delivery service along Black Nazarene parade route","date":"02:01 PM January 09, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines has temporarily suspended its GrabFood delivery services for security measures along the parade route of the Black Nazarene.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines has temporarily suspended its GrabFood delivery services for security measures along the parade route of the Black Nazarene.

CHR spokesperson Jacqueline De Guia said the commission will look into the “possible misconduct” of the police officer, identified as Polie Captain Ronald Saquilayan, and whether there was “disregard of due process of law” as claimed by the female driver named Mary Florence Narial.  The CHR said it is “deeply concerned” with the manner of arrest and the policeman’s alleged assault on the woman. “The 1987 Constitution guarantees that any person under investigation for the commission of a crime or offense ‘shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice’,” De Guia noted.  “We remind law enforcement agents to uphold their own standard protocols in conducting arrest and to be mindful of the legally allowable force to control someone who physically assaults an officer.” “If there is proven abuse of authority, appropriate complaints will be filed before the PNP-Internal Affairs Service and the Office of the Ombudsman to hold the erring official accountable,” she added.  Narial was arrested Tuesday in Taguig City for allegedly attacking a police officer. But Narial said she merely acted in self-defense as the policeman attacked her first by hitting her with his car’s door. Their altercation happened in front of a coffee shop where Narial said she fetched a passenger but could not leave because Saquilayan’s vehicle was blocking her way. The police officer was reportedly waiting for his daughter at the time. Narial said she approached Saquilayan, who was inside his vehicle, to ask him to move his car so she can pass through. She also said that even the coffee shop’s manager and security guard appealed to the police officer to move his car away from the driveway. However, Saquilayan allegedly refused.

Traditional banks are being challenged by a new generation of online-only competitors that can offer better savings and borrowing rates, as they don’t need to spend money on overheads such as physical branches.  The introduction of digital lenders into the Singaporean market heralds the biggest liberalization of the financial hub’s banking sector for two decades, and follows similar moves in the United States, Britain, Japan and Hong Kong, among others. With most adults in the city already having access to financial services, firms awarded licenses are likely to use the city-state as a gateway to the wider region, where many consumers still lack bank accounts.  “It’s a total reconfiguration of the terrain — we’re talking about radical changes,” Lawrence Loh, a professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, told AFP. “Singapore is the launchpad for Southeast Asia.” An eclectic group of 21 applicants are vying for five digital banking licenses, Singapore’s central bank and financial regulator said this month.  They range from Alibaba founder Ma’s online platform Ant Financial, as it ramps up efforts to expand outside China, to a consortium that includes Southeast Asian ride-hailing behemoth Grab and the region’s biggest telecom player, Singtel. Other bidders are Asia’s biggest massage chair maker, V3 Group, and an alliance featuring computer gaming firm Razer and a supermarket chain operator. ‘Challenging old models’ Two of the licenses will be for full banking operations, allowing holders to take deposits from consumers, while three will be for “wholesale” banking — which limits a lender to mostly dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises. The winners will be announced in June, with operations starting in 2021, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.  Observers say the overhaul is unlikely to spark immediate, dramatic changes in Singapore itself — where traditional banks such as DBS and UOB have already introduced digital services. But the future impact could be massive if the new online lenders expand across a region of more than 600 million people, which is home to booming economies and where many are getting access to the internet for the first time via smartphones. The opportunities appear huge — nearly a third of people in Southeast Asia still do not have bank accounts, according to a report by Google, Singapore investment firm Temasek and business consultancy Bain & Company. Another 98 million individuals own bank accounts but have insufficient access to financial services, while millions of small and medium-size businesses are in need of funding, the report said. And it projected digital lending in the region would rise five-fold to $110 billion (around P5.5 trillion) by 2025. The rollout worldwide of ultra-fast, 5G smartphone infrastructure over the next five years is also expected to accelerate the digital transformation, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. “This is fundamentally challenging the old business model of retail banks, particularly in competing for the business of younger generations,” he told AFP. There could be difficulties in expanding across a region where some governments have traditionally sought to shield domestic banks from foreign rivals. But analysts say regulators have gradually been removing barriers to competition, while Loh from NUS saw a bright future for digital lending, saying: “People are very quick to adapt.” “E-commerce, online supermarkets, food delivery — they are all done online.” IB/JB (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); RELATED STORIES: Internet magic: A look back at Jack Ma at Alibaba 5 things you could do better with an all-digital bank High spirits at Singapore’s school for gin Harrods to head to China in 2020, with first stand-alone outside the UK"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1345076/grab-ph-to-post-bail-for-detained-grab-driver-who-allegedly-attacked-cop-in-taguig","title":"Grab PH to help post bail for detained Grab driver who allegedly attacked cop in Taguig","date":"11:08 AM October 08, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines on Thursday said they will help post bail for the release of Mary Florence Norial, one of its drivers who is now in jail in Taguig after supposedly assaulting a police officer.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines on Thursday said they will help post bail for the release of Mary Florence Norial, one of its drivers who is now in jail in Taguig after supposedly assaulting a police officer. “We have received reports regarding one of our driver-partners who was detained after allegedly disrespecting a police officer.

In an initial probe, NCRPO chief Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas said Saquilayan was asking the security guard of the coffee shop that he is still waiting for his daughter to finish buying food but Norial was persistent to ask the policeman to leave the driveway.  “Kinausap niya (Saquilayan) yung security guard na ‘please pa-advise sila (Norial) na magpila uli kasi hindi pa naibigay yung binibili’ kaso yung babae (Norial) namimilit. Tinawag pa niya (Norial) kapatid niya. Nagbitaw naman ng salita yung pulis, na minasama naman, at sinabi na sandali lang at may aayusin,” Sinas told reporters after a dialogue and peace covenant event at NCRPO headquarters in response to the arrest of Norial at a coffee shop in Barangay Ususan, Taguig on Oct. 6, Tuesday. (Saquilayan talked to the security guard and said: “please advise that they need to line up again because we have yet to get the items that we bought” but Norial was persistent. Norial even called her sibling. Then, the police responded that he has some things he needs to fix.)  “So ngayon, siyempre nagte-threatan na yung babae, based sa statement ng police, ‘O sige police ka pala, ipa-pa-media ko kayo, ipapa ‘Tulfo’ ko kayo.’ Eh di nairita na rin ang pulis kasi parang tinatakot at binubully pa siya so inaresto na siya ngayon at dinala sa station,” Sinas added. (So now of course the woman was threatening, based on the statement of the policeman, “Okay since you’re a policeman, I will report you to the media or even to “Tulfo.” The policeman was irritated because it is as though he was being threatened and bullied so Norial was arrested and was brought to the station.) “Hindi po siya (Norial), according sa pulis, hindi siya hinarass, siya po ang nauna,” Sinas further said. (She was not, according to police, she was not harassed, it was her who did the harassment first.) Mirza Miguel Shahzad, Norial’s partner, said he was surprised by the allegation, noting that they did not threaten Saquilayan.  “‘Yan nga po ang new development na nagulat kami. ((That’s the new development which we were surprised.) We did not threaten them. We took the videos for our safety and our evidence as we already felt unsafe being with the police,” he told INQUIRER.net when sought for comment about Sinas’ remark that it was Norial who harassed and threatened the police officer. Norial is still detained at the Barangay Ususan, Taguig police station while the Taguig prosecutor’s office has yet to release a resolution on her case. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Norial said she was allegedly harassed by the policeman. She said Saquilayan hit her with his car door. Probe possible abuse of police Nonetheless, Sinas said they will also look into the possible abuse of Saquilayan in the incident regarding the statement of the Grab driver. “Ang administrative investigation namin is separate doon sa complaint ng babae at saka complaint ng pulis doon sa babae,” he said. (Our administrative investigation is separate from the complaint of the woman and the complaint of the police against the girl.) “Ang sa’min lang mag-imbestiga kung mayroong kamalian o pang-a-abuso yung pulis namin as based sa social posting ng Grab driver na babae,” he added. (For us, we will investigate if the policeman did commit abuses or wrongdoings based on the female Grab driver’s post.) Sinas said Saquilayan already denied harassing the female driver, who alleged that she was struck by the car door. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Ang sabi po niya (Saquilayan) ‘sir, hindi ko po sinaktan ‘yun.’ Wala po siya ginawa kasi sabi niya: ‘sir nasa sasakyan ako naka-civilian ako.’ Hindi niya matandaan kung ano ginawa niya,” Sinas said. (Saquilayan said he did not hurt the woman. He added that he was inside the car wearing civilian clothes. He could not remember what he did.) “Kaya allegation ito kontra allegations. Kung mayroon man kwan edi papatunayan ng pulis namin na wala siyang ginawa na pagsaktan sa babae. So sabi ko: ‘Magpakita ka ng ebidensya at witnesses na hindi mo sinaktan yung babae,’” the Metro’s top cop added. (So these are allegations against allegations. If there are abuses then our policeman will prove that he did not do anything against Norial. So what I told him was that he should show evidence and witnesses to prove that he did not hit the woman.)"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1208427/grab-defends-computation-after-users-question-refund","title":"Grab defends computation after users question ‘measly’ refund","date":"03:02 PM January 02, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines explained the computation behind its refund after receiving online criticism from its users who believed the rebate was a lot less than they were expecting.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines explained the computation behind its refund after receiving online criticism from its users who believed the rebate was a lot less than they were expecting. “It’s based on the amount spent that they had during the period mentioned, February to August,” Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said in an interview Thursday with ANC.  With the P19 million refund divided to three million active users, Cu said each user could receive an average of P20 pesos considering if they use the service equally. “Now, if you take P19 million against the monthly active users of the platform which is around 3 million, on average it’s P20 per user if they all use it equally,” Cu said.  “Then you have some users who use it once a week, some users maybe use it once a month. Those users may have gotten the one-peso, two-peso refund,” he added. Grab Philippines on Tuesday started distributing refund worth P19.2 million to its users, following an order by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).  Seeing the amount received through the application’s GrabWallet, however, prompted some netizens to air their dismay, with some poking fun on the refund. “Thing that drives me crazy about grab is that they reward you w/ so little points yet charge a thousand points for a measly Php 50 discount and then there’s this generous refund,” one netizen wrote on Twitter.   “The small amounts that Grab refunds are really the real-life example of “it’s the thought that counts,’” another netizen said.  Cu said he, himself, is a “heavy” user of Grab’s services and received a P50-refund. “I honestly do not know what they were expecting but if you do the math, on the average wouldn’t go beyond 20 pesos. I, for one, am a pretty heavy user of the service and I got P50. There would be users that would use it heavily more than I do so it could go up to P70, P80, P90,” he said.

On Wednesday, Grab made a proposal that would provide the riding public with cheaper cars for hire: Let hatchbacks operate as transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units under a dry run.  Its suggestion, however, will test anew the LTFRB’s  standards for determining which motor vehicles are considered safe for public transport. Unacceptable  Currently, hatchbacks are not considered acceptable TNVS units as regulations state that only vehicles with an engine power of 1,200 cc and above are qualified. Grab president Brian Cu said the dry run could help the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and LTFRB determine that hatchbacks were not only safe for transport, but could also “help ease supply pain points” for transport regulators.  “If the DOTr and LTFRB allowed a motorcycle taxi pilot, we hope they would also consider a similar pilot test for hatchbacks, which have passed international safety standards,” Cu added. Under Memorandum Circular 2018-5, the LTFRB allowed hatchback cars to operate as TNVS units until 2021 and only within Metro Manila, to help meet the demand of cars-for-hire. No more franchise renewal “So as not to disrupt the service and in consideration of those hatchbacks at the time, we allowed a transition for hatchbacks, but only until after their franchises would expire,” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III said. “I hope for the DOTr and the LTFRB to openly consider a pilot testing for [hatchbacks] and observe within a specific time period how this could best serve the interests of the commuting public and TNVS owners,” Cu said.  He added that the dry run would also allow Grab to create a lower-priced category to cater to certain segments of  the riding public. In fact, this was the third condition stated in the 2018 memorandum although it was never implemented, partly due to the LTFRB’s ongoing efforts to rationalize the fare schemes of transport network companies. Currently, Grab has three ride categories: GrabCar and GrabShare (mostly sedans and hatchbacks with a minimum fare of P80); and GrabPremium (sport utility vehicles with a P125 minimum fare). Fourth category A separate, cheaper category for hatchbacks has yet to be set since the 2018 memorandum was approved. On June 10, Grab deactivated 5,604 colorum drivers on its platform after they failed to meet the LTFRB’s June 7 deadline to apply for a franchise. Of the total, 1,225 were hatchback drivers, most of whom were not allowed to renew their franchise because of the LTFRB’s regulations against vehicles with an engine power below 1,200 cc. Since then, the LTFRB has opened 10,000 new slots for TNVS units."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/295586/60000-grab-lalamove-riders-get-p3b-free-manulife-insurance-coverage","title":"Grab, Lalamove riders get P3B free Manulife insurance coverage","date":"02:25 PM April 24, 2020","snippet":"","body":" Life insurer Manulife Philippines is providing P3 billion worth of free insurance coverage to more than 60,000 active two-wheel riders from Grab and Lalamove who brave the streets to serve the community during the extended enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).

Marcos filed on Wednesday Senate Resolution No. 283 urging the appropriate Senate panel to conduct an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service of Grab PH and its effective monopoly of ride hailing services.”  “Various reports state that Grab prices (are) increasing to exorbitant amounts during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, with commuters experiencing more than double their usual fare,” the resolution read. “In addition to the high fares during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, Grab commuters also experience difficulties in booking a ride, with reports of booking times reaching about an hour, if they get a booking at all,” it added.  Under the mandate of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) as defined by the Philippine Competition Act, Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines was subjected to “quality and pricing standards in clearing the transaction which were part of the voluntary commitments signed by Grab to address the competition concerns raised by the antitrust authority,” Marcos noted in her resolution. “Commuters using Grab services have consistently complained that fares are becoming more expensive now, after Uber sold its business to Grab, leaving them with no other ride-hailing company to choose from,” she added.

At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement.   Grab Philippines on Monday said its new policy is aimed at reducing unreasonable cancellations for drivers and passengers.  “Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” he added. Grab said the cancellation fees incurred will go directly to the driver to compensate them for fuel and effort they have spent travelling to the location of the passenger.  The cancellation fee and no-show fees, however, will not be applied to passengers if the ride is cancelled within five minutes of getting an assigned a driver, if the driver is not moving towards the pick-up point, if the driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival, and if the driver indicates that he has arrived when he or she has not. The ride-hailing company said it is willing to refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours. The updated policy is effective on Monday, April 29, but Grab said is doing a staggered toll out to both passengers and drivers, which will be completed by the end of May.

Launched last Sept. 24, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Grab for Good is the company’s social impact program targeted toward three main goals: to improve digital inclusion and literacy in Southeast Asia; empower the region’s microentrepreneurs and small businesses; and build a “future-ready” workforce.  According to Grab’s first social impact report, which was also released in Jakarta, the company now has nine million microentrepreneurs—a combination of drivers, delivery partners, merchants, and business agents—on their platform. The company started with just 40 taxi drivers in 2012.  The report also revealed that the company has: 1) contributed almost $6 billion to the Southeast Asia economy in the past year; 2) helped around two million previously unbanked individuals open accounts, as required before becoming a driver-partner; 3) empowered the livelihood of nine million microentrepreneurs; 4) and influenced more people on the use of cashless payment channels. By 2025, Grab CEO and cofounder Anthony Tan said the company plans to help over five million more traditional businesses and small merchants digitize their workflow and processes under the Grab for Good program.  They also aim to bring digital literacy and inclusion to three million Southeast Asians through partnerships with both private and public institutions, as well as nonprofit organizations; and train 20,000 students through its tech talent initiatives. In the Philippines, Grab’s focus, when it comes to helping small businesses and microentrepreneurs, are the food stalls that line the streets of Makati City, more popularly known as “jollijeeps.” Grab Philippines public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said around 20 of these food stalls already offer delivery services, through GrabFood, to customers within the five-kilometer radius of their respective locations. The formal announcement of these plans have yet to be made, but Pasigan painted a positive picture for these small businesses—she said that the food stalls on the platform, including the popular Sisig sa Rada, were able to make an additional P2 million in revenue in less than six months. Regionally, Tan said the Grab for Good program would also empower more members of an underserved segment: deaf microentrepreneurs.  Tan announced the further expansion of their “Break the Silence” initiative, which allows the deaf to become driver-partners on their platform. Grab currently has over 500 deaf drivers in Malaysia and Thailand; the initiative will now roll out in Indonesia and Singapore. Also, to “ensure that the knowledge of digital skills and technology is not limited to only those who go to good schools,” Grab sealed a partnership with Microsoft, also under the Grab for Good program. The University of Indonesia and Bandung Institute of Technology have so far partnered with the two companies for their tech talent development initiatives. Cheryl Goh, Grab’s group vice president for marketing, said that they plan to establish partnerships with schools in the Philippines in the coming year. Grab driver-partners will also have access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification via the Grab driver app, where they can complete basic tech courses, completion of which will earn them certification from Microsoft for free. “Grab for Good is only the beginning for us. It is not a slogan for us, nor is it new; this is who we were at our founding. It is how we see ourselves in the future,” said Tan. “Grab for Good is a call for all of us today to work hand in hand to create a meaningful and lasting impact on society.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1056789/list-grab-ph-controversies-and-issues","title":"LIST: Grab PH controversies and issues","date":"04:56 PM November 24, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.","body":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.

A report from the Southern Police District (SPD) said Norial, 26, was detained for alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority. According to the report, Police Captain Ronald Saquilayan was inside his car at the driveway of a coffee shop in Barangay Ususan Taguig City at 7:20 p.m. on Tuesday as he waited for his daughter when Norial alighted from her vehicle and started shouting at him.  SPD said Saquilayan is the chief investigator of Pateros police. Norial then continuously knocked on Saquilayan’s car window which prompted the lawman to ask assistance from the coffeeshop’s security guard.  Police said Saquilayan then returned to his vehicle when Norial allegedly pushed Saquilayan’s car door and hit the police officer on the head. Saquilayan immediately apprehended Norial, whom police said was “unruly and resisted” arrest. After her arrest, Norial took to social media and aired her version of the incident. Norial said she was fetching her passenger at the coffee shop but she could not leave because Saquilayan’s vehicle was blocking her way. She said the security guard as well as the manager of the coffee shop appealed to the policeman to move his vehicle away from the driveway.  “Naka 20mins n ata kami naghihintay ng pasahero, (We waited for 20 minutes.),” she wrote on her caption at a Facebook video which was livestreamed on Tuesday night. During the confrontation, Norial said she was reportedly hit by the policeman with his car’s door. “Hanggang sa itinulak ako ng sundalo gamit yung car door nya at nasubsob ako sa bushes (He pushed me using a car door and I fell down on the bushes.),” she said. Norial said she then slapped Saquilayan who tried to pin her down. “Sinampal ko sya s mukha pabalik gawa ng self defense ng bigla nyang binaligtad na sinaktan ko daw sya kaya ginapos nya ako gamit kamay nya at isunubsob sa glass window,” she said. (I slapped him on the face for self-defense but he turned the tables on me so he apprehended me using his hands.) Norial said she acted in self-defense. “Self defense yun at hndi naman drive thru yung pinagparkan nya at ilang beses na kaming nakiusap pero wala pa dn,” she said.

But Police Col. Lawrence Cajipe, regional officer of the police’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, said the death of Frankie Mark Serrano, 20, did not end their investigation, especially since the drivers of the ride-hailing app, Laurence Fajardo and Manuel Alamuddin, had yet to be found.  The drivers went missing in April after they were booked four days apart using the same pick-up and drop-off points in Cavite City. Road rage  Authorities were able to connect the incidents to Serrano following a road rage incident at Nagtahan Bridge in Manila on May 20. Serrano was driving a Toyota Vios, with plate UKE 549, when flagged down for a traffic violation. He reportedly surrendered his driver’s license but sped away once the enforcer noticed that the card was fake.  An onlooker was able to take a video of the incident as Serrano rammed at least 10 other vehicles. He was forced to stop as angry motorists threw rocks at the car. Serrano escaped on foot along with a still unidentified male companion. He abandoned the car and left a woman passenger, who turned out to be his live-in partner. The Manila police later traced the car to Laarni Roque, Fajardo’s sister. Alamuddin’s relatives then sought authorities after the video of the Nagtahan incident went viral. The police also learned that Serrano had used the same vehicle days before the Nagtahan incident when he shot two men at a gasoline station in Imus City, Cavite, over a petty altercation. Other cases  On June 8, Judge Hilda Mendoza of the Imus Municipal Trial Court in Cities issued a warrant for the arrest of Serrano on a case of grave threat. A report from the Cavite police said Serrano led a robbery and car theft gang in Metro Manila and Cavite. Cajipe said the police received a tip that Serrano was staying in an apartment at Barangay Santol in Silang, Cavite. Authorities on Wednesday night tried to arrest Serrano but he reportedly resisted and fired at them. The police fired back, killing Serrano. He said the woman whom Serrano left at Nagtahan Bridge in May was the same person the police found with him in Silang during their operation. Serrano tried to use her as a human shield by “pushing her toward the policemen” before he fired his gun, Cajipe said. “The woman told us she was being held [against her will]. She said [Serrano had] threatened to kill her father, a shoemaker from Cavite, and her child, if she fled. She’s pregnant,” Cajipe said. The police official did not identify the woman, saying she feared that Serrano’s men would get back at her. Police are looking into another case of a Grab driver slain in Rodriguez town, Rizal province, last year. Cajipe said it was possible that Serrano’s group was also behind the Rizal case. —MARICAR CINCO"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1195494/p23-m-grab-fine-nothing-to-do-with-ltfrb-fare-structure","title":"‘PCC’s P23-M  fine vs Grab not linked to LTFRB fare structure’","date":"11:00 AM November 28, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday clarified that the P23-million fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC)  on ride-hailing firm Grab has “nothing to do” with the board’s fare structure.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday clarified that the P23-million fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC)  on ride-hailing firm Grab has “nothing to do” with the board’s fare structure. The LTFRB said it met with PCC officials to discuss the imposed fine.  The PCC earlier imposed a P23.45 million-fine against Grab “for breaching its pricing commitments.” “To put it in proper context, the fine issued by PCC in its Decision recently rendered pertains to the failure of Grab to fulfill its commitment to PCC as embodied in Grab’s Undertaking which it voluntarily submitted to PCC.

The LTFRB said that it will continue working with PCC on the issue. “The agency shall, therefore, conduct a review to monitor Grab’s fare setting in order to determine any violation on the existing fare structure issued by the Board,” the LTFRB said.  Grab Philippines president Brian Cu earlier clarified that the fine was not due to “overcharging”, saying that they have been compliant with the fare matrix set by the LTFRB. Cu said they will abide by the PCC in order to refund P5.05 million to its passengers. He said Grab passengers who booked a ride from February to May 2019 will receive a refund ranging from less than P1 to over P100. “There are some that will get below a peso, there are some that will get over a hundred pesos depende kung gaano karaming trips ang ti-nake nila,” Cu said.

According to the document from the LTFRB which was released on Tuesday, Grab should also reimburse its passengers for the P2-per-minute travel charge through rebates. Leo Gonzales, head of Grab Philippines’ Public Affairs section, said in a statement that the company will study LTFRB’s nine-page order before responding to the issue.  “Grab will reserve comment for now until we have fully studied and analyzed the matter with our legal team. We will reach out in due time,” Gonzales said after the LTFRB made the document public. Grab, however, has refuted allegations of overcharging even in past statements. Last April, Grab has suspended collecting the P2-per-minute charge. It maintained, however, that this would “cause grave or irreparable damage” to drivers and operators in its platform.

Jericho Nograles on why the LTFRB decided to suspend, and eventually, penalize them for the P2-per-minute charge.  “He has only succeeded in reducing the income of drivers when he got the LTFRB to suspend the P2/minute fare component for drivers. This has resulted in fewer drivers going out; and therefore, fewer vehicles to serve the riding public,” Gonzales explained. Grab has also denied claims made by Nograles that the transport network company has been charging P100 for booking fees. “The allegation of Cong. Jericho Nograles that we charge P100 as booking fee is completely baseless. This new hit against Grab is part of his long list of unfounded allegations,” Gonzales said. In a report on Radyo Inquirer, Nograles said on Monday that Grab’s additional charges abuse its costumers.

This would further promote cashless transactions, including bills payment, food orders, and in-store and in-restaurant purchases in the country, according to Grab. “The Philippines has one of the highest percentages of people in Southeast Asia who do not have a bank account and who transact in cash,” Ooi Huey Tyng, Managing Director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, said in a statement.  “We believe Grab, an everyday app available on 1 in 2 smartphones in the Philippines, can make a difference where other e-wallets have not been able to so far,” she added.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) officials slapped the company with a P6.5-million fine, citing inconsistencies in Grab’s data about its pricing.  PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan alleged Grab submitted “deficient, inconsistent and incorrect data for the monitoring of its compliance with its voluntary commitments.” Also on Friday, Grab said it would file a motion for reconsideration.  Grab’s takeover of the regional operations of its rival Uber in March last year made its business a virtual monopoly in the Philippines. While this gave the company a stronger market power, many riders complained such advantage did not necessarily translate to better services as higher fares preyed on the traffic-weary public.  The PCC had flagged the deal and launched a review even as the deal pushed through. Months later, the antitrust body set this review aside after Grab agreed to “voluntary commitments,” whereby the company would be monitored by an independent trustee. Balisacan said these commitments were made to address concerns on the company’s pricing behavior and maintain service quality “in the absence of a significant competitive pressure in the market.” “However, the commission cannot effectively enforce these commitments without the submission of correct, sufficient, consistent and timely data by Grab,” he said. The PCC did not say how this would affect further actions in the future. “We do not want to presume that this is going to be a continuing trend towards violating their undertaking,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  Then PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo had said the government could cancel the Grab-Uber deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments. In a separate statement, Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said the company wanted to know why the fine reached P6.5 million. He said the PCC required Grab to submit data that covered the period after the transaction was made in March. Given the nature and huge volume of data required, he said the company worked “under very limited timelines to meet PCC’s deadline.” “During the voluntary commitment negotiations, Grab recommended various ways to present the requested data based on how the system can best provide them. Given enough time, we can reconcile our data structure with theirs,” he said. “Three out of four penalties were set at a maximum amount of P2 million pesos each. Given the breakdown of the fines vis-a-vis the severity of the lapses alleged by the PCC, we would like to better understand PCC’s rationale for imposing a maximum penalty,” he added."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248533/philippine-competition-commission-will-review-grab-uber-deal","title":"Philippine Competition Commission will review Grab-Uber deal","date":"05:34 PM April 03, 2018","snippet":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week.","body":"The government’s competition watchdog has decided to review Grab’s takeover of its main rival here in the country, but it is not yet clear if it could still prevent Uber from stopping operations next week. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249046/ltfrb-grab-reduce-cap-surge-pricing","title":"LTFRB to Grab: Reduce cap on surge pricing","date":"05:05 AM April 12, 2018","snippet":"Pending its accreditation of new transport network companies (TNCs) in the wake of Uber’s exit from the country, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered Grab to immediately lower its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times.","body":"Pending its accreditation of new transport network companies (TNCs) in the wake of Uber’s exit from the country, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered Grab to immediately lower its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times. “This is to ensure that the fare will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of transport network vehicle services (TNVS)  that are transferring to Grab,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a special board meeting on Wednesday.  In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following the announcement that Uber would be stopping its Philippine operations. ‘Due to lack of drivers’  Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu maintained, however, that his company was not taking advantage of the situation, saying the price surge was due to the lack of drivers. According to Cu, while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in Grab’s system rose only by around 30 percent.  Cu also pointed out that Uber’s fare was lower compared to Grab’s because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was P5 while theirs was P11. In fact, had Uber’s pending fare hike petition been approved, it would be charging P12 per kilometer, making the two TNCs’ fare rates almost the same, he added. Three other TNCs are seeking accreditation from the LTFRB: Lag Go, Hype and Owto. LTFRB, PCC at odds Meanwhile, the LTFRB has ordered Uber to stop operations in the country by April 16, a directive that contradicted that of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).  “In the interest of all TNVS and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” Lizada said in the board meeting. The LTFRB order came just days after the PCC directed Uber and Grab to continue operating separately in the country pending its motu propio review of the deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. The PCC had expressed concern that the deal would give Grab a monopoly of the ride-hailing industry in the country. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the LTFRB that while they intended to withdraw their pending petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC in preparation for halting their operations in the country, the PCC order prevented them from doing so. Lizada said that while the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would affect the riding public and thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. Just for compliance “The soonest possible time that you will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she told the Uber representative. Earlier, Cu said that in line with their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to continue funding the operations of the Uber app until April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. The app was initially scheduled to go offline starting on April 9. He noted, however, that their action not only defeated the purpose of the PCC order but also placed the riding public in danger since Uber no longer  has any back-end support in the country to address complaints and look after passengers in the event of a road crash."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/259107/grab-uber-ordered-pay-p16m-fines","title":"Grab, Uber ordered to pay P16M in fines","date":"05:20 AM October 18, 2018","snippet":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for allegedly causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review of their controversial takeover deal.","body":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for allegedly causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review of their controversial takeover deal. Top officials of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Wednesday the companies had made the review process unnecessarily difficult, despite clear orders against such actions.  Grab Philippines, now the largest transport network company in the country, would shoulder bulk of the fine. Uber would still be asked to pay despite having left the country. The issue stems from a regional takeover deal earlier this year, wherein Grab acquired Uber’s operations here in Southeast Asia.  The PCC had flagged this, launching a review amid concerns the deal might come at the expense of the ride-hailing public. “The fines are imposed for causing undue difficulties on the PCC review and decision making process,” said PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo in a press briefing.  The review was later set aside after Grab committed to make certain changes in its operations, albeit the violations during the process have been underscored. These promised changes, or the voluntary commitments, are currently being monitored. A violation could lead to more fines, and even an unwinding of the deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments, she said. Broken down, both companies were collectively fined P4 million for failure to keep their businesses separate. Grab, for its part, has been penalized to pay P8 million for failure to maintain premerger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber, as the acquired party, was fined P4 million for the same set of violations.

The company behind the popular bubble tea drink CoCo grappled with the latter when it partnered with Grab Philippines back in 2018.","body":"There are problems you keep to yourself, and problems that you can brag about. The company behind the popular bubble tea drink CoCo grappled with the latter when it partnered with Grab Philippines back in 2018. Back then, only 10 of the 30 CoCo outlets were chosen to participate in Grab’s food delivery service aptly called GrabFood. With a few taps on your phone, you could order a bubble tea, a drink more commonly known in the Philippines as milk tea.  Then came the problem. As if the milk tea craze were not enough, the demand spiked so fast that Grab saw an order for CoCo Bubble Tea every four minutes. CoCo just had too many orders.  “That was insane,” recalled Larry Evans Tan, general manager of CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice Philippines, who had an interview with reporters on the sidelines of a Grab launch last week. “There was such a surge in orders [that] the riders can’t keep up. The stores can’t keep up. The app can’t keep up,” he said.  It was the success of merchants like CoCo that eventually convinced the ride hailing giant—whose reputation in food delivery contrasts to the mixed reactions over its ride hailing service—to take the next logical step. Grab’s food delivery business has significantly grown since it was launched in 2018, according to GrabFood country head EJ dela Vega, with around 12,000 merchant outlets under its wing. But GrabFood can only do so much. It can only deliver to customers who live within a certain distance from a physical merchant, much so that a store in Mandaluyong can’t deliver food to a customer in Makati, for example. And so the next step for Grab is to find a way that will not only help merchants sell to a wider market via delivery, but will also remove the need for a business to build an actual store in the first place. Here comes GrabKitchen, a food court of sorts wherein partner-merchants can have their own private kitchens without ever having to pay rent, as long as Grab gets a certain share from their revenues.  The first GrabKitchen was launched at Glorietta Mall in Makati City last week. It partnered with six merchants, five of which do not have any commercial footprint in Makati. CoCo was one of the partner merchants. It was the only one that also had an outlet in Makati. In fact, it was also located in Glorietta, which only speaks volumes about the demand for milk tea in the area. The other five merchants are Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean. Customers can either have the food and drinks delivered via GrabKitchen, or eat in the actual store since it has a few tables inside. GrabKitchen, however, is not out to replace GrabFood. The latter, which Dela Vega said gets millions of orders in a month, will keep on. There will be three new GrabKitchens in other locations in six months, each would be able to accommodate a few partner merchants. “Without GrabFood, there is no GrabKitchen,” he said in a phone interview last Friday. “We view it more as a service to our partners. We created GrabKitchen for partners who want to expand but maybe could not invest in the same level as other [bigger companies],” he said. The new service marks Grab’s move to make its pre­sence felt even more in the lives of the public, in ways some consumers probably would not have imagined before from a ride-hailing business. Now, a rider can order food using Grab, get a document delivered, and even pay using a mobile wallet. In 2018, it called its app an “everyday super app”—a phrase that might ring like a buzz word for some, but a phrase that nevertheless becomes more true over time as the company surprises you with where else it could still go from here."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/278521/grab-investing-150-million-in-ai-to-build-regional-super-app","title":"Grab investing $150 million in AI to build regional super app","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing start-up Grab Holdings intends to invest US$150 million into artificial intelligence (AI) research over the next year, accelerating its expanding business that now includes food delivery, digital payments and digital content.","body":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing start-up Grab Holdings intends to invest US$150 million into artificial intelligence (AI) research over the next year, accelerating its expanding business that now includes food delivery, digital payments and digital content. Grab, in hot competition with rival Gojek to become Southeast Asia’s do-it-all super app, outlined for the first time a blueprint for its use and deployment of AI.  It will build on the US$100 million it had previously invested in the technology, said co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, and improve its fraud prevention and natural language processing (NLP) technology. “We want to go from AI-powered to AI everywhere,” Ms Tan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the Sooner Than You Think tech conference in Singapore.  She sees successful technology companies building “great platforms that are very localised to the problem they are trying to solve”. So Grab is working with Microsoft on delivering better NLP and making the region’s leader in ride hailing, food delivery and digital payments even more tailored and accessible to users in the various markets.  Technology companies like Grab are preparing as blazing-fast fifth-generation networks spread, powering complex AI applications and catalysing the emergence of futuristic technologies like self-driven cars. But Grab, according to Ms Tan, is focused on its customers and their immediate needs. “We won’t just build AI for the sake of AI,” she said. Grab, which is raising more than US$4.5 billion in its latest funding round from heavy hitters, including SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund and Tencent Holdings, is hiring thousands of people and setting up research centres from Beijing to Seattle. At the heart of its global effort is an ambition to create an all-in-one “super app” akin to Tencent’s WeChat for China. The company’s GrabPay service already allows consumers to pick up the tab for rides and order food, and it is expanding into lending and insurance.  Last year, it debuted a financial technology platform and launched Grab Ventures to fund promising start-ups. The company is also said to be considering applying for a digital banking licence if Singapore allows it. Ms Tan concluded by saying that Grab, which is valued at about US$14 billion, according to CB Insights, is “very much on track” to match or even slightly exceed forecasts of US$2 billion in revenue for the year."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1413476/lugaw-delivery-stopped-in-bulacan-barangay-execs-say-its-not-essential","title":"Lugaw delivery stopped in Bulacan; barangay execs say it’s not essential","date":"07:57 PM March 31, 2021","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines — A food delivery rider who was set to pick up an order of “lugaw” or rice porridge from a merchant was waylaid by officials of a barangay in San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan, even if the national government guidelines for enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) was clear about uninterrupted food delivery operations.

Because as long as you operate, people will go out, someone will deliver. It’s nonsense, sir, even if you video-record me.)  The female barangay official initially thought that the rider was the shop owner. Discussions between the two ensued with the barangay official even contending that rice porridge is not essential because people can live without it. “’Di niyo ba naiintindihan, nandito babasahin ko ha, curfew hours natin — sige video mo para maintindihan mo, ‘di ba alam ng Grab ‘yan?” the barangay official asked, which the rider answered by saying they are only following guidelines set by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). (Can’t you understand, I’ll read this here, this is our curfew hours — go on, take videos so you would understand. Is Grab not aware of this?) “Pero ECQ tayo, sir. Teka lang, sir, may pinapa-implement tayo, 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., okay, curfew ‘yan,” the female official argued, even showing what appears to be printed slides from the IATF presentation.  “So dito naman, sa private establishments, essential goods and services, essential po ba si lugaw?  Hindi, kasi mabubuhay ang tao nang walang lugaw. Ang essential, tubig, gatas, grocery.”  (But we are under an ECQ, sir. We are implementing restrictions, like a 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.  So here, for private establishments, only essential goods and services are allowed to operate. Is rice porridge essential?  No, because people can live without a rice porridge; what is essential are water, milk, grocery items.) INQUIRER.net has reached out to the San Jose del Monte Police Station about the incident, and they explained in a phone interview that food deliveries are permitted as per IATF resolutions, even in an ECQ setup. Bulacan is one of the five areas included in the so-called NCR Plus bubble, along with Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal — which the national government placed under ECQ amid surges in COVID-19 infections. The San Jose del Monte Police also noted that no police officer was present when the rider was stopped and that the actions were done by barangay officials only. Also, the police said no complaints have been lodged before them as of this writing as the rider was only barred from entering the barangay. During the announcement of ECQ rules within the NCR Plus bubble, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque stressed that food shops and restaurants should remain open, but only for take-out and deliveries.

After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.

In line with this, Grab has struck a strategic partnership with multi-sector Vietnamese conglomerate Sovico Group to collaborate on mobility and logistics solutions to improve Vietnam’s first and last-mile delivery networks.  The US$500 million investment will also go into launching new services, and expanding Grab’s transport, food and payments networks in Vietnam. In its “Tech for Good” development roadmap, three main areas Grab will look at are lifting communities from poverty, helping build a skilled workforce, and working with city governments for urban planning.  Grab aims to partner financial institutions to provide financial solutions to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses – which includes driver-partners, delivery partners and merchant partners. This includes access to credit and insurance products to grow and protect livelihoods. It also plans to grow its research and development (R&D) headcount in Vietnam and invest in building Vietnamese tech talents. It will also encourage tech entrepreneurship and support growth in the market’s startup scene through its GrabVentures program.  Grab also aims to work with city governments and policymakers in harnessing data to make better urban planning decisions to alleviate problems like traffic congestion and pollution. It will also look to put sustainability at the centre of its business by targeting to reduce plastic waste for its GrabFood delivery service. Grab Vietnam country head Jerry Lim said that by the end of 2019, Grab would have invested “more than US$200 million into the country to better the livelihoods of users and partners of its services. “By aligning our business with the government’s socio-economic development plan, we want to make a significant and meaningful contribution to Vietnam’s long-term socio-economic growth, and support the country’s Industry 4.0 ambitions,” Mr Lim added. Grab added that it has made “an open call for partnerships” with public and private sector stakeholders who share the same Tech For Good vision. As for its tie-up with Sovico Group, the conglomerate will provide its expertise and networks in aviation, finance, real estate and hospitality, together with Grab’s technology and platform, to accelerate Vietnam’s economic and technological development, said Grab upon the signing of a memorandum of understanding.  Sovico Holdings owns private airline Vietjet Air, and also runs several resorts and hotels including Furama Resort Da Nang, Ana Mandara and An Lam Ninh Van Bay. Grab head of regional operations Russell Cohen added the country’s rapidly developing economy and young, mobile-first population makes it ripe for the adoption of digital services. “As we scale our food, parcel delivery, transport and payments business across the country, we hope to tap and invest in new opportunities emerging in the fintech, mobility and logistics space, in order to bring about greater value and innovation for our customers and partners,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/941501/grab-ph-p100k-reward-for-leads-on-death-of-driver","title":"Grab PH: P100K reward for leads on death of driver","date":"11:11 AM October 30, 2017","snippet":"Grab Philippines has offered a P100,000-reward to anyone who could provide leads on the death of Gerardo “Junjie” Maquidato Jr., a driver-partner of the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) company.","body":"Grab Philippines has offered a P100,000-reward to anyone who could provide leads on the death of Gerardo “Junjie” Maquidato Jr., a driver-partner of the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) company.

Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan, in an event on Thursday attended by media from the six countries where it operates, said the name change was meant to reflect how the company has moved beyond a taxi-booking service when it was launched in 2012. Right now, Grab’s platform also offers private car services (GrabCar), motorcycle taxis (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch) and last mile delivery (GrabExpress).  The combined services cater to a region-wide market that is valued at about $25 billion.  In the Philippines, GrabHitch has yet to be launched while the Department of Transportation and Communications recently ordered the company to halt the GrabBike service pending the release of the proper guidelines.

We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,” he added. The Grab smarthpone app was also revamped in line with the change of its corporate identity. Tan said enhancements include easier booking based on a user’s preferred locations, automated retries when a booking fails and a one-click registration process for first-time users.  New options include “flash,” which searches all of the closest taxis and GrabCars to find the best vehicle for users across both services, and GrabPay, which allows passengers to go “cashless” either via credit or debit cards. It also rolled out GrabWork, aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and easier tracking of receipts for expense claims purposes. The company is making new investments as well as it revealed a plan to establish engineering centers, one each in Seattle, Untied States, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab said it controls about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. The company handles about 1.5 million bookings per day with 200,000 drivers on its platform."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248707/grab-uber-told-keep-apps","title":"Grab, Uber told to keep apps","date":"05:34 AM April 06, 2018","snippet":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has directed Grab and Uber to continue operating their apps independently despite the scheduled termination of the Uber app next week.","body":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has directed Grab and Uber to continue operating their apps independently despite the scheduled termination of the Uber app next week.

The company issued the call after a group of transport network vehicles (TNVS) drivers and operators revealed plans to stage a “transport holiday” on Monday, July 8. The group said they will temporarily stop operations and go offline for 12 hours. This will serve as a protest on their various complaints against the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

While it recognizes the drivers’ right to free speech and peaceable assembly, Grab urged the drivers to work with regulators and passengers through a dialogue. “In many ways, we also support the call for smoother processes and faster timelines,” Hosaka said. “Let us take the high road and to not resort to any rash actions that would directly affect the passengers we are all committed to serve.” The ride-hailing firm earlier deactivated 5,000 drivers without provisional authority from its system as part of its compliance with the LTFRB. For it part, the TNVS Community, the group planning to hold a “transport holiday,” said they are open to dialogue, and has actually been reaching out to the LTFRB. “Individually and as a group they reached out to LTFRB,” Ariel Inton, chair of the Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview on behalf of the TNVS community.  “Pero walang nangyari (Nothing happened). It fell on deaf ears,” he added. He said it’s about time that the LTFRB take the initiative to conduct a dialogue with the TNVS drivers and operators. “I think as government officials, the initiative should come from them because the stakeholders have been trying to reach out even before this planned transport holiday,” Inton said.

Grab submitted its voluntary commitments to the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on June 1, which is supposed to address the issues flagged by PCC, such as worsening conditions of the company’s ride fares and services.  This is according to Commissioner Stella Alabastro Quimbo, who told the Inquirer in a chance interview that PCC would now have to see whether or not such commitments are acceptable. She said the commitments are based on “their interpretation of what they think is a response” to PCC’s statement of concerns, which was published only recently. She deferred from disclosing what those commitments are.  “We have to make a determination that indeed there would be a meaningful change in behavior, meaning a change of behavior that would be enough to really at least return the competitive conditions before Uber exited,” she said. This develops months after Grab pursued a regional takeover of Uber’s business here in Southeast Asia last March, which raised a lot of concerns in the Philippine commuting public.  READ: Grab buys Uber; PCC sets review Despite a temporary delay that kept its operations going for some time, Uber has effectively left the Philippine market on April 16. Quimbo said that PCC has at most 60 days to decide on the voluntary commitments. Until such decision is made, the ongoing review of the deal “stops.” What happens next is a discussion wherein PCC and Grab will try to find a way in making the terms mutually agreeable. This includes additional measures that PCC could impose, if ever it finds Grab’s commitments “insufficient,” she said. Grab would then have to see if these are also acceptable.  However, if there would be a “breakdown in the talks,” then the review would have to continue — which could end with a block, an approval, or an approval with conditions. “Supposed those additional things are not acceptable to any party, [then] there [will be] no more voluntary commitments. In which case, we revert back to the review track. There is a deadline to that,” she said. The closest glimpse PCC gave to the now stalled review is the statement of concerns that was released recently. The statement is part of PCC’s review of the deal. In it, PCC essentially said that the price and quality of Grab’s services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, that not even the entry of new players could challenge the company’s influence. Even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the deal. /jpv"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248826/grab-uber-deal-ltfrb-pcc-aileen-lizada","title":"LTFRB worried about continued operation of Uber despite deal with Grab","date":"07:13 PM April 07, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is concerned that the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order to Grab and Uber to continue to operate independently in the country, even if the latter has already shuttered its Southeast Asian operations, may adversely affect the riding public.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is concerned that the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order to Grab and Uber to continue to operate independently in the country, even if the latter has already shuttered its Southeast Asian operations, may adversely affect the riding public. “PCC is focusing on the competition aspect,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Saturday. “Our concern is how will the complaints, road crashes, if any, will be handled by Uber if they no longer have employees? Who will pay for the cost to operate?  In an order released on Saturday, the PCC said the two transportation network companies (TNCs) should “maintain the independence of their business operations” for the “entire duration” of the commission’s motu propio review on the deal. The PCC, however, did not state when it intends to conclude its review. The PCC order came a day before the Uber app is scheduled to go offline, which is on Sunday, April 8.  Early this week, PCC and LTFRB officials met to discuss what would become of the ride-sharing industry with Uber’s exit from the Southeast Asian region. Lizada said that they stressed in that meeting that safety measures have been put in place by the board “to prevent any monopoly by any TNC,” which the PCC fears would happen.  For one, she noted, there are currently four new TNCs that have sought accreditation from the LTFRB. Once these TNCs – Lag Go, Hype, Owto and Pira – satisfy the LTFRB’s requirements, they will take the place of Uber, affording the riding public more transport options. Also, she said that TNCs could not increase their fares on their own as they are required to follow the fare structure approved by the LTFRB. As for the app-based drivers, the franchises that are given to them by the LTFRB are not exclusive to any TNC, which means that they get to decide on who they want to drive for. Rather than unbundle the deal entered by the two TNCs, Lizada said that LTFRB should instead be “called [out] to fast-track the processing of the new players.” It remains unclear how the PCC intends to enforce its order on Uber, especially that its employees are already on a four-month garden leave. The Inquirer also learned that Uber has only around 10 employees left in the country who are part of the transition team.  The Inquirer sought both Uber and Grab officials for comment on the PCC’s order but has yet to receive a reply as of writing. On Friday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu assured the National Privacy Commission that there would be no migration to their platform of the personal data of the 1.2 million Uber users, which may include credit card details. He noted that the data which would be transferred to them are only those of the drivers, who would have to give their consent to Grab. /atm"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/301025/p31-million-worth-of-shabu-seized-from-grab-driver-in-carcar-city","title":"P31 million worth of shabu seized from Grab driver in Carcar City","date":"April 08,2020 - 06:58 PM","snippet":"","body":" CEBU CITY, Philippines—Big-time drug peddling continues to flourish in Cebu despite the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) due to the COVID-19 crisis.

The drug bust operation was jointly conducted by the Talisay City Police, Provincial Intelligence Unit (PIU), Carcar City Police and the Regional Drug Enforcement Unit (RDEU), in close coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)-7. Nabbed in the buy-bust was Roblen Mata Repdos, 42, married, a Grab taxi driver and a resident of the area. Police said the suspect has kids but as to how many, they still have to verify. Police said they learned about Repdos’s illegal activities after he was tagged as the source of illegal drugs by drug personalities they have arrested the previous night (Tuesday). Seized from Repdos were 10 medium packs of suspected shabu, seven medium packs, three sealed green tea bags with Chinese markings which also contained the illegal substance and the marked money used in the operation. Police Regional Office (PRO-7) chief Police Brigadier General Albert Ignatius Ferro, said he believes Repdos is not a big-time drug dealer but was just used as a courier and bodegero. According to Ferro, the use of tea bags with Chinese markings as shabu containers is the signature of the Chinese triad, a group long regarded as the manufacturer of illegal drugs in the Asian region. The regional police chief also assured Cebuanos that despite the extra responsibilities of implementing the ECQ, policemen will remain vigilant against the distribution of drugs in the region. “The police are not resting. in fact, two days ago, or one day ago our personnel from the mobile force of CPPO were able to seize 20,000 stalks of marijuana. Our police force in PRO -7 are really are not resting on their functions as the law enforcement unit of the government,” Ferro said. Ferro added that he is hopeful that with the arrest of Repdos, they will be able to unmask his possible cohorts and contacts.

Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region enabling credit card holders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions — in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depends on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam – markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes.  Grab is also testing new services such as social carpooling, as well as last mile and food deliveries."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/289781/privacy-body-stops-grabs-test-of-video-audio-recording-of-passengers","title":"Privacy body stops Grab’s test of video, audio recording of passengers","date":"02:56 PM February 05, 2020","snippet":"The country’s privacy watchdog agency had suspended a pilot test of Grab Philippines that kept video and recordings of its passengers, noting that the company gave more weight to its risks than its riders’.","body":"The country’s privacy watchdog agency had suspended a pilot test of Grab Philippines that kept video and recordings of its passengers, noting that the company gave more weight to its risks than its riders’. The National Privacy Commission (NPC) had also suspended the selfie verification program of Grab for the same reason.  These three initiatives, the NPC said, “may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.” The issue marked another point of conflict with regulators, as Grab Philippines remains the biggest player in the local ride hailing market after buying out Uber, its main competitor, in 2018.  The Uber buyout triggered competition concerns that were not always addressed. In this case, personal data collected by Grab was supposed to help authorities piece together information in cases of conflict which would allow Grab to give police the entire picture if requested.  The video recording system, for example, will give Grab employees in the Grab Office a front row seat to what is happening inside a vehicle in cases of the driver pushing the emergency button. The NPC said despite good intentions, the efforts failed to strike a balance between security and privacy. The commission added that Grab had not given much thought to the risks passengers are being exposed to and “only the risks faced by the company were taken into account.” The NPC said while it “believes that the security of passengers and drivers is a primordial concern, their privacy rights must not be disregarded.” The commission sent a cease and desist order to Grab last Tuesday (Feb. 4) a few days after the NPC flagged Grab’s deficiencies in a notice issued on Jan. 31.  The Jan. 31 notice came long after Grab had already started its pilot test of the new security features, which began on Jan. 13 for 180 Grab vehicles in Metro Manila. The pilot test ran for two to six weeks with half of the number of cars being equipped with cameras while others equipped with audio recording equipment. At the launch of the pilot test, Grab said the new measures were another “layer of security” for drivers and passengers. Similar programs were launched in other countries, such as Grab in Jakarta and Uber in the United States. Grab had said it was complying with the Data Privacy Act but the NPC said the company failed to cite a legal basis for collecting passenger data. The NPC also said Grab was unable to establish if benefits outweighed risks and if the new security layer was the only way to achieve its objective. Grab had tried to downplay privacy concerns by saying that riders always had the choice to opt out without penalty after being informed in advance of the recording equipment. If the passenger consented, Grab said audio and video recordings would be encrypted and stored in Grab’s database for seven days for audio and 10 hours for video. The NPC, however, said details about how passengers could opt out were “not sufficiently communicated.” The agency added it was not clear how data processing would be done if consent had been withdrawn. The NPC gave the company 15 days from Jan. 31, or until the first half of February, to comply with proposed remedial measures. The measures were not specified. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The cease and desist order would remain in effect on a case-to-case basis for each of Grab’s data privacy programs until Grab had addressed the deficiencies cited by the NPC. The NPC clarified that the order was not a penalty, but an opportunity for Grab to fully comply with the law. The NPC stopped short of saying whether it would bar Grab from using the recording systems subject of the order. “The move, in effect, secures the riding public from unwanted privacy exposure,” said the NPC. It also gave Grab a chance to “modify its system to be complaint with the DPA,” the NPC added, referring to the Data Privacy Act. Grab has not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/152735/duterte-trump-grab-puso","title":"Duterte to Trump: ‘Grab them by the puso’","date":"11:31 PM February 20, 2017","snippet":"","body":" Click Here for article  "},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/118966/i-spent-p159088-on-grab","title":"I spent P159,088 on Grab","date":"05:02 AM January 19, 2019","snippet":"I’m not sure it’s possible to justify spending that much money, but what I learned from making that choice warrants discussion. I’m emotionally healthier than I’ve ever felt—at least, as far as traffic is concerned.","body":"I’m not sure it’s possible to justify spending that much money, but what I learned from making that choice warrants discussion. I’m emotionally healthier than I’ve ever felt—at least, as far as traffic is concerned. In 2018, I sat in someone else’s car and paid the equivalent of the household income of many Filipino families. With a click of a button—and more importantly, without the hassle of haggling the fare, reminding the driver to turn on the meter, or telling him that he is conveniently P1 short of my change—I asked more than 740 strangers to drive me, bring me food, or deliver a package. All the equivalent of a round-trip ticket to London—four times. I could have ridden a jeepney with the same amount to and from my work more than 8,800 times. I constructed a world of privilege in which very little of what I don’t have to deal with gets through the car window.  And I would do it all over again. The ill effects of traffic mismanagement, poor road conditions, bad drivers and equally inconsiderate pedestrians—all of us—are an old story. Metro Manila loses P3.5 billion a day due to traffic conditions, according to a 2017 report by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. This is about P1.2 trillion a year. If we consider the cash remittances of overseas Filipino workers  that same year at about P1.4 trillion, based on figures from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, this means 85 percent sent home by our hardworking loved ones is money down the sewage. Think of how much could also be available to manage our plastic pollution.  Traffic congestion does no better for our health. It is linked to stress, anxiety, anger and respiratory problems. Some of us get up early for work or stay longer to beat the rush-hour traffic. This means less sleep and less time spent with friends and loved ones—all linked to poor emotional health. Consider also that secure and safe attachment begins very early in life. Children with secure attachment become adults with higher self-esteem, greater self-reliance and lower rates of depression and anxiety. Every moment a baby or infant spends away from stuck-in-traffic parents or caregivers is lost investment in the future. Imagine also what we could be doing with all that lost time. In Manila, we spend a little more than one hour each day—or about 16 days a year—stuck in traffic, a 2017 Boston Consulting Group study says. With the average person reading at a speed of 280 words per minute, we could repurpose those days and read “Noli Me Tangere” 44 times. We could also lower our blood pressure by an average of 4-9 millimeters of mercury by walking, dancing or running for 30 minutes a day.  Medicines for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol might no longer have value-added tax starting this year, but traffic congestion means 800 lost opportunities to do a half-hour’s worth of aerobic activity—and for some, lost chances to reduce blood pressure better than some medication, according to the Mayo Clinic. With the time we spend in traffic, we could also learn basic Chinese—twice—and have sex 4,600 times, not including foreplay. Grab was my way of reclaiming lost time and money. I answered emails, held conference calls, prepared lesson plans, drafted talks and presentations. What you are reading now—I wrote some of it in a Grab. I did work—and worked hard to allow me to afford the amount I paid. All in the comfort of someone else’s car that I myself did not have to park, did not have to put gas in, and did not have to drive in the cruel and downright apocalyptic roads of Metro Manila. And I would do it all over again. My choice is afforded by privilege. It reeks of our fast-growing consumption culture and can even be questionably elitist. It is a shortcut for those who take advantage of venture capitalism at the expense of mom-and-pop workers. Many Filipinos have limited choice. I wish I did not have to pay for this extravagant amount. I am acutely cognizant of where that money could have been spent—savings, vacation, emergency funds, retirement, donations to improve waste management. However, I feel healthier, less stressed and get more work done. The local ride-sharing economy is not perfect. After Uber left the country in early 2018, Grab has a monopoly, effectively making it impossible for Hype, Owto, Hirna and other transport network companies to make big dents against Grab’s dominance. It is not clear if the efforts of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to break this virtual monopoly are working. Securing capital investments and getting riders continue to plague the competition.  And we suffer for it. Grab essentially controls the price—with ever deeper hands into our wallets. Surge pricing is also no joke. After more than 700 trips, I myself have noticed how increasingly difficult it is to book a ride. I do not expect these to change this new year. I also do not have high hopes for significant improvements in our public transportation, one that would be efficient and comfortable for commuters as well as profitable and fair for owners and operators. The Build, build, build (BBB) program might ease traffic congestion and improve transportation in the longer term. But I am a clinical psychologist who knows that one of the best predictors of future behavior is past behavior—because change is very hard. Knowing what you know about government-related projects in the past, how do you think the BBB will fare in the future? You already know the answer. So, as long as I can afford a ride alternative like Grab, I will take that opportunity and milk it for all it is worth. You should, too, because you deserve something better. You should not have to choose between sitting in a jeepney for 16 days and spending time with loved ones. You should be able to read Rizal’s great works and still have sex as many times as you want. I suggest including foreplay. The strength of exercising our choice is a threat to the passivity that is the essential feature of government inefficiencies and poor regulatory implementation. We need to exercise our choice for alternative rides. I choose Grab. Dr. Ronald del Castillo is professor of psychology, public health and health policy at the University of the Philippines Manila.

In August last year, the PCC put Grab Philippines under monitoring following its acquisition of Uber, its biggest competitor in the local market.  Done by an independent trustee, the monitoring is meant to cover a period of one year, during which Grab’s performance will be measured against its operations before the buyout deal in March last year. Through this, the PCC was hoping to see how far Grab had gone in restoring competition in the market, which should be similar to when Uber was still operating in the country.  For now, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said they were focusing on Grab’s fares, given how important the issue of pricing was to consumers. The problem, however, is that half a year worth of data from the monitoring report could not lead to any conclusive findings, he said. This is mainly because of questions surrounding the reliability of the data submitted by Grab.  “The data were supposed to be in their [Grab’s] system. So we’re dependent on that,” Bernabe told the Inquirer in a chance interview last week. “To the extent that it is generated by the system, it should be reliable. If it’s not within the system and it was generated some other way, then we have to determine whether that’s a credible way of preparing that data,” he added. This is not the first time that PCC has flagged Grab’s data. Last January, PCC fined Grab with P6.5 million for submitting “deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring.” He said PCC was still trying to understand certain issues about the data that Grab gave the independent trustee, such as how Grab came up with its pricing figures before and after the buyout deal. “So unless we are certain that the methodology is the same, we can’t make any conclusive findings at this point. The same problem [still exists] in the second quarter,” he said.  A PCC representative clarified that its monitoring report in the first quarter covered the period Aug. 10 to Nov. 10, 2018. The second quarter report, meanwhile, covered Nov. 11, 2018  to Feb. 10, 2019. In response to charges that it submitted “deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring,” Grab said in a statement in January that  it had “very limited time” to work on the data. Grab also questioned the fine slapped on it by the PCC then. “Is that a sufficient response? They made the voluntary commitments,” Bernabe said, noting the conditions that Grab had committed to comply with in exchange for PCC’s clearance of the buyout deal. After being fined last January, Bernabe said Grab had “attempted to make corrections.” It’s not clear at this point why those corrections are not enough. After seeing the monitoring reports, Bernabe said they sought clarifications from the company’s trustees on certain issues. He, however, did not give details on the said issues. When asked if this was the fault of international firm Smith & Williamson, the independent trustee that had also handled high-profile cases overseas, he said “it’s not the trustee, because the trustee is only going to work with the data that it gets its hands on.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/251538/pcc-cites-grab-price-hikes-decreased-service-quality-after-uber-acquisition","title":"PCC cites Grab price hikes, ‘decreased’ service quality after Uber acquisition","date":"03:12 PM May 28, 2018","snippet":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday.","body":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248514/grab-uber-deal-create-monopoly","title":"Grab-Uber deal to create ‘monopoly’","date":"05:13 AM April 03, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/259101/govt-fines-grab-uber-p16m-causing-undue-difficulties-merger-review","title":"Gov’t fines Grab, Uber P16M for ‘causing undue difficulties’ on merger review","date":"04:44 PM October 17, 2018","snippet":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal.","body":"The country’s antitrust body fined Grab and Uber P16 million for causing undue difficulties that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal. Top officials of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said Wednesday that the violations of these companies have made the review process unnecessarily difficult, despite clear orders against such actions.  Grab Philippines, now the largest transport network company in the country, would shoulder bulk of the fine. On the other hand, Uber would also be asked to pay despite having left the country already. The issue stems from a regional takeover deal earlier this year, wherein Grab acquired Uber’s operations here in Southeast Asia.  PCC previously flagged this, launching a review amid concerns that the deal might come at the expense of the ride-hailing public. “The fines are imposed for causing undue difficulties on the PCC review and decision making process,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo in a press briefing.  While the review was later set aside after Grab committed to make certain changes in its operations, the violations nevertheless still “prejudiced” the review process, according to Quimbo. These promised changes — called voluntary commitments — are currently being monitored. A violation could lead to more fines and even an unwinding of the deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments, she said. Broken down, both companies are collectively fined P4 million for failure to keep their businesses separate. Grab, for its part, has been penalized to pay P8 million for failure to maintain pre-merger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives, and service quality. Uber, as the acquired party, was fined P4 million or half of Grab’s fine for the same set of violations.  The company was given a reduced penalty since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered it to stop operations, despite PCC’s interim measures. Nevertheless, Uber was still fined because it was not entirely helpless in the LTFRB’s case. According to PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe, the company could have filed for a motion of reconsideration “if they were really keen on complying with the PCC order.” /kga"},{"url":"https://sports.inquirer.net/400680/nets-magic-grab-last-two-nba-playoff-spots-in-the-east","title":"Nets, Magic grab last two NBA playoff spots in the East","date":"12:08 PM August 08, 2020","snippet":"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida — The NBA playoff picture is getting a little clearer, and the Eastern Conference field of qualifiers is now set.","body":"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida — The NBA playoff picture is getting a little clearer, and the Eastern Conference field of qualifiers is now set. Brooklyn and Orlando clinched the last two remaining East spots Friday, meaning no play-in series — a new wrinkle added to the rules of the NBA’s season restart at Walt Disney World — will be needed on that half of the bracket.  Brooklyn secured its trip by defeating Sacramento 119-106. Orlando’s spot was clinched when Washington lost to New Orleans 118-107 later Friday, eliminating the Wizards from contention. The Nets and Magic will be No. 7 and No. 8, in some order, in the East playoffs. The No. 8 seed will face the Milwaukee Bucks in the opening round of the playoffs, which begin Aug. 17. The No. 7 seed could meet the reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors, who currently hold — but have not secured — the East’s No. 2 spot.  For the Nets, the clinching comes as something to savor in a topsy-turvy season. Kevin Durant couldn’t play at all because of his recovery from Achilles surgery — yet still got a $1 million contract bonus because Brooklyn made the postseason. Kyrie Irving missed much of the year because of injury, the Nets had several regulars opt out of participating in the restart, changed coaches in March and have used 24 players so far this season.  “It’s great to punch our own ticket into the playoffs,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. “I joked with the guys: I like my laundry being done, but nothing like doing your own laundry.” Orlando could have clinched with a win Friday, but lost to Philadelphia 108-101. The Wizards lost about an hour later, falling to 0-5 in the bubble. Washington was one of nine teams from the East who qualified for the restart, but has since fallen behind Charlotte into 10th place in the conference. Philadelphia’s win tightened the race for No. 4 in the East. The 76ers (42-27) are tied with Indiana for the fifth-best record in that conference, one game behind fourth-place Miami (43-26). The race for the last unclaimed playoff spot in the Western Conference remains close, with teams vying to grab the No. 8 spot and play the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. If the eighth- and ninth-place teams are within four games of one another when the seeding game schedule ends next week, there will be a two-game series to determine who gets the last playoff spot. Should that series take place, the ninth-place team would have to go 2-0 in a best-of-two series to advance.  Memphis remained alone in eighth out West, after the Grizzlies snapped a four-game bubble losing streak by beating Oklahoma City on Friday 121-92. The Grizzlies are one game ahead of Portland in the West standings. “We channeled what we’ve done all season long,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “We played Grizzlies basketball. Grizzlies basketball equals Grizzlies wins, more often than not. We hadn’t done that in the first four games.” San Antonio leaped idle Phoenix into 10th in the West by beating Utah 119-111, with the Spurs improving to 3-2 in the bubble. The Spurs (30-38) are one game behind Portland in the standings. “At the end of the day, we can’t control what they’re doing,” Spurs center Jakob Poeltl said. “We can only control what we’re doing. We’re going to take every game as it comes. We’re going to try to win every game.” Phoenix, Sacramento and New Orleans remain in the mix for a West play-in series spot.

Earlier, the PCC ordered Uber to continue its services beyond April 8, delaying Grab’s takeover of its operations in the country. Separate, independent  The PCC directed the two TNCs to maintain separate and independent operations pending its review of the deal between the ride-hailing firms. According to Cu, they decided to extend the operations of the Uber app until April 15 as they expect to meet with PCC officials this week to further discuss the March 25 deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region.  Cu said that since March 25, Grab has footed the cost of its rival app’s operations in Southeast Asia as drivers and riders migrated to its platform. He pointed out that if the PCC would insist that Uber continue operating during the review, this would “diminish the point of what they want us to do.” According to Cu, the PCC does not seem to understand the premise of Uber’s extension of its operations in Singapore for another week. Uber’s premise “The premise [of Uber’s April 15 extension in Singapore] was to help in the transition, not to create an indefinite operational structure for a company that has already left the region,” he said.  Leo Gonzales, Grab Philippines public affairs head, pointed out that even if the Uber app continued to operate in the country, the PCC should realize there was no back-end support left to take care of passenger complaints and safety issues in the event of an accident. This was also the issue raised by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) which said that since the signing of the deal, only two Uber employees remained in the country to work on the transition. Cu also said that the PCC’s worry that Grab’s acquisition of Uber would create a “virtual monopoly” of the ride-sharing industry was a matter best left to the LTFRB. Let LTFRB decide “Unlike other companies, we are governed by the LTFRB. We fully trust … that it is operating in the best interest of the riding public. If PCC thinks [the deal is] detrimental to the riding public, they should take it up with LTFRB,” he said. Currently, the LTFRB is in the process of accrediting three new TNCs. A fourth TNC has expressed interest in joining the ride-hailing industry although it has yet to submit an application for accreditation. Cu maintained that even if Uber was now a part-owner of Grab, there was “no integration of operations as it remained separate, and we’re not assuming control of the Uber app.” He explained that even if Grab was funding the app’s operations, the system was still being handled by Uber’s main office in the United States."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249694/grab-punishes-almost-500-drivers-unjustified-booking-cancellations","title":"Grab punishes almost 500 drivers over unjustified booking cancellations","date":"11:57 AM April 23, 2018","snippet":"","body":" Grab Philippines has meted sanctions on nearly 500 drivers last week following an internal investigation over mounting complaints against drivers who inexcusably cancel passengers’ ride bookings.

We promise to improve to provide the quality of service our passengers deserve,” he added. The Grab official said only 5 percent cancellation rate is allowed as metric for incentives.  Those with 10 percent and above cancellation rate per week may face sanctions such as suspension as well as removal and complete banning from the platform. Cu, however, urged their customers to also be responsible by maintaining minimal and valid cancellations, and keeping wait time to no more than seven minutes “Passengers with reported complaints my also face sanctions,” he noted.  /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/238044/singapore-airlines-grab-integrate-mobile-apps","title":"Singapore Airlines, Grab Integrate mobile apps","date":"05:20 AM October 06, 2017","snippet":"Singapore Airlines and regional ridesharing giant Grab announced a partnership on their mobile platforms and loyalty points.","body":"Singapore Airlines and regional ridesharing giant Grab announced a partnership on their mobile platforms and loyalty points. The companies, in a joint statement, said they had integrated their mobile apps, allowing customers to book Grab rides via the Singapore Air mobile app for trips to the airport. This will be allowed in six countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  According to both companies, Singapore Airlines’ mobile app users will see an option to book a Grab ride to the airport seven days before their scheduled flight. This option will then direct customers to the Grab app, where they can choose to hail a Grab ride to the airport. The airport will be automatically listed as the destination.  The user only has to provide the pick-up point and desired time. Moreover, GrabRewards members have the flexibility to convert their points into Singapore Airlines’ KrisFlyer miles.  “We have a shared commitment to innovation and delivering safe and high-quality travel experiences to passengers. At the same time, we are constantly making the Grab platform more rewarding for our customers,” Jason Thompson, head of GrabPay, said in the statement. “By integrating Grab’s and SIA’s loyalty programs, customers can look forward to using their points when they plan for their next holiday. This partnership is a significant recognition by one of the most prestigious airlines in the world and I’m incredibly excited about what we’re going to achieve together,” he added. Grab today is in more than 100 cities across seven countries including Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar. Singapore Airlines operates services to over 60 destinations in more than 30 countries on five continents worldwide. “We are constantly seeking to enhance our SingaporeAir mobile app and KrisFlyer program to ensure that we provide more benefits to our customers,” Campbell Wilson, Singapore Airlines senior vice president for sales and marketing, said in the same statement.  Grab, a fierce rival to Uber’s ambitions in Southeast Asia, earlier announced plans to raise as much as $2.5 billion to bolster its war chest. Grab said it was looking to tap China’s Didi Chuxing (DiDi), the world’s leading one-stop mobile transportation platform, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. to raise up to $2 billion. It said another $500 million would be raised from other investors. This was considered the largest single financing in the history of Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, Grab and Uber have tangled with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board over a 2016 state-ordered moratorium on the processing of new driver applications that both companies said was an obstacle to expansion."}]}
