Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon noted the increasing number of sellers of non-approved drugs in online platforms like Instagram and Facebook and e-commerce sites including Lazada and Shopee. “While I am pleased that our officials are pro-actively looking for viable solutions to help Covid-19 patients overcome the disease, I am alarmed over the proliferation of online sellers marketing and offering medicines not approved as a cure for COVID-19,” he said. “Online platforms are the usual marketplace for these types of businesses where they escape liability.” Biazon called on the Department of Trade and Industry to tighten the monitoring of e-commerce sites selling restricted medicines. He said the intense focus on Ivermectin as a potential anti-Covid medication has “inadvertently diverted” the attention on other drugs being repurposed as Covid-19 medicine, the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen. He also expressed alarm over the confiscation of some PHP9 million worth of smuggled Chinese medicines, including Lianhua, in February. “These smugglers are realizing that there is a viable market for the drug here in the Philippines. Had the Bureau of Customs not seized these contraband medicines, they would have probably ended up in the grey or black market,” he said. He said Ivermectin for human use was recently allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be produced only by one pharmaceutical company after it applied for registration, while Lianhua Qingwen is a prescription drug that should only be sold as such from drugstores and other authorized outlets. In an earlier House health committee briefing, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Linhua has been delisted by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) as a dangerous substance, but a regular doctor’s prescription was still required for purchase. According to the FDA, Lianhua is registered in the Philippines as a traditional Chinese medicine for respiratory illnesses and not as a Covid-19 medication. The drug, however, is an approved Covid-19 treatment for mild and moderate cases in China. While the FDA approved Lianhua Qingwen, the agency warned against the purchase of unregistered versions of the Lianhua Qingwen Jiaonang capsule, which had different labels aside from the prescribed English version.

Under IPOPHL's Memorandum Circular (MC) 2020-049, or the \"Revised Rules of Procedure on Administrative Enforcement Intellectual (IP) Rights,\" the electronic, digital, or online channels have been expressly included as part of the IEO's scope in exercising its enforcement functions.  “The exercise of IPOPHL's enforcement powers shall cover manufacturing, production, importation, exportation, distribution, trading, displaying, broadcasting, streaming and offering for sale, including other preparatory steps necessary to carry out the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods or contents to the public, including electronic, digital or online means provided that there is no pending case before any office, tribunal, quasi-judicial body, or court involving the same issue/s or subject matter,” the MC read.  The new rules also expanded IEO’s actions in response to an administrative complaint from a right holder regarding counterfeiting and piracy.  An enforcement order is served to, but not limited to, carry out the following actions:  Request removal of counterfeit goods or pirated goods or content, including advertisements in relation to such goods or content, or the blocking of access thereto, in coordination with the appropriate agency, body, or intermediary service provide;  Give cease-and-desist order;  Order the removal of counterfeit and pirated goods or content from physical establishments; and  Endorse and refer to other government offices the cancellation of permits and licenses, such as business permits.  Moreover, the expanded rules drastically shortened the standard period given to offenders for compliance with IEO decisions —now in 72 hours from the previous 60 days— ensuring faster corrective actions.  The IEO can now also conduct motu proprio monitoring in both online and physical marketplaces.  “Motu proprio monitoring allows the IEO to take on a more proactive approach and help brand owners screen markets of IP violating listings, with  prospects of reporting possible infringements to concerned IP right holders for their validation and appropriate action,” IPOPHL Director General Rowel Barba said in a statement.  Drawn up in response to heightened counterfeiting and piracy concerns online, the revised rules took effect a few days after Lazada and Shopee signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with various brand owners and business associations to build stronger industry-wide coordination.  With the MoU, the online marketplaces also adopted a swift, efficient and harmonized mechanism to take down counterfeit products and pirated works sold or distributed within their platforms.  “The new rules of the IEO and the MoU share common goals in weeding out IP rights infringers and safeguarding the public, whether they be brand owners or consumers. We believe with these new powers, IEO can better intercept counterfeiting and piracy, especially in the online space, and reduce the economic loss and reputational damage IP right holders, and consequently the Philippine government, suffer from infringements,” IEO officer-in-charge Director Ann Edillon said.  However, legislative amendments remain “immensely needed” for enforcement actions to keep up with the fast pace of piracy today, Deputy Director General for Enforcement Teodoro Pascua said.  “With the IP Code amendments we are requesting in Congress, we will have greater say in shutting IP infringing sites. Once a take-down order is served, the National Telecommunications Commission will automatically and immediately enforce it, without further evaluation as their systems can trust the expertise and competence of IPOPHL,” Pascua said.  To recall, piracy reports and complaints surged to a record-high of 121 in 2020, the year the Covid-19 lockdown compelled a massive shift to online transactions.  The 2020 figure also exceeded the total annual reports and complaints received in the four years from 2016 to 2019, strongly indicating an unprecedented trend of online counterfeiting and piracy that needs to be urgently addressed.  The interagency National Committee on IP Rights, which IPOPHL steers as vice-chair and acting chair, is also consolidating its value of seizures in 2020, which are initially appearing to be relatively high in comparison to previous years despite the limited operations due to the quarantine.  The report is expected to be released by IPOPHL within the first semester of the year.

IPOPHL signed the agreement with Lazada and Shopee on Monday to build a stronger industry-wide coordination mechanism against rising online counterfeiting and piracy.  Brand owners such as Unilever Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Philippines, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Philippines, Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc., Castrol Ltd., and Solar Pictures, Inc., as well as business groups Philippine Retailers Association and American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines also signed the MOU.  “Before, we used to experience delays especially on complaints on counterfeits and piracy. But with this MOU, we hope that there will be easier coordination and faster action on the part of platform owners to act on complaints of counterfeiting, not only coming from brand owners but especially from the IPOPHL and DTI (Department of Trade and Industry),” IPOPHL director general Rowel Barba said in an online press conference following the ceremonial MOU signing.  Barba added the agreement provides a self-policing measure that will help in cleaning up the marketplace from bogus products online.  Under the MOU, industry players agreed to use the notice and takedown (NTD) system, wherein rights owners can use the NTD procedures to remove contents on the e-commerce sites that have copyright infringement and other intellectual property violations.  It also drafted a feedback mechanism between e-commerce platforms and rights owners.  “With harmonized procedures and deeper ties with platforms, intellectual property rights holders are better able to notify e-commerce and request for swift actions necessary to prevent counterfeiters and copyright pirates from making a sale,” Barba added.  He said with the massive shift to e-commerce last year due to the pandemic, IPOPHL received the highest number of reports and complaints on intellectual property rights violations done online.  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Office received some 121 reports and complaints last year, apart from over 20,000 complaints at DTI-Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau, he said.  Barba said this initiative also aims to keep the Philippines out of the piracy watchlist that will give confidence to investors to bring in their brands and technology to the Philippines without the fear of their intellectual property rights being violated.  The MOU is an outcome of IPOPHL’s collaboration with the British Embassy in Manila under the UK Prosperity Fund Asean Economic Reform Programme.  In the same event, British Ambassador Daniel Pruce highlighted the need to protect intellectual property rights.  “Intellectual property protection is critical -- it’s critical to encourage innovation,” Pruce said. “So we need to build confidence in online transactions by creating a safe and reliable digital ecosystem which is beneficial for all online players in the marketplace.” (PNA)  "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1131878","title":"Insurance firm exec cites rise of sales through shopping app","date":" February 25, 2021, 6:22 pm","body":"MANILA – Banking on Filipinos love for shopping and the surge in online sales during the pandemic, an executive of Sun Life Philippines remains optimistic of their business as more people realize the importance of insurance.

This commitment was made as the government, through the Task Force Zero Hunger and alongside its partners in the private sector and other non-profit organizations, launched the \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" (PKG), a multi-sectoral anti-hunger initiative, which aimed at addressing involuntary hunger and food security in the Philippines on Monday. Margot Torres, private sector lead for the PKG movement, said the private sector has responded to the government's call for joint initiatives to end malnutrition and hunger being experienced by some Filipinos in different parts of the country. Torres said the private sector has translated the \"key responsibility areas\" of the National Food Policy into frameworks that can serve as a \"springboard\" for synergized initiatives and communication to end hunger issues among Filipinos. She said the PKG movement will be functional into four \"A\" frameworks: --Availability relates to food production by improving the productivity and income of the farmers and fisherfolk. It will also ensure a resilient food system. --Accessibility relates to distribution as well as ensuring 100 percent access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round. --Adequacy addresses hidden hunger with the vision of ending malnutrition experienced by children under five years old as well as pregnant women and lactating mothers. --Assistance that addresses hunger and ensures a resilient food system during crisis periods such as the current pandemic or natural disasters. \"While the long-term goal is to end hunger by 2030, we have set an immediate realistic goal of uplifting one million Filipinos from hunger and malnutrition by 2022,\" Torres said. She said the PKG programs will be pushed through in the priority areas with the highest poverty and malnutrition incidence. The Task Force Zero Hunger has identified 32 priority areas while the private sector has identified 17 more areas in 49 provinces nationwide. \"As the multisectoral collaboration continues, we have mapped out where in the Philippines there are existing programs to guide us in synergizing our efforts for both the present as well as the future,\" she said. Torres said they are targeting to include the public and partake in the PKG movement as she invited them to join the \"Lahat kasali, lahat kasalo\" initiative. \"We are preparing a consumer campaign and this will really invite the public to also participate even as low as 20 or 25 pesos to feed a hungry child so we're in the works,” she said. Torres noted that the campaign is set to be launched by April this year. Zero hunger movement Meanwhile, Task Force Zero Hunger chairperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said resolving issues on involuntary hunger in the country is a \"collective responsibility\" among the general public, the government, and the private sector. \"[It is] an imperative for all of us—the government needs the help of the private sector and other stakeholders to achieve our shared goals for zero hunger in the country,\" he said. Under the national food policy, Nograles said various programs and projects are lined-up to assist the food producers to sustain their livelihoods. The PKG movement also targets to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children by 2030 with the involvement of promoting breastfeeding and providing nutritious meals for every household.

Shining, shimmering, splendid are the best words to describe the face masks made by Randy Gomez and his wife Mina. They’re embellished with sequins, but nobody would ever think that they were made using backdrops from their photo studio “MRG Trading”. Since lockdown was imposed in March last year with events and other gatherings prohibited, Gomez had to think of a way to make use of all the sparkly backdrops supposedly meant for weddings, debuts, anniversary parties, and other events. “Di ba usually sa parties ang backdrop nila 'yung makikintab. Eh nung nag pandemic nawalan kami ng event. 'Yung mga tinda namin na backdrop, ang ginawa namin, binasag muna namin, ginawa naming face mask (Parties usually need shiny backdrops. When the pandemic started, we lost bookings. So we decided to cut the backdrops and turn them into face masks),” he told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in an interview. Gomez said one backdrop could make at least 100 face masks. To date, he and his wife have sold more than 4,000 masks that cost PHP40 each — quite affordable because they’re recycled. While he’s in charge of cutting the sequined backdrops, his wife sews them into face masks. “Meron kaming sewing machine dahil nagko-customize kami ng photography backdrop, photography bag (We have a sewing machine because we also customize photography backdrops and bags),” he said. Their stylish face masks are now among the top sales in digital stores like Shopee and Lazada — a feat they never saw coming. Gomez said buyers leave good reviews for their face masks because they not only keep them protected from Covid-19, but also get head-turns. “'Yung mga bumibili nagpo-post sila ng pictures, sini-send sa ’min. Usually nasa work sila. Sa work nila ginagamit kasi 'yung surgical mask, very common, pinapatungan ng sequined-face mask (Our buyers post photos then send them to us. They usually use them when they go to work. They use them over their surgical face masks),” he said. Apart from sequined-face masks, he said they also have other designs that cater to fans of floral, camouflage, and other patterns. Here to stay Now that limited gatherings are allowed as long as health protocols are observed, Gomez is thankful that clients are using their backdrops again but the demand remains low. “Bihira 'yung kumukuha ng photobooth kasi kung ikaw 'yung client, kukuha ka ng photobooth tapos ang pipictyuran is 10 visitors lang, mararamdaman mo na talo ka (People rarely want photobooths because if you were the client and get one to take photos of 10 visitors, you’ll feel like you’re at a disadvantage),” he said. Gomez remains hopeful that they would get back to business once the government kicks off their vaccine program. Because of the unusual shift from taking photos and selling photography equipment to making sparkly face masks, Gomez said he was initially embarrassed about having to sell them. However, he eventually grew to enjoy selling glamor face masks as it helped him sustain their family’s needs. “Nung una nahihiya i-post sa Facebook kasi siyempre puro pang babae 'yung pinopost ko, kaya lang dapat wala ka nang pakialam sa kritiko. Ang kailangan mo ngayong pandemic is mabuhay (At the beginning, I was embarrassed about having to post them on Facebook since they mostly cater to women but I realized I shouldn’t care about critics. What you need during this pandemic is a means to survive),” he said. Even if a large portion of the community becomes immune to Covid-19, Gomez said he still intends to keep selling fashionable face masks alongside their photography business. “Eto 'yung bumuhay sa ’min during pandemic so wala na kaming balak alisin ‘to kahit na bumalik sa dati 'yung photography (This what helped us survive during the pandemic so we have no plans of letting them go even if the photography business returns),” he added. Super-hero-themed masks Meanwhile, superhero fan, freelance graphic artist Rendell Sueña decided to design face masks that could make wearers feel like they have actual superpowers. Sueña owns a printing shop so it made perfect sense for him to make face masks with the help of his ninong (godfather) when they started losing customers due to pandemic lockdown. “Ang business ko po talaga nagtatatak ako ng shirts, tarpaulin pero nung nag-lockdown, humina 'yung business (My actual business is printing shirts, tarpaulins but during the lockdown, business slowed down),” he said. He started designing masks that were inspired by his favorite basketball teams and eventually expanded to include his favorite superheroes like Spiderman, The Hulk, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as well as anime characters like Dragon Ball, Voltes V, and Gundam. His face masks, which cost around PHP75-80, are also among the most preferred products in digital stores. “Gumawa rin ako ng concept kong design tsaka mga request ng customers ko nagbibigay ng pictures (I come up with my own designs but also accept requests from customers),” he said. Sueña considers his 93-year-old lolo (grandfather), Sofronio Porca, as a role model when it comes to design as he used to paint signages for stores in his younger days. “Ang lolo ko kasi artist din kasi siya. Magaling mag drawing, gumagawa ng signages—'yung mga sinaunang signages plywood, nagpipinta po siya (My lolo is an artist. He draws well, makes signages—those old signages on plywood, he paints them),” he said, adding that his lolo would also design posters which featured his favorite cartoon characters for his birthday. As a father to two kids, Sueña makes it a point to make sure his kids wear face masks others would envy. Designing face masks, he said, is an activity he enjoys doing so he doesn’t see himself stopping anytime soon. “Kung may nakita akong kumbaga natutuwa 'yung ibang tao sa gawa ko, natutuwa na rin ako (When I see people happy with the products I make, I feel happy too),” he said.

These are consistent with the Zero Hunger roadmap outlined in the National Food Policy unveiled by TFZH last month. PKG's initial projects include the following: -- Farmer assistance: With the end in view of elevating farming as a dignified and sustainable profession, these projects aim to increase farmer income by as much as 20 percent within the year, and to double farmer productivity by 2025 via the expansion of value chain projects and logistics improvements. -- Sustainable nutrition programs: Projects that will collectively work to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children across all households by 2030 via a strategy that involves campaigns to promote proper breastfeeding, address malnutrition, and roll out nutritious meals for Filipino households. -- Disaster response: Private sector companies will work to revolutionize their disaster response in close partnership and coordination with the attached national agencies and local government units to streamline the private sector’s efforts to facilitate a prepared, synchronized, and targeted action flow for food security when crises strike. -- Food banking: This effort involves the initiation of food surplus assessments among food manufacturers, restaurants, supermarkets, and public markets in Metro Manila, with the food surplus from donors eventually allocated for distribution to those in need. To promote these projects, to raise awareness regarding hunger, and to invite companies and organizations to join PKG programs, PKG is set to launch a public information campaign, the details of which will be accessible at pilipinaskontragutom.com.

The company was previously known as Bayad Center.  “Bayad supports digital payment and financial transactions for government institutions,” he said.  Bayad accepts payment for insurance, electronic phone load, loan payout, airline ticketing, remittance, and medical reimbursements.  It also accepts contribution and loan payments for several government agencies like Pag-IBIG Fund, and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), as well as payments for services of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and some local government units.  These payments can be done through Bayad’s branches nationwide and its 24/7 service through its online portal, Bayad Online.  Since Bayad has evolved into a full-service fintech, it has introduced a mobile app that is available through the App Store for iOS users and Google Play Store for Android users.  However, payments for government agencies that are currently available through the app are for NBI and Pag-IBIG.  “At the heart of this transformation is the mission to innovate payments and financial solutions for everyone,” Ferrer said.

He added Bayad is “transforming to keep pace with the times and people we serve” and is “guided by our belief that Filipinos deserve to be rewarded for their hard work.”  Bayad marketing head Wendell Labre told journalists in a Viber message that because most of their channels are physical branches, the number of transactions dropped when the government implemented lockdowns.  “However, we can share that our digital transactions (thru GCash, PayMaya, Lazada, etc) significantly increased to 30 percent of our total volume from 10 percent pre-pandemic,” he said.

However, he said due to the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, the task force sought to bring back the hunger incidence to the pre-pandemic level which was 8.8 percent. “With Covid-19, it doubled to 16 percent, then it rose to 20 percent and even to a high of 30 percent. But now it is back to 16. For 2021, our goal is to at least bring back the hunger incidence in the country to 8.8 percent, pre-pandemic,” he shared in a media interview during the first anniversary of the creation of the task force. President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 101 that created the task force in January 2020. He cited the “need to carefully coordinate, rationalize, monitor, and assess the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities to ensure a whole-of-government approach to eradicating hunger and achieving food security.” An SWS survey in 2020 showed 7.6 million Filipinos said they experienced hunger during the pandemic. Nograles said he recognizes this concern, adding that even the United Nations declared it was “impossible” for countries to achieve their zero hunger campaigns due to the problems brought by the pandemic. “The very essence of this task force is the recognition of the problem of hunger. That it persists despite previous efforts,” he said. National Food Policy Crafted in October last year, the National Food Policy aims to strengthen government agencies, both at the national and regional levels, and local government units to provide citizens necessary programs and interventions to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and attain sustainable agriculture. The policy is a detailed orientation for the efficient use of government resources. Nograles said the IATF on Zero Hunger created technical working groups to ensure coordination of government programs on hunger. Their key result areas highlight the review of existing policies, rules, and regulations related to hunger as well as ensuring the availability and affordability of food. The Department of Agriculture, for its part, highlighted its growth despite the series of challenges it faced last year. Agriculture Secretary William Dar said they are keeping their focus on raising the production value of farmers and fisherfolk to elevate their target in sufficiency levels of rice, corn, and livestock, among others. Nograles said the National Food Policy aims to ensure food security in the country by supporting farmers and fisherfolk through increasing their productivity and income. “The more food and agricultural products we have, the more we can ensure food prices and that we will never run out of food,” he said. The new policy will likewise ensure that food will not just be available but also accessible, by bringing agricultural products to the markets. “When President Duterte’s term ends in June 2022, the National Food Policy will formally be turned over to the next administration and hopefully they will accept and continue what we have started. The goal is to achieve sustainable development goal 2 which is Zero Hunger by 2030,” he said. He also mentioned the participation of the private sector through the Pilipinas Kontra Gutom campaign. It is a multi-sectoral movement composed of founding members Coca-Cola Philippines, Dole Philippines, J&J Philippines, McDonald’s, Metrobank, and San Miguel Corporation that have committed an initial 100,000 meals, and 3,000 infant kits to be distributed to areas in most need. Companies Lazada Philippines, RFM Corporation, Century Pacific Food Inc., Unilever, Gawad Kalinga, and RISE Against Hunger Philippines are also participants of the campaign. “The responsibility for ending hunger in the Philippines is in all of us. The Pilipinas Kontra Gutom ignites the Bayanihan spirit to call on all organizations and each and every Filipino to help our fellow Filipinos experiencing hunger and malnutrition,” he said.

Task Force Zero Hunger chairman and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles recognized the country's challenges on food production, distribution, and accessibility as well as hidden hunger and malnutrition, and immediate food needed during times of crises. \"While the public-private partnership is drawing up how we could address the complex problem that is hunger and malnutrition, we can’t forget those who remain to be hungry today,\" Nograles said on Wednesday. Introducing the 'Lahat Kasali, Lahat Kasalo' initiative, Nograles reiterated that hunger is one of the key priority areas of the government. Since the launch of the \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" program in November, the Task Force Zero Hunger and its private partners have been collaborating with the local government units (LGUs) nationwide to distribute immediate reliefs for communities affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and the recent typhoons. The \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" program is a multisectoral movement involving the government, the academe, non-profit organizations, private corporations, and the public, seeking to address issues related to involuntary hunger and food shortages during times of crises. Nograles said the program allows all organizations, companies, and concerned groups to contribute to the government's anti-hunger efforts which include supporting Filipino farmers and other food producers, advocating malnutrition, and providing relief assistance. Nograles, meanwhile, thanked Pilipinas Kontra Gutom's founding members from some of the country’s biggest corporations including Coca-Cola, Dole Philippines, J&J Philippines, McDonald’s, Metrobank, and San Miguel Corporation. \"We are grateful for the private sector members who are committed to provide aid to our fellow Filipinos, especially during times of crises,” he said. Pilipinas Kontra Gutom movement has been providing warm meals for Filipinos in several parts of the country including Bacoor, Caloocan, Manila, Makati, Pasig, Marikina, Parañaque, San Juan, Taguig, Quezon City, Camarines Sur, Albay, Catanduanes, Tuguegarao, Pampanga and Las Piñas. Under the movement, Nograles said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger aims to empower all food producers and boost their family income by helping them improve agricultural techniques and processes as well as supporting them in product marketing. Meanwhile, the Unilever Philippines, RFM Corporation, DOLE Philippines, Century Pacific Food, Inc., and Lazada along with their partnered-NGO implementer Rise Against Hunger Philippines (RAHP) joined the zero hunger movement by introducing the \"Noche Buena Para sa Lahat\" project which targets to provide 100,000 Noche Buena meal kits to the Filipino families this Christmas holiday season. On the other hand, some socio-civic organizations such as Gawad Kalinga and Kabisig ng Kalahi have tied up with the task force and aligned some of their programs with the Pilipinas Kontra Gutom movement’s cause. By virtue of Executive Order 101, President Rodrigo Duterte has created the Inter-agency Task Force on Zero Hunger to assess, coordinate, and monitor government initiatives to ensure a whole-of-nation approach to eradicate hunger. Pilipinas Kontra Gutom invites every Filipino to participate in the movement. People may visit www.laginghanda.gov.ph to join with the government's efforts to achieve zero hunger in the country.

Of the intellectual property violations this year, 79 were operating online – 53 from Facebook, seven from Shopee, six from Lazada, three from YouTube, and one each from Carousell, Instagram, and Vineyard. Seven other reported violators were caught operating in other online platforms. The IPOPHL also reported 43 complaints about counterfeit goods and 41 reports about piracy, while 51 were other intellectual property infringement reports not involving counterfeit and piracy. As the number of complaints on intellectual property infringement this year exceeded the reports for the past five years, IPOPHL director general Rowell Barba said they call for new rules to expand online monitoring authority. Barba said the agency’s Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Office (IEO) is proposing updates to the 2013 Rules and Regulations on Enforcement. “The primary objective of the revision is to add more disruptive enforcement functions to the IEO, such as clearly including online counterfeiting and piracy in its coverage, coordinating with the National Telecommunications Commission to take down intellectual property rights offending posts and monitor marketplaces proactively based on findings of the IPOPHL, and elevate issues found to intellectual property rights owners,” he noted.

During the plenary session, the chamber approved House Bill 7805, or the proposed Internet Transactions Act, with 232 affirmative votes, six negative votes, and no abstention. The bill seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services, and digital financial services. The proposed e-commerce bureau will serve as the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one-stop-shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. Valenzuela City Rep. Wes Gatchalian, author of the bill, said the proposed bureau will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet. “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he said. Gatchalian said the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low-value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee, and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to publish the details of their merchants; fail to examine goods related to food, drugs, cosmetics, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or are already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval.

Domagoso on Wednesday led a raid and the closure of two warehouses in Binondo for selling counterfeit beauty and cosmetic products and operating without business permits. After an investigation, the Manila Bureau of Permits said the products found at the two warehouses are sold through Shopee and Lazada and are delivered in various parts of the country. \"I think Shopee and Lazada should do some due diligence. It is not always the money, about earning, it's always about protecting your consumer,\" Domagoso said. He added that even the lessors of the two warehouses identified as Jerry Ong and Johnson Sy, failed to submit a business permit for wholesaler and occupational permits for service personnel, as well as a license to operate issued by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Domagoso served the immediate closure orders together with Bureau of Permits director Levi Facundo, and Manila Police District Special Mayor's Reaction Team (MPD-SMaRT) chief Maj. Rosalino Ibay. He clarified that while businesses are welcome to operate in Manila, they should acquire the proper permits needed to operate. Meanwhile, among those found inside the first warehouse include counterfeit products such as shampoos, lotion, body wash, bath bombs, and other high-end products bearing the brands of Unilever, Procter and Gamble, Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, and Bulgari. On the second warehouse, boxes of Johnson and Johnson's baby lotion, Cetaphil, bath soaps, and other medical cosmetic products, among others, were found. Domagoso warned the two popular online shops to strengthen their requirements in accepting sellers. \"If we are not going to receive proper explanation, you may be charged with certain liability because you're putting the citizens of Manila, the people of Manila at risk by allowing these products to be sold in your system,\" he said. He added that counterfeit beauty and cosmetics products may cause harmful effects to consumers. Domagoso also ordered Facundo and Ibay to coordinate with the National Bureau of Investigation and the companies involved for further investigation. Facundo said his office has coordinated with Lazada to countercheck if the sellers using their platform have business permits. Pursuant to Section 199 of City Ordinance No. 8331, both Ong and Sy may be slapped with a fine of not less than PHP1,000 nor more than PHP5,000 or imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than six months, or both, depending on the discretion of the court.

Together with Facebook, Shopee, and Lazada, USAID’s “Connecting Women Entrepreneurs to the Digital Economy” initiative will enhance Filipina entrepreneurs’ access to markets by equipping them with knowledge and tools to become effective online sellers. The initiative is under USAID’s E-PESO project, which supports the Philippine government’s transition from cash and checks to electronic payments for broader-based economic growth and financial inclusion. “Advancing women’s digital connectivity is key to increasing their economic empowerment as business owners in an ever-expanding digital world,” USAID Mission Director Lawrence Hardy II said. “USAID is pleased to support and collaborate with women entrepreneurs, the private sector, government, and other stakeholders in this initiative that will promote robust, inclusive growth and economic resilience.” This partnership, as part of the US government’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, will increase women entrepreneurs' access to financing, market opportunities, and training to establish and grow their businesses. DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez said the partnership “presents a great opportunity that can be harnessed in building back Filipino communities during the pandemic.” He said: “Women entrepreneurs, who are agents of innovation and change, will help bring the country towards digital connectivity, and contribute to rebuilding livelihoods, as the Philippines re-opens the economy and prepares for a better normal.” In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, businesswomen face struggles in their entrepreneurial journey as they balance their roles managing the household and caring for their families. Despite these barriers, global data underscores that supporting women-owned businesses advances prosperity.

It is an expression of the city’s inclusive governance — a leadership that listens to, cares for and trains young people,” SK Federation Beng Maximo said.Like last year’s convention, the 2020 edition featured a powerhouse of leaders, celebrities and influencers discussing various issues under theme “Youth Engagement for Global Action”.Taguig SK leaders launched on Aug. 24 the “Infodemic” campaign, which raised media literacy in response to the proliferation of mis- and disinformation during the pandemic.Team Ebs duo Angel Yap and Flow G led the Vlogging 101 webinar on Aug. 25. The next day, athlete Rachel Daquis discussed fitness and confidence while Lazada’s Petrus Carbonell followed with a discussion on e-commerce.Senator Pia Cayetano, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development, led the “Futures Thinking for Future Leaders” discussion on Aug. 27. Earlier in the day, Mind Museum resident scientists Mikee Estorga and Pecier Decierdo discussed climate change followed by Solenn Heussaff and husband Nico Bolzico who discussed relationships.On Aug. 28, Rocco Nacino and Melissa Gohing zeroed in on relationship goals and fitness while Bianca King tackled responsible citizenship. On the last day, Bubbles Paraiso met young people for self-care tips.Taguig 2nd District Rep. Lani Cayetano also showed her support for Taguigeño youth during the Taguig Youthcon 2020 by paying CICLs or Children In Conflict with the Law a visit at Bahay Pag-asa, a city-funded shelter established in 2015. This provides formation and education to children in conflict with the law.In one of the highlights of this year’s Youthcon, students thought up ingenious solutions to “new normal” issues with Youth Hackathon held on August 26-28.Hackathons gather people for a limited time to collaborate and come up with solutions to specific problems, that can range from information technology to development projects.In Taguig’s iteration, teams from different Department of Education schools discussed solutions to concerns in education, mental health, environment and sustainability, and transportation.Meanwhile, this year Youthcon also hosted \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Tournament\" on August 26-29, inspired by the success of e-sports at the 30th South East Asian Games hosted by the Philippines last year.“Investing in the youth is investing in the future, which is why we should continue to develop and empower the youth of the city. Let this be evidence that Taguig sincerely believes in young people, and that we are ready to train them and give them opportunities for growth whether or not a pandemic exists. Our commitment is timeless and resilient.” Cayetano added.

Four business establishments in Binondo, Manila were closed by the Bureau of Permits and Licensing Office (BPLO) of Manila led by Levi Facundo and Major Jhun Ibay of the Manila Police District Special Mayor’s Reaction Team (MPD-SMaRT) on Thursday. Domagoso said in a public address over Facebook that calling Manila as a province of China is “unacceptable\". “Una, misrepresentation at pangalawa, ang Binondo ay bahagi ng Maynila at ang Maynila ay Pilipinas. Ang Maynila ay capital ng bansa, hindi ito probinsya ng China at ni minsan hindi ito naging bahagi ng China sa anumang lathalain o kasaysayan na naitala. Hindi katanggap-tanggap sa'kin bilang Pilipino, bilang Manilenyo (First, its misrepresentation, and second, Binondo is part of Manila and Manila is in the Philippines. Manila is the capital of the country, it is not a province of China, and never in history that it has become a part of China. This is totally unacceptable for me as a Filipino, as a Manilenyo),” Domagoso said.Domagoso identified the company as Elegant Fumes Beauty Products Inc., which has its address printed on the labels of their product at “1st floor, 707 Sto. Cristo St, San Nicolas, Manila, Province of China”. He said that while it is true that the biggest Filipino-Chinese community in the country is in Binondo, he will never allow any foreigner to \"bully\" Manila. “Pumanatag kayo, hindi natin hahayaan ang mga superpower na yan na para bang tayo’y pinipitik-pitik sa mata at binabalewala ang sovereignty.

I will never allow this act of another country of slowly claiming that Manila is theirs),” Domagoso said. Moreover, Facundo said the business establishment was also found to be violating rules and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He said it is nowhere indicated on the products any \"batch/lot number\" and \"name and address of the company or person responsible for placing the product in the market.\" Facundo said these are important information that needs to be printed on the packaging of the products as required by law. \"This is not a minor violation because this is a misrepresentation, and this means that you are selling your products with wrong information,\" Facundo said in Filipino. He added that his office will also revoke the mayor's permit of the corporation. The FDA is also set to cancel the license to operate of Elegant Fumes Beauty Products Inc. due to the various issues. Calls for deportation The business is said to be owned by two Chinese nationals and three Filipinos. Authorities identified the Chinese nationals as Shi Zhong Xing and Shi Li Li. Domagoso said he wanted the two Chinese nationals operating the business establishment to be deported back to China. “I will formally ask the Bureau of Immigration to deport and declare these two Chinese nationals as undesirable aliens in violation of existing rules and regulations in doing business in the city of Manila, and for misrepresentation that they seem to be claiming Manila as part of China,” Domagoso said in a mix of English and Filipino. Four other establishments were served the closure order for selling beauty products with imprints stating their address at “Manila, Province of China”. Domagoso likewise called on the management of online stores like Shopee and Lazada to be aware of the incident and make sure that their stores are selling products bearing correct information.

During the virtual launch of the Unionbank-Lazada credit card Friday, Union Bank of the Philippines (Unionbank) senior vice president and card business head Antonio Sebastian Corro said consumers’ behavior changed during the implementation of the community lockdowns because online purchases rose while face-to-face transactions declined.  Corro said there was a significant rise in electronic commerce (e-commerce) for basic goods like food, clothing, and groceries.  He, however, said overall credit card usage is down.  “This is mainly, obviously, because a lot of shops have been closed and second, the biggest factor is travel. There’s no travel. And a lot of usage for cards is really for travel and entertainment…So that is hundred percent down,” he added.  Corro said spending is “really focused domestically”, adding a lot is moving to e-commerce.  During the same briefing, Lazada country chief marketing officer Neil Trinidad said transactions for groceries rose 15 times since the lockdown, and demand for hygiene products like alcohol and household cleaning materials grew 10 times.  Trinidad said demand for electronics, fashion times and general merchandize also posted expansions.  He said consumers are spending and using online transactions “two times more.”  “So it’s really a time of massive acceleration across all categories and I’m really seeing new behaviors starting to shift during this pandemic,” he added.  This demand is among the factors for the tie-up for a credit card powered by Mastercard.  Corro further said people can apply for the card electronically through the Unionbank’s website and the Lazada app.  He said the annual fee will be free for the first year and card validity is five years.  Card limit will depend on the qualification of the applicant and while there will be no cash-back promos, cardholders who use their cards will automatically be given six Lazada points, to be placed in their Lazada Wallet, per PHP200 spent on the app. (PNA)  "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1110771","title":"VAT on e-commerce sites to hurt consumers: solon","date":" July 31, 2020, 5:42 pm","snippet":"MANILA – A party-list lawmaker on Friday warned against imposing a 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) on e-commerce sites as this would ultimately hurt consumers.","body":"MANILA – A party-list lawmaker on Friday warned against imposing a 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) on e-commerce sites as this would ultimately hurt consumers. In a statement, Bagong Henerasyon Rep. Bernadette Herrera said the proposed VAT would be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher prices. Herrera called the move “totally unacceptable at this time of economic uncertainty.” She also warned that aside from consumers, small-time businesses and sellers would also be directly affected by the imposition of a 12-percent VAT on popular online shopping platforms, such as Lazada and Shopee. “It’s not good to impose undue administrative burden associated with VAT on Lazada and Shopee, which have been of great help to small businesses and budding entrepreneurs,” Herrera said. These online shopping platforms, she said, play a big role for consumers as the government promotes contactless transactions amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Herrera noted that these shopping platforms have been a source of alternative livelihood for Filipinos affected by the public health crisis. “Many of our kababayans (who) have lost their jobs due to the pandemic had to resort to selling products and services online just to make ends meet,” she said. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Committee approved a proposal imposing a 12-percent VAT on digital transactions in the country. It seeks to amend Section 105 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) by taxing digital service providers that operate through online platforms. Digital services include online licensing or software, updates and add-ons, website filters and firewalls, mobile applications, video games, and online games, and webcasts and webinars. Also included are the provision of digital content, such as music, files, images, text, and information; online advertising spaces; electronic marketplaces; search engine services; social networks; database and hosting; and online training, among others. Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, panel chair, said no new taxes would be imposed, as he guaranteed exemptions for small businesses. “If your sales are below PHP3 million, you are exempt from paying or filing VAT. If your net income as a sole proprietor is below PHP250,000, you are exempt from paying and filing income taxes. So, the small Facebook online seller will not be taxed. I guarantee you,” Salceda said. Some 77 percent of the projected revenues would come from upper-middle-income families and above, he said, adding that only 0.04 percent of all revenues from this proposal would come from the bottom 20 percent of the population.

The tourism chief has made the assertion following the release of the Philippine Tourism Survey: Covid-19 Edition conducted by Isla Lipana & Co./ PwC Philippines (PwC). Results of the survey show that 63 percent of tourism players expressed optimism that their respective businesses will be back on track by 2021. “If we want to get back on our feet sooner than anticipated, we need to rethink our strategies and use technological advancements to promote the health and safety protocols in the new normal. This, coupled with the implementation of industry-wide best practices, will provide clients with excellent service and guarantee a pleasant customer experience,” Puyat added.

Valenzuela Rep. Wes Gatchalian, panel chair, said the proposed Internet Transactions Act seeks to regulate all business-to-business and business-to-consumer commercial transactions conducted over the internet, including those related to internet retail, online travel services, digital media providers, ride hailing services and digital financial services. Gatchalian said the e-commerce bureau will be the “central authority” tasked to regulate online trade and shall act as a virtual one stop shop for consumer complaints on internet transactions. He said the proposed bureau “will only have authority over those activities which are currently not regulated but are nevertheless conducted over the internet.” “Any regulation of the eCommerce Bureau that may affect regulated industries shall only be ancillary to the government agency or instrumentality exercising primary jurisdiction over that specific activity,” he added. According to Gatchalian, the bill will not cover consumer-to-consumer transactions, or those considered petty, one-off, or occasional low value transactions. Under the bill, online e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee and Zalora shall share solidary liability with their own merchants if these platforms fail to exercise extraordinary diligence to prevent any loss or damage to the consumer; fail to take necessary measures against products sold on their platforms that do not comply with law; or fail to publish the details of their merchants, among others. The proposed law makes it illegal to cancel orders for food and/or grocery items made via ride hailing services when the said items have already been paid by or is already in the possession of the ride hailing service partner or in transit to the consumer. It will also be illegal to “unreasonably shame, demean, embarrass, or humiliate ride hailing service partners.” A consumer, however, may cancel an order if the delivery of ordered food or grocery items was delayed for at least an hour from the expected time of arrival due to the fault or negligence of the ride-hailing service partner. To encourage businesses to go online and for foreign organizations to choose to register with the e-commerce bureau, the Department of Trade and Industry will be required to lead the establishment of an industry-led eCommerce Trustmark. “This Trustmark will represent safety and security in internet transactions which will ultimately build consumer confidence and lead to a robust growth of the internet economy. As consumers, you will want to deal with entities which have been given this seal of approval. As a merchant, you would want to have this Trustmark on your website so that your consumers can transact with peace of mind,” he said.

The Connecting Women Entrepreneurs to the Digital Economy project of DTI and the private sector aims to equip businesswomen with knowledge in maximizing the use of digital platforms to expand and boost their businesses.  The project will provide integrated digital marketing training on online storefronts, implementing digital marketing promotions, and leveraging digital payments to become effective online sellers.  “This presents the biggest opportunity we can harness in building back our communities during this period of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In the virtual Kapihan sa Manila Bay, Lopez said around 1,000 complaints were filed in the first quarter of the year, and the rest were received in the second quarter.  Online transactions increased in the past months as the quarantine measures restricted the movement of people.  The DTI chief said consumers’ trust issues in transacting online, along with a lack of confidence in using digital payment, is one of the main challenges in domestic e-commerce.  “If these two trust issues will be resolved, we will grow our e-commerce,” he said.  Lopez expressed his support for House Bill 6122, or the Internet Transactions Act, that aims to regulate enterprises using online platforms and protect consumers in transacting online.  The bill also requires online sellers to register their businesses.  Lopez encouraged online businesses to register their activities as business registration serves as a “seal of trust”, which will help them build trust with their customers and also grow their businesses.  In the same online forum, Valenzuela City 1st District Rep. Weslie Gatchalian said registration and regulation do not mean automatic taxation.  Recently, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) ordered online businesses to register activities.  The government also clarified that those with annual net income of below PHP250,000 are exempted from paying tax.  “What the House Bill 6122 is proposing is to ask all MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), all online platforms who are transacting right now to register. House Bill 6122 seeks to also regulate all of them -- be it small-scale or large-scale like Amazon or Lazada. We all have to register so that the government can regulate,” Gatchalian said.  He added the government will be able to help and protect these online businesses if they will register.  Gatchalian said the government is not targeting online businesses just to regulate or collect taxes, but also to provide a level playing field to MSMEs with physical stores that are registered and regularly paying rents and taxes.  Gatchalian said the internet economy in the country only contributed 2.1 percent to the gross domestic product.  The gross market value of e-commerce in the country in 2019 reached around USD7 billion, relatively low compared to Southeast Asian neighbors like Malaysia at USD11 billion, and Indonesia at USD40 billion.  This despite the fact that the number of mobile phones in the country is higher than its population, with one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world at 67 percent, and one with the most number of active social media users of around 73 million users.

As a result of the community quarantines imposed across the country, many MSMEs, including those from the indigenous communities are having a difficult time selling their products because the movement of people, as well as access to traditional markets, is restricted. \"In order to continue operating and generating revenues during the community quarantines, entrepreneurs have started shifting to online markets. This is currently where all the action is so if the businesses that were shuttered for the past three months are thinking of resuming operations immediately, online is the way to go,\" Angara said. In his comments on President Duterte's 12th report to Congress on the implementation of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, Angara told the DTI to ramp up its efforts to assist MSMEs in tapping the online market as a way to restart their operations. He cited the case of the community weavers from Batangas who have no one to sell their products to right now because of the restrictions on travel. Based on a report, the weavers are now considering a shift to selling fish and vegetables once they are able to sell their remaining inventory. “It would be a shame to lose our cultural heritage due to this pandemic. These are traditions that are worth preserving and I’m certain there will be a strong demand for these products once access to them is made available,” Angara said. Recognizing that shifting online could be more difficult for some than others, Angara said the DTI should also explore ways to get the products of communities in far flung areas, the IPs and anyone who relies on traditional methods of selling, to market whether it is online or not. Angara also urged the Department of Agriculture and DTI to ramp up its efforts to make the products of farmers and fisherfolk available online. A strong advocate of the development and promotion of local industries, Angara, through his “Tatak Pinoy” platform, is constantly finding ways to help grow small businesses through innovation, developing supply chains and access to markets. Angara lauded the DTI on its plans to boost local products and industries, and launch a national media campaign to encourage Filipinos to “Shop Local. Eat Local. Travel Local. Buy Local.” He encouraged the DTI to continue building partnerships with e-commerce platforms such as shopinas and Lazada to make “Go Lokal!” products available for orders and delivery. \"This is as good a time as any to introduce these groups and other MSMEs to selling their products online. They should take advantage of this opportunity to tap this market that continues to grow especially now when most Filipinos would rather stay at home than go out,\" Angara said. “We encourage our online shoppers to support small businesses, as well as our local industries by buying Philippine-made products.

In an interview during the Laging Handa PH program aired over state-owned PTV Wednesday, Guballa said small business owners need not worry about registration and about paying taxes if their earnings do not exceed PHP250,000 annually since they are exempted from paying income tax.  He said registration fee for online sellers is PHP500 and that is the only fee they need to pay unless they do not qualify for tax exemption.  “What we want to tax are the big businesses involved in digital transactions like Lazada and those operated by foreign entities like Netflix,” he added.  Guballa further said the call for business owners with digital operations to register with BIR has been made since 2013.  “We just reiterated recently because the number of businesses engaged on online selling rose during the lockdown,” he said.  Guballa said what the government wants is to collect value-added tax (VAT) from big businesses using digital transactions.  For service providers that have main offices overseas like Netflix, Guballa said tax that will be collected is VAT since its service is being consumed locally.

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda filed House Bill 6765, which seeks to establish a fiscal regime for the digital economy. “No new taxes here, we just want them to pay their fair share. Assuming you’re a company that sets up in the Philippines, and you do video-streaming or music-streaming services, you will definitely pay taxes. But companies like Netflix and Spotify don’t. That’s obviously not fair,\" he said. When you’re a network in the Philippines, advertising services paid to you will be subject to VAT [value added tax]. But Google and Facebook are not subject to VAT for advertising. Ang laki po ng kinikita nila sa mga Pilipino, pero ni isang kusing ng VAT, wala,” he added. Salceda said the bill responds to the increased urgency of finding new sources of revenue to fund the country’s efforts to recover from the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and anticipates the increasing digitization of the country’s economy. He said that this tax administration proposal aims to fairly capture the value created into the tax system, which will lead to five key changes to the way the digital economy is currently taxed. The bill seeks to make “network orchestrators” like Grab, Angkas, and other similar services as withholding agents for income taxes, to ease their partners of the burden of having to pay their own taxes, while also encouraging tax compliance. It shall clarify that services rendered electronically in the course of trade or business are liable to VAT. It would also clarify that digital advertising by internet giants such as Google and Facebook and subscription-based services such as those of Netflix and Spotify are subject to VAT. Network orchestrators for lease services such as Airbnb and electronic commerce platforms such as Lazada and Shopee shall be made withholding agents for VAT. The bill requires those who render digital services to do so through a resident agent or a representative office in the Philippines. This seeks to address the issue of companies having a significant presence in the country without having a physical establishment in the Philippines not being liable for tax and regulatory purposes. Salceda noted that the bill ensures consumer protection, as most of these companies are considered “runaway services”. “Kapag may reklamo ka, paano mo sisingilin, wala namang opisina sa bansa, kaya wala naman kaming pwede panagutin (If you have a complaint, how would you hold them responsible, if there is no physical office in the country? There is no means of accountability),’ he said. Salceda also added that his tax proposal will not affect social media users who do not advertise on these platforms. “If anything, these social media platforms need you, the user, to keep using, so that they could earn from digital advertising, the same way TV networks need viewers so they could get advertising contracts. So, the usual social media channels will definitely remain free,” he said. “The whole idea that somehow, this bill will make social media networks charge users who don’t advertise, that’s a bad reading of the proposal,” he added.

In a press conference in Quezon City on Thursday, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) officer-in-charge Gregorio Pimentel said Charlene “Cindy” Mecayer, 24, was nabbed at the Greenwood Executive Village in Barangay Sta. Ana. Taytay, Rizal for selling illegal drugs online. Mecayer yielded PHP68,000 worth of shabu, three ecstasy tablets worth PHP4,500, PHP500 buy-bust money and various drug paraphernalia. Aside from selling drugs, he said Mecayer even shows how to use the paraphernalia on social media. Meanwhile, Mecayer's alleged supplier Emily Patanao Dudley, 60, was arrested and yielded PHP340,000 worth of shabu in a follow-up operation in Pasay City. \"This is a new trend (and) challenge PDEA (is) facing today. Illegal drugs were now rampant with the said platforms, (online transaction and transport services),\" Pimentel told reporters during the press briefing held at PDEA headquarters in Quezon City. Aside from these, drug suspects are also using 'deep webs' and 'dark webs' for their transactions as these networks are not visible to search engines and require the use of an 'anonymizing browser'. PDEA has already informed e-commerce firm Lazada of the alleged selling of drug paraphernalia on its platform. Pimentel, meanwhile, said PDEA plans to request the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to look into the use of ride-hailing and courier service apps for these illegal activities. The suspects are currently detained at PDEA and will be facing charges for violating Sections 5 and 12 of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

Through the Partnership Against Hunger and Poverty (PHAP), a convergence of services by DAR, Department of Agriculture, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of the Interior and Local Government and other participating government agencies, the government agency aims to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger nationwide. Agrarian Reform Support Services Office (SSO) Undersecretary Emily Padilla said PHAP’s goal is to connect 5,228 agrarian reform beneficiaries or the agrarian reform beneficiaries’ organizations (ARBOs) to an institutional buyer for them to have an established market. “We are currently talking with institutionalized markets like Lazada and Gerry’s Grill, which has 117 branches so that our ARBs would have regular markets to supply their farm products,” Padilla said in an interview. She added that as the current PHAP would be launched into an Enhanced PHAP, they would approach other institutions like the Department of Health, Department of Education, DSWD, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and other government agencies, where the ARBs could also supply their products. Meanwhile, DAR Policy, Planning, and Research Office Undersecretary Virginia Orogo said the PHAP program, while it boosts the lives of the farmers, will also ensure food security in the country. “We can achieve this by providing our farmers with support services packages as soon as they receive the lands awarded to them,” Orogo said. DAR-PHAP has covered 27 provinces for 2019, which include Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugo, Kalinga, Mt. Province, Quirino, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Palawan, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur I, Camarines Sur II, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, Masbate, Negros Occidental, Southern Leyte, Biliran, Zamboanga Norte, Zamboanga Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Misamis Occidental, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur.

In a briefing on Tuesday, BPI Chief Operating Officer Ramon Jocson said they have 8.5 million accounts, 1.8 million of which have passbooks.  Jocson said new account holders usually access the bank’s electronic channels once they open their accounts.  “The challenge for us is for those who have accounts with us, ATM (automated teller machines) accounts that have not gotten to the branches yet to apply for an online account,” he said.  Jocson, however, said that once the account holders realize the advantage of accessing the digital platform, “the adoption is quite fast.”  “But it (the challenge) is really trying to reach out to them to involve them,” he said.  “So our target right now is to get to at least 50 percent (of the account holders to use the digital platform) by the end of the year,” he added.  Domestic banks are keeping up with technological innovations and changes in the financial landscape to ensure they are able to fully cater to their clients.  Asked how much BPI has allocated for their technology-related spending, Jocson declined to give specific figures, noting that “it is a part of our whole IT (information technology) budget.”  He said major banks in Asia allocate about 7.5 percent to 8 percent of their total revenues to IT budget.  “We also allocate about the same level,” Jocson said, noting, however, that “within that, we now have to mix digital finances with that of other IT-related expenditures.”  “We have to mix that because it’s very hard also to overspend,” he added.  On Tuesday, the bank launched its digital ecosystem, which has two components -- Open Banking and BPI Digital Platforms.  BPI Chief Digital Officer Noel Santiago said open banking is “far reaching and with near-limitless possibilities.”  “We are capitalizing on this to grow our network of trusted partners so that clients can easily and conveniently transact via one app or website,” he said.  The bank has partnered with nine entities with 36 services, such as Lazada, GCash, and Paymaya, to further aid their clients’ needs.  It also launched its conversational banking app called “Bea of BPI”, which serves as a personal banker.

That was in 2017, when his parents did not like his idea that it took him six months to convince them to invest. In January 2018, the Pandalivery app was born, which he outsourced. Buelva described Pandalivery as a \"minimized Lazada, but for the locals.\" \"It's a localized platform, not just for the (app) users. It really helps the province, online store owners,\" he said. One could purchase various items using the Pandalivery app -- from over-the-counter medicines, clothes from \"ukay-ukay\", to groceries and food. Pandalivery enables small businesses to have an app to expand their market and sell their products, he explained. At present, Pandalivery operates in the cities of Naga and Legazpi, but Buelva targets to roll this out soon in Daet, Camarines Sur. \"We would like to uplift the provinces using our services,\" he said. The third year IT student from Ateneo de Naga has 90 partners selling via the Pandalivery app. From being on his own and using his brother's motorcycle, he now has 15 driver-partners and 10 dispatchers. He gets an average of 120 orders per day, too. Buelva said partner-drivers earn from commissions. \"Some of them earn an average of PHP800, which is higher than our PHP300 local minimum wage,\" he said. One could order via the Pandalivery from 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., for a minimum delivery charge of PHP35, depending on the distance. The items displayed on the app are those that are available in the store owner's stock. The buyer could also choose the expected time of delivery. In case of a defect in the items purchased, Buelva said Pandalivery would pick these up and have these replaced by the store owners. As part of customer service, the items will be delivered back to the buyers, free of charge, he said. Buelva was at the IdeaSpace event in Makati City last Tuesday, where Pandalivery and other startups showcased their products. \"I joined the (IdeaSpace) community because I like to learn from them. I'm still a college student and I don't have so much of an entrepreneurial mindset,\" he said. The young entrepreneur said he would like to reach more provinces in the future, and give small businesses a chance to develop something without spending too much. He said those who would like to partner with Pandalivery may give him a call and see the details in Pandalivery's website. \"(At Pandalivery), we prioritize the locals. We aim to provide them with more affordable local retail products,\" Buelva said.

On the other hand, Lopez affirmed the bright prospects for online retail platforms like Zalora in the Philippines with the rising income here, as well as its tech-savvy and young population. “The robust Philippine economy under the Duterte administration leads to a growing middle class that has greater purchasing power. The generally young population is also tech-savvy. This provides the perfect market for Zalora’s brand and its e-commerce business model,” he noted.

Its report showed that Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, and eBay were the most visited e-marketplaces in the Philippines in the second quarter of the year. “The rationale behind the dominance of the international players in PH e-marketplace is because Filipinos’ online shopping preference is mainly based on brand familiarity,” the iPrice Group report read.

Carranza said combined personnel of Tinglayan Police and operatives of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) arrested the four suspects. Initial police investigation shows that before their arrest, suspects were on-board two motorcycles coming from Barangay Buscalan, Tinglayan, Kalinga heading towards Santiago City, Isabela when they were flagged down on a checkpoint. Almost a kilo of dried marijuana leaves with an estimated market value of PHP812, 500 was confiscated from the suspects. Carranza also reported on Monday the arrest of two persons for illegal possession of firearms. The police officer identified those arrested as Peter Dangiwan Chinalpan, 48, a construction worker from Upper Pinget, Baguio City, and Johnson Sawac Tindo, 25, a farmer from Lam-ayan Bangao, Buguias. Confiscated from Chinalpan and Tindo were different types of unlicensed handguns and ammunitions. The suspects are now in police custody and facing criminal cases for violation of RA 9165 known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act of 2002 and RA 10591 known as Illegal Possession of Firearms.

Why not? Shopping online is fast and convenient, allowing one to shop even at midnight while in pajamas. The purchased stuff is even delivered right to the buyer's doorsteps. More than seven in 10 Filipinos (71 percent) shopped online on their personal computers in 2016, compared to only 60 percent the year before. Plus, one in two Filipinos is making purchases online through a mobile phone. That's according to Zalora, a global leader in the fashion e-commerce sector and one of the first ones to bank on the Philippines' fertile online market. Zalora is also present in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Lazada, another popular online site in the Philippines, estimates the local e-commerce market now at 10 million people. One of them is Likha Cuevas Miel, a financial journalist, who spent PHP8,000 on Christmas gifts for her family members and relatives. This year, she purchased from online marketplaces Lazada.com and Amazon.com. Miel said these gift items include electronics, clothes, books, watches, and art materials. “I don’t want to go to malls anymore, I have no time. Traffic is horrendous; there are no parking spaces,” she said. Miel further said she can purchase from online shops for items that are not available in the country. She noted online shops also offer discounts. Edna Plazo Cocoy, a real estate broker, said she has been increasing her e-commerce purchases during the Christmas season. Cocoy said she started buying online last year. “Buying online enables me to avoid the hassle of crowded shopping malls, especially during this season,” she noted. Jio Zorilla, Lazada Philippines Brand Management and Communication Lead, said their online sales during the holiday season are four times higher than normal days. “I personally think it is because you don't want a stressful Christmas -- avoid the holiday rush, long queues, etc.,” he said. Zorilla said top selling products on Lazada’s marketplace are consumer goods, face makeup, diapers, mobile phones, and fashion accessories. For his part, Zalora Philippines chief executive officer Paulo Campos said online sales increase dramatically during the holiday season. “What we see in the profile of our growth is that the fourth-quarter, in general, has been much stronger growth than the first three quarters of the year,” he said. Campos attributed Zalora's higher sales to the success of its mega pick sale days last November 11 (11-11) and December 12 (12-12), its highest days in terms of revenues this year. “Fourth-quarter 2016 was also strong. The fact it’s growing faster suggests that there is something about the behavior of Filipino shoppers. People are buying more of their Christmas gifts online… So that bodes well for us,” he added. Lazada also had a similar sales promotion this year. (PNA)"}]}
