Stella Quimbo on Wednesday said Grab would continue to monopolize the ride-hailing market if transport authorities do not allow the entry of motorcycle taxi operators. In a statement, Grab said Quimbo’s statement revealed that on-demand and platform-based motorcycle taxis were “effectively competing” with Grab, as withdrawing motorcycle taxis would limit consumer choices on transportation. “It is in the same spirit that we respectfully seek the PCC to review the basis for defining the competitive market in which ride-hailing services operate,” Grab said in a statement. It said the ride-hailing competitive market could also be broadened to include street-hailing transportation such as taxis. “Right now, what we hope for is to review the basis for defining the competitive market and that would include motorcycle taxis and taxis as well,” Grab said. It said the voluntary commitments (VC) made by Grab with the PCC to improve service quality, pricing and transparency following its acquisition of then competitor Uber, were “totally different” from their call to review the definition of the ride-hailing market. “We cannot right away apply for release from VCs because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release. That’s why we need the PCC to clarify the definition of competitive market,” Grab said. Earlier, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said Grab could be released from its VCs if the company proves that its services were substitutable with motorcycle taxis and that the substitute or competitor has acquired a certain percentage or threshold in the market. He added that once motorcycle taxis were established as a public utility vehicle, Grab would then have to prove whether four-wheeled vehicles such as Grab’s would be substitutable with two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycle taxis.

Grab’s voluntary pricing commitments covered August 2018 to May 2019. PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said both fines for the first and second quarters of the first undertaking totaling to PHP18.4 million will be paid to the PCC, and remitted to the national treasury. However, the third-quarter fine of PHP5.05 million and ensuing quarterly fines will be refunded to Grab customers through GrabPay within 30 days of Grab’s receipt of a notice of breach from the PCC, he said. The refund order was made through an amendment to Grab’s first commitment with the PCC and will be effective throughout the rest of the company’s price-related commitments which are set to end on Nov. 1, 2020, he added. “In the third quarter, in the fourth quarter and the extended period, that will be subject to refund,” Bernabe said. The fines, he said, were imposed after Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from its prices before its buyout of rival Uber. The allowable deviation or increase in prices was set to 22 percent from levels before Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing market, which meant Grab constantly exceeded its allowable price-hike since the buyout, and was fined based on how much it breached its agreement with the PCC. During the event, Balisacan also announced a new set of voluntary commitments by Grab which were broadly categorized into non-exclusivity, service quality, and price-related commitments. The non-exclusivity commitments, Balisacan said, have implications on new competitors to the ride-sharing market and will be effective for four years from Nov. 1, 2019. These include commitments to prevent exclusive membership or registration of drivers or operators to Grab, monitoring of incentives to drivers/operators, and provision of licensing and regulatory support. Grab’s service quality commitments, meanwhile, will be effective for one year from Nov. 1, 2019 and would help ensure that Grab drivers would not discriminate against passengers through the removal of the “see destination” feature for drivers with a completion rate below 65 percent for the first quarter and 70 percent for the remaining quarters. For price-related commitments, which would also be effective for one year, Balisacan further said these include a fare transparency commitment and a system-wide average fare cap to limit the average fare increase to 22.5 percent in most months. He added each violation will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach, not including a disgorgement mechanism wherein Grab will refund its commissions in excess of the system-wide average fare cap per month. “We hope that with the commitments set out in the extended undertaking, the riding public will be protected from the threat of monopolistic behavior,” Balisacan said.

The ridesharing firm explained that the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. “Grab is mindful that cancellations are frustrating for both the passengers and our drivers. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations. Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement on Monday. Starting Monday, a PHP 50 cancellation fee will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after 5 minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP 50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within 5 minutes for GrabCar and 3 minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. The cancellation fee will be applied on the next ride booking of a passenger if they paid in cash and will be paid to the driver to reimburse fuel costs and time spent for traveling to the destination point of the rider. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of 5 cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they forced passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab clarified that fees will not be imposed for the following situations: - Passenger cancels within 5 minutes of getting an assigned driver. - The driver is not moving towards the pick-up point or going to the wrong direction. - Driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival. - The driver indicates that he/she has arrived when he/she has not. The firm assured that it will refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours, when reported via their in-app Help Centre. The new policy will be implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed by the end of May. “We will be implementing this initially to the first 10 percent of the riders and drivers with its full implementation set by end May. We will be rolling out official communications for passengers and drivers starting this Monday,” Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. The company has notified the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board on the new policy. Ride-hailing firm Uber used to impose a PHP 100 cancellation fee to passengers that cancel rides more than five minutes after a booking is made before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted in April last year due to its acquisition by Grab.

Recognizing the Philippines as a strategic hub for global community operations and shared support, Uber initially infused USD1.5 million for the 2,919-square meter state-of-the-art facility, which will employ 165 customer service specialists who will provide world-class support, 24/7, to the Uber community. During the inspection of the center, located at the 2nd floor of Skytech IT Park in Barangay Camachiles here, Uber Clark CoE program leader Ricco Gamboa said Uber’s work station can accommodate up to 300 customer service specialists. He said the Clark Center of Excellence is designed to provide specialized support for critical incidents that require immediate attention, employing teams of solution-oriented, trusted advisors to support millions of customers across the Asia-Pacific region, and around the world. Gamboa also said that Uber’s solutions are rooted in technical skills, product expertise, and a deep understanding of their customers’ needs. “The center will provide support via multiple channels -- email, phone, video chat and social media to ensure seamless experience before, during and after the ride,” he said. “I am delighted to unveil our second center today in Clark, and reaffirm our commitment to the Philippines, and the Asia-Pacific region, through this significant investment,” said Troy Stevenson, global head of Community Operations. Uber’s first Asia Pacific Center of Excellence opened in Manila in 2015, at a sprawling 5,500-square meter office in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, and employs more than 1,000 team members.

In a statement on Friday, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said Go Jek’s local subsidiary, Velox Philippines, violated the provision under the 1987 Constitution - which states that companies in the country should be 60 percent owned by Filipinos. “We need to follow the 60-40 requirement of the law for TNCs to operate in the country,” Delgra said. The Board affirmed the decision of its pre-accreditation committee, which denied the application of Velox Philippines. The committee noted that only 20.4 percent of the 1.2 billion common shares of Velox Philippines’ parent company, Velox South-East Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. was actually sold to local shareholder Pace Crimson Ventures Corporation (PCVC) based on its Deed of Absolute Sale of Shares of Stock. The LTFRB said Velox Philippines has failed to show proof of payment of its capital gains tax on the shares allegedly sold, and proof of payment of shares allegedly subscribed by the PCVC under its subscription agreement. The Department of Transportation (DOTr), meanwhile, said it did not interfere in the accreditation process of Go-Jek. “The DOTr does not intervene with the decision of the LTFRB during that phase of deliberation. If Velox Philippines wishes to appeal, they can do so before the DOTr, through the Franchising Review Staff,” Undersecretary for Road Transport Mark de Leon said. Go-Jek is a technology start-up firm based in Jakarta, Indonesia that specializes in ride-hailing and logistics. It currently operates in Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand. The company, which counts Google and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings among its investors, has been expanding in Southeast Asia to compete with Grab, which took over the regional businesses of Uber Technologies last year.

PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said the commission was able to monitor violations of Grab with its pricing commitments over the period from August 10 to November 10 last year. “The monitoring team of the PCC found that there were certain inconsistencies and inaccuracies with the data that was provided as it relates to the price monitoring commitment. Suffice it to say that this prevented the monitor and the PCC monitoring team from carrying out its review of the pricing commitments in an effective way, which results in an unbiased and credible outcome. In that sense, we’ve thought that reviewing the undertaking of Grab, this ran counter to specific procedures of that undertaking,” Bernabe said. The PCC has approved the acquisition of Uber by Grab on Aug. 10, 2018 following the submission of the voluntary commitments by the ride-hailing company. Its voluntary commitments include the improvement of the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates, which existed before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall likewise not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares that are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments on a quarterly basis for a period of one year. The commission also slapped a PHP16-million penalty on Grab last October for violating the interim measures it has imposed during the review period of their deal with Uber. Meanwhile, Grab said it will file a motion for reconsideration against the fine imposed by the PCC. In its statement, the firm said it wants to determine the rationale for PCC to impose the maximum penalty. “We assure our passengers that we are charging fares within the range as allowed by the LTFRB,” Grab said in the statement. The PCC issued the fine against Grab last January 22 with the company receiving the notice on January 23. Grab has to submit the necessary data within five days of the receipt of order, which will be on January 28.

The next step would be a hearing for mediation tentatively scheduled on March 21. But Madrid said the March 21 hearing may not proceed because of the pending petition by Trillanes to review the resolution of local prosecutors indicting the Senator. The DOJ review will take about 60 days, he added. Madrid said it is up to the court if it orders both parties to go into mediation, adding it is also up to his clients, too, whether a public apology from Trillanes is acceptable. Harassment Madrid laughed off Trillanes’ characterization of the cases, saying they are mere harassments. “As far as we are concerned these are not harassment — these are legal proceedings and by doing our job we intend to send him to jail.

Trillanes, pertaining to four counts of libel in Regional Trial Court Branch 54 in Davao City, so that we may be on top of the case and its details,” Eleazar said in a statement sent to reporters. Eleazar said police personnel already coordinated with the Senate’s Sergeant-at-Arms to know Trillanes’ whereabouts, although as per the communication sent by the senator, they will settle things by Monday, December 10. “In his media statement, Sen. Trillanes also said that he is willing to turn himself in on Monday, so he can post bail. As such, we shall be coordinating with the office of the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms on this matter. If the Senator wishes to turn himself to us, then we will get him from the Senate,” the NCRPO chief said. Eleazer said Trillanes is invoking his constitutional privilege to being arrest-free while Congress is in session. “The provision in the Philippine Constitution that the Senator invokes is found in Article VI, Section 11, 1987, that is: 'A Senator or Member of the House of Representatives shall, in all offenses punishable by not more than six years imprisonment, be privileged from arrest while the Congress is in session,'\" Eleazar said. “In this regard, our legal office at the NCRPO says that we have to abide by the Constitution,” he added.

Grab completed the transaction legally, and did not violate the interim measures order,” Lawyer Miguel Aguila, Grab's counsel, said in a statement. The ridesharing firm reiterated that its transaction with Uber was done in a legal manner and did not violate the PCC’s orders particularly the maintenance of independent operations and other conditions such as platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, among others, prior to the merger on March 25. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and drivers’ data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” Aguila added. He said Uber’s acquisition of an equity stake and board seat in the company was consummated prior to the issuance of the interim measures order. “The interim measures should be interpreted to apply prospectively and should not cover acts already consummated before its issuance,” Aguila said. He said Grab's fares and surge rates are within the minimum allowed fares set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Grab’s price algorithm, until the LTFRB suspended the time component in its fares, remained the same. The supposed increase in price was affected by the higher incidence of surge, which was driven by the low supply of vehicles and high concentration of demand,” Aguila said. Meanwhile, the PCC said it has yet to receive a copy of Grab’s motion for reconsideration. “To date, we have not yet received a copy of Grab’s motion for reconsideration. The parties have until October 29 within which to file their MR,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a text message to the Philippine News Agency (PNA). PCC, in its decision issued on October 11, imposed a fine of PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review and another PHP4-million fine for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period. Uber was also imposed a fine of PHP4 million for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review. The commission said both Uber and Grab violated two of its seven-interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction.

Cu said the company will be implementing a surge cap for as low as 1.4 times the fare rate to enable their riders to plan out their trips during the Christmas season. He said the company will also continue to provide promos to its riders for them to avail of lower fares, while performance-based incentives will be given to drivers based on higher acceptance rates of rides, lower cancellation rates and consistently following traffic rules, among others. To date, Grab implements a surge cap of 1.6x from the previous 2x after its PHP2-per-minute charge was reinstated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board last September.

This, as Grab welcomes the decision of the LTFRB to open applications for 10,000 new TNVS units to address the limited supply of vehicles at present. “The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board should increase the TNVS common supply base in Metro Manila from 65,000 to 80,500 to be able to serve the current passenger demand. LTFRB’s decision to open 10,000 new vehicle slots is a step in the right direction towards resolving the current lack of supply on the road but it’s not going to be enough. Replacing the inactive vehicles in the masterlist would be an additional measure that could go a long way in improving TNC service,” Leo Gonzales, Grab Public Affairs Head, said in a statement Tuesday. Currently, Grab receives an average of 600,000 passenger bookings daily but only 35,000 drivers are on the road to address the demand. Its allocation rate for ride bookings in Metro Manila is at 40 percent, which is the lowest in the Southeast Asian region. “Supply is struggling to meet the massive demand from the riding public and only the LTFRB has the authority to address this,” Gonzales said. “We urgently request the LTFRB to replace inactive vehicles with active vehicles ready to serve the riding public. We also appeal to the LTFRB to increase the common supply base to 80,000 vehicles (equivalent to 65,000 active vehicles) and review the demand quarterly consistent with their earlier pronouncements. This will help bring more passengers home and will allow new TNCs to scale,\" he added. The Board has started accepting the on-line registration of TNVS applications for new certificates of public convenience (CPC) not included in the master list through the LTFRB website on August 24. It has likewise ordered all TNVS units included in the master list provided by transportation network companies to submit their applications and to secure the necessary provisional authority on or before August 31. The Board has noted that there were fewer applications for new CPCs for TNVS despite its order for the resumption of their acceptance last March. It has prioritized applicants that were included in the master list submitted by Uber and Grab, which was the subject of an audit review during that time. To date, the LTFRB has issued 13,816 units with provisional authority and 4,925 were issued with CPC. The LTFRB has issued a memorandum last February setting the supply cap of TNVS units in Metro Manila at 65,000. Of the proposed 65,000 vehicle cap, 55,000 slots have been allocated to vehicles based the master list of the LTFRB. Only 42,000 vehicles were left operating with Grab when Uber halted its operations in the country last March as not all vehicles were able to transfer from Uber.

This is after the PCC has finally approved the voluntary commitments submitted by Grab to the Commission. Balisacan said even with the approval of the deal, Grab will be subjected to monitoring for a minimum of six months. Among the voluntary commitments that have to be met by the TNC include improving the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares, which are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo mentioned that the “extraordinary deviation” should not be above 22 percentage points of the fare before the acquisition. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion, meantime, explained that this commitment to eliminate the “extraordinary deviation” on Grab fares aims to revert prices of ride within the pre-transaction level. According to Asuncion, if a Grab ride fare cost PHP100 before it acquired Uber surged to PHP180 for the same route after the transaction, prices should go back to more or less PHP100 or only up to PHP120. Grab likewise pledges for transparency by giving a fare breakdown per trip in its receipt that shall include distance, fare surges, discounts, promo reduction, and per-minute waiting charge. The TNC will also remove the “see destination” feature for drivers with low ride acceptance rate. The company shall also not introduce policies that will result in drivers and operators being exclusive to Grab, in order to allow them to register with other TNCs through a multi-homing scheme. PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe noted that these commitments shall be implemented starting Friday. The PCC will be monitoring Grab's compliance with its submitted voluntary commitments through a third party monitoring, he added. The third party monitoring will be nominated by Grab but will be chosen by the PCC. The third party monitoring shall also come up with a quarterly report to be submitted to the Commission, it was explained. But the monitoring expenses will be shouldered by Grab, which is expected to reach PHP12 million, covering a one-year period. PCC will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach of the conditions.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said. Grab hopes that this initiative would help encourage passengers to use public transportation to ease the traffic congestion in Metro Manila.

Grab is expected to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy as it ensures to provide proper income to drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) for them to earn a decent living while assuring that trips are still affordable to passengers. “Based on our computations, a TNVS driver needs to make at least PHP330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel and vehicle maintenance costs,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Tuesday. “Since PHP2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in,” he added. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. The fare subsidy will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers will get the ideal fare rate as computed by Grab’s system. “For example, if a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance and fare is computed at PHP120 only.

This information is contained in the Statement of Concerns (SOC) report on the Grab-Uber deal done by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisition Office (MAO) released to the press Monday. The antitrust body through its report, reiterated that the acquisition of Uber by Grab has resulted in a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in the ride-hailing market. But the review also found out that “an overwhelming majority of riders” would still continue using on-demand car-based private transportation online booking service via mobile ride-hailing application despite a 5 to 10 percent increase, “which is borne out by actual events of post-transaction”. It was also noted that there are key qualitative differences between TNVS and other modes of public transportation. Moreover, the PCC stated in the SOC that in the aftermath of the merger, Grab now controls 93 percent of TNVS registered vehicles, solidifying its unrivaled dominance in the relevant market. Despite the increase in supply of drivers after the deal, Grab fares have continued to increase. “This upward trend in price is apparent through the higher fares and increased frequency of surge-pricing applied by grab,” the SOC read. “The review indicated that prior to the transaction, prices charged by Grab have been flat to declining, while post-transaction prices have been increasing, despite the supply of drivers available to Grab post-transaction,” it added. The Commission also cited the declining quality of service of Grab after the transaction, which include increased driver cancellation, forced cancellations of rides, and increased waiting time. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were likely less to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” the SOC noted. PCC’s issuance of SOC is part of its motu proprio review on the Grab-Uber deal launched on April 3. The Commission has given the parties time to file their comments on the SOC. The PCC earlier said that based on its review, the Commission has the power to approve or block the deal.

In its petition filed before the Board dated May 18, Grab said the suspension by the Board of the per minute fare has infringed the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as it has allowed other transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose similar charges prejudicing their operations. “The Honorable Board’s assailed Order dated 19 April 2018 suspending the petitioner’s imposition of its per minute charge as a component of its fare structure violates petitioner’s right to equal protection of the law since while the Honorable Board suspended such fee imposition by the petitioner, it has allowed other transportation network companies to include the same per minute charge in their respective fare structures,” Grab's petition read. The LTFRB has approved the accreditations of ride-hailing firms Hype Transport Systems Inc., Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc., Go Lag, Owto and MiCab Systems Corporation following the halt of the operations of Uber as a result of its acquisition by Grab last month. According to Grab, the Board has approved the fare structures of these new TNCs allowing them to impose per minute charges to their riders. The suspension will enable drivers and operators belonging to the common supply base which was imposed by the LTFRB to transfer to other TNCs as they are allowed to impose per minute charges, the firm said. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” its petition read. The firm also said that the filing of a motion for reconsideration will render the LTFRB’s suspension order not executory. \"Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,\" Grab said. The firm has said that it has the authority to formulate their own fare structures in accordance with the Department Order 2015-11 of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). The LTFRB has suspended Grab’s per minute charge following the allegations raised by PBA Partylist Rep. Jericho Nograles that Grab is illegally charging PHP2-per-minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of PHP40 and charging PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer.

For sure, we can implement it for credit card users.

We are reviewing that and will be rolling it out as soon as we have the solution,” Toh added. Uber used to charge a fee on riders who cancel trips, which they will have to pay on their next trip, before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted last April due to its acquisition by Grab. Grab is imposing a maximum cancellation of one trip per day as part of incentives for its drivers. Currently, its drivers cancel 8 percent of their trips while passengers cancel 12 percent of their rides. The ridesharing company seeks to reduce the rate of driver cancellation by 4 percent, and passenger cancellation by 6 percent under its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and welfare, provide better ride experience, and upgrade customer support. Under the initiative, Grab will enhance the performance incentives it offers to drivers to motivate them to provide quality services to its riders. Top performing drivers will be rewarded based on their number of rides, high rating, and good feedback from passengers. Grab is also considering to implement a breakdown on its fares to ensure transparency of its operations. “We are working already a breakdown of the fare on the receipt. I have a team that is working on revising the receipt that you get. On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers traveled. That is already a work in progress,” Toh said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the campaign. “We just have tech constraints. We will be rolling it out. Our target is this will also be implemented within the 100 days,” she said. Grab implemented the masking of passenger destinations last April 27, which was initially rolled out to 25 percent of Grab drivers with historically low acceptance rate. It has also activated an auto-accept feature that will automatically allocate trips to drivers allowing a more seamless experience in continuously accepting passenger requests.

With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs.

He said that it would be beneficial if any one of them starts operation, referring to the reported application of other local ride-sharing companies for accreditation to operate in the country. Last week, the LTFRB said that Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their TNVS accreditations before the agency. \"The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,\" Pimentel said. \"We need real competition, not potential competition. As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service -- and this is where the LTFRB must come in,\" he added. He also called on the LTFRB to \"strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country's TNVS guidelines.\" He urged the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in place mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. \"Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. LTFRB should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” Pimentel said.

The Commission said it has yet to receive any notification of the transaction from any of the parties. “The parties also made representations that the transaction is not covered by the compulsory notification requirements under Section 17 of the Philippine Competition Act,” the PCC said in a statement. Since last month, the PCC hiked the mandatory notification threshold for merger and acquisition deal to PHP2 billion for the size of transaction and PHP5 billion for the size of the party from the PHP1-billion threshold for both sizes of the transaction and the party. “In Resolution No. 08-2018, PCC said its preliminary assessment of the Grab-Uber transaction conducted by the Mergers and Acquisitions Office indicated that there are reasonable grounds that the said acquisition may likely substantially lessen, prevent, or restrict competition,” PCC said. The antitrust body noted that based on its preliminary assessment, the sudden merger may adversely affect the interests of both the riding public and partner drivers.

In a statement, the PCC has urged the parties to undergo a voluntary review of the deal, if the transaction does not meet the requirements for mandatory notification. Under the new mandatory threshold, entities involved in mergers and acquisitions shall notify the PCC if the size of transaction breaches PHP2 billion and PHP5 billion for size of the party. The PCC has reminded the parties that if the deal is notifiable, Grab’s acquisition of Uber should not yet push through until the Commission has reviewed and approved the transaction. “If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anti-competition concerns,” the Commission said, on the other hand. “Should anti-competitive concerns arise out of the transaction review, the parties may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or present the negative effects to competition in the market after the acquisition,” the PCC added. But if the parties refuse to undergo a voluntary review, the Commission cautioned that it can launch a motu proprio investigation on its own initiative regarding the transaction. The Commission said the review aims to determine if the Grab and Uber merger will substantially lessen the competition in the ride-sharing market in the Philippines. The PCC will evaluate and analyze if the acquisition will result in a fare increase, deterioration of service, lesser competition, and how it will fairly compete once new transport network companies enter the market. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns, as a notified transaction, or by opening a motu proprio case,” the Commission said. PCC officials met with representatives of Grab and Uber Monday to determine if their deal warrants closer scruitiny. “The consultation is taken as a sign of the parties’ willingness to comply with the provisions of the Philippine Competition Act, including ensuring real competition among ride-hailing options and promoting the welfare of the riding public,” said PCC. “PCC is committed to ensure that Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines will not harm the interest of the riding public,” it added.

The company said that the merger will enable them to efficiently provide rides to their customers. “With the increased supply base under one TNC, you should see that allocation times will get better because the density of cars across the maps should get better.

Kabayan Rep. Ciriaco Calalang made the statement following the recent development that ride-sharing firm Grab has acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations. \"Given the new development of the sale by Uber of its entire Southeast Asia business to Grab, the Philippines now suddenly finds itself with a ride-hailing service monopoly -- a situation that is not good for the riding public because of the lack of competition and competitive pricing,\" Calalang said. \"It may take some weeks or months for the effects of the Uber sale to Grab to cascade to the Philippines, but it will eventually happen,\" he added. Calalang said the LTFRB should proactively encourage other transportation network companies (TNCs) to enter the Philippine market to serve more passengers and break the monopoly of Grab. \"LTFRB can do so by reducing red-tape inside the office, setting new regulations opening the TNC sector to new investors both local and foreign, and creating an environment ready for the influx of new TNCs,\" he said. \"Such proactive move shall benefit the riding public as healthy competition naturally breeds innovations, new technologies, higher standards, and lower prices,\" he added. The party-list lawmaker noted that the riding public needs more choices and better price options by having two or three more TNCs that can address the \"huge demand\" not just in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, but also in the highly urbanized cities of Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan. He said the LTFRB could issue a new policy through a board resolution encouraging more TNCs to be accredited. \"If, after some reasonable time, the LTFRB is unable or unwilling to protect the riding public with these measures, then it may very soon be necessary for Congress to divest the LTFRB of its power to regulate TNCs,\" he said.

Hirna, a company that offers convenience to the taxi-riding public, said Cagayan de Oro will be the next city to establish its operation. Hirna, a play on the phrase “here na” or “here already”, said it will open business in this city following its launch in Davao City last month. Aminoden Guro, LTFRB-10 director, said Hirna’s entry will redound to the benefit of local passengers, noting that the popular ride-hailing companies Uber and Grab have not yet established a significant presence here. Francisco Mauricio, Hirna chief executive officer and president, said by choosing Davao and Cagayan de Oro, they aim to establish a foothold in Mindanao and work their way up to Visayas and Luzon once the business starts to pick up. Maurico said one of the key differentiating factors of Hirna is the “driver rating system” that keeps track of the drivers’ disposition on the road. Mauricio said Hirna has data analytics that look at the number of rejections made by drivers, citations, attitude problem, and other negative issues. “It [analytics] will collate to a driver rating system that would be shared between taxi operators and the LTFRB. The driver is then rated. We will know who the model drivers are and who are not,” he said. He also assured the drivers and operators that Hirna will have favorable effect on their income as the new player will not be imposing extra charges but only a minimal fee. Guro hopes the driver rating system will change the drivers’ outlook since their driving behavior and how they treat their passengers will be monitored. This will enable the agency to take appropriate action if the drivers violate existing transportation laws, he added. Among the complaints that LTFRB has been receiving from passengers included rejection, bad hygiene, and drivers wanting in good manners. At present, the city has 2,691 taxi units and close to a thousand operators, who were encouraged by the LTFRB-10 to consolidate their franchise by forming a cooperative or a corporation so they could be united, Guro said.

Dapat mas mabilis na ang serbisyo ninyo at wala nang cancellation (Your services should be more faster and not have any cancellations),” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a press conference. The number of the common supply base was decided by the Board considering various factors such as unserved demand, number coding scheme and churning rate or the number of inactive drivers for the past few months and will be reviewed every three months. The ridesharing companies welcomed the decision of the Board as it will enable them to efficiently deliver services to their passengers. “The supply base will enable us to address our passenger demand. This assures us na walang drivers ang mawawalan ng trabaho (no drivers will lose their jobs), Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said. \"On the number that they provided, we still need to assess the impact it will have on our reliability, but we'll continue to work with LTFRB on the quarterly process,\" according to Uber policy associate Irish Almeida. The memorandum shall be effective on Feb. 28, 2018.   Meanwhile, the LTFRB also ordered hatchback units to only operate within Metro Manila and charge lower fares to their riders. The regulatory board will issue different plates and stickers for TNVS units for enforcement purposes. The stickers will be released as soon as the Provisional Authority has been issued with the plates to be issued later. There are 59,020 accredited TNVS units for both Uber and Grab whose Certificates of Public Convenience were not processed by the LTFRB due to the moratorium on applications last July 2017. The application for the TNVS units will begin on March 5 with priority to be given to the master list of active drivers submitted by the ridesharing companies to the LTFRB. Last January, the LTFRB has imposed the supply cap for TNVS units at 45,700 units. However, Department of Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered for its review and created a team to evaluate the number of request bookings per day and the number of served and unserved rides of TNCs.

The signing took place in a ceremony held at the PDEA Activity Area, PDEA National Headquarters in Quezon City on Wednesday. “Realizing that drug syndicates have exploited the use of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), the PDEA, LTFRB and TNCs signed the MOU to stop this new trend of drug trafficking,” PDEA Director General Aaron N. Aquino said. Aquino said drug syndicates now use TNVS or mobile-based application of TNCs to deliver their illicit goods concealed inside packages right at the doorsteps of their intended receivers. Under the MOU, the parties have committed themselves to interdict and prevent the transportation of packages containing illegal drugs using drivers/operators of TNVS, identify and report timely intelligence information for the purpose of anti-drug operations; and implement applicable policies on drug-free workplace in the TNCs premises to ensure that operators with existing contracts with Uber, My Taxi.PH and U-Hop are not involved in any illegal drug activities. Among the provisions stated in the agreement, PDEA shall take the lead role in the conduct of overall investigation, arrest and subsequent filing of drug cases in cooperation with LTRFB and TNCs. Also, PDEA shall map out plans in the prevention of the drug delivery and conduct trainings/seminars to contracting parties relevant to the anti-drug law. “The signed agreement among PDEA, LTFRB and TNCs is a step forward in achieving a new partnership that would suppress the use of TNCs drivers from being exploited as unknowing drug couriers and finally put a stop to this emerging drug trend,” the PDEA chief said. On the other hand, LTFRB pledged to facilitate any programs and activities for the effective implementation of the MOU; encourage TNVS operators/drivers to undergo PDEA trainings to be integrated into the LTFRB Drivers’ Academy Training; provide sanctions and penalties to TNVS operators or drivers who shall violate any policies issued by LTFRB; and provide legible decals and/or stickers with PDEA and LTFRB Hotlines to all TNVS operators/drivers. Aquino said that under the MOU, “the TNCs shall communicate with partners and drivers on the dissemination of the detailed PDEA contact information for the speedy relay of criminal and other suspicious activities to authorities”. Also, the TNCs agreed to exercise due diligence in the selection and hiring of their drivers by requiring the submission of additional identity requirements such as NBI, Police and Barangay Clearances. TNCs shall design a mechanism by which all items for delivery shall be properly marked with the name and complete address of the sender and the consignee to be recorded by the drivers, maintain a record of parties’ transactions under Uber, My Taxi.PH and U-Hop subject to the provisions of the Data Privacy Act, among others. Aside from Aquino, the other signatories were LTFRB Chairman Atty.

Hirna is the new taxi booking application in Davao City developed by Davao-based developers and AVIS Philippines, in partnership with Globe Telecom. Hirna is a name that plays the phrase “here now\" to symbolize speed and convenience. The taxi hailing app is accredited by LTFRB as a digital platform. It also connects to most number of taxis in the city. Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, who led the launching of the application on Tuesday, commended the transport sector for streamlining the setting up of a taxi hailing. “This marks an important development in Davao City particularly in the transport system,” she said. She said the city’s vision of low-density load traffic condition could be achieved through Hirna. “With our collective efforts the vision of a low-density load traffic condition in Davao City is a possibility that we can all achieve,” she said. The mayor underscored the need to address the traffic condition in the city, thus, the city government is trying to double its efforts to address it. One of these is implementing the city’s Comprehensive Transportation and Traffic Master-plan. The mayor also witnessed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the city government and the Department of Transportation (DoTr) for the new taxi hailing application. \"The MoU is an affirmation of a productive collaboration of the city government and DoTr,\" she said. Hopefully, she said the partnership would result in more initiatives designed to address solutions in the current traffic problems. AVIS Philippines president Francisco Mauricio said the app is different from the existing Uber and Grab since it has unique features.It has no booking fee which is beneficial to the passenger. Mauricio assured there will be no charge surge with this app because this will only follow the metered fare. \"We are really dedicated in enhancing the quality of life of our riding public,\" he said. On the part of Metro Davao Taxi Operator Association (MDTOA), the app will be a big help to their drivers. MDTOA president lawyer Rogelio Largo said that with the application, their cab drivers don't need to roam around the city to solicit passengers. \"We would like to see a day that they will just stay in non-busy areas waiting for online mobile bookings,\" he said. Largo said if all drivers are using it, there would be possible reduction of volume of vehicles plying the roads, thus easing the traffic flow. He said the app also has a feedback mechanism feature where passengers could report the behavior of the cab drivers. \"This app will enable people to provide feedback to our regulators like LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and LTO (Land Transportation Office), in order to improve driver discipline and driver behavior, \" he said. Largo said even if majority of the drivers in the city are good yet it could not be denied that some of them are arrogant. Although the taxi industry in Davao is 'a lot better from the rest of the country', Largo said there should be improvements in the industry. Largo added the operators would be the first to shoulder the operational expenses of the app just to provide comfort to the riding public in the city. Hirna has also a 24/7 booking hotline for those without the app. After Davao, the Hirna team will expand nationwide in the coming months bringing with it the discipline, secure, and completely crime-free-Davao experience. “Being a home-grown service that embodies and champions unique Dabawenyo values guarantees strong support from local partners and patronage by the local passengers,’ Largo said.

This, after the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Mark Villar and transport network company Uber Philippines’ General Manager Laurence Cua on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding where the latter would be sharing data that may be utilized for planning of infrastructure projects that would help address traffic problems in the National Capital Region. Villar said that they would be given access to Uber’s Movement, a website that uses Uber’s data to help urban planners make informed decisions about cities. “This is one major step towards finding a solution to the increasing vehicle volume in our roads. With the help of Uber, we will be able to have better decision-making process when it comes to traffic patterns, solutions, and re-routing schemes,” he said. The riding app will build the Movement for Manila platform with the help of the DPWH Planning Department to provide inputs for enhanced traffic management and troubleshooting. “Our Department is one with Uber in their campaign towards finding a solution to our current traffic condition. We will provide them with inputs and relevant updates to ensure a hassle-free journey for their growing ridership,” he added. On the other hand, Cua explained that since Uber trips occur all over cities, by analyzing a lot of trips over time, they can reliably estimate how long it takes to get from one area to another. “Since Uber is available 24/7, travel conditions across different times of day, days of the week, or months of the year can be compared—and how travel times are impacted by big events, road closures or other things happening in a city. This data is anonymized and aggregated into the same types of geographic zones that transportation planners use to evaluate which parts of cities need expanded infrastructure, like the NAIA-X or Skyway extension,” he said.

Recto made this remark noting that under the Procurement Law or Republic Act 9184, Sanofi is duty-bound to reimburse the government “because all government purchases are mandatorily covered by warranty.” “This is our prescription for Sanofi, give us our refund,” Recto said in a press statement. \"RA 9184 has an anti-lemon provision. It is discussed extensively in Section 62, which deals with faulty, defective substandard goods and services. The bottom line is that the government is entitled to restitution,\" he added.

He said that this is a standard clause in government contracts. Moreover, the \"no return, no exchange policy\" does not apply to government purchases. Under RA 9184, even official supplies, car parts, appliances bought for government must pass the quality test. Recto noted that many corporations have been paying huge fines upon orders of regulatory bodies, \"a path Sanofi should follow if it wants to retain public goodwill.\" He mentioned some companies such as Uber, Metrobank, RCBC, PAL as some companies which have willingly paid a fine, or settled obligations, for operational oversights committed.

It may be recalled that the dengue vaccination program was implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) during the last year of the Aquino administration and continued by the Duterte government, upon the recommendation of the new DOH leadership. Senate Minority Leader Frank Drilon and Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV both asked the government to monitor the status of students who received the initial dose of the vaccine and ensure their safety. The dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, was licensed for use in the Philippines by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2015. DOH earlier confirmed that it has administered the dengue vaccine to hundreds of thousands of school children in Central Luzon, NCR, and Calabarzon. To date, the DOH has stopped its implementation.

The Asia Pacific air cargo industry is experiencing growth and transformation, driven by rapidly increasing capacity supply on passenger flights, and the shift to business-to-consumer small parcel shipments as a result of e-commerce. Growing passenger demand will increase the number of passenger flights and add to cargo capacity supply. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the number of air passengers globally will almost double between 2016 and 2035, with the greatest growth in Asia Pacific – particularly in China and India1. Simultaneously, the popularity of e-commerce is changing the nature of cargo shipments, incrementally increasing the number of small parcels – which is predicted to grow 5 percent annually in mature markets and 17 percent annually in China2. \"At Unisys, we predict these market pressures will bring innovation in three areas in the cargo supply chain: smart warehouses will become even smarter, drones will finally take off in the cargo supply chain – but inside the warehouse, and new alliances between airlines and global distributors will enable llonger-termcapacity management. Much of the underlying technologies are already being used in other sectors – including the consumer world. But now, more than ever, cargo operators will be forced to embrace such innovation to be more efficient, nimble, and proactive in an increasingly competitive and price-conscious market,\" said Mr. Pazhyanur. Unisys cargo experts believe the following predictions will become reality within the next five years or less: 1)      Smart warehouses will become a reality. To meet the growing demand for small parcel deliveries, warehouses will transform from a storage location to a dynamic facility using IoT and voice Artificial Intelligence (voice AI), enabling faster processing of more shipments to generate a higher return on the real-estate investment. Just as connected wearable devices, such as smartwatches are becoming mainstream in the consumer world, IoT-based technology will create the \"smart warehouse\" of the future. Recent innovations such as smart glasses used to display information triggered by a barcode or QR code on a container3 will be taken to a new level by incorporating scanners to automatically capture and input information into the warehouse system and integrating voice AI to initiate actions. Similar technology is already used in digital assistants such as Siri, Cortana or Amazon Echo. Unisys expects cargo operators to invest in converting machine commands to voice within the next three years. 2)      Drones will be used inside the warehouse. While drones have become a familiar way to provide TV sports aerial footage, the much-anticipated mainstream rollout of drones to deliver parcels to the customer’s doorstep is hampered by flight space restrictions, government approvals, and privacy considerations. Unisys predicts the more immediate application of drones in the cargo supply chain will be within the confined space of warehouses to conduct inventory checks more often and more accurately, replacing the largely manual process. Beyond locating lost or misplaced items, the drones will use sensors to monitor environmental information such as light or temperature for perishable food, pharmaceuticals or livestock, and raise alerts to unusual noise or movement that may indicate animals are in distress. Unisys predicts this within the next 12 months. 3)      New alliances between airlines and global distributors will be forged for long-term revenue optimisation. With cargo capacity potentially increasing faster than cargo demand due to extra passenger flights and larger aircraft, cargo capacity management has become the number one challenge for airlines. In this environment of unconstrained capacity, the traditional approach to yield management will not work as airlines may dump cargo space onto the market, creating a price war. Unisys predicts a fundamental move to longer-term revenue optimization based on strategic alliances between airlines and organizations with large ongoing delivery requirements such as postal authorities, major online retailers, global distributors, and supply chain management companies. This will require airlines to provide their alliance partners with transparent real-time access to available capacity and predictive analytics to determine best routes based on speed, reliability, and cost. This expectation for visibility will also extend to the \"last mile\" of the business-to-consumer cargo supply chain, leading to the development of mobile apps to allow the final recipient to be able to track the approach of their delivery – similar to how consumers currently track an approaching taxi or Uber.

Cu warned Maquidato’s killers that Grab is using its technology to help authorities solve the incident. Grab has earlier said it will cooperate with the Philippine National Police–Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG) to deter carjacking incidents involving their transport network vehicle services (TNVS) which are being booked by criminals posing as legitimate passengers. The ridesharing firm said they have reported to authorities at least six confirmed carnapping cases involving Grab Car. Meanwhile, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it is set to hold a meeting with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) as Grab has submitted a tracking copy of Maquidato’s trip. This was forwarded to the MMDA for monitoring through its CCTV system. “LTFRB has reached out to both Uber and Grab to be able to come up with suggestions on how to protect their respective TNVS. After hearing the suggestions of the TNCs, the board will come up with a decision on what proposal to be undertaken in coordination with law enforcement agencies such as PNP-HPG,” LTFRB board member and spokesperson Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters. Among the proposals of the transportation network companies (TNCs) include submission of a picture of the rider in order to prevent carjacking incidents and allowing drivers to share their GPS to their family members in order to track down their trips. These will also be considered by the Board for the application of taxis in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents.

In a press conference in UP Diliman, Confederate for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government Employees president Ferdinand Gaite said the plan to phase-out old-jeepneys would result in higher fares ranging from PHP12 to PHP20 from the current PHP8. Gaite said that several government workers with their meager salaries could not afford the more expensive options of transportation such as taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab and Uber. “As it is, transportation expenses already eat up a substantial portion of employee’s salaries. Our take-home pay is not even enough to take us home,” Gaite said. Gaite said that while he sees the need to improve the public transport system in the country, the modernization program should take into account the welfare of the affected sectors and not that of the private investors and capitalists. “In many countries, a highly efficient publicly-owned mass transport system is operated not for profit but as a service of the state to bring the people to their destinations,” Gaite said. For her part, Advocates of Science and Technology for the People (AGHAM) campaign officer Cleng Julve echoed Gaite’s sentiments, saying that the government should undertake schemes that would benefit drivers, operators, and the commuting public. Julve suggested that the government grant subsidy to small and single-unit operators for rehabilitation and upgrading of technology of their vehicles. She said the “palit-jeep” scheme should allow jeepney drivers and operators to swap their old jeepneys with new ones at a subsidized value instead of the current scrap value offered. Other groups present during the press conference include the Crispin B. Beltran Research Center and All-Workers Unity. The Department of Finance reported that the program would cost PHP417 billion for the next five years, including the PHP8 billion subsidy for the purchase of PUVs and PHP3.9 billion for the Office of Transport Cooperatives. Under the PUV Modernization Program, jeepney units that are 15 years old will be replaced with Euro 4 engines or electrically-powered engines with solar panels for roofs. These will also be equipped with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, a GPS navigation system, an Automatic Fare Collection System (AFCS), speed limiters, dashboard cameras, and Wi-Fi.

LTFRB is set to issue a show cause order to U-HOP explaining why they continue to activate new drivers into their system despite the existing ban, according to board member and spokesperson Aileen Lizada. Lizada said the board was able to take hold of certificates of accreditation issued to two different U-HOP drivers who used the same vehicle.

Out of the 5,000, we only activated less than 300 and 56 in Cebu due to the clamor of the public for affordable rides,” the firm said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. U-HOP said they have received their accreditation last March and stopped their activation after the suspension order was released in July. “When U-HOP received the TNC Accreditation last March 2016, we were only allowed to run for four months and immediately stopped after the July suspension. We incurred considerable losses but we never complained. We followed the order even if it almost got us to the ground,” U-HOP said. “During the TNC-TWG, we asked permission to allow us to run 5,000 units, to be able to survive the competition and provide decent service to our users. We got a verbal approval,” they added. U-HOP will remove the logo in all their future certification as well as on the vehicle markings in compliance with the LTFRB order.

This after the LTFRB central office recently approved the petition of taxi operators nationwide to add several pesos to the prevailing fare. LTFRB-10 Director Aminoden Guro said taxi operators, who have not calibrated their taxi meters, cannot charge passengers with the new fare. He advised the riding public to check the meters of the taxi before paying the additional charge.In the new LTFRB order, the flag-down rate for taxicabs remains at P40, but passengers will now pay P13.50 for every kilometer, instead of P3.50 per 300 meters. Drivers can now also charge P2 per minute for the waiting time. To ensure that taxi drivers and operators comply with the order, Guro said taxi meters must be calibrated by private companies, and the units must be checked by LTFRB first before they are allowed to operate. The LTFRB has decided to implement the increase based on the petition of the drivers and operators who are complaining of higher fuel prices, the traffic congestion in Manila, and the revival of operation of the ride-hailing services, such as Grab and Uber, especially in the National Capital Region. According to the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, the fare hike for taxis is long overdue as the last increase was in 2010. The group said taxi operators are also suffering from financial hardship due to “record-low levels of dispatch and increases in spare parts prices and other expenses.” Ringo Lago, secretary-general of the transport group Solidarity of Transport in Region X-Pagkakaisa ng Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Starex-Piston), described the fare hike as \"very laudable\". However, Lago also called on the administration to do something to solve the plight of the public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers. At the root of the transport workers' suffering, he said, is the scrapping of the oil deregulation law. The enactment of Republic Act 8479, or the Oil Deregulation Law, in 1998, led to the non-interference of the government with the pricing, export and importation of oil products, among other provisions.

This was bared by PDEA Director General Aaron N. Aquino on Thursday. Aquino, together with LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra, met the operators of Grab and Uber to address growing concerns of their drivers being used by drug dealers in delivering the said contraband. The schedule for the MOU signing is tentatively set on the second week of October, he said. Aquino suggested to the operators of TNVS – Grab and Uber – to open packages sent through their drivers in order for them not to be used as unwitting drug couriers. “To Grab and Uber operators and drivers, please exercise due diligence to prevent your line of work from being tainted with involvement with illegal drug activities,” Aquino said in a statement. Both representatives of Grab and Uber who were present during the meeting supported Aquino’s suggestion.Aquino also encouraged Grab and Uber operators and drivers to help enhance intelligence efforts by reporting information to authorities. “Report suspected packages directly to us,” Aquino said. The PDEA chief issued such proposal following the arrest of Jovit Atillano, a suspected ecstasy dealer admitted that he has been hiring the services of TVNS drivers to deliver packages containing illegal drugs to his on-line clients. The suspect, who yielded 500 pieces of party drugs and other illegal drugs worth PHP1 million, was arrested by PDEA agents on Sept. 19, in his condominium unit in Mandaluyong City.

They will register using fictitious names and pre-activated SIM cards to avoid detection in case the delivery went amiss and intercepted by authorities. Unaware, the poor driver will likely suffer the dire consequences,” he added. Local TNVS, such as Grab and Uber, offer doorstep express deliveries using cars and motorbikes that are covered by insurance and real-time tracking and notification alerts. PDEA is seeking the assistance of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and TNVS to find ways to stop this new trend of drug trafficking, Aquino noted. House probe Meanwhile, the House of Representatives’ Dangerous Drugs Committee is considering the conduct of an investigation into the alleged unwitting involvement of transport network vehicle services’ (TNVS) drivers in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In an interview with reporters on Monday, committee chair Robert Ace Barbers said he has received media and police reports of TNVS drivers, such as Grab and Uber, becoming susceptible to being used as couriers in this new scheme of drug trafficking. “What we’ll do is to call a motu proprio investigation on the alleged involvement of Grab and Uber drivers in the trafficking of drugs,” Barbers said. Rep. Barbers said his committee will look into the policy and system of the transport network companies in their parcel or document delivery, and see if there is a need to enforce strict guidelines on such express deliveries.

LTFRB board member and spokesperson Aileen Lizada said the proposed taxi fare rates will now be based on the distance and time travelled. “For the new fare structure, there will still be a flagdown rate of PHP40. We will now be basing it on a per kilometer basis. There will be an amount for running time, no longer for waiting time,” Lizada explained in a text message to reporters. The current taxi fare is set at PHP40 at flagdown and the first 500 meters, and PHP3.50 for every 300 meters and for two-minute waiting time. Taxi drivers and operators are seeking a PHP2 increase in the rate for every succeeding kilometer in the distance travelled by taxi units. If the adjustment is granted, the running fare and waiting time will increase to PHP5.50 from PHP3.50 while the flagdown rate remains at PHP40. The LTFRB official said the board is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the month. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III earlier stated there is a need to increase the fare of taxis to make them at par with transportation network companies, such as Uber and Grab, and motivate drivers to improve their services. The taxi fare was last adjusted eight years ago. Uber and Grab use a dynamic pricing scheme wherein fares change based on the demand of passengers at a certain time, especially during rush hours, or conditions, such as heavy traffic and inclement weather.

Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) spokesperson Aileen Lizada said Uber and Grab have agreed, during its technical working group meeting Wednesday afternoon, to comply with its memorandum circular providing for an enhanced personal accident insurance program. “We directed TNCs to provide insurance coverage the same as LTFRB is providing extensive coverage and all risk policy. We asked both Uber and Grab to improve the coverage that their TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should be having,” Lizada said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The Board has partnered with the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc. (PAMI) and SCCI Management and Insurance Agency Corporation (SCCI) for its insurance coverage. Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2015-028, passengers of public utility vehicles are entitled to monetary benefits from PHP3,000 to PHP200,000 including accidental death and other injuries. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated PAMI coverage since these are recognized by the LTFRB to have legitimate operations. Grab’s insurance policy mandates that those without PA or CPC should be enrolled to an insurance premium while those with PAs/CPCs get the same on top of PAMI. As such, all TNVS drivers accredited by Grab are covered by insurance and passengers can settle claims against the ridesharing firm. The LTFRB earlier said Uber offers limited insurance coverage compared to its competitor that has no fault indemnity clause and all-risk coverage. A no-fault indemnity insurance clause assures that the insurance company will pay for damages incurred regardless of whose fault has caused the accident. An all-risk insurance policy provides broader coverage as it insures passengers for losses that might arise from any extreme conditions. LTFRB will issue stickers for the identification of TNVS units with PAs or CPCs, Lizada said. The TNCs also agreed that their partner TNVS drivers and operators will participate in the Drivers Academy for public utility vehicles (PUV) which was established by the LTFRB to ensure road safety and discipline. Some of the issues that were also discussed in the meeting were: penalties for erring drivers; accountability of the TNCs; fare discounts and determination; and fleet management. The LTFRB plans to issue a memorandum circular by September that will set a limit to the number of TNVS units that will be operated by Uber and Grab.

The guidelines will address various concerns such as dynamic pricing scheme, rating of driver performance, etc., she said. Meanwhile, LTFRB Board member Ronaldo Corpus said the taxi app will provide commuters choices for a convenient mode of transportation. Chairman Martin Delgra III said the establishment of an app will enable them to have a database of taxi drivers across the country. “We want to put to a stop the colorum taxis,” Delgra said. The Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) has partnered with Micab to improve the traffic situation in Metro Manila and other parts of the country. MiCab offers an app-based solution wherein commuters can book rides from taxi drivers similar to the TNCs Uber and Grab. Unlike Uber and Grab, MiCab only connects passengers to a network of regular taxis with franchises, not private vehicles.  “We want to improve the quality of taxi services in the country,” PNTOA President Atty. Bong Suntay said. The LTFRB is also mulling to implement a taxi fare adjustment as operators and drivers are seeking a PHP2 increase in the rate for every succeeding kilometer in the distance travelled by taxi units.  If the adjustment is granted, the running fare and waiting time will increase PHP5.50 from PHP3.50 while the flagdown rate remains at PHP40. According to Suntay, it is urgent to implement a fare increase as it has been eight years since the last adjustment was implemented. “With the fare adjustment, we would see a change in the attitude of drivers and we expect that they will be more disciplined and professional,” Suntay said. The board is likewise coordinating with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to impose stricter penalties against erring public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers. The LTFRB proposes that the license of drivers be suspended for 3 months for first offense, suspension of license for 6 months for second offense and revocation of license or downgrade to nonprofessional drivers’ license category for third offense. Data from the LTFRB shows that there are currently 32,364 taxi franchises for 50,910 units nationwide with Metro Manila having 20,910 franchises for 30,195 units. LTFRB has earlier said taxi operators should comply with the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines issued last June as part of the government's public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program. The taxi units should have automated fare collection, WiFi connectivity, dashcam, among others, to comply with the franchising guidelines. Under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines, local government units plan public transport routes based on the current and projected travel patterns in their respective areas. These routes will be contained in the Local Public Transport Route Plan (LPTRP) of LGUs that will serve as basis for franchise issuance by the LTFRB. The LTFRB has also created a driving academy for PUV drivers and operators to inculcate road safety lessons to lessen accidents on the road and proper etiquette when dealing with passengers.

Leo Gonzalez, head of the Public Affairs, said Grab is testing the environment in Davao City if Davaoenos are ready to pay higher fares for a more convenient ride. Gonzalez stressed the company is looking more on the demand side under such operation. He said the company has already expressed interest with the Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB) to operate in the city. GrabCar is a car-booking application that dispatches private vehicles. The app has high demand in Metro Manila. Grab has been operating in Davao City since 2014 when it partnered with taxi operators and drivers in Davao for GrabTaxi. Jose Thor Villarreiz, Grab Davao Manager, said there are now 1,300 Grab-a-Taxi drivers still using the Grab platform averaging about 500 drivers active per day. When Grab started in Davao City there were about 2,600 because of the incentives they offered to establish the brand. Meanwhile, on Friday, Grab Philippines revealed it has already accepted 100 drivers from Uber as of Friday, August 18, after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units to transfer to two other accredited Transport Network Companies (TNCs). Grab Philippines Country head Brian Cu, however, is not sure how many will be joining Grab. “It is yet to be seen,” Cu said when asked how many the company would take in. Cu, who was here for the 32nd Kadayawan sa Dabaw, said Grab will just submit a list to LTFRB daily until his company will be told it is enough. The submission of a list is required by LTFRB. On Thursday, LTFRB released Board Resolution No. 19 stating Uber TNVS units will be allowed to transfer to two other accredited TNCs like Grab and UHOP to ease the burden of commuters. Under the said resolution, the TNVS should only show their proof of accreditation by Uber and insurance coverage. Grab and UHOP should submit to the LTFRB a list of operated TNVS on a daily basis. Cu said, “We will accommodate the members of the TNVs community who want to join Grab’s platform so long as they abide by the requirements clearly stated in the order and the company’s policies.” Cu said Grab is also looking at people whose livelihood is affected by the suspension of the operations. Uber was suspended last August 14 and was ordered to cease and desist the operations of its online booking applications. Cu stressed that Grab understands very well about the lack of supply to serve the need of the riding public. With LTFRB’s resolution, Cu is optimistic Grab can meet the demand beginning on Monday. To maintain Grab’s quality of service, Cu said drivers will undergo training, cross check their background. “We’re focused on serving drivers and consumers, and ensuring that the car-and-taxi-hailing transport continues to run as smoothly as possible,” he said. He added that aside from the fare cap which Grab put in place to ensure consumers continue to pay a reasonable fare, Cu said Grab also ensures that the onboarding process will be smooth so that TNVs drivers can start to make a loving again.

LTFRB board member and spokesperson Aileen Lizada said the transportation network company (TNC) has also declared its intent to provide financial assistance for its affected transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) partners. Lizada said the Board is set to conduct a hearing on the matter on August 23, 2017. “We will be hearing Uber’s side. If there is a need to hear the TNVS as regards to their financial assistance, we will do the same. We will not be pressured to fast track everything,” the LTFRB official said in an interview with reporters. Uber and the LTFRB had a meeting Wednesday with the Senate Committee on Public Services to settle the impasse over the accreditation of TNCs. Committee chairperson Sen. Grace Poe stated that the meeting was conducted to ease the burden of passengers affected by the suspension. During the meeting, Uber Technologies Southeast Asia manager Michael Brown apologized to LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III for any misunderstanding caused by its continuing acceptance of new drivers into its system despite an order halting activation. \"If there's been a misunderstanding in the past, that's on us and I apologize for that misunderstanding,\" Brown said. LTFRB, in its suspension order dated August 14, directed Uber to cease and desist the operations of its online booking applications.

Ejercito made this statement on the sidelines of the closed-door meeting between representatives of the LTFRB and Uber in the Senate led by Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services. The senator pointed out that although Uber was “in-demand” by passengers, it is not an excuse to defy government regulations. He said that penalties will still have to be meted out. “I know that they’re popular, that’s why we want them to be back on the streets as soon as possible. We just made it clear that we want the interest of the riding public as a priority,” he added. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, in a statement, said that instead of a suspension, the LTFRB should only implement a fine as it would not affect daily operations. “Halting operations of Uber will only hurt the drivers and the riding public. A monetary penalty will give us the same result without having to hassle our commuters,” he said. Aquino also said that it was brought up in the meeting that Uber should compensate drivers for the days that they will not be able to use their vehicles. He said that it was also agreed that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed, not just for ridesharing services but also to improve our taxi fleets and their ability to serve the riding public and compensate drivers. The senator expressed hope that the LTFRB can propose a new framework to institutionalize changes to improve transportation in the country. In the same meeting, Uber Technologies Southeast Asia manager Michael Brown apologized to LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra for accepting applications for accreditations despite the board’s orders. On Monday (August 14), the LTFRB suspended Uber operations for repeatedly violating the board’s order to stop accepting driver applications. Uber filed a motion for reconsideration on Tuesday (August 15), however, the LTFRB rejected it.

The complaint comes after the one-month suspension imposed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against the transport network company (TNC). Based on the complaint filed by Kilusan sa Pagbabago ng Industriya ng Transportasyon chairman Vigor Mendoza II, Melencio “Boy” Vargas of the Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines, Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Associations of the Philippines (Fejodap) President Zenaida Maranan, Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) president Efren de Luna, Pasang Masda President Roberto Martin, Orlando Marquez of the Liga ng Transportasyon at Opereytor sa Pilipinas and Fermin Octobre of the Drivers Unite for Mass Progress Equality and Reality (DUMPER), Uber has accredited 74,687 vehicles but only 21,353 have been authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). This means that the remaining 53,334 vehciles are 'colorum' or operating illegally. “These vehicles were operating without a valid authority from the LTFRB, thus colorum…Respondents [Uber officials], as officers and members of the Board of Director of Uber, knowingly and willfully violated the orders of the LTFRB, and consented and approved their company’s illegal activity of operating vehicles as public utilities without the proper and valid authority coming from the LTFRB, otherwise known as ‘colorum’ activities,” the complainants said. Complainants said they are not against Uber but against its stance “of wanting to be above the law.” “Operating more than 50,000 colorum vehicles sets a dangerous precedent, and if not stopped would wreck havoc to the country’s transport plans and programs, specifically the Modernization Program, which aims to enhance transport service and uplift the lives of transport workers,” the complaint stated. “If Uber can get away with this, then all other modes of transport service might as well forget their franchise and just operate as colorum, just like Uber,” they added. Complainants also noted that LTFRB already ordered TNCs to suspend accepting applications for additional vehicles, but still, Uber continued to accept new applicants. They added that despite LTFRB’s order suspending Uber’s operation, it continued with its operation citing the experience of a certain Kenneth Lugtu who managed to book Uber services on Aug. 15, a day after the LTFRB suspended its operation. On Tuesday, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said Uber' suspension remains in effect despite its pending motion for reconsideration asking the LTFRB to lift the suspension order issued Monday. Lizada said the agency will continue to apprehend the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) of Uber if they were found to be still operating on the road. In its motion, Uber stated that the LTFRB suspension order against it was a “blatant violation” of its right to due process. Furthermore, it said that there was no proof it violated the LTFRB’s order stop the activation of new drivers. “Over the course of this morning, tens of thousands of riders were left stranded, causing needless inconvenience, while drivers were unable to access the earning opportunities they rely on. We are looking forward to urgently resolving this matter with LTFRB in the interests of everyone who depends on Uber every day,” Uber said in its official Facebook page. Lizada questioned Uber for resuming operations despite the suspension order, after filing the MR. “What Uber did now saying that they will now be online, they are putting at risk all of its TNVS. What kind of a partner is that? We want Uber to uphold a level of accountability and not leave their TNVS partners behind,” Lizada said. She further said that the board considers Uber’s continuing operations despite the suspension of its accreditation as acts of contempt. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III reiterated that the mere acceptance of Uber of new drivers into its system is already a violation of its order. He said the board has apprehended 19 “colorum” Uber and 16 “colorum” Grab TNVS which have no certificates of public convenience or provisional authority. “The TNCs have already admitted that some of their TNVS are colorum. We just want this problem to be nipped in the bud before it becomes worse,” Delgra said. “We are supporting innovations in our transportation system through the use of modern technology but we also want to ensure that these will be compliant with the law,” he added. Lizada explained that the LTFRB only wants to ensure that TNCs will be able to protect the welfare of their TNVS partners. “It is incumbent upon the Board to choose TNCs that will protect the welfare of TNVS. This is not a fight; we just want to support TNCs that protect the public welfare,” she said. In its order, the LTFRB directed Uber to cease and desist the operations of its online booking applications. It is holding the TNC responsible for all its accredited “colorum” TNVS apprehended during the suspension period, if these were discovered, that they continue to accept passengers using their mobile application. “The latest irresponsible act of the Respondent Uber is not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation but it is about unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country thereby compromising sound business practices. In effect, adversely creating an uneven playing field for the rest of the stakeholders, among them franchise holders of public transport services covering taxis, buses, UV Express and public utility jeepneys, who are also governed by the same regulation,” the LTFRB said in its order.

The LTFRB directed Uber to stop its practice of accepting new applications beyond the issuance of the moratorium as it may pose “regulatory problems” pending the review of policies on TNCs and TNVS. “USI’s continued advertisement, acceptance and accreditation of peers despite the moratorium imposed by the Board on TNVS applications gave rise to the rising number of TNVS which only prejudiced the misguided applicants, because they were not duly informed by the respondent USI of the requisite franchise requirements, and who were of the assumption that once accredited by USI, they can legally ferry passengers and earn from their accreditation as TNVS peers,” the Board further said.

At a Palace briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that while the government appreciates the benefits provided by transport network companies (TNCs) like Uber, it also has to support the mandate of the LTFRB to regulate public transport services. On Monday, the LTFRB suspended the accreditation of Uber for a month after it found that the company continued to accept additional accreditation of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) and/or activation of accounts despite the agency's order. “The issue here is striking a balance between innovation and laws and regulations that LTFRB has to implement as part of its administrative function in regulating common carriers,” he said. “We affirm the positive and beneficial service offered by the TNCs. However, as per LTFRB, Uber Systems unduly challenged its rules and instructions. The Palace understands the situation and therefore, will support LTFRB,” Abella said. The Palace official said that it also respects the suggestions coming from lawmakers, particularly from Senator Grace Poe, that Uber should be just sanctioned with additional fines rather than suspend its operations given the large impact on commuters. “Well, I suppose Ms. Poe’s comment has its own merit. However, we do need to understand that the one in charge is LTFRB and we go by that,” Abella said. However, Abella stressed that Malacañang is hoping that the issue between LTFRB and Uber could be resolved soon for the benefit of the riding public. “We do empathize with the traveling public. It affects everyone, including us at times. That’s exactly why we wish that the LTFRB and the Uber situation should be addressed and it should be resolved as soon as possible and ease the traveling situation, especially in the national capital region,” Abella said.

Poe, in a statement, said that she was hopeful that the meeting with the LTFRB would help resolve the issue as public interest requires the Senate to exercise congressional oversight. She described the decision of LTFRB to suspend Uber services as “cruel and absurd.” “I am aghast that this agency that committed before the Senate to resolve the issues has just imposed a cure that will only make the disease much worse. It does not solve the problem, but further exacerbates the problem of having an utter lack of safe, reliable, and convenient transportation options for our people,” Poe said. Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, described the LTFRB’s suspension order as a “defiance of the LTFRB officials’ commitment to provide a solution to the issues surrounding transport network vehicle services (TNVS) operations.” “When the Senate Committee on Public Services, during the last hearing, asked them to straighten out issues with the Transport Network Companies by October, the committee did not mean for them to suspend the operations of any TNC,” Poe said. “I was wrong to think that the LTFRB was on the same page with the Committee on how to come up with remedial rules pending the crafting of pertinent legislation,” she added. Poe said that the LTFRB suspended Uber’s services not because of lack of roadworthiness but because of “a mere administrative violation” which should have merited a corresponding administrative penalty. The senator pointed out that Uber’s penalty should not limit the public of their transport options. She further said that the public deserved to have options when it comes to choosing convenient, safe, and reliable transportation services to brave the daily punishing traffic jam. “Why can’t the LTFRB be innovative in coming up with an appropriate penalty that is fair and that will not prejudice the riding public? Is there no other less crippling penalty at our disposal? Thirty days is a long time,” Poe said. “Without reliable public transportation, those who depend on Uber for their daily commute will have to find an alternative or revert to their long and usual daily grind. Was the interest of the riding public, that is now compromised and jeopardized, ever factored in when the LTFRB came up with the suspension order?” she added. Automotive journalist James Deakin, in a statement, said that he supported the LTFRB’s decision to suspend Uber for a month but expressed hope that the board would be equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. “As big a fan as I am of ride sharing, I support the LTFRB's decision to suspend Uber for a month. Harsh as it may be, rules are rules. And if Uber broke those rules by accrediting vehicles after the deadline, then so be it. The LTFRB are just doing their job. We have to respect that,” Deakin said. “I hope that in the spirit of fairness we can also hold the LTFRB equally accountable for not doing their job in other areas. After all, rules are rules,” he added. He, meanwhile, urged the LTFRB to also suspend operations of other public transport vehicles that transport passengers without permits.

Dubbed as driving skills for life (DSFL) is a global program of Ford Motor Company that educates drivers about safety driving, fuel-efficient driving as well as all the other elements to be able to drive safely, said EJ Francisco, assistant vice president for communications of Ford Philippines in a press conference on Thursday. It was piloted in Manila last July with about 200 drivers of Uber, he added.  “Hopefully we can also have a roll out here in Iloilo but we are targeting some roll outs in Cebu and in Davao,” he stated. While the program focuses on drivers of public utility vehicles (PUVs), Francisco said that it also reaches out to schools. Meanwhile, Ford is inviting car enthusiasts to avail of their experiential test drive roadshow that will run from August 11-13, 2017 in this city. The \"Ford Island Conquest\" allows customers to test drive the Everest mid-size suburban utility vehicle (SUV), EcoSport compact SUV and the segment-defining ranger pickup.   The test drive arena located at the SM City Iloilo Northwing Parking features an outdoor course with a water-wading drive-thru to highlight the key features and capabilities of the Everest and Ranger. “Visit the booths and try for yourself the capability of our vehicles,” said Ford Philippines brand manager Mark Cruz. Those who are interested only have to show their driver’s license. The experiential test drive is the first to be held outside of Luzon and Manila. It was meant to entice more customers as there is now a growing demand for SUVs and pickup trucks in the province. Engr. Leo Jellicoe R. Villavert, branch manager for Iloilo, said that their company ranks second in terms of monthly sales in Western Visayas with an average of 100 cars.   Monthly, some 400 to 450 vehicles are being sold monthly in the region. He added that 80 percent of their markets are overseas Filipino workers, particularly sea-based  workers and those in the medical field such as nurses. (PNA) "}]}
