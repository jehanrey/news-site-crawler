In making his appeal, the governor pointed out that owners of small businesses are “barely making a profit” during the period of community quarantine that was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.  “I am asking the national government to PLEASE consider delaying the taxation of online trading or selling. This is for the benefit of small business entrepreneurs,” Remulla said in a Facebook post. “Rather than impose taxes, we should create programs, encourage and inspire people to shift to the new digital economy. I think innovation and progress is what the country truly needs,” he added.  The official also cited a Social Weather Stations’s survey in July which showed that the adult unemployment in the country rose to 45.5 percent, or a 28-point increase from the 17.1 percent in December 2019, setting a record-high from the 34.4 percent in March 2012. He pointed out that online selling is one of the effective ways to cope with the pandemic, adding that even teachers and other professionals who lost their jobs during the crisis have engaged in this business.  In Silang, Cavite, where Remulla lives, owners of shops of ornamental plants have also taken their businesses online, according to the governor. “There is no reason not to support those who are crafty, resourceful, street smart and adaptive to the modern world. Please, let us not burden them. Rather, let us work together to make their numbers grow. Let us boost their spirits so that someday, they may be big enough to pay bigger taxes,” he said. “Let us give comfort to those who are striving to survive. They are not even asking for a dole out. These entrepreneurs are not depending on the SAP. They are just trying to make a living in order to provide for their families. Is it that difficult to make the lives of the people we serve easier?” he added. Remulla also took a swipe at corruption issues especially those hounding the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, saying that “now is the time to prove our campaign promises.” READ: Amid ‘carousel of lies,’ Senate ready to come out with findings on PhilHealth probe  “If we are successful in this endeavor, then maybe paying taxes will be worth it for everyone,” he said. “Let us give our small scale business owners a break from the burden of taxes at this very difficult time and fix the issues of corruption first,” he added. In an interview in June, Bureau of Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa said that online sellers earning less than P250,000 a year are exempted from paying income tax. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez also earlier clarified that online sellers operating ““intermittently or irregularly” as well as those selling homemade items as a hobby are not required to register their businesses."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1379226/pnp-to-check-reports-of-students-selling-sensual-pics-online-to-support-education","title":"PNP to check reports of students selling sensual pics online to support education","date":"03:48 PM January 04, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) will look into reports that some students have been selling sensual photos and videos online to raise funds to support their education in the time of COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) will look into reports that some students have been selling sensual photos and videos online to raise funds to support their education in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. “As of now, we will try to task our Anti-Cybercrime to monitor these postings and to track or monitor,” PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said in a press briefing Monday.  Sinas, however, explained that the police cannot just monitor social media accounts. “Until such time na may magrereklamo tungkol doon, then it becomes already a… pero kung personally nilang pinopost ‘yun, is nasa kanila po ‘yun,” he said.  “I think kung minors ‘yan, di naman kasi kami nagmo-monitor ng mga accounts ng social media.

He said the PNP will also coordinate with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) regarding the matter. “What we will do, we will task our cybercrime to monitor this one and inform the parents and maybe track and inform the parents or forward it to DSWD for professional intervention,” said Sinas. The PNP chief made this assurance after Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the Senate committee on basic education, called on law enforcement agencies to ramp up efforts in investigating reports of students allegedly selling obscene photos and videos to finance their studies. In making this call, Gatchalian cited a report from The Philippine Online Student Tambayan that revealed students use hashtags #AlterPH, #AlterPinay, and #AlterPhilippines on Twitter to sell their sensual photos and videos to help them purchase gadgets and pay for internet bills for online learning."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/136000/online-selling-buying","title":"Online selling,  buying","date":"04:07 AM December 09, 2020","snippet":"Several weeks back, my household helper told me she was leaving her job and returning to her home province to be with her children and help them with the challenges of online classes.","body":"Several weeks back, my household helper told me she was leaving her job and returning to her home province to be with her children and help them with the challenges of online classes. When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay. Let’s help make it work for our still struggling entrepreneurs, and let’s make sure our kids are prepared as well to be smart consumers. mtan@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Dr. Rufino Suropia, Cotabato provincial veterinarian, said the contamination could have been brought here through the orders of processed meat sent through couriers at the height of the lockdown.  He said online selling had been the normal recourse of residents in Magpet when the entire country was placed on enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in April and May. Online sellers from the Davao region were sending their products through couriers which passed through the COVID-19 quarantine personnel undetected, Suropia said.  Blood samples taken from pigs in at least four remote villages of Magpet town have been found positive for ASF infection, according to Arlan M. Mangelen, regional director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in Soccsksargen region, on Monday (July 13). Mangelen said ASF, a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease among domestic and wild pigs, had been detected at the villages of Ilian, Kiantog, Tagbac and Magca-alam of Magpet town.  “We are investigating these cases, we learned that processed food (chorizo) made its way to one of the villages,” Mangelen said. Several hogs have died mysteriously the past two days forcing its owners to consult the municipal agriculture office. Domestic hog raisers at the villages of Tagbac and Pangao-an also reported deaths of their domestic animals. To prevent the disease from spreading and affecting hogs in nearby villages, culling of live pigs within a one-kilometer radius from the site of infection already started on Friday (July 10) and will continue this week, he said. The culled hogs will be paid by the government, according to the prevailing market price of live meat.  Agriculture officials said ASF cases at Magpet villages were the first cases reported in Cotabato. It came after the first ASF case in Mindanao was reported in Don Marcelino town of Davao Occidental, about 185 kilometers (or a four-hour drive) from here. The provincial government had ordered the veterinary office to set up checkpoints in a 1-km radius of villages with ASF cases. Cotabato Gov. Nancy Catamco also ordered the local government of Magpet to bar the transport or delivery of live pigs and processed meat in a 5-km radius from areas with ASF cases. Sorupia said officials would enforce a lockdown in the town of Magpet to stop the entry and exit of pigs and meat products from the area. “We will compel delivery trucks to open their vehicle for inspection to stop the entry of contaminated meat products,” he said. Sorupia said the provincial veterinary office also took pigs’ blood samples to determine the extent of ASF infection. He said of the 228,000 hog population in the province, 182,000 head, or 80 percent, were from backyard farms and only 45,000 or 20 percent were from commercial farms. Mlang town Mayor Russel Abonado ordered the municipal agriculture office to look into reports of meat stands filling stretches of the national highway. He sought to assure the public, though, that all meat sold at the town’s public market were butchered at the town’s slaughterhouse, which has a double A rating and accredited by the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS).

The husband-and-wife team opened a salon in 2016 and went into online selling two months after.  Here, Ortuoste talked about the fundamentals of selling online and how she was able to adapt the concepts of trade marketing from her previous work. Q: How did you get into e-commerce?  A: We originally did not plan to get into e-commerce. Back in 2016, we bought a salon franchise. A few months into running the salon franchise, we realized it was not making enough to sustain itself. We then decided to go into online selling by chance, after a lady from Zambales messaged us on our Facebook page, asking to buy Argan oil from our salon in Mandaluyong. From there, we realized there was a distribution gap for professional hair care products and figured out how to serve clients with similar needs. Q: How do you know which product and SKU (stock keeping unit) to carry or not?  A: As a niche site, we have to be very efficient with the products we carry. We check product reviews, look up brands on Google Trends (free to use on google.com/trends) to see if there is interest, and try the products ourselves before deciding to carry a brand. We make sure the products we carry deliver on their promise. We also make sure each brand we carry contributes positively to our portfolio. Having too many brands with the same function can end up confusing customers. We keep our portfolio well-curated so as not to waste our customers’ time and money going through these products. Doing so also helps us be efficient with our own resources since we focus our time, money and energy only on brands that are likely to yield better returns. Q: What is the value proposition of HairMNL? How did you know it will work? A: We offer information and convenience to our shoppers. Our clients have pressing hair and scalp concerns. We have access to great professional hair care products. What we do is try to match their needs with the best products for them. We do this by offering free consultation online and in-store for customers who need more guidance. Our site is also laid out to help customers find what they need easily. Since we started, we’ve increased access to professional hair care products. Not everyone lives near a salon that carries the products we have. By shipping to most islands in the Philippines, we allow more people access to these products.  We did not know at the start if this would work, but intuitively knew there was a need to make our target market aware of the benefits of professional products, and provide better access to them. We started carrying just one, then three brands, but expanded after seeing that customers were responding well to our value proposition. Q: When is online selling best? A: Online selling is best for niche, high-engagement products and services, especially those that require research prior to purchase. The internet is naturally a great platform to educate shoppers on features because it allows for efficient distribution of information through images, videos, social sharing and messaging. Online selling is also best for products that can be shipped sensibly. The market should either be willing to shoulder shipping costs, or margins are high enough to cover shipping costs. Shipping is a cost intrinsic to online selling, and should really be planned out. Lastly, online selling is best for products with good barriers to entry. Marketing online can become very costly with increased competition. —CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1290266/spare-small-online-sellers-bir-urged","title":"Spare small online sellers, BIR urged","date":"05:30 AM June 12, 2020","snippet":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 60-2020 issued by the BIR on June 1 gave these businesses until July 31 to register and pay the required taxes.  The BIR’s latest directive spurred complaints from netizens and online sellers, who said they were only trying to find ways to make a living and feed their families despite the lockdown. Deputy Revenue Commissioner Arnel Guballa on Thursday told the Inquirer that the BIR was targeting “all online sellers to register.”  BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay said these included “not only partner sellers/merchants, but also other stakeholders involved such as the payment gateways, delivery channels, internet service providers and other facilitators.” Instead of cracking the whip on these small businessmen, Sen. Joel Villanueva on Thursday said the government should go after big-time tax evaders like the owners of Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos).  “We know the government needs to collect taxes. It must first go after those with proven tax liabilities. Up to now, Pogos have yet to pay the P50 billion they owe. They should be the focus of the BIR,” he said in a statement. Villanueva noted that the government had given Pogos many opportunities to settle their tax obligations. It even allowed them to operate during the quarantine provided that they settled their unpaid taxes first, he said. Villanueva said the BIR should also be accommodating to Filipino entrepreneurs. “Let us be grateful that our fellow countrymen are resourceful. We haven’t even given aid to many, and yet we plan to tax those who want to earn a living decently,” he said.  Sen. Risa Hontiveros also said the BIR should focus first on the Pogos’ unpaid taxes instead of going after Filipinos who earn little from online selling. “Why are we lax on Pogos but cruel to Filipinos?” Hontiveros said, pointing out that online gambling operators were allowed to operate during the quarantine period even if they were considered nonessential businesses. “Can we put Filipinos’ welfare first?” she said. Sen. Imee Marcos also believes the BIR move was ill-timed. “Let’s give time for the underground economy to flourish and help jump-start this country’s economy. Else, they will continue to depend on government subsidy. Two or three years, maybe,” Marcos said. Later on, she said, the BIR could ensure that e-businesses pay the proper taxes by only allowing compliant businesses to sell in the online marketplace. “They will have to show a third party-vetted compliance trust mark. That’s how other countries do it,” she said. Sen. Francis Pangilinan said this was not the time to tax and place more burden on the people. “Now is the time to give them relief and support,” he said in a text message. Sen. Sonny Angara said that while the timing of the BIR order was not the best given the difficulties many people were facing, the taxes that the bureau wanted to collect were nothing new. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The BIR is just seeking to collect taxes that are supposed to be paid under existing laws, Angara noted. “So if you ask a seller who has a store, he will say it’s only fair to have a level playing field since that seller pays the transaction taxes due,” he said in a text message. The BIR should have issued the reminder earlier, he said. Malacañang appealed for the public’s understanding regarding the government’s tax collection effort. “We are getting our funding for the COVID-19 response from the BIR and the Bureau of Customs. So while our funding requirements go up, we will continue to look for ways to increase our intake of taxes,” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. He said that “if our country’s coffers are empty, we have no way of distributing aid while COVID-19 remains a threat.” Left jobless by the lockdown imposed in March, many Filipinos resorted to e-commerce platforms and social media such as Facebook to sell food products and nonfood items. The restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for a boom in e-commerce, since people were restricted to their homes and became reliant on delivery services. Quoting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua, Roque noted that tax laws exempted online sellers who make less than P250,000 a year. “If your online business net income does not exceed P250,000, you won’t have to pay anything. You only need to register your business,” Roque said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); While these rules were already put in place seven years ago, BIR officials had admitted that it was difficult to collect online stores’ tax payments since there were no physical marketplaces that revenue officers could audit. Guballa said the BIR did not have data on these shops’ level of tax compliance. Estimates on how much more the country’s biggest tax-collection agency could collect from them would be determined once all online stores formalized their operations. Dulay said the BIR would not slap penalties on updated or late registrations, as long as these were done on or before July 31. “Likewise, they are encouraged to voluntarily declare their past transactions subject to pertinent taxes and pay the taxes due thereon, without corresponding penalty, when declared and paid on or before the said date,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1302353/dof-to-ban-online-sale-of-sin-products","title":"DOF to ban online sale of ‘sin’ products","date":"04:55 AM July 06, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces. To ensure that these products are not accessible to minors, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III on Saturday said “we will move to ban online sales of cigarettes and liquor.”  The Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003 bars cigarette makers from advertising, including on the internet, but there’s no law preventing them from selling in online marketplaces. Presidential Decree No. 1619, issued in 1979, prohibits the sale to minors of “volatile substances that induce intoxication.’’  Amid the quarantine, which limits the movement of people and access to certain goods and services, online sales are booming—and those of cigarettes are no exemption. People below 21 years old are still barred from going outside their home even under general community quarantine (GCQ), which was implemented in Metro Manila on June 1. GCQ was earlier declared in other areas.  Since March 16, minors have been cooped up in their homes as a result of the lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus. The ban on the sale of liquor, imposed by local governments to discourage social drinking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, was lifted only a few weeks ago. A check with e-commerce platform Lazada on Sunday showed popular cigarette brands being sold at big discounts of 15 percent to 55 percent. For instance, the price of a ream of mentholated Marlboro containing 10 packs of 20 sticks each was slashed 42 percent to P1,050 from P1,800. Liquors are also being sold on Lazada, although the website asks potential buyers to first confirm whether they are “at least 18 years old to enter” the page of the specific product category.  Some of the alcoholic drinks are also being offered at discounted prices. PMFTC Inc., a merger of Philip Morris International Inc. and Lucio Tan’s Fortune Tobacco, said it was allowing authorized resellers to sell cigarettes online. But Dave Gomez, communications director at PMFTC, told the Inquirer on Sunday that the company was implementing a so-called age-gating to ensure that none of its products were sold to minors. PMFTC’s trade and distribution agreements with resellers contain provisions requiring the latter to not sell to consumers below 18 years old, according to Gomez. The resellers are responsible to double-check the ages of buyers upon delivery, he said. “We’re very strict with that online sellers observe age verification.” Thus, he said, resellers were required to ask buyers to show proof through any government-issued ID. Gomez added that PMFTC would cancel agreements with resellers that did not follow age-gating. Asked to comment on Dominguez’s plan to ban online sales, he replied: “We understand the concern and agree that cigarettes should not be sold to minors, even online. Minors should not smoke, period.” “For online commerce, resellers of cigarettes should strictly observe youth-access prevention by having age-gating on their sites and require proof of age upon delivery. This is our policy,” he added. Gomez acknowledged that PMFTC brands, like any other consumer products, were seeing a surge in e-commerce sales due to the pandemic. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It was because of this online sales boom that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) moved to strictly implement registration and, eventually, tax collection among businesses in the digital space. The government was also working on a mechanism to collect value-added tax (VAT) from global digital platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Last month, Dominguez said that “as more and more transactions move online, so must our revenue measures.” He said the government would be “focusing on efforts on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what other Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are doing.” While the quarantine boosted online sales, it stopped operations of tobacco and alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the early months of the pandemic due to a liquor ban and restricted deliveries of nonessential products. When the supply of tax-paid cigarettes dwindled, trade of fake and illicit sticks flourished. The Bureau of Customs reported that the Port of Subic confiscated on July 1 three 12-meter containers of smuggled cigarettes, which had been misdeclared as LED lights. The seized cargo contained about 3,100 master cases of cigarettes valued at P93.1 million. A combination of rising illicit trade and the lockdown restrictions on production had resulted in weak “sin” tax revenue to date. As of end-May, the combined take from tobacco and alcohol products fell 39 percent year-on-year to P63.1 billion. This was despite the higher levies slapped on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and alcoholic drinks under Republic Act No. 11346, or the tobacco tax law of 2019 signed by President Duterte last year, as well as RA 11467 signed in January.

Insurance Commissioner Dennis Funa said face-to-face selling of insurance products had been rendered “impractical” by the COVID-19 quarantine. Previously, only insurance products worth not more than P50,000 or single premium contracts not exceeding P150,000 were allowed to be sold through means other than face-to-face transactions.

Ms Jazzmin San Mateo, a senior high student, says her 40-year-old mother began selling noodles, spring rolls and fried bananas online after she was furloughed from her job as a payrolls officer in June. Her mother always had a knack for cooking, and had been supplementing her income with a makeshift food stand in front of their home, she adds. The single parent supports four school-going children. “My mother doesn’t know when she’ll be called back to work,” says Ms San Mateo. So for now, they are all relying on her mother’s cooked food sales to get them through the day. It’s a tough job that affords little time to rest, and everyone in the family has to pitch in to keep the money coming, she says. Ms San Mateo says she’s the social media marketer and helps her brother with the deliveries. “But I can see my mother’s happy, even with the modest profit, especially when she receives glowing feedback for her cooking and she sees us not going hungry,” she says.  Those who do not have the means to go online are bringing what they have to sell directly to their customers’ homes. Mr Albert Terejesas, 26, and his wife walk about 10 km a day to sell fish, shrimp and squid from one home to another. His mother used to have a vegetable stall in a public market. But when much of the country was shut down in March, people stopped coming. So, around April, he decided to go to the buyers instead. He and his wife would head to a fisherman’s wharf very early in the morning and fill two pails with seafood that they load onto a bicycle, and begin knocking on doors. He makes about P500 to P600 a day this way. “It’s a decent living,” he says. But it is a daily grind or they’d have no income. He constantly worries about getting sick. He has two children, aged one and four. For now, the demand is there. With some 27 million still under shelter-at-home restrictions and a still-raging coronavirus outbreak, seven out of 10 Filipinos living in the capital are buying most of the stuff they need online. Data released by the government showed a 6.6 percent growth in the communications and information sector. “What that data is telling us is that there is high demand for telco services due to a surge in demand for e-commerce,” Economic Planning Secretary Karl Chua says. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Grab Philippines public relations manager Arvi Lopez told The Straits Times that its food delivery business, GrabFood, had seen a fourfold increase in deliveries since the pandemic. Mr Roland Gonzales, 37, started delivering for GrabFood in June, after the printing company he was working at wound down as sales plummeted. He says he is still working his way up GrabFood’s accreditation ladder. He makes up to 600 pesos from four trips a day, enough to cover for the income he lost at his previous job. The more seasoned drivers make at least eight deliveries a day, he says. While there is a huge demand for online goods and services, the margins for most sellers are not very large, and many of them would rather go back to their old, regular-paying jobs. “It’s not a windfall,” says Ms San Mateo, whose mother makes about P400 a day selling food online. That is less than the P500  minimum wage in Metropolitan Manila. Her brother, who is in college, has had to skip school this year, and she is not sure if she will be able to purchase the laptop and phone she needs for online schooling. “I guess we just have to help each other out to get through this,” she says. The market for those hustling online is expected to be there as long as a virus-wary population continues to shun malls, public markets, department stores, groceries and restaurants. Mr Steven Tan, president of the country’s largest mall chain SM Supermalls, says he does not expect foot traffic to pick up till December. All its tenants had to shutter when a sweeping two-month lockdown was imposed in March. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Overall, while the online gig economy is providing a lifeline to those who have lost their jobs or had to shut down their businesses, it is in no way supplanting gainful employment or a fully operational business. Mr Jan Vincent C Robles, 32, sells 40 pieces of shawarma a day from home via GrabFood or Foodpanda, at about 100 pesos each. He is now thinking of renting a food stall along a busy road to augment his income if he can’t restart his audio and lighting business. He used to make much more renting out equipment for weddings and birthday parties. Mr Gonzales, the GrabFood rider, says although he earns slightly more now, he’d still rather go back to his old job. “The hours are fixed, and it’s still safer to be inside an office than being on the road riding a motorcycle all day, with the virus still out there,” he says.

In making his appeal, the governor pointed out that owners of small businesses are “barely making a profit” during the period of community quarantine that was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.  “I am asking the national government to PLEASE consider delaying the taxation of online trading or selling. This is for the benefit of small business entrepreneurs,” Remulla said in a Facebook post. “Rather than impose taxes, we should create programs, encourage and inspire people to shift to the new digital economy. I think innovation and progress is what the country truly needs,” he added.  The official also cited a Social Weather Stations’s survey in July which showed that the adult unemployment in the country rose to 45.5 percent, or a 28-point increase from the 17.1 percent in December 2019, setting a record-high from the 34.4 percent in March 2012. He pointed out that online selling is one of the effective ways to cope with the pandemic, adding that even teachers and other professionals who lost their jobs during the crisis have engaged in this business.  In Silang, Cavite, where Remulla lives, owners of shops of ornamental plants have also taken their businesses online, according to the governor. “There is no reason not to support those who are crafty, resourceful, street smart and adaptive to the modern world. Please, let us not burden them. Rather, let us work together to make their numbers grow. Let us boost their spirits so that someday, they may be big enough to pay bigger taxes,” he said. “Let us give comfort to those who are striving to survive. They are not even asking for a dole out. These entrepreneurs are not depending on the SAP. They are just trying to make a living in order to provide for their families. Is it that difficult to make the lives of the people we serve easier?” he added. Remulla also took a swipe at corruption issues especially those hounding the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, saying that “now is the time to prove our campaign promises.” READ: Amid ‘carousel of lies,’ Senate ready to come out with findings on PhilHealth probe  “If we are successful in this endeavor, then maybe paying taxes will be worth it for everyone,” he said. “Let us give our small scale business owners a break from the burden of taxes at this very difficult time and fix the issues of corruption first,” he added. In an interview in June, Bureau of Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa said that online sellers earning less than P250,000 a year are exempted from paying income tax. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez also earlier clarified that online sellers operating ““intermittently or irregularly” as well as those selling homemade items as a hobby are not required to register their businesses."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1379226/pnp-to-check-reports-of-students-selling-sensual-pics-online-to-support-education","title":"PNP to check reports of students selling sensual pics online to support education","date":"03:48 PM January 04, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) will look into reports that some students have been selling sensual photos and videos online to raise funds to support their education in the time of COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) will look into reports that some students have been selling sensual photos and videos online to raise funds to support their education in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. “As of now, we will try to task our Anti-Cybercrime to monitor these postings and to track or monitor,” PNP chief Gen.

Sinas, however, explained that the police cannot just monitor social media accounts. “Until such time na may magrereklamo tungkol doon, then it becomes already a… pero kung personally nilang pinopost ‘yun, is nasa kanila po ‘yun,” he said.  “I think kung minors ‘yan, di naman kasi kami nagmo-monitor ng mga accounts ng social media.

The PNP chief made this assurance after Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the Senate committee on basic education, called on law enforcement agencies to ramp up efforts in investigating reports of students allegedly selling obscene photos and videos to finance their studies.

When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay. Let’s help make it work for our still struggling entrepreneurs, and let’s make sure our kids are prepared as well to be smart consumers. mtan@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Dr. Rufino Suropia, Cotabato provincial veterinarian, said the contamination could have been brought here through the orders of processed meat sent through couriers at the height of the lockdown.  He said online selling had been the normal recourse of residents in Magpet when the entire country was placed on enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in April and May. Online sellers from the Davao region were sending their products through couriers which passed through the COVID-19 quarantine personnel undetected, Suropia said.  Blood samples taken from pigs in at least four remote villages of Magpet town have been found positive for ASF infection, according to Arlan M. Mangelen, regional director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in Soccsksargen region, on Monday (July 13). Mangelen said ASF, a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease among domestic and wild pigs, had been detected at the villages of Ilian, Kiantog, Tagbac and Magca-alam of Magpet town.  “We are investigating these cases, we learned that processed food (chorizo) made its way to one of the villages,” Mangelen said. Several hogs have died mysteriously the past two days forcing its owners to consult the municipal agriculture office. Domestic hog raisers at the villages of Tagbac and Pangao-an also reported deaths of their domestic animals. To prevent the disease from spreading and affecting hogs in nearby villages, culling of live pigs within a one-kilometer radius from the site of infection already started on Friday (July 10) and will continue this week, he said. The culled hogs will be paid by the government, according to the prevailing market price of live meat.  Agriculture officials said ASF cases at Magpet villages were the first cases reported in Cotabato. It came after the first ASF case in Mindanao was reported in Don Marcelino town of Davao Occidental, about 185 kilometers (or a four-hour drive) from here. The provincial government had ordered the veterinary office to set up checkpoints in a 1-km radius of villages with ASF cases. Cotabato Gov. Nancy Catamco also ordered the local government of Magpet to bar the transport or delivery of live pigs and processed meat in a 5-km radius from areas with ASF cases. Sorupia said officials would enforce a lockdown in the town of Magpet to stop the entry and exit of pigs and meat products from the area. “We will compel delivery trucks to open their vehicle for inspection to stop the entry of contaminated meat products,” he said. Sorupia said the provincial veterinary office also took pigs’ blood samples to determine the extent of ASF infection. He said of the 228,000 hog population in the province, 182,000 head, or 80 percent, were from backyard farms and only 45,000 or 20 percent were from commercial farms. Mlang town Mayor Russel Abonado ordered the municipal agriculture office to look into reports of meat stands filling stretches of the national highway. He sought to assure the public, though, that all meat sold at the town’s public market were butchered at the town’s slaughterhouse, which has a double A rating and accredited by the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS).

The husband-and-wife team opened a salon in 2016 and went into online selling two months after.  Here, Ortuoste talked about the fundamentals of selling online and how she was able to adapt the concepts of trade marketing from her previous work. Q: How did you get into e-commerce?  A: We originally did not plan to get into e-commerce. Back in 2016, we bought a salon franchise. A few months into running the salon franchise, we realized it was not making enough to sustain itself. We then decided to go into online selling by chance, after a lady from Zambales messaged us on our Facebook page, asking to buy Argan oil from our salon in Mandaluyong. From there, we realized there was a distribution gap for professional hair care products and figured out how to serve clients with similar needs. Q: How do you know which product and SKU (stock keeping unit) to carry or not?  A: As a niche site, we have to be very efficient with the products we carry. We check product reviews, look up brands on Google Trends (free to use on google.com/trends) to see if there is interest, and try the products ourselves before deciding to carry a brand. We make sure the products we carry deliver on their promise. We also make sure each brand we carry contributes positively to our portfolio. Having too many brands with the same function can end up confusing customers. We keep our portfolio well-curated so as not to waste our customers’ time and money going through these products. Doing so also helps us be efficient with our own resources since we focus our time, money and energy only on brands that are likely to yield better returns. Q: What is the value proposition of HairMNL? How did you know it will work? A: We offer information and convenience to our shoppers. Our clients have pressing hair and scalp concerns. We have access to great professional hair care products. What we do is try to match their needs with the best products for them. We do this by offering free consultation online and in-store for customers who need more guidance. Our site is also laid out to help customers find what they need easily. Since we started, we’ve increased access to professional hair care products. Not everyone lives near a salon that carries the products we have. By shipping to most islands in the Philippines, we allow more people access to these products.  We did not know at the start if this would work, but intuitively knew there was a need to make our target market aware of the benefits of professional products, and provide better access to them. We started carrying just one, then three brands, but expanded after seeing that customers were responding well to our value proposition. Q: When is online selling best? A: Online selling is best for niche, high-engagement products and services, especially those that require research prior to purchase. The internet is naturally a great platform to educate shoppers on features because it allows for efficient distribution of information through images, videos, social sharing and messaging. Online selling is also best for products that can be shipped sensibly. The market should either be willing to shoulder shipping costs, or margins are high enough to cover shipping costs. Shipping is a cost intrinsic to online selling, and should really be planned out. Lastly, online selling is best for products with good barriers to entry. Marketing online can become very costly with increased competition. —CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1290266/spare-small-online-sellers-bir-urged","title":"Spare small online sellers, BIR urged","date":"05:30 AM June 12, 2020","snippet":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 60-2020 issued by the BIR on June 1 gave these businesses until July 31 to register and pay the required taxes.  The BIR’s latest directive spurred complaints from netizens and online sellers, who said they were only trying to find ways to make a living and feed their families despite the lockdown. Deputy Revenue Commissioner Arnel Guballa on Thursday told the Inquirer that the BIR was targeting “all online sellers to register.”  BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay said these included “not only partner sellers/merchants, but also other stakeholders involved such as the payment gateways, delivery channels, internet service providers and other facilitators.” Instead of cracking the whip on these small businessmen, Sen. Joel Villanueva on Thursday said the government should go after big-time tax evaders like the owners of Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos).  “We know the government needs to collect taxes. It must first go after those with proven tax liabilities. Up to now, Pogos have yet to pay the P50 billion they owe. They should be the focus of the BIR,” he said in a statement. Villanueva noted that the government had given Pogos many opportunities to settle their tax obligations. It even allowed them to operate during the quarantine provided that they settled their unpaid taxes first, he said. Villanueva said the BIR should also be accommodating to Filipino entrepreneurs. “Let us be grateful that our fellow countrymen are resourceful. We haven’t even given aid to many, and yet we plan to tax those who want to earn a living decently,” he said.  Sen. Risa Hontiveros also said the BIR should focus first on the Pogos’ unpaid taxes instead of going after Filipinos who earn little from online selling. “Why are we lax on Pogos but cruel to Filipinos?” Hontiveros said, pointing out that online gambling operators were allowed to operate during the quarantine period even if they were considered nonessential businesses. “Can we put Filipinos’ welfare first?” she said. Sen. Imee Marcos also believes the BIR move was ill-timed. “Let’s give time for the underground economy to flourish and help jump-start this country’s economy. Else, they will continue to depend on government subsidy. Two or three years, maybe,” Marcos said. Later on, she said, the BIR could ensure that e-businesses pay the proper taxes by only allowing compliant businesses to sell in the online marketplace. “They will have to show a third party-vetted compliance trust mark. That’s how other countries do it,” she said. Sen. Francis Pangilinan said this was not the time to tax and place more burden on the people. “Now is the time to give them relief and support,” he said in a text message. Sen. Sonny Angara said that while the timing of the BIR order was not the best given the difficulties many people were facing, the taxes that the bureau wanted to collect were nothing new. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The BIR is just seeking to collect taxes that are supposed to be paid under existing laws, Angara noted. “So if you ask a seller who has a store, he will say it’s only fair to have a level playing field since that seller pays the transaction taxes due,” he said in a text message. The BIR should have issued the reminder earlier, he said. Malacañang appealed for the public’s understanding regarding the government’s tax collection effort. “We are getting our funding for the COVID-19 response from the BIR and the Bureau of Customs. So while our funding requirements go up, we will continue to look for ways to increase our intake of taxes,” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. He said that “if our country’s coffers are empty, we have no way of distributing aid while COVID-19 remains a threat.” Left jobless by the lockdown imposed in March, many Filipinos resorted to e-commerce platforms and social media such as Facebook to sell food products and nonfood items. The restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for a boom in e-commerce, since people were restricted to their homes and became reliant on delivery services. Quoting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua, Roque noted that tax laws exempted online sellers who make less than P250,000 a year. “If your online business net income does not exceed P250,000, you won’t have to pay anything. You only need to register your business,” Roque said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); While these rules were already put in place seven years ago, BIR officials had admitted that it was difficult to collect online stores’ tax payments since there were no physical marketplaces that revenue officers could audit. Guballa said the BIR did not have data on these shops’ level of tax compliance. Estimates on how much more the country’s biggest tax-collection agency could collect from them would be determined once all online stores formalized their operations. Dulay said the BIR would not slap penalties on updated or late registrations, as long as these were done on or before July 31. “Likewise, they are encouraged to voluntarily declare their past transactions subject to pertinent taxes and pay the taxes due thereon, without corresponding penalty, when declared and paid on or before the said date,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1302353/dof-to-ban-online-sale-of-sin-products","title":"DOF to ban online sale of ‘sin’ products","date":"04:55 AM July 06, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces. To ensure that these products are not accessible to minors, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III on Saturday said “we will move to ban online sales of cigarettes and liquor.”  The Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003 bars cigarette makers from advertising, including on the internet, but there’s no law preventing them from selling in online marketplaces. Presidential Decree No. 1619, issued in 1979, prohibits the sale to minors of “volatile substances that induce intoxication.’’  Amid the quarantine, which limits the movement of people and access to certain goods and services, online sales are booming—and those of cigarettes are no exemption. People below 21 years old are still barred from going outside their home even under general community quarantine (GCQ), which was implemented in Metro Manila on June 1. GCQ was earlier declared in other areas.  Since March 16, minors have been cooped up in their homes as a result of the lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus. The ban on the sale of liquor, imposed by local governments to discourage social drinking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, was lifted only a few weeks ago. A check with e-commerce platform Lazada on Sunday showed popular cigarette brands being sold at big discounts of 15 percent to 55 percent. For instance, the price of a ream of mentholated Marlboro containing 10 packs of 20 sticks each was slashed 42 percent to P1,050 from P1,800. Liquors are also being sold on Lazada, although the website asks potential buyers to first confirm whether they are “at least 18 years old to enter” the page of the specific product category.  Some of the alcoholic drinks are also being offered at discounted prices. PMFTC Inc., a merger of Philip Morris International Inc. and Lucio Tan’s Fortune Tobacco, said it was allowing authorized resellers to sell cigarettes online. But Dave Gomez, communications director at PMFTC, told the Inquirer on Sunday that the company was implementing a so-called age-gating to ensure that none of its products were sold to minors. PMFTC’s trade and distribution agreements with resellers contain provisions requiring the latter to not sell to consumers below 18 years old, according to Gomez. The resellers are responsible to double-check the ages of buyers upon delivery, he said. “We’re very strict with that online sellers observe age verification.” Thus, he said, resellers were required to ask buyers to show proof through any government-issued ID. Gomez added that PMFTC would cancel agreements with resellers that did not follow age-gating. Asked to comment on Dominguez’s plan to ban online sales, he replied: “We understand the concern and agree that cigarettes should not be sold to minors, even online. Minors should not smoke, period.” “For online commerce, resellers of cigarettes should strictly observe youth-access prevention by having age-gating on their sites and require proof of age upon delivery. This is our policy,” he added. Gomez acknowledged that PMFTC brands, like any other consumer products, were seeing a surge in e-commerce sales due to the pandemic. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It was because of this online sales boom that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) moved to strictly implement registration and, eventually, tax collection among businesses in the digital space. The government was also working on a mechanism to collect value-added tax (VAT) from global digital platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Last month, Dominguez said that “as more and more transactions move online, so must our revenue measures.” He said the government would be “focusing on efforts on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what other Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are doing.” While the quarantine boosted online sales, it stopped operations of tobacco and alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the early months of the pandemic due to a liquor ban and restricted deliveries of nonessential products. When the supply of tax-paid cigarettes dwindled, trade of fake and illicit sticks flourished. The Bureau of Customs reported that the Port of Subic confiscated on July 1 three 12-meter containers of smuggled cigarettes, which had been misdeclared as LED lights. The seized cargo contained about 3,100 master cases of cigarettes valued at P93.1 million. A combination of rising illicit trade and the lockdown restrictions on production had resulted in weak “sin” tax revenue to date. As of end-May, the combined take from tobacco and alcohol products fell 39 percent year-on-year to P63.1 billion.

Insurance Commissioner Dennis Funa said face-to-face selling of insurance products had been rendered “impractical” by the COVID-19 quarantine. Previously, only insurance products worth not more than P50,000 or single premium contracts not exceeding P150,000 were allowed to be sold through means other than face-to-face transactions.

Throughout the morning, a kilo of tilapias, a bagful of onions, garlic and ginger, and a powerbank were delivered to her doorstep. Still to arrive is an order of iced coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts.  “I try not to go out if I can help it. Good thing that now you can buy almost anything online,” she says With at least two million without jobs and over 83,000 businesses shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic, people here are trying to eke out a living selling anything they can online or knocking on doors from one house to another.  Pilots and flight attendants have hung up their snazzy uniforms and now driving around Manila to deliver dim sum. A popular rapper raps jingles on his Facebook and YouTube accounts to promote his fried chicken business. Those living in gated communities are setting up Facebook pages to connect buyers and sellers within the neighborhoods. Anything from rugs and air-conditioners, to a used McLaren sports car, is being traded.  Ms Jazzmin San Mateo, a senior high student, says her 40-year-old mother began selling noodles, spring rolls and fried bananas online after she was furloughed from her job as a payrolls officer in June. Her mother always had a knack for cooking, and had been supplementing her income with a makeshift food stand in front of their home, she adds. The single parent supports four school-going children. “My mother doesn’t know when she’ll be called back to work,” says Ms San Mateo. So for now, they are all relying on her mother’s cooked food sales to get them through the day. It’s a tough job that affords little time to rest, and everyone in the family has to pitch in to keep the money coming, she says. Ms San Mateo says she’s the social media marketer and helps her brother with the deliveries. “But I can see my mother’s happy, even with the modest profit, especially when she receives glowing feedback for her cooking and she sees us not going hungry,” she says.  Those who do not have the means to go online are bringing what they have to sell directly to their customers’ homes. Mr Albert Terejesas, 26, and his wife walk about 10 km a day to sell fish, shrimp and squid from one home to another. His mother used to have a vegetable stall in a public market. But when much of the country was shut down in March, people stopped coming. So, around April, he decided to go to the buyers instead. He and his wife would head to a fisherman’s wharf very early in the morning and fill two pails with seafood that they load onto a bicycle, and begin knocking on doors. He makes about P500 to P600 a day this way. “It’s a decent living,” he says. But it is a daily grind or they’d have no income. He constantly worries about getting sick. He has two children, aged one and four. For now, the demand is there. With some 27 million still under shelter-at-home restrictions and a still-raging coronavirus outbreak, seven out of 10 Filipinos living in the capital are buying most of the stuff they need online. Data released by the government showed a 6.6 percent growth in the communications and information sector. “What that data is telling us is that there is high demand for telco services due to a surge in demand for e-commerce,” Economic Planning Secretary Karl Chua says. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Grab Philippines public relations manager Arvi Lopez told The Straits Times that its food delivery business, GrabFood, had seen a fourfold increase in deliveries since the pandemic. Mr Roland Gonzales, 37, started delivering for GrabFood in June, after the printing company he was working at wound down as sales plummeted. He says he is still working his way up GrabFood’s accreditation ladder. He makes up to 600 pesos from four trips a day, enough to cover for the income he lost at his previous job. The more seasoned drivers make at least eight deliveries a day, he says. While there is a huge demand for online goods and services, the margins for most sellers are not very large, and many of them would rather go back to their old, regular-paying jobs. “It’s not a windfall,” says Ms San Mateo, whose mother makes about P400 a day selling food online. That is less than the P500  minimum wage in Metropolitan Manila. Her brother, who is in college, has had to skip school this year, and she is not sure if she will be able to purchase the laptop and phone she needs for online schooling. “I guess we just have to help each other out to get through this,” she says. The market for those hustling online is expected to be there as long as a virus-wary population continues to shun malls, public markets, department stores, groceries and restaurants. Mr Steven Tan, president of the country’s largest mall chain SM Supermalls, says he does not expect foot traffic to pick up till December. All its tenants had to shutter when a sweeping two-month lockdown was imposed in March. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Overall, while the online gig economy is providing a lifeline to those who have lost their jobs or had to shut down their businesses, it is in no way supplanting gainful employment or a fully operational business. Mr Jan Vincent C Robles, 32, sells 40 pieces of shawarma a day from home via GrabFood or Foodpanda, at about 100 pesos each. He is now thinking of renting a food stall along a busy road to augment his income if he can’t restart his audio and lighting business. He used to make much more renting out equipment for weddings and birthday parties. Mr Gonzales, the GrabFood rider, says although he earns slightly more now, he’d still rather go back to his old job. “The hours are fixed, and it’s still safer to be inside an office than being on the road riding a motorcycle all day, with the virus still out there,” he says.

In making his appeal, the governor pointed out that owners of small businesses are “barely making a profit” during the period of community quarantine that was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.  “I am asking the national government to PLEASE consider delaying the taxation of online trading or selling. This is for the benefit of small business entrepreneurs,” Remulla said in a Facebook post. “Rather than impose taxes, we should create programs, encourage and inspire people to shift to the new digital economy. I think innovation and progress is what the country truly needs,” he added.  The official also cited a Social Weather Stations’s survey in July which showed that the adult unemployment in the country rose to 45.5 percent, or a 28-point increase from the 17.1 percent in December 2019, setting a record-high from the 34.4 percent in March 2012. He pointed out that online selling is one of the effective ways to cope with the pandemic, adding that even teachers and other professionals who lost their jobs during the crisis have engaged in this business.  In Silang, Cavite, where Remulla lives, owners of shops of ornamental plants have also taken their businesses online, according to the governor. “There is no reason not to support those who are crafty, resourceful, street smart and adaptive to the modern world. Please, let us not burden them. Rather, let us work together to make their numbers grow. Let us boost their spirits so that someday, they may be big enough to pay bigger taxes,” he said. “Let us give comfort to those who are striving to survive. They are not even asking for a dole out. These entrepreneurs are not depending on the SAP. They are just trying to make a living in order to provide for their families. Is it that difficult to make the lives of the people we serve easier?” he added. Remulla also took a swipe at corruption issues especially those hounding the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, saying that “now is the time to prove our campaign promises.” READ: Amid ‘carousel of lies,’ Senate ready to come out with findings on PhilHealth probe  “If we are successful in this endeavor, then maybe paying taxes will be worth it for everyone,” he said. “Let us give our small scale business owners a break from the burden of taxes at this very difficult time and fix the issues of corruption first,” he added. In an interview in June, Bureau of Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner for Operations Arnel Guballa said that online sellers earning less than P250,000 a year are exempted from paying income tax.

The PNP chief made this assurance after Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, chair of the Senate committee on basic education, called on law enforcement agencies to ramp up efforts in investigating reports of students allegedly selling obscene photos and videos to finance their studies.

When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay.

Dr. Rufino Suropia, Cotabato provincial veterinarian, said the contamination could have been brought here through the orders of processed meat sent through couriers at the height of the lockdown.  He said online selling had been the normal recourse of residents in Magpet when the entire country was placed on enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in April and May. Online sellers from the Davao region were sending their products through couriers which passed through the COVID-19 quarantine personnel undetected, Suropia said.  Blood samples taken from pigs in at least four remote villages of Magpet town have been found positive for ASF infection, according to Arlan M. Mangelen, regional director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in Soccsksargen region, on Monday (July 13). Mangelen said ASF, a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease among domestic and wild pigs, had been detected at the villages of Ilian, Kiantog, Tagbac and Magca-alam of Magpet town.  “We are investigating these cases, we learned that processed food (chorizo) made its way to one of the villages,” Mangelen said. Several hogs have died mysteriously the past two days forcing its owners to consult the municipal agriculture office. Domestic hog raisers at the villages of Tagbac and Pangao-an also reported deaths of their domestic animals. To prevent the disease from spreading and affecting hogs in nearby villages, culling of live pigs within a one-kilometer radius from the site of infection already started on Friday (July 10) and will continue this week, he said. The culled hogs will be paid by the government, according to the prevailing market price of live meat.  Agriculture officials said ASF cases at Magpet villages were the first cases reported in Cotabato. It came after the first ASF case in Mindanao was reported in Don Marcelino town of Davao Occidental, about 185 kilometers (or a four-hour drive) from here. The provincial government had ordered the veterinary office to set up checkpoints in a 1-km radius of villages with ASF cases. Cotabato Gov. Nancy Catamco also ordered the local government of Magpet to bar the transport or delivery of live pigs and processed meat in a 5-km radius from areas with ASF cases. Sorupia said officials would enforce a lockdown in the town of Magpet to stop the entry and exit of pigs and meat products from the area. “We will compel delivery trucks to open their vehicle for inspection to stop the entry of contaminated meat products,” he said. Sorupia said the provincial veterinary office also took pigs’ blood samples to determine the extent of ASF infection. He said of the 228,000 hog population in the province, 182,000 head, or 80 percent, were from backyard farms and only 45,000 or 20 percent were from commercial farms. Mlang town Mayor Russel Abonado ordered the municipal agriculture office to look into reports of meat stands filling stretches of the national highway. He sought to assure the public, though, that all meat sold at the town’s public market were butchered at the town’s slaughterhouse, which has a double A rating and accredited by the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS).

The husband-and-wife team opened a salon in 2016 and went into online selling two months after.  Here, Ortuoste talked about the fundamentals of selling online and how she was able to adapt the concepts of trade marketing from her previous work. Q: How did you get into e-commerce?  A: We originally did not plan to get into e-commerce. Back in 2016, we bought a salon franchise. A few months into running the salon franchise, we realized it was not making enough to sustain itself. We then decided to go into online selling by chance, after a lady from Zambales messaged us on our Facebook page, asking to buy Argan oil from our salon in Mandaluyong. From there, we realized there was a distribution gap for professional hair care products and figured out how to serve clients with similar needs. Q: How do you know which product and SKU (stock keeping unit) to carry or not?  A: As a niche site, we have to be very efficient with the products we carry. We check product reviews, look up brands on Google Trends (free to use on google.com/trends) to see if there is interest, and try the products ourselves before deciding to carry a brand. We make sure the products we carry deliver on their promise. We also make sure each brand we carry contributes positively to our portfolio. Having too many brands with the same function can end up confusing customers. We keep our portfolio well-curated so as not to waste our customers’ time and money going through these products. Doing so also helps us be efficient with our own resources since we focus our time, money and energy only on brands that are likely to yield better returns. Q: What is the value proposition of HairMNL? How did you know it will work? A: We offer information and convenience to our shoppers. Our clients have pressing hair and scalp concerns. We have access to great professional hair care products. What we do is try to match their needs with the best products for them. We do this by offering free consultation online and in-store for customers who need more guidance. Our site is also laid out to help customers find what they need easily. Since we started, we’ve increased access to professional hair care products. Not everyone lives near a salon that carries the products we have. By shipping to most islands in the Philippines, we allow more people access to these products.  We did not know at the start if this would work, but intuitively knew there was a need to make our target market aware of the benefits of professional products, and provide better access to them. We started carrying just one, then three brands, but expanded after seeing that customers were responding well to our value proposition. Q: When is online selling best? A: Online selling is best for niche, high-engagement products and services, especially those that require research prior to purchase. The internet is naturally a great platform to educate shoppers on features because it allows for efficient distribution of information through images, videos, social sharing and messaging. Online selling is also best for products that can be shipped sensibly. The market should either be willing to shoulder shipping costs, or margins are high enough to cover shipping costs. Shipping is a cost intrinsic to online selling, and should really be planned out. Lastly, online selling is best for products with good barriers to entry. Marketing online can become very costly with increased competition. —CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1290266/spare-small-online-sellers-bir-urged","title":"Spare small online sellers, BIR urged","date":"05:30 AM June 12, 2020","snippet":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"Several senators are questioning the move by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to press owners of online shops to register their businesses during an economic crisis, saying this would burden and not help small entrepreneurs who are trying to cope with an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 60-2020 issued by the BIR on June 1 gave these businesses until July 31 to register and pay the required taxes.  The BIR’s latest directive spurred complaints from netizens and online sellers, who said they were only trying to find ways to make a living and feed their families despite the lockdown. Deputy Revenue Commissioner Arnel Guballa on Thursday told the Inquirer that the BIR was targeting “all online sellers to register.”  BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay said these included “not only partner sellers/merchants, but also other stakeholders involved such as the payment gateways, delivery channels, internet service providers and other facilitators.” Instead of cracking the whip on these small businessmen, Sen. Joel Villanueva on Thursday said the government should go after big-time tax evaders like the owners of Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos).  “We know the government needs to collect taxes. It must first go after those with proven tax liabilities. Up to now, Pogos have yet to pay the P50 billion they owe. They should be the focus of the BIR,” he said in a statement. Villanueva noted that the government had given Pogos many opportunities to settle their tax obligations. It even allowed them to operate during the quarantine provided that they settled their unpaid taxes first, he said. Villanueva said the BIR should also be accommodating to Filipino entrepreneurs. “Let us be grateful that our fellow countrymen are resourceful. We haven’t even given aid to many, and yet we plan to tax those who want to earn a living decently,” he said.  Sen. Risa Hontiveros also said the BIR should focus first on the Pogos’ unpaid taxes instead of going after Filipinos who earn little from online selling. “Why are we lax on Pogos but cruel to Filipinos?” Hontiveros said, pointing out that online gambling operators were allowed to operate during the quarantine period even if they were considered nonessential businesses. “Can we put Filipinos’ welfare first?” she said. Sen. Imee Marcos also believes the BIR move was ill-timed. “Let’s give time for the underground economy to flourish and help jump-start this country’s economy. Else, they will continue to depend on government subsidy. Two or three years, maybe,” Marcos said. Later on, she said, the BIR could ensure that e-businesses pay the proper taxes by only allowing compliant businesses to sell in the online marketplace. “They will have to show a third party-vetted compliance trust mark. That’s how other countries do it,” she said. Sen. Francis Pangilinan said this was not the time to tax and place more burden on the people. “Now is the time to give them relief and support,” he said in a text message. Sen. Sonny Angara said that while the timing of the BIR order was not the best given the difficulties many people were facing, the taxes that the bureau wanted to collect were nothing new. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The BIR is just seeking to collect taxes that are supposed to be paid under existing laws, Angara noted. “So if you ask a seller who has a store, he will say it’s only fair to have a level playing field since that seller pays the transaction taxes due,” he said in a text message. The BIR should have issued the reminder earlier, he said. Malacañang appealed for the public’s understanding regarding the government’s tax collection effort. “We are getting our funding for the COVID-19 response from the BIR and the Bureau of Customs. So while our funding requirements go up, we will continue to look for ways to increase our intake of taxes,” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. He said that “if our country’s coffers are empty, we have no way of distributing aid while COVID-19 remains a threat.” Left jobless by the lockdown imposed in March, many Filipinos resorted to e-commerce platforms and social media such as Facebook to sell food products and nonfood items. The restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for a boom in e-commerce, since people were restricted to their homes and became reliant on delivery services. Quoting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua, Roque noted that tax laws exempted online sellers who make less than P250,000 a year. “If your online business net income does not exceed P250,000, you won’t have to pay anything. You only need to register your business,” Roque said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); While these rules were already put in place seven years ago, BIR officials had admitted that it was difficult to collect online stores’ tax payments since there were no physical marketplaces that revenue officers could audit. Guballa said the BIR did not have data on these shops’ level of tax compliance. Estimates on how much more the country’s biggest tax-collection agency could collect from them would be determined once all online stores formalized their operations. Dulay said the BIR would not slap penalties on updated or late registrations, as long as these were done on or before July 31. “Likewise, they are encouraged to voluntarily declare their past transactions subject to pertinent taxes and pay the taxes due thereon, without corresponding penalty, when declared and paid on or before the said date,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1302353/dof-to-ban-online-sale-of-sin-products","title":"DOF to ban online sale of ‘sin’ products","date":"04:55 AM July 06, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — While cigarettes and liquor are enjoying brisk sales online in the time of pandemic and are delivered to the comforts of home of buyers, who may include minors, the Department of Finance (DOF) wants to stop the sale of the “sin” products in digital marketplaces.

Presidential Decree No. 1619, issued in 1979, prohibits the sale to minors of “volatile substances that induce intoxication.’’  Amid the quarantine, which limits the movement of people and access to certain goods and services, online sales are booming—and those of cigarettes are no exemption. People below 21 years old are still barred from going outside their home even under general community quarantine (GCQ), which was implemented in Metro Manila on June 1. GCQ was earlier declared in other areas.  Since March 16, minors have been cooped up in their homes as a result of the lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus. The ban on the sale of liquor, imposed by local governments to discourage social drinking to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, was lifted only a few weeks ago. A check with e-commerce platform Lazada on Sunday showed popular cigarette brands being sold at big discounts of 15 percent to 55 percent. For instance, the price of a ream of mentholated Marlboro containing 10 packs of 20 sticks each was slashed 42 percent to P1,050 from P1,800. Liquors are also being sold on Lazada, although the website asks potential buyers to first confirm whether they are “at least 18 years old to enter” the page of the specific product category.  Some of the alcoholic drinks are also being offered at discounted prices. PMFTC Inc., a merger of Philip Morris International Inc. and Lucio Tan’s Fortune Tobacco, said it was allowing authorized resellers to sell cigarettes online. But Dave Gomez, communications director at PMFTC, told the Inquirer on Sunday that the company was implementing a so-called age-gating to ensure that none of its products were sold to minors. PMFTC’s trade and distribution agreements with resellers contain provisions requiring the latter to not sell to consumers below 18 years old, according to Gomez. The resellers are responsible to double-check the ages of buyers upon delivery, he said. “We’re very strict with that online sellers observe age verification.” Thus, he said, resellers were required to ask buyers to show proof through any government-issued ID. Gomez added that PMFTC would cancel agreements with resellers that did not follow age-gating. Asked to comment on Dominguez’s plan to ban online sales, he replied: “We understand the concern and agree that cigarettes should not be sold to minors, even online. Minors should not smoke, period.” “For online commerce, resellers of cigarettes should strictly observe youth-access prevention by having age-gating on their sites and require proof of age upon delivery. This is our policy,” he added. Gomez acknowledged that PMFTC brands, like any other consumer products, were seeing a surge in e-commerce sales due to the pandemic. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); It was because of this online sales boom that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) moved to strictly implement registration and, eventually, tax collection among businesses in the digital space. The government was also working on a mechanism to collect value-added tax (VAT) from global digital platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Last month, Dominguez said that “as more and more transactions move online, so must our revenue measures.” He said the government would be “focusing on efforts on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what other Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are doing.” While the quarantine boosted online sales, it stopped operations of tobacco and alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the early months of the pandemic due to a liquor ban and restricted deliveries of nonessential products. When the supply of tax-paid cigarettes dwindled, trade of fake and illicit sticks flourished. The Bureau of Customs reported that the Port of Subic confiscated on July 1 three 12-meter containers of smuggled cigarettes, which had been misdeclared as LED lights. The seized cargo contained about 3,100 master cases of cigarettes valued at P93.1 million. A combination of rising illicit trade and the lockdown restrictions on production had resulted in weak “sin” tax revenue to date. As of end-May, the combined take from tobacco and alcohol products fell 39 percent year-on-year to P63.1 billion. This was despite the higher levies slapped on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and alcoholic drinks under Republic Act No. 11346, or the tobacco tax law of 2019 signed by President Duterte last year, as well as RA 11467 signed in January.

Insurance Commissioner Dennis Funa said face-to-face selling of insurance products had been rendered “impractical” by the COVID-19 quarantine. Previously, only insurance products worth not more than P50,000 or single premium contracts not exceeding P150,000 were allowed to be sold through means other than face-to-face transactions.

Throughout the morning, a kilo of tilapias, a bagful of onions, garlic and ginger, and a powerbank were delivered to her doorstep. Still to arrive is an order of iced coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts.  “I try not to go out if I can help it. Good thing that now you can buy almost anything online,” she says With at least two million without jobs and over 83,000 businesses shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic, people here are trying to eke out a living selling anything they can online or knocking on doors from one house to another.  Pilots and flight attendants have hung up their snazzy uniforms and now driving around Manila to deliver dim sum. A popular rapper raps jingles on his Facebook and YouTube accounts to promote his fried chicken business. Those living in gated communities are setting up Facebook pages to connect buyers and sellers within the neighborhoods. Anything from rugs and air-conditioners, to a used McLaren sports car, is being traded.  Ms Jazzmin San Mateo, a senior high student, says her 40-year-old mother began selling noodles, spring rolls and fried bananas online after she was furloughed from her job as a payrolls officer in June. Her mother always had a knack for cooking, and had been supplementing her income with a makeshift food stand in front of their home, she adds. The single parent supports four school-going children. “My mother doesn’t know when she’ll be called back to work,” says Ms San Mateo. So for now, they are all relying on her mother’s cooked food sales to get them through the day. It’s a tough job that affords little time to rest, and everyone in the family has to pitch in to keep the money coming, she says. Ms San Mateo says she’s the social media marketer and helps her brother with the deliveries. “But I can see my mother’s happy, even with the modest profit, especially when she receives glowing feedback for her cooking and she sees us not going hungry,” she says.  Those who do not have the means to go online are bringing what they have to sell directly to their customers’ homes. Mr Albert Terejesas, 26, and his wife walk about 10 km a day to sell fish, shrimp and squid from one home to another. His mother used to have a vegetable stall in a public market. But when much of the country was shut down in March, people stopped coming. So, around April, he decided to go to the buyers instead. He and his wife would head to a fisherman’s wharf very early in the morning and fill two pails with seafood that they load onto a bicycle, and begin knocking on doors. He makes about P500 to P600 a day this way. “It’s a decent living,” he says. But it is a daily grind or they’d have no income. He constantly worries about getting sick. He has two children, aged one and four. For now, the demand is there. With some 27 million still under shelter-at-home restrictions and a still-raging coronavirus outbreak, seven out of 10 Filipinos living in the capital are buying most of the stuff they need online. Data released by the government showed a 6.6 percent growth in the communications and information sector. “What that data is telling us is that there is high demand for telco services due to a surge in demand for e-commerce,” Economic Planning Secretary Karl Chua says. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Grab Philippines public relations manager Arvi Lopez told The Straits Times that its food delivery business, GrabFood, had seen a fourfold increase in deliveries since the pandemic. Mr Roland Gonzales, 37, started delivering for GrabFood in June, after the printing company he was working at wound down as sales plummeted. He says he is still working his way up GrabFood’s accreditation ladder. He makes up to 600 pesos from four trips a day, enough to cover for the income he lost at his previous job. The more seasoned drivers make at least eight deliveries a day, he says. While there is a huge demand for online goods and services, the margins for most sellers are not very large, and many of them would rather go back to their old, regular-paying jobs. “It’s not a windfall,” says Ms San Mateo, whose mother makes about P400 a day selling food online. That is less than the P500  minimum wage in Metropolitan Manila. Her brother, who is in college, has had to skip school this year, and she is not sure if she will be able to purchase the laptop and phone she needs for online schooling. “I guess we just have to help each other out to get through this,” she says. The market for those hustling online is expected to be there as long as a virus-wary population continues to shun malls, public markets, department stores, groceries and restaurants. Mr Steven Tan, president of the country’s largest mall chain SM Supermalls, says he does not expect foot traffic to pick up till December. All its tenants had to shutter when a sweeping two-month lockdown was imposed in March. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Overall, while the online gig economy is providing a lifeline to those who have lost their jobs or had to shut down their businesses, it is in no way supplanting gainful employment or a fully operational business. Mr Jan Vincent C Robles, 32, sells 40 pieces of shawarma a day from home via GrabFood or Foodpanda, at about 100 pesos each. He is now thinking of renting a food stall along a busy road to augment his income if he can’t restart his audio and lighting business. He used to make much more renting out equipment for weddings and birthday parties. Mr Gonzales, the GrabFood rider, says although he earns slightly more now, he’d still rather go back to his old job. “The hours are fixed, and it’s still safer to be inside an office than being on the road riding a motorcycle all day, with the virus still out there,” he says.

Conducted by independent research firm Forrester Consulting, the study showed that 57 percent of Apac respondents ranked buying directly from SME online retailers as their least-preferred business type for cross-border shopping, ranking it below multi-brand online marketplaces, brand or manufacturer websites and bricks-and-mortar retailers.  Of the Apac respondents who expressed misgivings about buying direct from SME online retailers, 46 percent said their reluctance stemmed from the difficulty in verifying the seller’s reputation or trustworthiness-compared to a global average of just 21 percent who harbored this reservation. The study completed in September 2014 is based on the responses of 9,006 global online shoppers in 17 countries and regions, including Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea in Asia Pacific.  The results of the study complement other current data reflecting the e-commerce landscape in the Philippines, as growth in this sector has surged with 40.4 percent of Filipinos now accessing the Internet for their shopping needs. However, Filipino shoppers remain cautious when purchasing online, with 89 percent citing security concerns, 88.5 percent for speed of transactions, and 88.5 percent for payment methods.  In addition, there is still a preference for local websites. “In some respects, the study reveals a trust deficit among Apac consumers when it comes to buying goods from the websites of SME online retailers outside their home market,” said Dr. Karen Reddington, president, FedEx Express, Asia Pacific.  “They are more nervous than their counterparts in other regions about buying from retailers they may not be familiar with, or those based in distant markets.  Nevertheless, the study also reveals the considerable opportunity for SMEs in the online retail space, and suggests ways for them to win the trust that is so important to online shoppers in this region.” The study suggests that doubts about using SME online retailers’ websites haven’t dampened Apac consumers’ appetites for all cross-border online purchases. In fact, Apac consumers spend an average of almost $350 per year on such purchases, compared to a global average of $300. Consumers in certain Apac markets spend even more: 26 percent of mainland China respondents reported spending more than $1,000 per year, for example.  Through its exhaustive analysis of global trends in online shopping behavior when purchasing goods from overseas, the study arrived at five key recommendations for SME online retailers. These are: 1. SMEs should pay attention to their international traffic and business.  A large number of merchants surveyed reported that their international business had started unintentionally, through overseas customers finding them through web searches and online advertisements.  Monitoring this traffic can help to inform future business strategy. 2. SMEs should research how other merchants successfully market their goods. Explore what has made other SME sites successful including their logistics offerings and how the purchase process works. 3. SMEs should decide whether to go broad or narrow.  Whether to attempt to serve many markets or focus on a few key ones is likely to be dictated by whether the products on sale have broad appeal and logistics considerations that may make it easier to serve some markets than others.  SMEs that decide to focus on a small number of key markets may decide to invest more in services such as website translations, web advertising and broader payment offerings. 4. SMEs should focus on limited geographies at first.  This enables them to “test the water” with less risk.  Each country will have its specific requirements and complexities.  Being able to meet customer expectations in the initial markets helps to ensure success as SMEs expand their reach. 5. SMEs should identify the right resources.  The company’s international strategy and type of business will determine what the company needs from its selling and logistics resources-with particular emphasis on services and offerings that will matter to customers in the company’s target markets.  For example, companies that offer return services to their customers need logistics providers that can handle international returns smoothly and efficiently. “Access to overseas markets is no longer the preserve of large corporations – more and more SMEs are selling overseas,” said Dr. Reddington.  “Increasingly, promoting e-commerce is a way to promote the interests of SMEs, which are the driving force of many economies in the region. The study’s findings will help service providers like FedEx to tailor our service offerings so that they are an even better fit with what our SME customers need. In addition, national governments also have a role to play in ensuring a favorable environment for e-commerce to thrive. Ultimately, this benefits not only SMEs but consumers and national economies too.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/311398/significant-increase-in-consumer-complaints-vs-online-transactions-reported-in-2020","title":"‘Significant’ increase in consumer complaints on online transactions reported in 2020","date":"12:21 PM November 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — There has been a “significant” increase in the number of consumer complaints related to online transactions in 2020 compared to previous years, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported Monday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — There has been a “significant” increase in the number of consumer complaints related to online transactions in 2020 compared to previous years, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported Monday.

The IPOPHL said in a statement that it had proposed to revise the rules and regulations in the exercise of its enforcement functions and visitorial power. The agency is still gathering comments from stakeholders.  As they are now, the rules do not explicitly cover intellectual property rights-infringing activities that are conducted online. According to the IPOPHL, these rules had neither been amended nor even revisited since its approval and implementation in 2013. The latest proposed amendments were pushed by IPOPHL’s Enforcement Office (IEO) in an effort to give teeth when it comes to e-commerce.  Under the proposed new definition of IEO’s enforcement power, it would be able to enforce its mandate against the sale, streaming and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods online, among other activities. IEO Director Ann Edillon said this would allow the IEO to take down posts that sell counterfeit or pirated products through a warning notice and compliance order directed to the platform. To do this, an administrative complaint needs to be filed by the affected IP rights holder first.  When asked for further clarification, the IPOPHL said that the proposed rules did not discuss any liability that an online platform like Shopee and Lazada, for example, might have in case a merchant is caught selling counterfeit goods. “The way to go about it would depend on facts before the IEO. We may order the immediate blocking of a seller but we will not necessarily do that all the time. However, we will definitely always call the platform to immediately exercise its IP policy aside from possibly directing it to remove an infringing post,” Edillon said. “Where there is violation of, or resistance to, an IEO order issued in relation to an administrative complaint, IEO can file a case before the pertinent local government unit or the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) for the cancellation of the violating seller’s business permit. “ she added. Moreover, the proposed amendments also expanded the definition of an enforcement order to include the “permanent take down, blocking and removal of the infringing online sites or accounts.” IEO would also be able to issue a cease-and-desist directive and an order to remove the counterfeit and pirated good either from the online or physical establishment. If approved, the IPOPHL would able to issue orders that the National Telecommunications Commission would have to follow. At present, the NTC usually has to wait for an order to be issued by the court.

On Friday, Agriculture Secretary William Dar announced the inclusion of six new merchants and two logistics providers in the eKadiwa system, which in turn would bring new agricultural items to consumers at a faster pace.  One of the biggest setbacks of the government’s new e-commerce platform is poor logistics as consumers would often have to wait days or weeks before the delivery of their produce. This is expected to change following the participation of the country’s two most active two-wheel delivery operators in the country—Grab and Lalamove—in addition to eKadiwa’s primary partner, Mober.  “We believe that agriculture is the backbone of the Filipino community. To ensure that this backbone functions well, logistics play a critical role. We will be able to provide same-day logistics as we will incorporate eKadiwa under our own program, GrabMart,” Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said in a briefing. Both Grab and Lalamove will offer special rates to consumers availing themselves of the services via eKadiwa, while bike riders will also enjoy incentives.  This will also expand payment options available for eKadiwa to cash on delivery, bank transfer, credit card, ewallet and GrabPay. In addition, the agency has also included six new merchants in its online platform to complement other sellers like AgriNurture Inc., Zagana and Benjabi Seafoods. These include Farmfetch Inc., whose main products are vegetables; Farmshare Prime Dairy Products from Laguna; Livegreen International Inc., which is known for distributing organic vegetables to major supermarkets in Metro Manila; canned products and condiments manufacturer Ram Food Products Inc.; Ablayan Trading, which represents fruit and vegetable growers in Benguet, and Banwa Farms, known for its indigenous and heirloom products like adlay rice. Dar has assured the consuming public that the eKadiwa platform would carry on even with the lifting of lockdowns and added that the agency intended to expand its operations to other parts of the country once the system proved to be successful in Metro Manila. “If we can offer agricultural products at reasonable prices and in good quality, people will not go to wet markets anymore,” Dar said. “This is also one way of teaching our farmers to become real agripreneurs. We have to give them access to untapped markets.” According to the secretary, they have received 69 new applications from various agriculture players wanting to participate in the agency’s new digital marketing approach."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1378934/gatchalian-wants-probe-on-students-selling-lewd-photos-videos-online","title":"Gatchalian wants probe on students selling lewd photos, videos online","date":"07:08 PM January 03, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Sunday called on law enforcement agencies to ramp up efforts in probing reports that some students have been selling lewd photos and videos online to buy gadgets needed for distance learning.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Sunday called on law enforcement agencies to ramp up efforts in probing reports that some students have been selling lewd photos and videos online to buy gadgets needed for distance learning. “Nakakabahalang dahil sa mga suliraning dinudulot ng pandemya, ang ating mga kabataan ay nahaharap sa matinding panganib na maging biktima ng pang-aabuso at karahasan.

Dr. Rufino Suropia said the contamination could have been brought through processed meat sent through commercial couriers at the height of the community lockdown ordered to contain the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  He said Magpet residents, as in other areas in the country, had turned to ordering food and other supplies online when the entire country was placed under strict lockdown in April and May.Online sellers from the Davao region were sending their products through couriers with goods passing through quarantine checkpoints undetected, Suropia said. Blood samples taken from pigs in at least four remote barangays in Magpet town had turned positive for ASF infection, said Arlan Mangelen, regional director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in Soccsksargen (South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, General Santos) region.  Mangelen said ASF, a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease among domestic and wild pigs, had been detected in the villages of Ilian, Kiantog, Tagbac and Magca-alam in Magpet. “We are investigating these cases. We learned that processed food (chorizo or sausage) made its way to one of the villages,” Mangelen said.  Several pigs had died in the town in the past two days, forcing its owners to consult the municipal agriculture office. Hog raisers in the villages of Tagbac and Pangao-an also reported deaths among their domestic animals.Mangelen said the culling of pigs within a 1-kilometer radius from the site of infection started on Friday and would continue this week to prevent the disease from spreading and affecting hogs in nearby villages. Suropia said more than 100 pigs had been culled in the Magpet villages of Magcaalam and Ilian, and nearby sitios, considered the ground zero of the outbreak, on Monday. Gov. Nancy Catamco has ordered the provincial veterinary office to establish animal quarantine checkpoints in the affected villages to contain the disease.She also ordered Magpet officials to strictly observe health protocols, particularly prohibiting the movement of live pigs and processed meat within the 5-km radius from the affected areas. Suropia said Magpet would be placed on lockdown to stop the entry and exit of all hogs and meat products in the area. “We will compel the delivery trucks to open their vehicle for inspection to stop the entry of contaminated meat products,” he said.

Anyway, the annual income below P250,000 is exempted from the income tax according to the BIR ruling,” Lopez said during the online hearing of the House committee on ways and means.  “If one is just selling intermittently or on an irregular basis or selling homemade stuff as a hobby, it is understood they are not yet in business thus they are not required to register,” he added. The trade secretary however did not elaborate on the definition of an “irregular basis.”  Lopez, however, underscored the importance of registering businesses with the government, saying that it is key to consumer protection. “There is greater traceability if online sellers are registered and this increases the trust factor and confidence of online buyers in making the transaction online,” Lopez said.  “This addresses definitely the element of trust which is crucial if we are to grow the e-commerce industry in the country,” he added. Lopez likewise believes that registration of online businesses is good for the e-commerce industry if the country wants the sector to grow. He also noted that business registration will be beneficial for businesses in the future once their enterprise grows. “We believe that eventually, these unregistered businesses will register as they grow in size sooner or later, they would have to borrow from formal lending institutions that will require registered audited financial statements or if they get to serve larger establishments, official receipts for their sales will be required, thus they would have to be registered,” Lopez said. “DTI reiterates that business registration has always been the right way of doing business. It is needed in growing a business. It can also increase buyers’ confidence,” the trade secretary added.  Under BIR’s Memorandum Circular 60-2020, “all persons doing business and earning income in any manner or form, specifically those who are into digital transactions through the use of any electronic platforms and media, and other digital means” are reminded “to ensure that their businesses are registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 236 of the Tax Code, as amended, and that they are tax compliant.” Later, BIR clarified that the said memorandum was not targeted towards small-time online sellers, noting that it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1364241/student-keeps-up-with-online-classes-while-working-in-the-street","title":"Student keeps up with online classes while working in the street","date":"02:33 PM November 24, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The sight of students juggling work and school has become part of the new normal during the pandemic.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The sight of students juggling work and school has become part of the new normal during the pandemic. “Freedom,” a second year physics major from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), was recently seen attending his online classes while selling items along Evacom Road in Paranaque City.

Guballa said the BIR had asked the country’s online sellers to register to keep track of their number, but it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year.  Local subscription fees to Netflix, which is based abroad, include a value added tax which “the government wants to collect under the destination principle,” Guballa said at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday. The BIR also wants to tax merchants who sell their items via shopping sites like Lazada, he added.  “We are not really looking at those who were locked down and selling pansit online. We are looking at bigger businesses in online selling,” Guballa said. Outraged netizens and lawmakers had described as “ill-timed and insensitive” the BIR’s directive for online sellers to register, saying that people who had lost their jobs because of the lockdown had turned to online selling to earn a living. Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Jose Maria Concepcion meanwhile appealed to the government to delay its plan to tax online sellers until January next year, to allow them to make ends meet during the pandemic.  The BIR has given online sellers until July 31 to register their business, or face penalties.“We should allow these people to continue and then be stricter later on, maybe next year starting in January,” Concepcion said during the online conference “Flattening the Unemployment Curve,” where he raised the tax issue. Taxing online businesses is not new, as the requirement has been in place since 2013. However, the government’s decision to push for strict compliance amid strict lockdown protocols because of the pandemic has drawn criticisms from various sectors. In the Senate, Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday called on the BIR to withdraw and revise its order for online sellers to register with the bureau, since “it has caused confusion among online sellers,” she said in an online forum. Also in the forum were Bernie Bernal and Michael Adina who sell electronic gadgets and native delicacies online, respectively. The two said they were anxious when they heard about the BIR directive. —With reports from Roy Stephen C.

The buying habits not only of Filipinos, but practically also of everyone else across the globe, have been altered greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic. For Philippine companies and entrepreneurs wanting to see what lies ahead and how digitalization is shaping up, the findings of a regional survey conducted by the iPrice Group, a Kuala Lumpur-based company that operates a search website in seven countries across Southeast Asia and compares and catalogs more than 500 million products, should prove insightful. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, for its part, can use the data to draw up its program on how to effectively target online businesses that need to pay taxes.  The rise of internet selling is evident in the number of Filipinos who have opted for this path, peddling a variety of stuff from food to household items and cheap products sourced mainly from China. From June to September this year, the BIR said it registered 7,262 web-based businesses. Last Sept. 30 was the deadline set by the BIR for all online sellers to register their businesses for taxation purposes. The regional survey covered consumers in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. Dubbed “Map of E-Commerce” report, it showed the Philippines’ online economy fast catching up with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Forced to stay home during the survey period covering the second quarter of 2020 when the Duterte administration imposed the most stringent lockdown in the region, Filipinos, according to the survey, had the highest increase in the use of shopping apps, at 53 percent, in Southeast Asia. The Philippines also had the highest increase in spending, at 57 percent, among the countries covered.  Another interesting finding is that fashion retail sites appear to be falling out of favor among consumers. In the Philippines, fashion sites’ web traffic declined by 30 percent compared to last year’s level. Fashion online sites have taken the biggest hit regionwide as clothing and apparel become less of a priority while people stay home because of the pandemic. On the other hand, electronics sites (those selling mobile phones and audio and video gadgets) experienced a 59-percent jump in web traffic. An earlier study by the same group showed that the number of Filipinos searching for Wi-Fi adapters soared 518 percent, ostensibly as they prepare to spend more of their time online.  In the region, sports and outdoor products are the most ordered, growing by 34 percent during the second quarter. The survey also showed an upsurge in the total sessions in shopping apps in the Philippines, reaching 4.9 billion from April to June this year. It had been expected that online businesses in countries that underwent strict physical distancing measures would experience growth in mobile app usage, but the Philippines’ growth was particularly noteworthy as it indicated that the country was catching up with its regional peers. Before this, Filipino consumers were known to patronize brick-and-mortar stores as reflected in the big number of shopping malls in the country. However, digital adaptation was forced, and apparently sped up, by the strict lockdown measures imposed by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19. The only sad part in the findings is that multinational companies are gaining more web traffic while local companies lose out. In the Philippines, these foreign selling platforms cornered 97 percent of the market, leaving just 3 percent to homegrown sites. Vietnam and Indonesia are the only two countries in the survey where local companies have a bigger share in web traffic than the multinational companies they compete with for consumers. This can, however, be turned into an opportunity for homegrown Filipino talent to find creative ways to grab market share from the foreign websites. Local sellers just need to find more compelling ways, and offer more compelling products, to pique the interest of local consumers. The dreaded pandemic has inadvertently given the internet economy in the Philippines a big push. It is now up to the government to lay a safe groundwork for e-commerce, for telecommunication companies to provide fast, affordable, and reliable services, for online sellers to abide by the rules and regulations, and for consumers to exercise prudence and awareness in transacting online.

Regional Director Dr. Allan Poquita of BFAR-7 said a rising number of people were venturing into selling seafood online because the fisherfolk were having difficulty bringing their products to the market due to quarantine restrictions imposed in many areas. “We are happy that people are venturing into this enterprise to cater to the needs of people in their localities nowadays,” he said during the virtual talk show Mugstoria Ta by the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas. Provincial fishery officers in Central Visayas, who also joined the online talk show, shared the same observation, saying that many people have responded to the situation by selling their produce online or peddling them. Bohol Fishery Officer Candido Samijon said that there had been more than 1,000 people on the island, who have been reportedly peddling fish products to high-traffic areas like Tagbilaran City in recent months. “People selling seafood online is also increasing here,” said Samijon. Edgardo Delfin, BFAR Cebu head, said they have been encouraging people to explore the income opportunities in fish selling, especially at a time when many livelihood had been lost during the crisis. To supplement this growth in aquaculture, the BFAR-7 plans to increase fish production in the region through the provision of fingerlings and technical assistance to small-scale fisherfolk and fisherfolk organizations. This is also in response to the call of Agriculture Secretary William Dar to refocus the agency’s programs in order to respond immediately to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic to the fishery sector.

Online shopping has become popular due to its convenience, accessibility and speed. With the continued success of e-commerce, many now question the existence of traditional stores. Does online selling signify the death of actual shopping? Options in selling  Clothes, appliances, gadgets—these are only some of the items that sell well online. Can you imagine, however, buying a car completely online? Or purchasing an expensive piece of jewelry without seeing it first? According to the consumer psychologist Phillip Graves, people tend to feel safer buying products that are predictable and familiar online (Braff, 2014). When customers first try out a brand, many opt to visit retail stores. Shop employees help a lot in explaining items to them. This provides the assurance most people need before purchasing.   Luxury products also undergo deep scrutiny. The value of such items depends on their effects on the senses. In cases like these, buyers usually prefer experiencing the item first before confirming to buy.  In addition, older people are known to stick with the traditional mode of shopping. This is also the case when buyers are not comfortable with gadgets or prefer human interaction. Shopping, after all, is a social activity for many people. Considering these ideas, one can see that online and traditional shopping actually go hand-in-hand. The two are mere channels through which retailers communicate with people. Markets, products and situations determine which method suits a business best. Introducing the omnichannel So which platform should your business adopt? Should you base your choice on market analysis or budget limits? To save you the decision, why don’t you let clients choose? Marketing analysts now promote the idea of “omnichannel.” It is, simply put, a method of offering multiple buying options (Newman, 2014). By giving clients different ways of shopping—through the internet, in-store or even by phone—a company can offer a personalized experience.  A business with an omni-channel works like this: buyers can choose which media they wish to learn about a company’s products. They can also switch from one channel to another any time they wish. For example, someone buying shoes might visit a website first to choose his or her desired style. The buyer then might want to visit a retail outlet to try out the product. Finally, he or she considers the promos available online or in-store to determine where to make the purchase. It might seem complicated, but buyers always appreciate being informed. Offering multiple ways of getting the product means more support in establishing a brand. Designing a brand experience So considering both online and traditional selling, what makes a brand stick with users? Do beautiful shop interiors or eye-catching websites guarantee the success of the business? Reality tells us no. There have been many businesses that went bust despite heavy investments in shop and website design. The truth of the matter is that a business has to consider client experience before, during and after shopping. Whether using mobile apps, websites, retail outlets or a combination of these to sell, the business must be consistent. As the goal is to attract customers and keep them coming, the brand must be developed enough to tell a story. Using any platform, a business should clearly show its core values and unique features. People should be able to easily understand what the brand is about, what it upholds, and what it promises to deliver. This will then become their basis in trying out a brand and sticking with it. Thus, the success of attracting customers doesn’t really rely on which platform is used to sell. More often than not, it depends on the experience being offered by the brand. (Sources: Braff, D.

Lockdowns have increased online consumer activity, similar to the SARS episode in 2003, which was a turning point for China’s e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com,” Maybank Kim Eng analysts Lee Ju Ye and Chua Hak Bin said in an April 20 report titled “Consumer Behavior During a Pandemic.”  Citing Google’s COVID-19 community mobility reports, usage of retail and recreation facilities such as restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas plunged 82 percent in the Philippines from Feb. 29 to April 11, compared to the baseline period covering Jan. 3 to Feb. 6. Also, Filipinos frequented groceries and pharmacies less often, as mobility dropped to 60 percent during the same period.  Mobility to workplaces declined 67 percent; via transit stations and public transport hubs such as bus and train stations, down 86 percent; and in parks and beaches, 59 percent. “Based on data compiled by Google’s COVID-19 community mobile reports, the Philippines and Malaysia—among the first countries to impose lockdowns—are showing the steepest declines in people movements,” Maybank said.  Maybank noted that food delivery services had a low penetration rate in Asean—for instance, only 5.5 percent in the Philippines last year, but “with the ban on dine-in services, more food merchants are signing up with delivery platforms such as GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.” The Philippine government had allowed these food delivery services to continue amid the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon and other parts of the country, which started in mid-March and would end by April 30. The newfound habit of ordering food online or through mobile apps was expected to spill over to a wider array of goods and services offered on the internet, Maybank said. “Asean’s e-commerce penetration is relatively low, but will likely rise significantly due to COVID-19.

This is well below the 30-percent rate in South Korea and China, and 13 percent in the US,” it said. On the flip side, Maybank said that “the ‘sharing economy’ tech players, after enjoying several years of generous venture capital funding, will be the worst hit.”  “Bookings on Airbnb have plunged by over 90 percent in some markets, and online searches for ‘Airbnb,’ ‘Booking.com’ and ‘AirAsia’ have fallen to record lows across Asean. Co-working space is another major casualty, as tenants halt payments and break leases. Ride hailing platforms face a plunge in ridership, but drivers are shifting to other types of work such as food delivery and logistics. Grab and Gojek are burning cash to provide financial support to drivers in order to maintain their fleet for the ensuing recovery,” it noted. On a lighter note, while most Filipinos stayed at home during the ongoing lockdown, consumers mostly searched for food and entertainment as well as details of the government’s social amelioration program on Google. From March 18 to April 16, the top Google searches in the Philippines included “Dalgona coffee,” “SAC (social amelioration card) form,” “Dalgona Milo,” “Netflix mobile plan,” “Vindale research” (paid surveys at home), “grocery store,” “Goldilocks Bakeshop,” “Minecraft,” and “recipe,” Maybank noted. Searches for “masks” and “thermometers” also climbed across Asean since the pandemic started during the last week of January.

Samonte shared with fans her new business via Instagram on Sept. 10, proudly accepting the title her husband gave her, which is the “D&D Queen of The South,” with D&D meaning “danggit and dilis.”  “Yes we sell dried fishes na din. You know why? Nung nakatikim ako nito super sarap y? Actually matagal [na ‘ko] bumibili nyan and lagi kami [meron] dito sa house kasi [favorite] din ni [Heather] ang danggit and dilis,” she said. (Yes, we also sell dried fish now. You know why? Because when I tasted this, it was super delectable. Actually, I have been buying dried fish for a long time now and we always have it in our house because danggit and dilis are Heather’s favorites.)  The actress said that she gets the dried fish fresh from Masbate, noting that they are all unsalted. Samonte sells danggit, sweet pusit, palad flakes, big dilis boneless and small dilis, among others. “Hindi ako nahihiya na magbenta ng ganito kasi sa panahon ngyn kelngn natin maging madiskarte and hindi nakakahiya kasi masarap [talaga],” she emphasized.  (I am not ashamed to sell them because during these times, we need to be resourceful and not be ashamed, because these are really delicious.) Following the positive feedback and support she got from the public, Samonte has since created an Instagram account for her dried fish business, which she aptly named “D&D Queen of The South” and shared the news yesterday, Sept. 11. Samonte, who was a StarStruck Avenger on the Kapuso show’s first season, is one of several celebrities who have ventured into online selling. For one, veteran rapper Gloc-9 last July likewise noted that there is nothing to be ashamed of as online selling is honest work after he got told that it did not suit him.  /ra RELATED STORIES: Gloc-9 on being told online selling doesn’t suit him: ‘Walang dapat ikahiya kung ang trabaho marangal’ Aiko Melendez denounces move to tax online sellers"},{"url":"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/382601/gloc-9-on-being-told-online-selling-doesnt-suit-him-walang-dapat-ikahiya-kung-ang-trabaho-marangal","title":"Gloc-9 on being told online selling doesn’t suit him: ‘Walang dapat ikahiya kung ang trabaho marangal’","date":"11:13 AM July 10, 2020","snippet":"As Pinoy rap icon Gloc-9 (real name: Aristotle Pollisco) is not exempted from the consequences of the pandemic-induced lockdown, he has resorted to doing what many others have turned to: online selling.","body":"As Pinoy rap icon Gloc-9 (real name: Aristotle Pollisco) is not exempted from the consequences of the pandemic-induced lockdown, he has resorted to doing what many others have turned to: online selling. The rapper’s new venture, however, seemed to be not to one fan’s liking, Gloc-9 revealed in a Facebook post yesterday, July 9.  “May [nagtanong] sakin ‘idol bakit ka nag bebenta ng kung ano ano? Hindi bagay sayo (Idol, why are you selling all this stuff? It does not suit you),'” Gloc-9 said. “Sabi ko sa kanya. Tol wala namang masama siguro doon diba?

And do you know that before I became a rapper, I used to clean trashcans, toilets and canals?)   After noting what he went through before finding success as one of the country’s biggest rappers, Gloc-9 emphasized how online selling, as well as his former jobs, are things people should not be ashamed of. “Tandaan nyo mga Kababayan iba na ang panahon natin ngayon kailangan nating lumaban para mabuhay para sa mga Mahal natin,” he said. (Remember my countrymen, times are different now, so we have to fight to stay alive for our loved ones.)  “Wala kang dapat ikahiya kung ang trabaho mo ay marangal at wala kang tinatapakang kapwa mo. Kaya natin ito! APIR!!!” the rapper added. (You should not be ashamed if your job is honorable and if you do not step on someone else in the process. We can do this. High five!) Other than keeping his fans updated on his life, Gloc-9 has also been using Instagram to offer his goods, which range from his official merchandise such as “Makata” jerseys to food including fried chicken and dinuguan. Despite dabbling in business, Gloc-9 has not taken a break from making music. Just this week, the rapper released his new song titled “Ahon” with singer Bugoy Drilon. Gloc-9 likens life to a bicycle ride in the new single, urging others to continue riding even through steep paths, and to pick themselves up whenever they fall. The veteran rapper has also offered an online writing and composition workshop, of which the first session will be held this coming Sunday, July 12.  /ra RELATED STORIES: LISTEN: Gloc-9, Bugoy Drilon release new song ‘Ahon’ FlipTop Festival 2020: Anygma hails Gloc-9 for inspiring Pinoy hip-hop artists For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Angara noted that many MSMEs including those from indigenous communities are having a difficult time selling their products due to restrictions on travel and traditional markets.  “In order to continue operating and generating revenues during the community quarantines, entrepreneurs have started shifting to online markets. This is currently where all the action is so if the businesses that were shuttered for the past three months are thinking of resuming operations immediately, online is the way to go,” he said in a statement. He cited the case of community weavers from Batangas who currently do not have buyers of their products because of travel restrictions.  He said the weavers are now reportedly considering shifting to selling fish and vegetables once they are able to sell their remaining inventory. “It would be a shame to lose our cultural heritage due to this pandemic. These are traditions that are worth preserving and I’m certain there will be a strong demand for these products once access to them is made available,” said the senator.  Considering that shifting to online platforms might be more difficult for other MSME owners, Angara said the DTI should also explore ways to get the products of communities in far flung areas, the IPs and anyone who relies on traditional methods of selling, to market whether it is online or not. He also urged the Department of Agriculture and the DTI to step up efforts to make the products of farmers and fisherfolk available online. According to Angara, the DTI should continue building partnerships with e-commerce platforms to make “Go Lokal!” products available for orders and delivery. “This is as good a time as any to introduce these groups and other MSMEs to selling their products online. They should take advantage of this opportunity to tap this market that continues to grow especially now when most Filipinos would rather stay at home than go out,” he said. Angara then urged online shoppers to support small businesses, as well as local industries by buying locally-made products.  “Everyone needs help during this pandemic and by supporting our local businesses, you also help in saving jobs and reviving the economy,” he said.

Gatchalian, who previously served as chairperson of the House committee on trade and industry, said that while online shopping sites such as Lazada have clearly classified Ivermectin as a veterinary drug, some individuals may take advantage of the drug’s easy access especially with recent claims that Ivermectin can help treat COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2.  The Food and Drug Administration, however, has yet to approve the anti-parasitic drug for human use, Gatchalian stressed. “Please be on the lookout for abusive online sellers who are taking advantage of the current situation and even manipulating the price of Ivermectin. I just want to remind the public that this drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use and may be highly harmful to the health of our consumers,” Gatchalian said in a statement.  “People should never take animal drugs, as the FDA has only evaluated their safety and effectiveness in the particular species for which they are labeled. Using these products in humans could cause serious harm,” he added. Gatchalian said e-commerce sites should tighten their monitoring especially on medicines and other drugs, particularly on their price and function.  He said e-commerce sites should exercise due diligence with regards to their merchants and not pass off the responsibility to law enforcement agencies to run after people who are behind these online illegal activities. “For one, the prices of these should never exceed the suggested retail price. Second, they should ban sellers who market drugs to be utilized for other than their recommended function,” Gatchalian said. The lawmaker likewise advised the public that while the FDA has yet to issue a compassionate special permit for Ivermectin to be used as a treatment for COVID-19, consumers should stick to the approved use of the drug for animals. “Let us all be vigilant, help monitor and report to authorities online marketplaces for fraudulent covid-19 drugs, or those that sell unapproved products and make false or misleading claims, to protect the health and safety of our consumers,” Gatchalian said. The use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 has recently sparked debate in the Philippine medical community.  Some have vouched on its efficacy to address the disease and said the government should make it available to COVID-19 patients. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said prescribing Ivermectin without statistically significant evidence of its efficacy against COVID-19 is “harmful” since it would give “false confidence” to the public.

An official of the DOF on Friday said the government wanted these businesses to be registered so that they would be included in the formal economy before they are compelled to pay the right taxes.  The BIR is one of the revenue-generating agencies under the DOF. Its June 1 Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 60-2020 setting a July 31 deadline for all online sellers to register and pay their taxes triggered protests from small internet entrepreneurs and several lawmakers who said the agency was burdening rather than helping people who were trying to cope with the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.  But Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said “the goal of this project is not to go after online merchants for unreported sales or unpaid taxes.” “We just want to encourage those who are engaged in online businesses to register with the BIR,” Tionko, head of the DOF’s revenue operations group, said on Friday.  “Online transactions have increased for quite some time now, especially during the community quarantine period. That’s why we want to take this opportunity to remind them to register their businesses,” Tionko said. She did not say whether the tax payments would be postponed. Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner Arnel Guballa on Thursday said both individual and corporate taxpayers who sell goods online needed to register and settle their tax obligations. Officials defended the BIR’s move as a means to raise more revenue to fund efforts to contain the pandemic. Several senators, however, said that instead of cracking the whip against these small businessmen, the BIR should focus on large tax evaders, particularly Philippine offshore gaming operators, who owe the government tens of billions of pesos in taxes.  The DOF explained that the BIR order also is part of the government’s efforts to establish a tax collection for digital transactions. Last month, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the DOF was studying a bill that had been filed by Albay Rep. Joey Salceda to impose taxes on video and music streaming, online shopping sites, as well as advertisements on social media. Dominguez said the DOF was “very carefully” looking into parts of the “digital economy” that should be taxed. He said Salceda’s bill was aimed at ways to include digital purchases into the value-added tax (VAT) base and how profits made by digital companies could be absorbed into the corporate tax system. “We are studying how best these goals can be achieved, considering the transnational nature of most of these transactions,” Dominguez said. He said the bill would not create new taxes or increase current tax rates as Salceda only wanted to expand the revenue base. “Ultimately, having a clear and efficient tax regime for the digital economy will be critical, as more and more taxable transactions shift from traditional means of doing business to more virtual avenues, a trend accelerated by COVID-19,” Dominguez said in May. “Taxation in the digital economy is being seriously considered not just in the Philippines but in other countries as well,” he said. He cited Indonesia, which is taking steps to bring the digital economy into its tax base, and Singapore and Malaysia, which had already covered some digital services in their sales tax bases. Dominguez noted that the United States had protested against these new digital taxes, saying they were meant to target its homegrown tech giants. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); He said some countries had started to impose digital service taxes even before they could agree on how to “reallocate income taxation rights on cross-border digital transactions.” “Once an international agreement is reached, we will immediately study and propose tax reforms to capture income tax on cross-border digital transactions,” he said. The Philippines for the moment is focusing on collecting VAT on both local and cross-border digital transactions, similar to what is being done by its partners nation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to Dominguez. The DOF and the BIR are crafting regulations and designing a system to effectively collect VAT on digital transactions, he said. Online businesses were targeted for taxation as early as 2013 when then BIR Commissioner Kim Henares issued RMC 55-2013 requiring registration and tax payments from “online business transactions, including online retailing through virtual shopping malls, online marketplaces, webstores and similar websites” or “online stores.” These online stores included business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, and business-to-business transactions. As such, online shopping or retailing, intermediary services, advertisements and classified ads, as well as auctions were taxable, according to the BIR. Henares said that like other business establishments, persons who conduct online transactions and their “permutations” were obligated to register, secure authority to print invoices or receipts and register books of accounts. These businesses should also withhold the required taxes, including on their employees’ compensation, file tax returns and submit other tax compliance reports. The BIR warned that those engaged in internet commerce who failed to comply with tax laws, rules and regulations would be penalized under existing laws, including the Tax Code. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As the economy faltered, the BIR’s tax take from January to April dropped 20.5 percent year-on-year to P559.3 billion. Collections slid 61.6 percent to P90.5 billion just for the month of April. Historically, the BIR’s collection surges in April, as filing and tax payments are mandated by the Tax Code to be done by April 15. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BIR moved the deadline for submitting income tax returns three times before finally settling on June 14, as the government prolonged the quarantine which was imposed in mid-March."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1254255/online-seller-of-overpriced-alcohol-nabbed-in-cabanatuan-city","title":"Online seller of overpriced alcohol nabbed in Cabanatuan City","date":"07:29 PM April 05, 2020","snippet":"CABANATUAN CITY–Agents of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have arrested a man here for allegedly selling overpriced isopropyl alcohol online.","body":"CABANATUAN CITY–Agents of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have arrested a man here for allegedly selling overpriced isopropyl alcohol online.

A business offering graphic designs recently posted on its Facebook page a stern warning versus a purported modus of an alleged scammer wherein a counterfeit deposit slip from Banco de Oro (BDO) was used to trick them into believing that a client has a paid transaction with them.  According to the online trader, a woman supposedly from Cavite sent them a photo of a BDO deposit slip showing her supposed payment. However, a check with BDO revealed that no such transaction ever occurred and that the deposit slip was fake. The Facebook page manager explained in a message to INQUIRER.net the story behind their post.  “Actually, that was a payment made by my friend because I lent her some money,” the female page manager, who refused to be identified, said in Filipino. “The person who made the fake deposit slip was a reseller of her clothing products, whom she met at an online sellers group.” “So, she instead asked the buyer to direct the payment to my account. But when I checked it, no amount reflected on my online account then I had the deposit slip verified, which eventually turned out fake,” she added.   INQUIRER.net contacted BDO Unibank for clarifications and to confirm whether the deposit slip was fake — considering that it looked authentic — but they have yet to reply as of posting time. Due to the lockdowns and travel restrictions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses opted to go online in a bid to continue their operations while avoiding direct contact with clients in consideration of the government-imposed health protocols. The majority of online transactions depend on bank transfers and other digital modes of payments.  However, entrepreneurs’ reliance on the internet also exposes them to cyber attacks. Banks have even cautioned clients and the general public against tricksters who are only after stealing money from unwitting individuals despite the pandemic.

And while there are online channels that offer life insurance, these are still in the earlier stage of maturity compared to the long-established agency channel,” Sun Life Philippines chief executive and country head Benedict Sison told the Inquirer recently.  “But with the ECQ, face-to-face selling through licensed advisors had to stop for about four weeks. During this time, we saw sales of our online insurance products on Lazada increase significantly as this became a very convenient alternative to avail of our products. This is also because of the heightened feeling of anxiety among consumers, which led them to appreciate and be more proactive in availing of life insurance for the security it provides,” said Sison, who is also president of the industry group Philippine Life Insurance Association Inc. Last week, Insurance Commissioner Dennis Funa allowed life insurance companies to sell through nontraditional channels “during the ECQ period or any extension thereof, or until June 30, 2020, whichever comes later,” as the Insurance Commission (IC) had acknowledged that “face-to-face” transactions would be “impractical” during the lockdown given physical and social distancing restrictions.  In the case of Pru Life UK, senior vice president and chief customer marketing officer Allan Tumbaga told reporters via Zoom last Friday that “we saw more interest—traffic as well as transactions—digitally.” “We saw that the demand for pure digital [products] increased, in terms of views on our website and transactions. At the same time, there is a queue from our agents because their customers are asking them to be more digital—that’s what we’re working on,” Tumbaga said.  Tumbaga noted that over 90 percent of Pru Life’s agents were currently working from home due to the lockdown. As for Sun Life, Sison said that “the numbers from our online channels still do not match the numbers that we used to generate from our advisors.” “This is because products available online are limited to those with a certain maximum coverage and when it comes to buying life insurance, there is still a preference among many to have face-to-face contact. Thankfully, the IC recently allowed our advisors to conduct virtual face-to-face selling. We are happy with this devolvement because this now allows us to offer a wider range of insurance solutions to Filipinos at this time when they need it the most,” Sison said. “With our advisors now able to sell virtually, sales have been steadily picking up and I am confident we will see sales back to pre-ECQ levels in the next couple of months because insurance is really a very beneficial product to have at this time,” Sison added.

But even as new platforms have emerged, direct selling remains at the core of Avon, enabling five million women around the world to become entrepreneurs.  Random knocking on people’s doors, like how the Avon lady met Edward Scissorhands two decades ago, may be a thing of the past, but relationship-building is both an art and a science that has withstood the test of time. Admittedly, the COVID-19 pandemic made it more challenging for the company in the beginning of this global crisis to foster relationships as people could not meet face to face, says Avon global CEO Angela Cretu, noting that the group had to first protect its people and rely just on online selling platforms.  The portfolio mix also had to be adjusted overnight to meet demand for essential goods and toiletries, like antibacterial gel. As people were locked down and dealt with economic distress, nondiscretionary goods across the globe took a hit. But it is also during dire times that relationship plays a major role, Cretu says.  In a Zoom interview with Inquirer from her office in London, she says Avon’s beauty representatives still found ways to stay connected. In the last month or so, Cretu proudly notes that Avon’s portfolio mix has almost returned to pre-COVID-19 norms, with clients now willing to spend more on beauty, fragrance and intimate apparel products. This shows that in good times or bad, “there’s need for women to make sure that they feel confident in their own skin and use the beauty products that they have always used,” she says. Lipstick and foundation products that stay on even if women had to wear masks, for instance, are selling well during this pandemic. “People started to use their social media. People found new ways to deliver their product to the door without bypassing the barriers. This is a clear commitment from our beauty representatives to continue serving their customers, even if they had to learn new ways [to do so], especially through the internet,” she says. Now that the pandemic has bludgeoned many industries and resulted in massive job losses, Avon has seen a surge in its network of beauty representatives in the last quarter. Beyond just embracing this as their bread and butter, there has been a shift in how people see their affiliation with Avon.  “What we’ve seen is people want to be part of the purpose that we share together, really create a tangible change in women empowerment, in creating access to democratize access to beauty and learning opportunity, as well as we’ve taken our role to offer a tangible support to the communities we are part of,” Cretu says. Unlike other direct sellers, Cretu explains that Avon’s business model differs in such as way that much of its earnings are channeled to causes relevant to women, from breast cancer awareness to campaigning to stop domestic violence against women, which has escalated especially during this pandemic. Cretu herself issued an open letter to all governments early this year, calling for a “safe exit” for battered women during the lockdown. The company has helped fund a program to provide shelter, education and counselling for women victimized by domestic violence. Globally, Avon is also a major contributor in the crusade against breast cancer, having collected and donated $1.1 billion so far to causes that support women and their families to lead safe and healthy lives. “I think this COVID crisis is really opening new expectations. They (consumers) are not expecting just the best price for the best product or the best promotion. They also want a personalized high-touch relationship with the brand and are also [considering whether] that brand is sharing profits with the community,” she says. In the Philippines, Avon’s crown jewel in Asia, a significant portion of women in Avon’s sales force are there full time, although there are those who also sell as a hobby. A hybrid model that combines physical and digital channels, not just in selling but also in accessing training programs, is in place. “Going forward, we are going for an omnichannel presence: one that will be at the choice of customer and choice of the representative, so they can work either in hybrid mode or digital with physical presence,” she says. The task is to nurture authentic relationships, she adds. “We want to celebrate all women. Not the catwalk women. Not the posh filtered profiles. Not the mega-influencers. We want to celebrate everyone who takes up the role to be a microinfluencer in her own community and is really changing the social norms for more equality.” As heightened concern for hygiene during this pandemic has eliminated the possibility of putting out there samples, like for makeup, Avon instead offers a 100-percent guarantee. “Usually, over-the-counter players, if you took my lipstick, you bought it, went back home and tried it on and realized after one week that that color is not suiting you well or maybe is not as nourishing or hydrating as you want it, you can’t return it,” Cretu says. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “In Avon, we keep up the promise that it’s 100-percent guaranteed, which means, you didn’t like it the quality, we will give your money back. That’s also showing the confidence we have on our products and as well as our respect for consumers. This is part of our mission to create affordable access, while still promising outstanding quality and guaranteeing for that.” Cretu notes that the brand has also continuously invested in research and development (R&D) to meet the demands of the times. Whether it’s lipstick that will stay even with the face mask on, or proprietary antiaging facial products that dramatically restore collagen, Avon has strived to adjust its innovations to the global trend of consumers seeking the convergence of beauty, health and wellness products. “And consumers are saying don’t treat me like a segment any longer. I want a personalized relationship,” she says. Secondly, consumers now detest brands that act like an autocratic beauty player. They don’t want brands telling them what beautiful is. They want to celebrate their own beauty. They want to be themselves. “And with these new trends, we really try to reposition ourselves even at 135 years of beauty that truly celebrates this overcoming of barriers and social norms and beauty standards, and economical hurdles that all women feel,even more so now in the pandemic,” Cretu says. “They feel the pressure of motherhood, economical hurdles, unemployment, the need to keep their families, as much as possible protect them from this mayhem, the crisis and the uncertainty and anxiety. So we try to play that role and we thought, as a company, we should get away from being just a beauty range choice and play a more active role and support the community, support women overcoming these barriers and redefine expectations,” she says. Democratizing access to beauty means Avon is not favoring any specific market segment, instead trying to make sure it caters to anyone from a 15-year-old teenager learning about personal grooming to 64-year-olds or members of the “silver” generation who also have their own needs. “From a product perspective, we no longer believe in the kind of luxurious inaccessible brands that we know their ingredients and formulas are basic, but through positioning they create access only for the selective few,” she says. And while Avon has been focused on women over the century, it understands that men are also part of the family and now has a growing portfolio of products dedicated to men’s grooming. These days, Avon is competing not just with a number of legacy western brands but a number of rising beauty brands in Asia as well, especially those produced in high per capita-country Asian countries like South Korea and Japan where makeup is essential. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Part of Avon’s strategy is thus to bring in some locally manufactured goods to its portfolio. In the Philippines, the majority of its beauty products, as well as those in intimate apparel, are locally manufactured, Cretu says. It spends on R&D to come up with formulations relevant to the local market. As such, she notes that the brand has been a leading player in makeup, fragrance and lotions in Philippines. The company currently operates an R&D hub in Shanghai that is developing specific brands catering to consumer needs for Asia, not just in terms of formulation and local ingredients, but also in packaging. With over 200 patents worldwide, Avon is at the same time bringing global innovations to the local pipeline. In October, it is set to launch Protinol, a unique formula for antiaging that pitches to restore seven years of collagen in just seven days. “That’s an example of global innovation that will follow the latest discoveries in the antiaging research and being deployed in the market at an accessible and affordable price,” she says. Since entering the Philippine market 42 years ago, this market has proven to be fertile ground for Avon, possibly due to strong historical and cultural ties with the United States, but also because of how family values and how people connect to one another are evident in this nation. “The way people develop trust, it’s really very nurturing for our commercial model,” she says."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/297714/online-seller-nabbed-for-selling-overpriced-alcohol","title":"Online seller nabbed for selling overpriced alcohol","date":"March 27,2020 - 10:58 PM","snippet":"","body":"LAPU-LAPU CITY, Philippines — A 31-year-old female online seller was arrested for selling overpriced bottles of alcohol during an entrapment operation in Lapu-Lapu City at 4 p.m. of March 27, 2020.

Some of our dealers do that too… the important thing is to check if the product being sold is licensed or not,”Joven Ong, president of the Firecrackers Association of the Philippines, said in an interview.  Ong said dealers have partnered with online shopping stores for the distribution of their products. Lea Alapide, president of Philippine Pyrotechnic Manufacturers and Dealers Association Inc. (PPMDAI), said that pyrotechnic devices have been available online since last year, adding that dealers have turned to online shopping platforms to boost sales.  Alapide said online purchases also gave buyers the comfort of getting products delivered at their doorsteps, saving them the time to travel to this town. Known as the fireworks capital of the country, Bocaue is home to more than 70 stores and dealers licensed to distribute or sell pyrotechnic products.  “Online selling is the trend now. If everything can be purchased from online shops, why can’t we offer our products in these platforms?”Alapide said. Some pyrotechnic devices that can be bought online are “luces” (sparklers), such as roman candles and fountains, which cost between P30 and P150 per box. Also offered online are aerial fireworks sold between P250 to P1,500 per box. The Philippine National Police says it allows online selling of pyrotechnics, as this does not violate Republic Act No. 7183 or the fireworks law. Lt. Col. Lorenzo Kim Cobre, acting chief of the PNP’s Explosive Management Division of the Firearms and Explosives Office, said online companies were allowed to transport a maximum of 1 ton of pyrotechnic products. But fireworks manufacturers cautioned against online shopping for “bangers”or firecrackers such as “kuwitis,” “five star” and “sawa,”as well as unlicensed products that may explode when mishandled.  In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order No. 28 limiting the use of firecrackers to fireworks displays, citing as basis the prevalence of firecracker-related injuries every year.

The public is confused and registration is not a joke since it costs P2,260 which may be expensive for small online sellers.) So long as the revenue policies that are “clear, comprehensive and un-oppressive,” Hontiveros said online sellers are willing to comply.  She also reiterated that it should be “responsive to the difficulties faced by many Filipinos during this pandemic,” considering that some ventured into online selling after their livelihoods were affected. With the current number of unemployment, Hontiveros said the government should give protection to Filipinos who are trying to provide for their families via online selling. “There is insufficient official data vis-à-vis the informal online economy to guide policy, thus making it imperative that the relevant government agencies provide an update on the situation for Congress,” Hontiveros said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1088959/2-women-nabbed-for-selling-stolen-motorcycle-parts-online","title":"2 women nabbed for selling stolen motorcycle parts online","date":"06:27 PM February 22, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Two women allegedly selling stolen motorcycle parts online were arrested in an entrapment operation launched by the Quezon City police on Thursday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Two women allegedly selling stolen motorcycle parts online were arrested in an entrapment operation launched by the Quezon City police on Thursday. Police said the operation stemmed from the complaint of call center agent Kient Dave Faustino, who said that his Yamaha Mio parked along Quezon Avenue corner Kitanlad Street in Barangay Doña Josefa in Quezon City was stolen on Thursday.  On the same day, Faustino’s colleague at work told him that motorcycle spare parts were being sold in a social media page. He later found out that a pair of shock absorbers from his vehicle was among those being offered online. Faustino posed as a buyer of the spare parts and coordinated with the police, who set up the entrapment operation at a shopping mall in Manila on Thursday.  Police seized from suspects, identified as Kristine and Camille Buluran, the shock absorbers from Faustino’s vehicle and a pair of foot pegs. The suspects will face charges for violation of the Republic Act 10883 or the Anti-Carnapping Law.  Chief Supt. Joselito Esquivel Jr. reminded the public to be vigilant in buying spare parts of vehicles sold online. “Pinapaalalahanan natin ang ating mga kababayan na mag-ingat at maging aware sa mga bagong modus ng sindikato sa panahon ngayon, dahil pati ang social media ay ginagamit na nila bilang instrumento upang magbenta ng mga nakaw na parte ng sasakyan,” he said on Friday.

Ferolino told lawmakers that the shift in drug transactions from face-to-face to digital means “is a huge challenge to PDEA and other law enforcement agencies.” “We all know that drug syndicates would always do anything to succeed in their illegal drug activities and under the new normal,” she said.  Ferolino said even before the pandemic, arrests had been made already of drug traders “who facilitated drug transactions through online platforms or e-commerce platforms.” The PDEA, she said, had conducted buy-bust operations that led to the arrests. The suspects posted drug paraphernalia on an e-commerce platform, which prompted the PDEA to conduct buy-bust missions, she said. She added that the PDEA had conducted three such missions.  Ferolino said online shopping platform Lazada had also turned over to them 3.6 kilos of marijuana. “They also use TNVS to transport their illegal drug activities. We have arrested two drug personalities who use a transport service to deliver their packages,” she said. Rep. Wes Gatchalian (Valenzuela City), chair of the House committee on trade and industry, said online platforms should “exercise due diligence with regards to its merchants.” These online traders, he said, should “not pass off the responsibility to law enforcement agencies to run after people who are behind these online illegal activities.” Gatchalian said the PDEA confiscated last Sept. 18 these illegal items from online platforms—P12,000 in marijuana, 12 ecstasy tablets worth P40,000, a capsule of “Fly High” party drug worth P2,500 and 11 bottles of liquid ecstasy worth P426,000. Citing information from arrested suspects obtained by the PDEA, Gatchalian said some drug paraphernalia, like water pipes and glass tooters, had been brought from the country’s two leading online shopping sites.  He said the PDEA had already requested the administrators of these shopping sites to take down all listings of drug paraphernalia. At the hearing, Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said the department had received a total of 14,869 complaints involving online transactions from Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2020. Castelo said this was way higher than the 2,457 complaints that the DTI received in 2019. The official said the complaints were related to violations of the Price Act, like overpricing, profiteering, or lack of price tag. “Many people are being defrauded by false and deceiving advertisements, poor product quality and unconscionable sales acts and practices,” said Gatchalian in reaction to the DTI data. “What is surprising is that a majority of these complaints came out of sales facilitated through these major platforms,” Gatchalian said. He said, “this is happening precisely because there are currently no regulations that will compel these platforms to ensure the safety of our consumers.” “Right now, many platforms are self-regulating, but the problem is that when these self-regulations fail, the consumers have nowhere to turn to,” he said. “Many are oftentimes left hanging, or are put through such a long process that many of them just choose to abandon their claims,” he added. The lawmaker renewed his call for the immediate passage of his House Bill No. 6122, which seeks to regulate the internet economy. Under the bill, the platforms will be held liable for vendors’ wrongdoing on their platforms if no measure had been taken to prevent the sale of illegal products. The measure has been approved by the House panel and is set to be passed on second reading."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/628509/can-you-sell-wild-animals-online-no-way-says-denr","title":"Can you sell wild animals online?

Paje issued the warning following the arrest early this month of a man who has offered to sell online a juvenile serpent eagle. The suspect, Cardell Mariano, claimed he is an employee of the DENR and that he has a permit to sell.  But Paje said the DENR does not issue a permit for the sale of a serpent eagle, considered an endangered species because of its dwindling population that has resulted from the destruction of its habitat. The Philippine serpent eagle (spilornis holospilus) is usually found in forest clearings and open woodlands of Luzon and Mindanao. It is distinguished from other species of serpent eagles by distinct spots on its underparts and wings.  In a statement, Paje said, “Those who engage in illegal trade of wildlife, especially those threatened or endangered, could face charges punishable by imprisonment or fine. This applies to everyone, even DENR employees, more so because we are a regulatory agency that oversees the implementation of the country’s wildlife law.” He stressed that the agency would not condone any illegal wildlife activity and would take strong action against unscrupulous traders.  Agents of the Philippine Operations Group on Ivory and Illegal Wildlife Trade, made up of deputized DENR personnel and policemen, arrested Macario in an entrapment operation in Cavite for selling a juvenile serpent eagle through the social networking site Facebook for P5,000. He posted a photo of the eagle. The eagle was rescued and turned over to the DENR Wildlife Rescue Center in Cavite for rehabilitation while Macario was detained and charged with violation of the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. Macario, who is neither connected with, nor an employee of the DENR, could be imprisoned for two years and fined P200,000 once convicted for the crime. The Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act punishes the illegal trade of endangered species with a P200,000 fine and a two-year jail term. Killing an endangered animal carries stiffer penalties of six years of imprisonment and a P500,000 fine."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/132155/diskarte-and-student-struggles","title":"‘Diskarte’ and student struggles","date":"04:05 AM July 27, 2020","snippet":"Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve gotten used to seeing petitions for help on social media. “Sana po mapansin niyo,” the pleas often begin in our inboxes or as comments on public posts, along with details of the user’s difficulties — a relative in the hospital, a breadwinner who has lost their job — and their GCash or other bank details.","body":"Since the start of the pandemic, we’ve gotten used to seeing petitions for help on social media. “Sana po mapansin niyo,” the pleas often begin in our inboxes or as comments on public posts, along with details of the user’s difficulties — a relative in the hospital, a breadwinner who has lost their job — and their GCash or other bank details. Recently, petitions for help have taken a turn, with more and more students asking for help to continue schooling. When community quarantine began and students needed to adapt to distance learning, many problems quickly became apparent: poor or no internet access, a need for smart gadgets for accessing teleconferencing and exam platforms, not to mention a general swoop of the Filipino household’s income in the last few months, with students struggling with hunger even as they struggle with online classes. Who can forget the news of a Mapua student climbing a mountain in search of an internet connection to send a class requirement? Who wasn’t touched by the photo of a lola scraping her coins together to buy a smartphone? The burden rests, too, on harried parents who must balance maintaining their households with tutoring their children, and teachers who also struggle with internet access problems and the new paradigm of online classes. Distance learning was always going to be a challenge, with low-income families being the hardest hit, as usual.  Now, as students prepare for the beginning of classes next month, we’ve been told that schools will be implementing “blended” learning in various, flexible ways—through online classes, printed modules, and classes broadcast through television and radio. Not all of these, we are assured, will require internet access, and schools and communities will be adjusting to their students’ needs accordingly. As Education Secretary Leonor Briones said last week, “Kanya-kanyang diskarte, kanya-kanyang adjust.” These are statements that look good on paper, but a scroll through social media shows that the experience of many students varies. On Twitter, Facebook and anonymous chat site Omegle, there are more and more students asking for financial assistance so they can access the internet; so they can buy a smartphone, tablet or laptop; or so they can enroll. One Twitter user complained that buying P50 of prepaid load to use for cellular data might not even be enough to finish one Zoom-based class. To avoid accusations of scamming, some have attached photos of their grades and credentials. The Twitter account @pisoparasalaptop has helped to collate many of these fundraisers for individual students by retweeting them. The number of posts grows by the hundreds daily, showing just how many students seek to continue their education but don’t have the means to do so. A quick search of #AcademicFreeze might help the reader hear the sentiments of students, teachers, and parents who cry that no student should be left behind as the new academic year begins.  The hustle, as the kids say, is real: Online selling has boomed since the pandemic began as families find ways to augment their incomes, and student learners sell goods and services to prepare for schooling. Some seek to barter goods for secondhand phones and laptops. Some have taken to online selling or art commissions. More disturbingly, some students have taken to sending discreet messages offering nude photos or videos in exchange for money. One prays that these efforts are not being made by minors. I don’t believe that this is the kind of “diskarte” Briones had in mind, but it’s a reality all the same, that with limited opportunities to earn money for school, some students have had to manage on their own. “Napakaliit talaga ng epekto ng COVID-19 sa mga bata,” Briones said earlier this month, citing the small proportion of COVID-19 deaths in children. If we take a moment to listen to our most vulnerable youth, however, we might find that the effect isn’t small at all, and that the youth, even without contracting the disease itself, suffer greatly during the pandemic, too.  kchuarivera@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/306339/bir-extends-anew-deadline-for-online-trade-registration-to-sept-30","title":"BIR extends anew deadline for online trade registration to Sept. 30","date":"06:11 PM September 01, 2020","snippet":"Over 5,600 online-based businesses have complied with the extended deadline to register their operations with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), which on Tuesday (Sept. 1) further moved the cutoff date to Sept. 30.","body":"Over 5,600 online-based businesses have complied with the extended deadline to register their operations with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), which on Tuesday (Sept. 1) further moved the cutoff date to Sept. 30. As of Sept. 1, at least 5,650 online businesses already registered as taxpayers, Internal Revenue Deputy Commissioner Arnel S.D. Guballa told the Inquirer on Tuesday.  The original July 31 registration deadline had been moved to Aug. 31, but it fell on National Heroes’ Day, a regular national holiday, prompting the country’s biggest tax-collection agency to accept applications until Sept. 1. But in Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 92-2020 issued by Internal Revenue Caesar R. Dulay also on Tuesday, the BIR chief said he noted that there was “a surge of registrants in various revenue district offices that are trying to beat the deadline.”  “Considering this and the BIR’s resource constraints at this time of quarantine protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the deadline is further extended to Sept. 30, 2020,” Dulay said. Dulay gave an assurance that registration until the end of the month won’t be considered violation of the deadline which carries penalties.  “These taxpayers who have prior transactions subject to pertinent taxes are also encouraged to voluntarily declare the same and pay the taxes due thereon, with no penalty for late filing and late payment, provided the same is done on or before the extended due date,” Dulay added, referring to enterprises engaged in digital and online transactions. But Dulay warned that those who willingly engaged in online business without registering or updating their registration and those who fail to declare and pay past taxes would face “penalties under the law.” In June, Dulay issued RMC 60-2020 to remind online stores of their registration and tax obligations under the Tax Code as well as guidelines issued by then BIR chief Kim S. Jacinto-Henares in 2013. Henares’ RMC 55-2013 required all online stores to register and pay taxes. These included online retailers, online malls, online market places, web stores and similar websites. The government had found that online sales flourished as more enterprises did business on the internet, social media, and other digital channels at the height of the longest and most stringent COVID-19 lockdown in the region, which shut down many brick-and-mortar marketplaces.  Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III earlier said RMC 60-2020 was part of the government’s effort to implement a tax-collection program on digital transactions for goods and services, just like it collected taxes from physical stores. “What we are asking right now is just for online sellers to register with the BIR. Whether or not they will be subject to tax depends on their specific circumstances,” according to Dominguez."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1285792/deped-warns-public-vs-learning-materials-sold-online","title":"DepEd warns public vs learning materials sold online","date":"06:02 PM June 03, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday warned the public against the illegal selling of learning modules and materials from the agency.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday warned the public against the illegal selling of learning modules and materials from the agency.

But the documentary evidence seized by investigators said otherwise. The evidence included remittances from Western Union and screen grabs of the fake identities allegedly used by the workers in extorting money from victims who were enticed to expose themselves or perform sexual acts in front of a webcam.  Senior Supt. Elmo Francis Sarona, chief of staff of the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) at Camp Crame, said the company’s employees used Facebook to scan the Net for possible victims, zeroing in on those who seemed lonesome and away from home. Porn stars   They then set up fake Facebook accounts using images of porn stars as profile pictures to entice their mark to engage in a chat and later  in private conversations through Skype that would eventually lead to cybersex sessions. Sarona said the victims were recorded without their knowledge while doing sexual acts before the webcam, and later harassed into giving money with the threat that the incriminating images would be posted on the Net if they failed to do so. Scripts for chats The head of the ACG said they also recovered scripts used in chatting with the victims that contained instructions on the most appropriate answers to give and the conversational lines to be used to entice the target victims into exposing themselves in front of the webcam. In the Thursday raid, the police seized 73 computers and held for questioning the 34 workers in the premises, including the company’s owner-manager.  The questioning led the police to Digital Minds’ other branches where they arrested 32 in Legazpi City from a computer shop called Mocabyteâ along Barangay (village) Bonot, 16 in Libmanan town,  and two in Nabua town, both in Camarines Sur province. Sarona said they were able to trace the head of the operation, a certain Charvel Rebagay, who reportedly established a partnership with several co-owners that enabled him to branch out from Naga City to Nabua, Libmanan, and Legazpi City in Albay province. Borderless crime The investigation on the cyberextortion activities in Naga City started in November last year, with surveillance started in January, Sarona said, adding that the operation involved the Interpol because cyberspace is borderless, and the complainants were victims living outside the Philippines, except for one Filipino complainant. Sarona said Rebagay’s establishment devised a lot of schemes to earn money, but the bottom line was that his company violated Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Under the law, cybersex is defined as the willful engagement, maintenance, operation or control, directly or indirectly, of lascivious acts, exhibition of private parts, or any sexual activity with the aid of a computer system, Sarona said. Those arrested were also held for violating RA 8484, or the Access Devices Regulation Act of 1998,which provides penalties for fraud involving credit card, telecommunications service or equipment, and other access devices made possible by advances in technology.

Two years ago, she passed away, leaving my grandfather Basilio and second cousin Vikki Torres to continue her modest business, which supported the livelihoods of a handful of people. The pandemic brought their small-scale business to a halt: The pasalubong centers and the restaurants that ordered from them shut down, and with international travel held in abeyance, they couldn’t count on their balikbayan customers either.  Such was the case for months until they decided to sell the products online. “This is where things are headed,” Ate Vikki told me. “We should at least try our luck.” And so last month, with the help of other relatives and a consultant, they opened their Lazada store, in time for the “11.11 sale.” My relatives are among the many Filipinos turning to the online economy to rescue their businesses—or keep themselves afloat by starting new ones.  Thankfully, it is easy to open an online store. While it took a lot of hard work (and paperwork) for my Lola to be able to sell her candies in SM, it took only days to set up the business’ presence in Lazada. It is similarly easy to do the same in Shopee, which is why many businesses often have parallel stores on both platforms. In terms of capital, it’s likewise easier: Unlike a physical store in a mall, for example, that will require months of rental advance and deposits, not to mention the cost of actually building the store, an online store will only take some elementary skills in layout, photography, and web development.  Finally, in terms of profit, the minimal commission and transaction fees allow sellers to offer products at a price point competitive against other sources. All of the above are liberating for small and medium enterprises, giving them a lifeline during the pandemic and likely beyond, with the online economy seemingly poised to become only more and more dominant. On the other hand, it is also easy to see how the online economy can exclude as much as it includes. We may have iconoclastic feelings against big corporations like SM, but will Shopee and Lazada be any different should they continue their growth? Empowering to SMEs the online economy may be—but what of the riders and workers who bear much of the effort, but are no less contractual and vulnerable as mall (non-)employees? The challenge, then, for our country and society is to make sure that everyone benefits from the online economy—from the entrepreneurs to the consumers and the people in between, especially the riders to whom we have outsourced the need to go out of our homes, with them bearing the risk for minimal pay. Of course, the onus is on the online sellers themselves to act on this equity considerations, but the government, too, has a role, not least of which is to ensure and facilitate internet access throughout the country, given how it’s become fundamental not just to our social lives but also to economic participation. Another challenge is to make the online economy environment-friendly. Alas, today all our individual packages come with layer upon layer of bubble wrap, and while this may be demand-driven (e.g., customers’ view that the more packaging, the better), can we not come up with solutions to reduce the materials needed? Can we not apply the principles “reduce, reuse, recycle”—in that order? Proven measures include grouping packages to minimize packaging, Amazon-style; using alternative packaging materials (e.g., EcoNest Philippines’ cassava bags and other products); and scaling up recycling practices and capabilities. Surely there are more ways, and I’m sure our environmental scientists and online sellers themselves have much to say in this important conversation.  Meanwhile, I would like to end this piece by calling on Shopee, Lazada, and other online platforms to pursue, support, and encourage plastic-free options within their ecosystems; for consumers to clamor for it, and for all of us—scientists, citizens, entrepreneurs, and government agencies—to work together to ensure that the online economy is inclusive, sustainable, and friendly to the environment. —————— glasco@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

An order of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) requiring some 900,000 online sellers in the country to register and pay taxes may just be a losing proposition, according to a senator.  Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, Senate economic affairs committee vice chair, said the government could be spending more for the administrative costs of monitoring web-based merchants and auditing their sales than the revenue that the BIR could generate from them. Instead of going after small businesses, the BIR should just focus its resources on collecting some P70 billion in unpaid taxes from 24 Chinese-owned online gambling companies, more known as Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs), Gatchalian said on Sunday.  “For me, this [decision of the BIR] is the height of insensitivity,” he said, pointing out that most online sellers were people who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic. “In [introducing new] taxation, timing is very important. In this time of pandemic, it’s not right to impose taxes on new or small entrepreneurs,” Gatchalian said in a radio interview.  “The administrative costs in the registration, auditing and monitoring of [online sellers] could be more expensive than the taxes that the government would be able to collect from them,” he argued. The senator said the BIR’s move could also expose more people from contracting the new coronavirus, noting that 99 percent of business owners in the country were engaged in micro, small and medium enterprises. In addition, he said it could adversely affect couriers for delivery services, most of whom were drivers of motorcycle taxis that the government had temporarily banned to stem the contagion. Should the BIR insist on pushing through with its plan, Gatchalian said the registration should be at least be done through the internet to ensure the safety of online merchants and the public in general. “Imagine if all the small business owners would be required to go to the BIR [offices] to register. It would not only lead to the transmission [of the coronavirus] but also cause [logistical] problems,” he said.  Despite the mounting opposition from lawmakers, the Department of Finance stood firm on the BIR decision, with Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko saying it was not designed to go after online sellers for “unreported sales or unpaid taxes.” Tionko said the program was crafted to “encourage those who are engaged in online businesses to register with the BIR.” Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri shared Gatchalian’s position, saying the BIR order was not only insensitive but also totally unnecessary. “We understand that our government needs revenue, but we must focus on what’s important … Definitely, taxing small online businesses is not the answer,” Zubiri said in a Viber message. “First of all, many of these online sellers are trying to survive during this time of pandemic. [To] harass them on their last means of income is heartless, to say the least,” he said. The Senate leader said he and his colleagues would not support the revenue measure and that they would instead push to impose bigger taxes on Pogos that have been “growing within our country like a virus.” “Those with devious minds planning these tax schemes will have little or no support at the Senate for these measures,” he said. “Why make small enterprising and entrepreneurial [Filipinos] suffer from the threat of taxation and allow foreign Pogo [owners] to operate while evading or underpaying their taxes?” he added.

According to the FDA, there are “significant risks” in buying medicines online as compared to other consumer products sold on the internet.  “Unlike other consumer products purchased over the internet, medicines have the potential to cause serious side effects and health problems if not used and stored properly,” FDA said in an advisory. “Buying medicines over the internet can pose a serious health risk. You will never know what exactly you are getting. Even if the medicines bought online look the same, there is no guarantee that it is genuine.” “A medicine bought online may contain no active ingredient; too much or too little if active ingredients which may result in your condition not being treated correctly,” the FDA added. “Also, these medicines may not be stored correctly in accordance with its appropriate storage conditions.”  Online selling of medicine is prohibited in the Philippines, the FDA warned. Only sellers who actually have existing pharmacies licensed by the FDA are allowed to offer online ordering of their products.  “Online ordering services are additional activities of a pharmacy or botika subject for approval of FDA,” the agency said. “The FDA recommends purchase of medicines from licensed pharmacies near you and seek advice from your community pharmacist on the proper and safe use of medicines,” the agency said.

A Facebook-commissioned study, which surveyed 1,501 adult respondents in the Philippines, showed that there was 7 percent decline in the number of people who did their 2017 and 2018 holiday shopping in malls.  Facebook Philippines Country Director John Rubio said that possibly part of the reason people don’t go to malls anymore is hellish traffic in Metro Manila. Another reason, he said, was the convenience of shopping from the comforts of home online.  Rubio, in a forum on Thursday, Oct. 10, said people who still go to malls still rely on their mobile phones to browse for gift suggestions. The Facebook 2019 Holiday study found that 73 percent of shoppers use their phones while they are browsing for gifts in stores or in malls. This is 10 percent higher than that recorded last year, it noted.  Of the number, 69 percent compare prices, 61 percent compare products, and 60 percent read product reviews. Growing market Rubio also noted that the number of people shopping digitally for the holiday season “has grown significantly from one year to the other,” where spikes in online consumer activity usually occurring in November and December. He said, however, that majority of Christmas shoppers “take action early” and buy or prepare gifts as early as October. Singles Day (November 11), 12/12, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are among the most popular online shopping dates, the study said.  “Almost close to one out of two people will have a digital shopping experience in one of the shopping days,” Rubio said. The study also found that holiday shopping season extends up to January primarily because people take advantage of additional holiday sales. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they still shop in January because of bargains, while 43 percent said they want to buy new things for the New Year. Avoiding traffic Some 3 out of 10 persons said they shop in January as malls are “less busy” and there is “less traffic.” Thirty percent of respondents also said they use gift cards they received during the holiday season to purchase new things. Online videos also help people decide what to buy for the holidays, the study found. Respondents said during the holiday season, they like watching videos that feature families (67%). Others prefer videos that get them in a holiday mood (58%) or give them holiday gift ideas (58%). The Facebook Philippines official encouraged small-to-medium businesses in the country to tap free resources to help them bring their products online. “I think businesses need to have a clear digital strategy because I think it’s now an actual channel of business,” he said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); He added that holiday statistics show that “the trajectory is more and more digital or e-commerce.” “I think businesses need to get prepared and it needs to be a core part of their strategy. It needs to be ingrained in everything they do already and plan for,” Rubio said. Personal level For those planning to go online selling, it might be helpful to note that according to the Facebook study, nine of out of ten people are more likely to make a purchase if they are able to contact businesses on instant messaging services. This drives the importance of being able to engage customers on a more personal level, Rubio said. The study said that people usually message a business during the holiday season to find out more details about a product (66%), to purchase a product (58%), to track an order (58%), to find shopping details (56%), and to find store information (47%). Facebook Philippines has ongoing programs that provide free seminars and workshops to help local entrepreneurship thrive. On Tuesday, the social media firm conducted its “Festive Bootcamp in Manila” where 200 Manila-based small-to-medium businesses attended seminars and workshops about running a business on Facebook easier. This helped participants to brush up on digital knowhow and learn about new tools and templates to save time and effort, especially during the holiday season, which is the busiest time of the year. “With festive boost, we want to provide small and medium-sized businesses access to market insights and tools that can help them plan for an extended holiday season for their customers,” Rubio said.

Grown across tropical Southeast Asia, the durian is hailed by aficionados as the “king of fruits” due to its creamy, golden flesh and bittersweet flavor.  But detractors complain of its overpowering smell, comparing it to rotting food or stale vomit, and it is banned in many hotels and on public transport. The traditional roadside stalls where Malaysians have for decades enjoyed the smelly fruits were, along with most other businesses, forced to close during the lockdown.  Motorbike and car deliveries were still allowed, however, and companies such as Dulai Fruits Enterprise turned to social media to market their frozen durians. Managing director Eric Chan said he had been skeptical the move would work as Malaysians typically prefer fruit fresh, and a previous bid to sell them online had limited success.  But the company has seen roaring trade, with Chan telling AFP: “By the fifth day of our sales, we (had) hundreds of orders every single day.” Durians in Malaysia can cost more than 60 ringgit ($14) a kilogram, and there are 137 officially registered varieties ranging from “Musang King” to “Black Thorn” and “Red Prawn.” Durian trader Top Fruits has been selling prepared durian in sealed, 300-gram (10-ounce) packs on Facebook, and was making about 80 deliveries a day during the lockdown, which began mid-March. Managing director Tan Sue Sian said customers had come to see the advantages of having the fruit delivered to their door. “You don’t have to worry about your car being smelly” after transporting the fruit, said Tan.  Online sales of the fruit in Malaysia have since slowed after restrictions were eased at the start of May, as durian lovers gradually returned to outdoor stalls. Malaysia has seen a relatively small outbreak of COVID-19, recording almost 9,000 cases and 124 deaths. Online orders are still only a fraction of business for durian traders, with the bulk going to exporters — the fruit is particularly popular in China — and local shops, but they are hopeful about future prospects. “There is room to grow, and room to grow fast,” Tan said. Lindsay Gasik, who has written a number of books about the fruit, said it was about time that buying durians online took off. “I think once the supply chain and logistics got into place, people realized that it wasn’t that difficult to sell durians online,” she told AFP. She said aside from making it easier for people to get their durian fix via deliveries, online selling was also exposing them to more varieties and farms. “It isn’t just a better situation for customers, it is also for the farmers,” she said. “Selling durians online is definitely here to stay.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

In addition, the prohibition of gatherings by roadside stalls have also posed some challenges for the industry.  Nevertheless, continuing demand for the fruit both locally and internationally has the industry optimistic about the prospects for the year. Given the inability to take the fruit directly to people, many durian traders have turned to online platforms for sales while adhering to the Movement Control Order (MCO).  A box of branded durians such as Musang King and D24 that usually costs RM35 (S$11.50) is now being sold for as low as 66 sen as part of one online site’s super sales promotion that ends on Saturday (June 6). One of the participating durian sellers, Ms Leow E Shuen from Penang, said each box of durians would weigh between 300g and 380g.  “It’s the time to enjoy the King of Fruits. For this campaign, we are selling our branded durians at 66 sen per box. Usually, it costs between RM35 and RM38. We hope to build our brand and sell our products on more online platforms and bring our business to greater heights,” said Ms Leow. She said: “We received a lot of orders for our durian delivery service during the MCO and conditional MCO period. We first offered delivery services in 2018, but back then, many local and foreign tourists still preferred to dine in. “And this year, we have no choice but to only cater to delivery. We have been delivering durians to our customers as far as Selangor. As our customers are adapting to the new norm of ordering durians online, we have to be innovative too, ” she said. Durian seller L.Y. Ang said business has been good since he began selling online in April. “Business was brisk from the beginning. I was selling through online platforms and there were agents who came to us for durians. It’s the peak season now and we are dealing with many wholesalers from Kuala Lumpur. Most of them are looking for branded durians such as Musang King, black thorn, Hor Lor, hong xia and green skin,” he said.

From outright insistence, it now offers them enticements like financial aid during a national crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage them to list up their small businesses.  “Registering with the Bureau of Internal Revenue not only helps the government generate additional revenue for its various projects — joining the formal economy also ensures that these businesses and their employees are eligible for government assistance programs,” Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said. He said such perks were available only to those who register their businesses and pay taxes like ordinary brick-and-mortar shops.  For instance, small businesses registered with the BIR and the Social Security System (SSS) could avail themselves of the small business wage subsidy (SBWS) program, he said. Dominguez was referring to the P51 billion in subsidies to over 3 million workers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which had been unable to pay their employees during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) imposed on Luzon and other parts of the country.  SBWS beneficiaries are qualified to receive P5,000 to P8,000 a month for two months only if their employers had been faithfully paying corporate income taxes and remitting their employees’ withholding taxes and SSS contributions. Only registered businesses may get government loans under the COVID-19 assistance to restart enterprises (Cares) program of the Department of Trade and Industry, he added. Dominguez said the BIR’s Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 60-2020, which set a July 31 deadline for online stores to register and pay the correct taxes, was “part of the government’s efforts to implement a tax collection program on digital transactions” for both goods and services. How much taxes these online sellers will be told to pay “depends on their specific circumstances,” he said, pointing out that the rates for self-employed individuals had gone down since the implementation of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act in 2018. “For instance, a seller earning less than P250,000 will be subject to zero income tax,” he said. “In fact, for value-added tax (VAT) purposes, they will be exempt from VAT if their gross receipts do not exceed P3 million.”  Under the Tax Code, businesses that fail to register with the BIR can be closed for not less than five days. The closure order can be lifted “only upon compliance with whatever requirements prescribed by the [BIR] commissioner in the closure order.” But Dominguez said those who may be found with unpaid tax obligations prior to this year would “certainly can be covered by a general tax amnesty—that is why we are still asking Congress to pass the legislation on tax amnesty.” Last year, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11213, or the Tax Amnesty Act of 2019, which paved the way for the ongoing amnesties on delinquencies and estate taxes. But the President had vetoed RA 11213’s general tax amnesty provisions, which Dominguez defended. He said giving a chance to taxpayers to settle their past liabilities without safeguards “would only lead to revenue losses for the government and encourage tax evasion.” Benedicto Yujuico, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), said his group was backing the BIR. “The money we use for social amelioration funds to recover, for example, are funded by loans. We need to pay these and we need sources of revenue, so these online businesses must register,” Yujuico said during Saturday’s Laging Handa briefing. The government, in turn, will help online businesses, he said. “So I hope those starting online businesses will appreciate this and won’t hesitate to register their businesses and pay VAT and taxes due from selling products online,” Yujuico said. Online sellers and several lawmakers had protested against forcing the small internet entrepreneurs to register with the BIR, saying it was ill-timed since many of these businesses were struggling to survive amid the economic crisis. —With a report from Leila B.

In its recent report titled “Direct Selling and Communities in the Internet Age,” Euromonitor reveals that because the direct selling business model has a “personable nature,” the worldwide growth of the internet, and with it, online retail, “has not stopped direct sellers yet, nor is it predicted to.”  The report states, however, that the growth of direct selling is now stronger in developing regions, which could be due to less robust internet infrastructures in such areas. It also says that there is a positive correlation between underdeveloped retail markets—such as remote rural communities where going to a grocery requires long travel and can, therefore, be expensive—and the size and growth of direct selling in that region. “Direct selling not only operates as a source of income for some individuals in these communities, but as a source of everyday products for others. Direct selling helps sellers and consumers achieve the higher quality of life they strive for when opportunities are limited by geography,” the report reads.  “But [direct sellers’] continued success within specific communities, even in developed countries, suggests future potential. If anything, it has been individualistic attitudes and negative press that have hurt direct sellers more than the inevitable progress of technology,” the report adds. Still, as with any business, direct sellers need to adapt to the “internet age,” and it is the world wide web, ultimately, which will become one of their most important tools as an entrepreneur, according to the report. Direct sellers’ core strength will remain their personal sales model, but to evolve, they must also maintain an online presence. “Many younger generations seem more interested in online shopping and harbor skepticism of older brands and institutions. Direct sellers have been able largely to ignore these worries, thanks to success in regions that are not quite as developed, but those nations will catch up sooner or later, and when they do, the most successful direct sellers will have a plan for teaching the workforce of today how to sell to the hyper-connected shoppers of tomorrow,” states the report. Euromonitor cites the brand AUN Socks as an excellent example of direct selling making good use of digital tools, particularly social media, since it opened a store on WeChat.  “Something as simple as providing website templates in multiple languages gives distributors the power to speak to their online communities on their terms. As of September 2015, skincare seller Nerium has given sellers this option, with personal websites now available in Spanish,” the report adds. Euromonitor suggests that direct sellers keep track of three key trends that impact internet sales: personalization, convenience, and engagement. Herbalife is one direct selling company which could build on its customized service, says the report, since it already offers its clients various products based on their personal activities. “But a more robust recommendation engine that depends on user input (like data from a Fitbit) would be more modern,” the report suggests. When it comes to convenience, direct sellers should keep in mind the value of providing customers a wide variety of options. “Give shoppers options, because if you do not, someone else will. More options means more for current customers to buy and more to attract new ones,” it says. Euromonitor also suggests that to make distributors more accessible to their clients, a system could be developed to make it easier for direct sellers to be searchable online and via mobile. Mobile is also one avenue for direct-selling brands to improve engagement among their sellers and customers. “Real world examples of engagement are found in Western brands like Kate Spade and Burberry that market themselves in China via quizzes and contests on WeChat. A direct selling application would be using parties and in-person sales visits as photo-ops and incentivizing sharing them via social media, then allowing distributors to track their own engagement and reward the most active participants within their communities,” reads the report. While the internet will not be a harbinger of doom to direct sellers, it will become a differentiator, concludes the report. “Improving lives and supporting friends and family will never go out of fashion. However, the way communities are organizing themselves is changing,” it adds. It is up to smart direct sellers then, to figure out how they can support these changes by harnessing the power of the internet to cater to today’s modern shoppers."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/296887/ic-online-insurance-sales-also-allowed-in-areas-under-gcq","title":"IC: Online insurance sales also allowed in areas under GCQ","date":"12:12 PM May 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — With some areas in the country now covered by a less restrictive general community quarantine (GCQ), insurers and their agents can continue selling products online just like did they under the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) setup, Insurance Commission (IC) said.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — With some areas in the country now covered by a less restrictive general community quarantine (GCQ), insurers and their agents can continue selling products online just like did they under the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) setup, Insurance Commission (IC) said. Noting that the earlier IC issuances serving as guidelines for “virtual” face-to-face transactions only covered the ECQ, Insurance Commissioner Dennis B. Funa said in Legal Opinion No. 2020-4 dated May 5 that “assuming that the ECQ will be lifted and be replaced by GCQ by lawful authorities, it shall be entirely within the discretion of concerned companies to adopt and implement its initiatives under said circular letters in ‘areas [that will be] under GCQ.'”  “However, it must be emphasized that the adoption and implementation of said Initiatives during said extended period and in said areas under GCQ must not be contrary to any law, circular letter/s of [the IC], and/or existing rules and regulations, which includes the GCQ guidelines to be adopted and implemented by lawful authorities,” Funa said. “Otherwise, said companies will be ordered to recall said Initiatives without prejudice to the imposition of any and all administrative sanctions,” Funa added.  When the COVID-19 ECQ was first implemented in Luzon and other parts of the country starting mid-March, Funa noted that “face-to-face” sale of life insurance had already been “impractical.” As such, the IC had allowed the sale of life insurance products via remote communication, including teleconferencing, videoconferencing, computer conferencing, and audio conferencing, even without the regulator’s prior approval.  The IC had nonetheless required life insurance companies to register these non-traditional sales initiatives and inform the regulator about their mechanics immediately after launching them. Once registered with the IC, sales agents may use the aforementioned communications technologies to get potential customers’ minimum information, on top of identification documents needed for customer due diligence."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/308580/booksale-now-offers-books-through-online-shopping-site","title":"Booksale now offers books through online shopping site","date":"05:40 PM October 01, 2020","snippet":"Secondhand book store Booksale has begun selling its selection of titles on an e-commerce platform.","body":"Secondhand book store Booksale has begun selling its selection of titles on an e-commerce platform.

On Saturday, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the agency would move to stop online sales of cigarettes and liquor as these products might be accessible to minors if left unchecked.  But cigarette companies like PMFTC Inc. said they had age-gating in place so their resellers double-checked buyers’ government-issued IDs when delivering orders to ensure their products don’t end up with minors. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez was supporting Dominguez’s plan to ban unregistered sellers and resellers of sin products. “We should ban online the cigarettes, liquor, e-cigarettes and similar devices, if sellers are not registered and they don’t get profiles of buyers, if they don’t assure that buyer is no longer a minor, and if there’s no standard compliance of those products,” Lopez said in a statement. “We are discussing this with the Department of Finance as we study further and set up a system where online-selling platforms must be legitimate and registered with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the BIR—those that can assure profiling of buyers (up to receiving), and product standards,” Lopez said. “We allow only those asking for age and only delivering to buyers with the right age.” “These can be done by direct company online sales and major platforms that should be registered — those that will get profiles of buyers. Outside these registered groups, they must be banned,” he added.  “Online selling is the future. And it will provide added revenues also for the government because we make sure only registered and taxed products are being sold,” he said. For Lopez, selling cigarettes and liquor online should not be entirely prohibited — “if it is allowed in brick-and-mortar [stores], it must be allowed online, as long as registered and standard-compliant and original products are sold, especially on sin products because any fake item means tax evasion.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1402635/cops-seize-7700-unregistered-covid-19-test-kits-in-navotas","title":"Cops seize 7,700 unregistered COVID-19 test kits in Navotas","date":"07:04 PM March 03, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines – Police have seized a total of 7,700 unregistered COVID-19 test kits in Barangay San Rafael in Navotas City, which were said to be sold online.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Police have seized a total of 7,700 unregistered COVID-19 test kits in Barangay San Rafael in Navotas City, which were said to be sold online. In a statement released Wednesday, operatives of the Quezon City District Field Unit (QCFDU) of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, Philippine Air Force intelligence, and Navotas Police Station nabbed on Tuesday 40-year-old Liset Lo Kaw and Christian Cruz, 33, for selling the unregistered test kits.  According to the report, the two were leaders of Christian CG, a criminal group engaged in online selling of the unregistered test kits. The operation stemmed from information shared by the Food and Drug Administration about the two allegedly selling the test kits online.  Seized during the operation were 154 boxes of containing 50 pieces of 50 pieces of Clungene rapid test kit, and marked money amounting to P436,000. The two were then brought to the QCDFU, and charges for violating Republic Act 9711, or FDA Act of 2009 in relation to FDA Circular No. 2020-016, or the prohibition of online selling of FDA certified COVID-19 antibody test kit, are being prepared against them.

In a case that shocked the country and raised serious questions about child protection services in Germany, the regional court in Freiburg sentenced the boy’s mother, Berrin Taha, to 12-and-a-half years in prison.  Her husband Christian Lais, the boy’s stepfather whom he called “papa”, received a 12-year sentence followed by preventive detention. Lais, 39, had a previous conviction for child abuse, raising questions why he was allowed to live in a home with a child present.  The court found that the unemployed couple had sexually assaulted the boy, now 10, and pimped him on the so-called darknet between May 2015 and August 2017. They were convicted of rape, aggravated sexual assault of children, forced prostitution and distribution of child pornography, judge Stefan Buergelin said as he read out the verdict.  The couple was also ordered to pay a total of 42,500 euros ($49,200) in damages to the boy and another victim, a girl. Their sentences fell short of what prosecutors had demanded — 14 years and six months for Taha and 13 years and six months for Lais. On Monday, the same court sentenced a Spanish pedophile, Javier Gonzalez Diaz, to 10 years’ prison for repeatedly sexually abusing the young boy after paying the parents. The 33-year-old was also ordered to pay 18,000 euros to the young victim. The case came to light following an anonymous tip-off last September and led to the arrest of eight people who have been charged with belonging to an online pedophile ring.  Lais admitted on the witness stand to the assaults on the boy. He also made serious accusations against the child’s 48-year-old mother, who confessed to the crimes but remained largely silent about any possible motive during the trial. In his verdict, Buergelin said Taha went along with the abuse at first so she would not lose Lais as a partner and later “for financial motives”. They charged several thousand euros (dollars) for each instance of abuse, filmed the acts and posted them on the darknet. The boy is in foster care. His lawyer told reporters Tuesday that he was doing well “under the circumstances”.   /vvp"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/300501/another-online-trader-nabbed-for-selling-overpriced-thermal-scanners","title":"Another online trader nabbed for selling overpriced thermal scanners","date":"April 06,2020 - 11:11 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Authorities continue to crack down on online traders, who sell overpriced in demand medical products amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis in the Philippines. The latest to fall is a 40-year-old resident of Barangay Zapatera, Cebu City, who was caught in an entrapment operation in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City for selling overpriced thermal scanners.  Henry Te was handcuffed during a meetup with undercover policemen in Panagdait Road in Barangay Mabolo at past 2 p.m. today, April 6, 2020, said Police Captain Romeo Caacoy Jr. of the Regional Intelligence Division of the Police Regional Office in Central Visayas (PRO-7). Caacoy said that they arrested Te after he allegedly sold an overpriced thermal scanner to the undercover policeman. He also said that they confiscated 27 thermal scanners from Te during the operation. Te’s arrest came after two other online traders got arrested for selling overpriced thermal scanners last April 2 in Barangay Banawa and Barangay Kinasang-an Pardo in Cebu City.

He said the operation was conducted after several buyers of Te’s products complained about the overpricing of his products. With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in the Philippines, the demand for thermal scanners like rubbing alcohol and face masks surged. This prompted the government to monitor the prices of these products. Caacoy said that the entrapment operation was conducted especially since they were ordered to monitor incidents related to overpricing of these products amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On top of selling to new investors, the Treasury will also swap the new fixed-rate RTBs with two previously issued 10-year RTBs maturing on Aug. 19 and March 3 next year and two fixed-rate treasury notes (FXTN) maturing on Aug. 20 and March 20, 2021, according to a notice posted on the Treasury website on Friday (July 10).  Following the rate-setting auction set on Thursday next week, the RTBs maturing in 2025 will be offered until Aug. 7 or at an earlier date determined by the Treasury. Settlement will be on Aug. 12. The RTBs will be sold to small investors in multiples of P5,000.  For the first time, RTBs can be purchased via UnionBank of the Philippines’ mobile app BONDS.PH, which National Treasurer Rosalia V. de Leon said will be available on both Android and iOS mobile devices. These RTBs will also be made available online from these banks and authorized dealers:  The same general rules apply to investors who will purchase through the app and online channels, including the minimum investment amount of P5,000 and passing the know-your-client requirement before placing orders. For those who will use BONDS.PH, payment options included: De Leon said the BONDS.PH app will be live early next week. The app and online facilities can accept a maximum purchase of P500,000 per transaction. This will be the Duterte administration’s seventh RTB issuance and the Treasury’s 24th overall.  De Leon said the money to be raised from selling these RTBs will be used as budget support. At the same time, RTBs were being pitched as a secure investment for individuals and small groups. Last February, the Treasury issued a record P310.8 billion in three-year RTBs at 4.375 percent, despite a shortened offer period amid robust demand from small investors."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/718327/china-bans-online-platforms-from-selling-drones-due-to-military-parade","title":"China bans online platforms from selling drones due to military parade","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"Major online shopping platforms have been told to stop selling unmanned aerial vehicles – commonly known as drones – due to the military parade being held in Beijing on Thursday.","body":"Major online shopping platforms have been told to stop selling unmanned aerial vehicles – commonly known as drones – due to the military parade being held in Beijing on Thursday. In a statement, Taobao.com said it had been told by the Ministry of Public Security to stop selling drones and aerospace products until Friday. The company issued the statement last week.  Other major e-commerce platforms, including JD.com and Suning.com, have also been told to stop selling drones. Model aircraft owners have been banned from flying their planes for sports, entertainment and advertising campaigns from August 22 until September 4, within 300 kilometers of Tian’anmen Square.  The prohibition was announced by the General Administration of Sport’s Aeronautical Radio Model and Sports Management Centre. When the phrase “unmanned aerial vehicle” is input on e-commerce platforms, no results show up. When consumers input the type of a specific unmanned aerial vehicle, they can only browse information about the product on the webpage, but cannot place an order.  Drone companies said the suspension of sales at online platforms will have a limited influence in the short term. Yu Shengxin, sales manager at Shenzhen Jiuxing Tianli Technology Co, said: “Exports of our drone products comprise a large percentage of total sales, so we are not worried about the ban on sales. The company will strengthen cooperation with Tencent to manufacture more civilian drones.” Securities Times quoted Rapoo Technology, another drone manufacturer in Shenzhen, as saying it has not been affected by the prohibition because apart from Beijing, offline sales of drone products in other cities are being processed normally and online sales will resume on Friday. Analysts said the security issue surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles is the main reason for Beijing issuing the no-fly restrictions. She Shuanglin, an analyst at Internet consultancy Analysys International in Beijing, told China Daily, “The percentage of online purchases of drone and aerospace products by consumers is much higher than that for offline sales. Moreover, unmanned aerial vehicle companies are mainly small startups, so they are more susceptible to such a situation.  “There are still no effective measures to manage and supervise the drone industry, including production standards, industry technology standards and market admission standards.” She said the quality of drones varies greatly, and suggested that the government introduce industry standards as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1193107/fda-online-drug-sales-hinder-drive-vs-counterfeit-meds","title":"FDA: Online drug sales hinder drive vs counterfeit meds","date":"05:00 AM November 22, 2019","snippet":"The booming industry of online sales,  particularly of medicines, is making it difficult for the government to combat the prevalence of counterfeit drugs, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said.","body":"The booming industry of online sales,  particularly of medicines, is making it difficult for the government to combat the prevalence of counterfeit drugs, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said. “That’s one of the biggest challenges for us, the online sale of pharmaceuticals,” said FDA officer in charge  director general Enrique Domingo, adding that selling drugs online is illegal in the country.

The official said it was difficult to check the authenticity of medicines as well as personal care products being sold online by unlicensed sellers who are “ordinary individuals” with “no licenses to operate or sell pharmaceutical products.”  The FDA earlier issued a cease and desist order to online shopping companies Shopee Philippines and Lazada Philippines for selling drug products with no appropriate licenses to operate from the agency."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/293399/online-sex-trafficker-gets-31-years-for-selling-abusing-young-boys","title":"Online sex trafficker gets 31 years for selling, abusing young boys","date":"March 11,2020 - 03:03 PM","snippet":"","body":" CEBU CITY, Philippines– A 34-year-old man from Cebu City was sentenced to at least 31 years in prison after pleading guilty to the attempted trafficking of two boys, aged 9 and 14 and for acts of lasciviousness. Joey Michael Donozo entered a plea bargaining agreement and confessed to the crime of attempted trafficking which is a violation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act 9208 as amended by Republic Act 10364) and 16 counts of acts of lasciviousness in violation of the Revised Penal Code, said a press release from the International Justice Mission (IJM). Under plea bargaining agreements, the accused enters a not guilty plea to the original charge filed against him but to other similar offenses, usually before a court trial starts. This protects child victims from the possibility of having to testify against the perpetrators who are often family members or neighbors, reducing possible trauma on the child victim. Police investigation showed that Donozo sexually abused the two boys to produce Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM) which he later on distributed to foreign sex offenders.  He also sold minors to foreigners traveling to Cebu. On March 10, 2020, Cebu City Regional Trial Court Branch 22 Judge Dax Gonzaga Xenox sentenced Donozo to serve 15 years in prison for the crime of attempted trafficking and another 16 years for a separate complaint for acts of lasciviousness that was also filed against him. Judge Xenox also ordered him to pay P600,000 to each of his victims. “Children are safer in Cebu because of the Court’s conviction of Joey Donozo.  The young boys whom he trafficked and sexually abused to create child sexual abuse materials are safe from his predatory acts.  In fact, restraining Donozo has protected all other vulnerable children whom he would have abused for years to come were it not for his arrest and conviction.  IJM has seen over and over again that when violent offenders are held accountable, the abuse of children dramatically decreases as impunity is replaced with accountability,” said IJM Cebu Field Office Director John Tanagho. “To those who are perpetrating this crime against our children, you will be caught eventually. You will soon be put behind bars and be held accountable for your crime,” said Senior Assistant City Prosecutor Noel Cellona. Donozo was arrested on February 16, 2019, after he offered two underage boys – aged 9 and 14 at the time – for commercial sexual exploitation. He also previously transmitted online sexually explicit images involving one of the boys in exchange for money from foreigners. Members of the Women and Children Protection Center – Visayas Field Unit (WCPC-VFU) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) conducted the operation in Cebu City and rescued the boys. The operation stemmed from a case referral from the Australian Federal Police to the PNP which said that Donozo was engaged in the sex trafficking of minors by selling young Filipino boys to foreigners for sexually explicit acts. Donozo also produced Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM) by filming minors in sexually explicit acts. The WCPC-VFU operation was supported by the Central Visayas offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD-7), the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT-7), the Cebu City Police Office’s Special Weapons and Tactics and Women and Children Protection Desk, and the IJM.

The Philippine Retailers Association, a group with more than 400 member companies, is asking the government to let all businesses—essential or not— to resume their operations as long as they do so online, a top official said on Friday.  This is not about getting profits, said PRA vice chair Roberto Claudio, since the market would not likely soon go back to how it was before. It’s about getting enough revenue to at least continue paying workers. If the lockdown is extended by another month or even 15 days, he warned that MSMEs would run out of working capital.  “Because of the fact that we have been on lockdown for two months, literally all MSMEs have no sales, zero revenue, no [revenue] source that could be used to pay for people’s salaries,” he added. He said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Department of Trade and Industry should revise its guidelines to allow all businesses to operate again under the condition that they do their transactions online and follow all the necessary health protocols.  He first raised this proposal during a webinar hosted by the Management Association of the Philippines on Friday, essentially suggesting to blur the line between what the government considered essential and nonessential businesses. In the same webinar, PwC Philippines showed the results of its recent survey, which noted that 39 percent of MSMEs saw financing as a “pressing need.” The survey was conducted among 350 respondents, of which 59 percent were MSMEs. “In fact, they should have done that from the time when we had an ECQ. That would be compliant to all health protocols. It won’t violate them,” he said. “That should be their guideline. Any business that can transact online and can comply with the medical protocol [should be allowed to resume operations, while] those that cannot [should not be allowed],” he said. While companies continue to support their workers during the lockdown, MSMEs could only do this for so long without running out of money entirely, especially since there are other expenses to look into, including bank loans.  It is still uncertain if the lockdown would extend after May 15, although some parts of the country already have relaxed restrictions since they were considered either low or medium risk. Metro Manila, the country’s capital, is still under an enhanced community quarantine, which allows only essential businesses—such as supermarkets, hospitals, and call centers—to operate while every other company had to close. “By allowing them to resume business, even if it’s just online, they can generate a little revenue to at least pay their people. Bank loans and rentals can wait, since they could at least request to pay in installments,” he said. Claudio is the chair and CEO of sports retail company Toby’s Sports. Even his company could not go back to work in areas under enhanced community quarantine because their business is not considered essential. INQ"}]}
