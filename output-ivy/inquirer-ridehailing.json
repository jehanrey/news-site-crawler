In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.

After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As of April 8, all Uber rides had shifted to the Grab app, which meant that former Uber drivers had to either join Grab or stop working. In the deal when Grab took over Uber operations in Southeast Asia, Uber was allowed to retain 27.5 per cent of Grab’s shares."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061236/2-new-ride-hailing-firms-get-ltfrb-accreditation","title":"2 new ride-hailing firms get LTFRB accreditation","date":"05:42 AM December 08, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1209152/pimentel-endorsement-wont-influence-decision-after-pilot-test-run","title":"Koko endorsement won’t influence TWG decision on ride-hailing apps","date":"08:57 PM January 04, 2020","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1101047/need-water-ride-hailing-service-seizes-the-dry-day","title":"Need water?

Go Jek’s rejection further cements Grab’s hold on the Southeast Asian market, particularly in Manila, where the Singapore-based firm has captured 90 percent of the market, according to local anticompetition officials.  LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  While Grab hails from Singapore, its local subsidiary, MyTaxiPH, complies with the foreign ownership requirement. Should Go Jek reconstitute its ownership and board composition, it can appeal for reconsideration, Libiran said. Go Jek statement In a statement, Go Jek said the company “continues to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines.” With Go Jek facing a roadblock, the Philippine ride-hailing industry remains split among 10 players: Grab, u-Hop, Micab, Hype, e-Pick Me Up, Owto, Hirna, GoLag, Ryde and SnappyCab. Grab and u-Hop have yet to renew their accreditations.

However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1209152/pimentel-endorsement-wont-influence-decision-after-pilot-test-run","title":"Koko endorsement won’t influence TWG decision on ride-hailing apps","date":"08:57 PM January 04, 2020","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1101047/need-water-ride-hailing-service-seizes-the-dry-day","title":"Need water?

Go Jek’s rejection further cements Grab’s hold on the Southeast Asian market, particularly in Manila, where the Singapore-based firm has captured 90 percent of the market, according to local anticompetition officials.  LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  While Grab hails from Singapore, its local subsidiary, MyTaxiPH, complies with the foreign ownership requirement. Should Go Jek reconstitute its ownership and board composition, it can appeal for reconsideration, Libiran said. Go Jek statement In a statement, Go Jek said the company “continues to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines.” With Go Jek facing a roadblock, the Philippine ride-hailing industry remains split among 10 players: Grab, u-Hop, Micab, Hype, e-Pick Me Up, Owto, Hirna, GoLag, Ryde and SnappyCab. Grab and u-Hop have yet to renew their accreditations.

These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/982340/ltfrb-crackdown-set-vs-drivers-of-illegal-ride-hailing-app-ltfrb-ride-hailing-app-colorum-tnvs-arcade-city","title":"LTFRB: Crackdown set vs drivers of ‘illegal’ ride-hailing app","date":"01:18 PM April 14, 2018","snippet":"Transport authorities are poised to launch a nationwide crackdown against drivers of the new ride-hailing app Arcade City should they continue to defy the government and push through with its operations without the accreditation on Monday.","body":"Transport authorities are poised to launch a nationwide crackdown against drivers of the new ride-hailing app Arcade City should they continue to defy the government and push through with its operations without the accreditation on Monday. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday assailed Arcade City for its continued defiance of the cease-and-desist order against it, as the agency pointed out that the app is encouraging the establishment of illegal transport network companies (TNCs), as well as the activation of unregistered transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Arcade City’s business model promotes illegality by espousing that TNCs no longer have to be accredited to be able to operate in the country. Arcade City also claimed that its drivers need not apply for a franchise from the government for them to ferry passengers.  Lizada said this is why when Arcade City app goes online on Monday, enforcers from the LTFRB, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Land Transportation Office and the Philippine National Police’s Highway Patrol Group will be implementing the power the law against the unregistered ride-hailing app. Lizada warned that members of the law enforcers will be operating undercover as they themselves would avail Arcade City’s services to apprehend drivers and impound their vehicles.  “We cannot afford any more irregularities such as this. We need to protect the riding public,” Lizada told the Inquirer. After Arcade City was ordered this week to cease operations for the second time, it taunted the LTFRB by saying that the board does not understand how its technology and model work. “Arcade City does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company. Driver entrepreneurs may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, but Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers,” it said in a statement. Based on its website, the app would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens.” These tokens could either be sold or used within Arcade’s ecosystem for services and bonus features. Lizada said that on top of apprehending Arcade drivers for “colorum” operations, the LTFRB will also coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications Technology and the US Embassy to “protest” the actions of the company’s founder and CEO, Christopher David.  “He is making a mockery of our rules and regulations,” Lizada said of David, who packages his company as a supposed alternative to Uber. Uber ceased operating as a TNC by Monday, running counter to the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order for it to remain in operations while a review on the deal of its acquisition by Grab is being conducted. The PCC feared that Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry gives Grab a monopoly of the industry.

There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.

No ride-hailing apps accepted the request for vehicle except for one with a driver whose picture looked very familiar. The app says the driver has a blue Suzuki Vitara and the fare is P200. The driver pulled over the driveway of the CDN building in Barangay Mabolo 15 minutes later. As his first passenger entered the vehicle, the driver looked away. When the second passenger came, this reporter who covers the Cebu City Hall beat, the driver lets out a laugh. “Nakakita man mo sa akong picture sa app no?” he says. (You saw my picture on the ride-hailing app, right?) Behind the wheels of the car is Cebu City Councilor David “Dave” Tumulak, who earlier told City Hall reporters that he has applied to be driver for a ride-hailing app. That Friday afternoon, Tumulak says he just came from M.J Cuenco Avenue after a meeting. There is no more work for the day at his office at the Cebu City Hall so he decided to pick up passengers. That was when he received the request for a vehicle from the CDN Digital employee. ‘Driver for hire’ While he jokes about his government salary to be insufficient to pay for gas, Tumulak turned serious when asked why he decided to become a driver. “Sayang kaayo ang oras mag-drive from one meeting to the next. Daghan kaayong pasahero mag-atang. (Hours are wasted driving in getting from one meeting to the other) It is a waste of time and gasoline to drive alone. So may pa mag-driver ko aron makabayad ko sa gas (So I decided to become a driver so my earnings can pay for gas),” he tells CDN Digital. Tumulak reveals that he has been part of the ride-hailing app for two weeks. He applied in early December 2019 and was approved after two days. On Thursday, December 19, he earned P1,700, which is enough to have his tank filled with gasoline. And he is not even a full-time driver. His main mission in doing in being a driver is related to his role as a public servant. He enjoys driving around the city which also gives him the first-hand experience to see what is really happening on the road. It gives him the platform to better understand the plight of the drivers, whose livelihood are affected by the city’s worsening traffic situation. In these drives, he personally witnesses the experiences of motorists, pedestrians and commuters. Being a driver is his way of getting information, which he utilizes in formulating ordinances or legislations that will help the city government serve its constituents better. WATCH: David Tumulak answers questions from CDN Digital on the road  Passengers “Kun driver diay ka ba, madunggan man diay nimo tanan bisan og naa sila sa likod,” he shares with an amused voice. (When you are a driver, you can hear everything that your passengers talk about even when they are seated at the back.) He has since learned informative lessons and hilarious realities from his passengers. “Naay pasahero nga sabaan, medyo hugawan, sigeg panglibak, sigeg pagwapa,” says Tumulak. (There are passengers who are talkative, who are quite messy, who likes to gossip, or who uses the time on the road to put on make-up.) Some passengers have recognized him and when it happens, he gladly converses with them. Road issues That Friday, around 4 p.m. on the way to SM Seaside City Cebu, Tumulak pointed out that trucks were plying Sergio Osmeña Road on North Reclamation Area when there is an existing truck ban around that time. He points out the need to enforce measures such as the truck ban to make sure that efficient flow of traffic is observed with the expected holiday rush this month, December 2019. As the car moved forward to its destination, Tumulak noticed a light traffic situation at the South Road Properties (SRP) tunnel that afternoon while CDN Digital was on board his car. There were sacks, which might have fallen from a delivery truck, that were left unattended on the road. To resolve the situation, he called an official from the Cebu City Transportation Office in removing the sacks. He says this is one of the advantages of being a councilor-driver. Sitting as the Cebu City Council’s chairperson for the committee on disaster risk reduction and management, Tumulak is also able to conduct his own research that he can report to the body. He can easily respond to any incident while he is on transit. He gets to converse with his passengers, people from all walks of life, on the issues and challenges they face. As he receives the P200 payment for the drive, Tumulak showed off the money to this reporter. “Makapa-gas nako!” he says sounding victorious from a recent feat. (I can fill up my gas tank.) For Tumulak, being a driver is no different than being a councilor. Just like a councilor, a driver provides service to the public with the ultimate goal of providing convenience to passengers, a small but significant contribution to make their lives better. / dbs & celr"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/280292/malaysia-threatens-ride-hailing-firm-grab-with-21-m-fine","title":"Malaysia threatens ride-hailing firm Grab with $21-M fine","date":"04:47 PM October 03, 2019","snippet":"KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia’s competition watchdog on Thursday threatened to hit Grab with a $21 million fine for practices that allegedly reduce competition, the latest problem for the ride-hailing giant.","body":"KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia’s competition watchdog on Thursday threatened to hit Grab with a $21 million fine for practices that allegedly reduce competition, the latest problem for the ride-hailing giant. Grab is the biggest ride-hailing firm in Southeast Asia, and has strengthened its hold on the market since buying US rival Uber’s operations in the region last year.  But the Singapore-headquartered firm has come under scrutiny from regulators in several countries due to concerns about its dominant position. The Malaysia Competition Commission proposed fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company’s competitors.  This had the effect of “distorting competition” by creating barriers to Grab’s rivals, it said. “It is important that barriers to entry for new players remain low, and for existing players to have the ability to grow and compete on merits to ensure that competition can remain healthy,” said Iskandar Ismail, the watchdog’s chief executive.  In addition, a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit will be imposed should Grab fail to take action to address the competition concerns. Grab has 30 days to respond to the watchdog, after which a final decision will be made. The company said they had complied fully with competition laws and were “surprised” by the proposed fine. “We believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms,” a Grab statement said. Last year, Singapore fined Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged. /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/251351/indonesia-transport-vietnam-thailand-singapore-philippines-gojek-ride-hailing-app","title":"Indonesia ride-hailing app GoJek says expanding abroad, including PH","date":"02:52 PM May 24, 2018","snippet":"Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek said Thursday it would expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines as it takes on regional rival Grab in the fast-growing Southeast Asian market.","body":"Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek said Thursday it would expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines as it takes on regional rival Grab in the fast-growing Southeast Asian market.

Local start-up Filo Technologies, which was founded late last year, said it intends to launch its private-hire car booking services within the next two weeks.  It is up against local firm Ryde and India’s Jugnoo, which both debuted earlier in the week, and incumbent Grab, which acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations two months ago. Filo founder Jason Tan, 41, who is from the shipping and logistics industry, told The Straits Times yesterday (May 5) fares will be lower than those for taxis and comparable to other private-hire car services. Fares will also fluctuate based on demand and supply, he added.  To attract drivers, Filo will collect a 12 per cent commission – lower than Grab’s 20 per cent – which will be capped at S$400 (US$300) a month, said Mr Tan. He is currently recruiting 300 licensed private-hire car drivers to drive for his app – through social media and word of mouth – and aims to have 2,000 drivers in time for the launch. The company, based at Vision Exchange in Jurong East, has a start-up capital of S$50,000. Mr Tan said this money comes from his own pocket and investors, and he has plans to raise more funds.  His rivals currently have deeper pockets – Jugnoo has raised US$16 million, Ryde has US$1.5 million, and Grab, US$4.1 billion, according to tech website Crunchbase. Competition in Singapore’s ride-hailing sector looks set to get more intense, with firms such as Singapore’s MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) Foundation, Malaysia’s Dacsee and Indonesia’s Go-Jek looking to join the fray. Still, Mr Tan is undeterred. “The passenger-driver (matching) platform is just the start. We will have other more attractive services on the app in the coming days,” he said, but declined to reveal more. He is also promising attractive promotions for customers, but was tight-lipped about what they will be. “Based on my research, as long as there are no more than five players, the market should be able to accommodate all of them,” he added.  Asked about the sustainability of the new entrants, Mr Li Jianggan, founder of Momentum Works, a tech investment firm, said the companies could be counting on the Government regulating the ride-hailing industry in the future, to have more than one player. “At some point, this means regulating pricing and incentives.

Only licensed taxis may use ride-hailing apps, the Ministry of Transport announced Friday. Such apps are hugely popular in China, and the ministry said it needed to protect users.  The ruling could be a setback for Uber, which faces legal challenges in South Korea, India, Europe, California and other markets for using drivers who lack taxi licenses. “While we encourage innovation, we prohibit private cars from using platforms to participate in the ‘hired car’ business,” said a ministry announcement. It said companies that operate ride-hailing apps will be required to make sure no unlicensed drivers use them.  China’s ride-hailing market is dominated by domestic competitors Didi Dache, backed by Internet giant Tencent, and Kuaidi Dache, backed by rival Alibaba Group. Those services are used mostly by taxi companies. A third Chinese Internet giant, search engine operator Baidu Inc., jumped into the market in December by investing in Uber.  Taxi companies in the United States, Europe and other countries have complained Uber and similar ride-hailing services have an unfair advantage because they are not covered by regulations that affect the established industry. In December, the Shanghai city government detained and fined 12 unlicensed drivers who received business through the Didi Dache app. In South Korea, the chief executive of Uber’s local subsidiary was charged in December with operating an unlicensed transport company.

Micab CEO and cofounder Eddie Ybañez said the company had received enough commitments from taxi operators to scale their current pool of drivers to 15,000 in September from the current 6,500.  The problem, however, is that its entry has been mired by so-called phantom bookings that began in June. Rides are booked, but later cancelled. As a result, drivers became less willing to activate the Micab app because of the phantom bookings, which nearly doubled in two months’ time, from 15,000 in June to more than 29,000 this month, he said.  Micab, one of the few transport network company (TNC) entrants accredited in April, was part of the promise to keep the market competitive. It was supposed to give consumers a choice, after Grab became a monopoly through a regional takeover of rival Uber. Micab first recognized these phantom bookings by looking into passenger accounts that have cancelled at least three times in short intervals.  But before the company could stop these phantom bookings, its drivers would have already wasted time and fuel, an unnecessary cost just when the prices of basic goods are increasing. “They’ll switch on the meter only when the passenger finally gets in. So the risk actually is that the driver goes there and then there is no one there,” he said, noting there were no refunds in these cases. Most of these bookings were then followed by a call recruiting the Micab driver to switch to Grab, he said. The person on the other line would even give a counteroffer. These calls came from cellphone numbers that have “sequential” last digits, suggesting the accounts were bought in bulk, the official said. “Our conclusion is this is just one entity. It’s like a campaign,” he said. To address the issue, Ybañez said the company had recently used an algorithm automatically banning phantom bookings after three cancellations done in short intervals.  He said they were still monitoring the results. The problem, however, is that people behind this campaign can register new numbers. Asked if Micab has already reached out to authorities, he said a legal team was still examining options. If the issue is not resolved by the app’s algorithm, the best they could do is to “minimize” the number of incidents, he said. Nevertheless, the Cebu-based cofounder is only asking for fair play. “We just want this to stop,” he said."},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/166440/road-ahead-ride-hailing-southeast-asia","title":"The road ahead for ride-hailing in Southeast Asia","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"Many probably expected Grab to dominate Singapore’s ride-hailing market, following its acquisition of rival Uber’s Southeast Asia business two months ago.","body":"Many probably expected Grab to dominate Singapore’s ride-hailing market, following its acquisition of rival Uber’s Southeast Asia business two months ago. But a slew of newcomers have entered, or have signalled their intention to occupy, the turf left vacant by Uber.  This is good news for commuters because fares are likely to stay competitive as the rivals strive to erode Grab’s lead while it tries to retain its top spot. Today, local carpooling app Ryde makes its foray into the private-hire car business with the debut of its RydeX service, offering lower driver commissions and advance booking of trips of up to seven days.  Yesterday, Indian start-up Jugnoo launched its app here, featuring a reverse bidding system that gives drivers the option to put out fare bids. At least three more players are eyeing a piece of the pie. They are: Indonesia’s Go-Jek, Singapore-headquartered MVL (Mass Vehicle Ledger) Foundation and Malaysia’s DacSee.  MVL has announced an end-July launch, DacSee plans to debut in the second quarter of next year, and Go-Jek will launch in the “next few months”, according to sources cited in media reports. Go-Jek is in talks with Singapore’s biggest cab company, ComfortDelGro, over a possible tie-up. On the regulatory front, the increased competition could impact the move by Singapore’s competition watchdog to stall the Grab-Uber merger, which is being investigated for suspected infringement of competition laws. Whether the watchdog will lift its interim measures blocking the Grab-Uber union, however, hinges on the newcomers building up a critical mass of users and drivers to compete effectively with Grab, say experts. Meanwhile, the swift appearance of contenders will keep Grab on its toes, and commuters less anxious of falling prey to take-it-or-leave-it fares. Competition watchdogs in other Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia and the Philippines, will also keep a close eye on the development in Singapore while reviewing the Grab-Uber merger."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/45941/transport-ministry-in-indonesia-bans-ride-hailing-apps","title":"Transport ministry in Indonesia bans ride-hailing apps","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"INDONESIA—The transportation ministry has banned the operation of the country’s rapidly proliferating ride-hailing applications as it claims they do not fulfill the requirements for being public transportation, an official said.","body":"INDONESIA—The transportation ministry has banned the operation of the country’s rapidly proliferating ride-hailing applications as it claims they do not fulfill the requirements for being public transportation, an official said.

Under Department Order 2015-11 issued by then-Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya, the LTFRB only has an oversight function and can only step in to set fares during emergency situations. The LTFRB, however, disputed the validity of the order because it was implemented without their knowledge. /ee"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/75031/ltfrb-accredits-filipino-owned-ride-hailing-firm-hype","title":"LTFRB accredits Filipino-owned ride-hailing firm, Hype","date":"12:14 PM April 19, 2018","snippet":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) that would rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount.","body":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) that would rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount. The LTFRB accredited Hype, giving app-based drivers as well as commuters an alternative to Grab, and eliminating Grab’s “virtual monopoly” of the industry that apparently followed after its acquisition of its rival Uber last month.  LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III noted, however, that it would be up to Hype and other TNCs they would later accredit how they would market themselves to lure drivers and commuters to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  Bu LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said drivers would still need to obtain accreditation from their chosen TNC for accountability purposes. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to accrediation from the LTFRB, namely: Hirna, Go Lag, Micab, and Owto.  Delgra said they hope to accredit the other applicants once they have complied with the LTFRB’s requirements. For one, he said, these TNCs must show proof that they are able to accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry to the ride-hailing industry comes amid mounting complaints against Grab for its high fare and picky drivers. Brian Cu, Grab’s country head, has nevertheless assured the public that apart from passenger complaints mechanisms, they have in place in their system the ability to detect and determine if a driver is deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once they verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking, the erring driver would be summoned to their office for investigation and may be suspended or removed from their platform. /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1241529/grab-driver-is-pampangas-first-covid-19-case","title":"Grab driver is Pampanga’s first COVID-19 case","date":"07:47 PM March 13, 2020","snippet":"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO—Pampanga’s first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case is a driver of ride-hailing company Grab, who had serviced routes in Clark Freeport and Pampanga.","body":"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO—Pampanga’s first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case is a driver of ride-hailing company Grab, who had serviced routes in Clark Freeport and Pampanga.

Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/264192/passenger-in-cebu-shares-hilarious-ride-hailing-experience","title":"Passenger in Cebu shares hilarious ride-hailing experience","date":"October 15,2019 - 01:38 PM","snippet":"","body":" CEBU CITY, Philippines— Have you ever tried booking a ride but your driver arrives at your destination first before you even hop aboard?

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283629/grab-to-obey-pcc-order-for-p5-m-refund-to-customers","title":"Grab to obey PCC order for P5-M refund to customers","date":"03:55 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.

PCC said Grab will return price excesses to riders via GrabPay if it breaches the monthly average fee cap set by the commission. “This mechanism ensures that the public will directly be given a rebate, through their individual GrabPay accounts,” PCC chair Arsenio Balisacan earlier said in a press conference.

The ride-hailing giant said on Thursday that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) should clarify if motorcycle taxis were now considered its competitors, after a former PCC commissioner said that barring the likes of Angkas would mean removing Grab’s “competition.” Grab was referring to Rep. Stella Quimbo, who earlier warned transport authorities that banning motorcycle taxis at the end of a pilot test meant that Grab would continue to monopolize the market.  This is an important distinction since the restrictions that currently bound the company—called voluntary commitments—are meant to keep it in check until a new and strong enough competitor emerges. “We cannot right away apply for release from voluntary commitments because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release,” Grab said.  These voluntary commitments result in penalties for Grab whenever it overcharges its passengers and prevents its drivers from working under other ride-hailing apps. But PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said that they would only consider this after motorcycle taxis had finally been legalized."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/914214/ltfrb-to-impound-uber-grab-cars-lacking-franchise","title":"LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise","date":"05:30 AM July 16, 2017","snippet":"Before the end of the month, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will start apprehending drivers accredited by ride-hailing companies and impound their cars if they continue to operate as public conveyances without franchises.","body":"Before the end of the month, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will start apprehending drivers accredited by ride-hailing companies and impound their cars if they continue to operate as public conveyances without franchises. After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/57306","title":"2 new ride-hailing firms get LTFRB accreditation","date":"December 10,2018","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1202866/senate-inquiry-into-alleged-abuse-poor-service-of-grab-ph-sought","title":"Senate inquiry into alleged ‘abuse, poor service’ of Grab PH sought","date":"04:19 PM December 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines. Marcos filed on Wednesday Senate Resolution No. 283 urging the appropriate Senate panel to conduct an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service of Grab PH and its effective monopoly of ride hailing services.”  “Various reports state that Grab prices (are) increasing to exorbitant amounts during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, with commuters experiencing more than double their usual fare,” the resolution read. “In addition to the high fares during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, Grab commuters also experience difficulties in booking a ride, with reports of booking times reaching about an hour, if they get a booking at all,” it added.  Under the mandate of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) as defined by the Philippine Competition Act, Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines was subjected to “quality and pricing standards in clearing the transaction which were part of the voluntary commitments signed by Grab to address the competition concerns raised by the antitrust authority,” Marcos noted in her resolution. “Commuters using Grab services have consistently complained that fares are becoming more expensive now, after Uber sold its business to Grab, leaving them with no other ride-hailing company to choose from,” she added.

Signed on Tuesday, the board’s Memorandum Circular No. 2018-19 also ordered all TNCs to issue electronic receipts showing the fare breakdown.  The order would take effect 15 days after its publication in a national newspaper, according to LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III. The memorandum is applicable only to TNCs with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) or private vehicles that can be booked for solo or carpooled rides. Of the six ride-hailing apps accredited by the LTFRB, only Grab and local players Owto and Hype offer TNVS.  Fare components The others — GoLag, Micab and Hirna — are taxi-hailing TNCs which already have the P2-per-minute travel fee integrated into their fares following the recalibration of their meters, a process which started in July.  At present, all TNCs share the same fare components: a P40 base fare, a P10- to P14-per-kilometer rate, a price surge of up to two times the regular rate, and the now-authorized travel rate. The LTFRB memorandum also meant that Grab, which was earlier ordered to pay a fine of P10 million for unilaterally imposing the P2-per-minute travel fee, could now reinstate it. Drivers complain Grab drivers earlier complained that since the suspension of the travel charge in April, their income had dropped considerably due to rising fuel prices. The memorandum was issued on the same day the board reversed a July 9 order directing Grab to reimburse passengers who were charged the travel fee through rebates for future rides.  However, the LTFRB stood firm on the P10-million fine it imposed on the company. In reaction, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said the TNC would file an appeal in connection with the stiff penalty, this time in the Department of Transportation. The board’s decision authorizing the travel rate partly stemmed from calls made by House transportation committee chair and Catanduanes Rep. Cesar Sarmiento, Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon and Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo on behalf of the drivers. For TNVS coalition head Winson Esteras, having the fee approved was just the first step in keeping drivers’ incomes sustainable amid fuel price increases and rising inflation."},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/16432/netizen-ride-hailing-app-vs-the-lowly-jeepney-ride","title":"Netizen: Ride-hailing app vs the lowly jeepney ride","date":"12/18/2019","snippet":"","body":"VIRAL ngayon ang rant ni Angelo Ray with a Twitter handle of @artsybeaver as he compares the whopping fare difference between commuting using a ride hailing app and via jeepney.

Under the new safety measures that Grab will impose once it resumes its operations, drivers must disinfect their vehicles after every trip, while payment for each trip will only be cashless.  These initiatives, Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said, put an “added cost for the drivers.” Grab proposed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to a P5 per-trip fee to passengers “to help cover sanitation measures for the drivers.”  “We made a proposal to raise the per-trip cost by a fixed amount to help cover these. However, there’s no decision out yet,” Cu told reporters in an online media forum on Thursday. “I believe it is around P5 per trip that will help cover sanitation measures for the drivers,” Cu added.  While there is no decision yet on their proposal, additional costs are mainly shouldered by the drivers and the firm itself, Cu pointed out, and there will be no adjustments to the rates. The firm assured the fees will go directly to drivers. Grab said it will still abide by the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for transport network vehicle services (TNVS). “So far, there is no adjustment in the fare. We will be following the standard fare matrix of the LTFRB. We haven’t made any requests to the LTFRB to raise rates,” Cu said. The ride-hailing firm will also lower its surge cap than that mandated by the LTFRB.  Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. Under the lockdown, mass public transport, including TNVS services, were suspended. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

The Journal said details of Uber’s initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May.   The IPO comes after a mixed response to the market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber.  Lyft shares rose on the first day of trading and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were trading down more than 10 percent from the $72 offering price.

These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report. Uber released financial data earlier this year showing it lost $865 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier.

This is to allow other operators to participate in the pilot run, the DOTr said in a statement Tuesday.  Last June, a six-month pilot run was approved in aid of legislation for Congress to further evaluate pending bills seeking to legalize the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles (PUVs). The pilot run was originally set to end on Dec. 26. The extension, however, will be an “expansion of the study” by allowing new motorcycle taxi service providers to participate in the pilot run to give the riding public more choices and push operators to provide a “higher standard of service,” TWG chairperson Antonio Gardiola Jr. said.  Last Nov. 20, the DOTr heard proposals from six other motorcycle-ride hailing firms, namely Citimuber, JoyRide, MoveIt, EsetGo, Sakay, and VroomGo. All were keen on participating in the pilot run. The extension of the pilot run will also provide the TWG more time to widen the scope of their study on appropriate standards and capacities for motorcycles to be considered safe, convenient, and eligible for franchise.  “We want to determine their operational readiness and compliance”, Gardiola said. “We also want to determine whether or not motorcycles are really a safe and viable form of public transportation. That is always our priority — the safety, security, and comfort of the riding public,” he added. The TWG has already submitted its recommendation, and a decision on the proposed extension is due for release in the coming days. The TWG was created to primarily gather data and determine the viability of motorcycles as a safe mode of public transportation. It is composed of representatives from the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office (LTO), and the Inter-Agency Council for Traffic (I-ACT).  Commuter group asks DOTr to publicize Angkas pilot run findings The commuter group The Passenger Forum (TPF) has appealed to the DOTr to reveal to the public its findings on Angkas’ six-month pilot run to let the public know the “exact data on the safety, viability, and the effects on road traffic of motorcycle taxis.” “We are hoping that they will not wait for us to write a Freedom of Information request before making the material public,” TPF Convenor Primo Morillo said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that their group also wants to find out Angkas’ compliance with the 60 kilometer-per-hour speed limit, the 10-work hour per day limit, accident insurance coverage and the company’s compliance with the fare matrix set by DOTr. Morillo said they will conduct a survey asking motorcycle taxi passengers about their experience during the Angkas pilot run."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283620/antitrust-body-fines-grab-p23m-orders-p5-m-refund-to-riders","title":"Antitrust body fines Grab P23M, orders P5-M refund to riders","date":"02:51 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments. “The PCC has imposed a total fine of P23.45 million on Grab for breaching its pricing commitments during the 1st to 3rd quarters of the initial undertaking,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan said Monday.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) started by pointing out that a year after Uber left, ride-hailing has remained uncompetitive, referring to Grab as the very dominant player in this service. A virtual monopoly leaves the riding public with no alternative. Competition, on the other hand, forces players to improve efficiency and lower prices. The near-monopoly position of Grab explains the numerous complaints on fare surges even beyond rush hours, canceled bookings and other aggravations that riders have to endure since no alternative service exists.  At about the same time as the PCC announcement, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta) called out the the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for sitting on the applications of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. The next day, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade directed the LTFRB to approve all complete but pending applications of these ride-hailing drivers. The Department of Transportation ordered the LTFRB to immediately release certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to qualified ride-hailing driver-applicants. Tugade also directed Transportation Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon and the LTFRB to comply immediately with Arta’s directive to automatically approve all pending TNVS applications and issue them the corresponding CPCs.  Arta’s action followed complaints from TNVS drivers alleging irregularities in the processing of their TNVS applications by the LTFRB. According to the complaints, their applications already had the complete requirements, but they could not operate as drivers and operators while waiting for the issuance of the CPCs. Aside from these developments, the PCC announced that it would also renegotiate the conditions that Grab had previously agreed to when it sought the PCC’s approval of the Grab-Uber deal, which resulted in the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia.  Those conditions, called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hope that they would improve market conditions, particularly the maintenance of reasonable fares that existed when Uber was still around. But those hoped-for improvements have not materialized. Exactly a year after PCC’s decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority lamented that the dominance of Grab (the surviving firm in the agreement with Uber) remains unchallenged, and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market. It said the market continues to be uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of smaller transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. The PCC gave only a hint of what the new commitments would be, saying they would include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its fare surges, instances of driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. The commitments should be designed to prevent Grab from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, according to PCC Chair Arsenio M.Balisacan. They may also include measures that will allow smaller players to grow, or for formidable new competitors to enter the market for the benefit of the riding public. Last year, PCC officials warned that Grab’s failure to comply with the commitments would be met with a fine of P2 million per breach, or even the “unwinding of the transaction.” It’s really a puzzle why the LTFRB appears to be acting in a way that commuters feel is against their interest, with the regulatory agency throwing up all possible roadblocks to the approval of more ride-hailing companies that can compete with Grab, or more driver-applicants to increase supply and bring rates down. It’s a good thing the PCC and Arta are keeping an eye on such government agencies that, by their continuing failure to protect commuters and do their job with dispatch, openness and efficiency, are a huge disservice to the public."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/953019/owto-tncs-ltfrb","title":"LTFRB warns new ride-hailing app OWTO to get accredited before launch","date":"05:40 PM December 16, 2017","snippet":"Upcoming ride-hailing app OWTO is reportedly set to hold a press conference next week for its launch, but the government has warned the firm not to push through or it would be dealt with accordingly.","body":"Upcoming ride-hailing app OWTO is reportedly set to hold a press conference next week for its launch, but the government has warned the firm not to push through or it would be dealt with accordingly.

The new TNC was reported to have scheduled a press conference on Dec. 18 at Amo Gastropub on Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City. Lizada said the firm should postpone the conference. “To the organizers of OWTO, it is best that you coordinate with the LTFRB before you do any press conference, before you do any packaging, before you do any marketing, because you need to know the basic requirements the law requires,” Lizada said. In a Facebook page post on Dec. 5, OWTO branded itself as a TNC that would give riders “reasonable value-for-money fares.” “It also empowers the driving partners with equitable take-home pays through the company’s lower commission take-out schemes.

The firm added that it would commit and comply with the government’s rules and regulations for the “greater good of the public.”  “Christmas time is fast approaching. Guess who’s coming to town?

De Guzman is in critical condition after an accident in a Grab ride, causing him to sustain “severe traumatic brain injury.” A viral Facebook post from Marko’s cousin, Steffi de Guzman, said Marko and his friend, Alia booked a Grab car last Oct. 26 along Taft Avenue, Manila. She said the Grab ride was allegedly running too fast and was driven by a sleepy Grab driver.  She then said the Grab car collided into another car before crashing into a Light Rail Transit (LRT) post. Marko, then sustained a fractured skull after the incident. With the incident, Grab said they are constantly communicating and offering financial assistance to Marko’s family. An investigation was also launched as both drivers affected were facing “court arraignment.” READ: Grab says it is ‘continuously reaching out’ to support critically hurt rider ‘System downtime’ The ride-hailing company also faced technical issues such as the recent glitch on its computation of fares.

Grab denied the allegation, saying the message was not endorsed by its company. Grab Country Head Brian Cu said: “No that’s false. The message is not endorsed by Grab, it was probably crafted by a partner driver and shared among other drivers.” READ: Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila ‘Unjustified booking cancellations’ Last April, Grab Philippines punished nearly 500 drivers after an internal investigation on complaints that drivers inexcusably cancel passengers’ ride bookings. Grab said only 5 percent cancellation rate was allowed. But for those with 10 percent and above cancellation rate per week may subject to penalties such as suspension and removal from Grab. /jpv READ: Grab punishes almost 500 drivers over unjustified booking cancellations"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1294473/angkas-offers-use-of-plastic-dividers-to-prompt-revival-of-motorcycle-taxi-operations","title":"Angkas offers use of plastic dividers to prompt revival of motorcycle taxi operations","date":"08:26 PM June 19, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service app Angkas on Friday proposed the use of plastic shields between its riders and passengers in a bid to convince authorities to allow the resumption of motorcycle taxi operations.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service app Angkas on Friday proposed the use of plastic shields between its riders and passengers in a bid to convince authorities to allow the resumption of motorcycle taxi operations. In an online press briefing, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said that aside from the plastic dividers, they are also proposing to make motorcycle taxis “much like a shuttle service with pre-registered passengers for select companies.”  All these offers and more were submitted by Angkas to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), he added. According to Royeca, allowing Angkas to be a shuttle service for select companies will ensure contact tracing for those who might later test positive for SARS-COV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  “To date, Angkas has a base of four million users that can help add to the government’s contact tracing database,” the Angkas official said. Also, Royeca said Angkas proposed that passengers must provide their own helmet and face mask to limit contact between the rider and passenger.  Royeca further said all of their bikers will be subjected to COVID-19 testing. “We hope to work with the IATF and the Department of Health (DOH) to monitor the results and eventually recommend guidelines that can be adopted by both private motorcycles and motorcycle taxis alike. If the design is approved by the government and the medical experts, we commit to make the final shield design mold for free to the public,” Royeca expressed. Operations of motorcycle taxis have been suspended since mid-March following the imposition of the Luzon-wide quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque revealed that the government is assessing whether or not motorcycle taxis may resume operations as quarantine measures were gradually relaxed this month. To minimize the impact of the public health crisis to its riders, Angkas shifted to delivery services while community quarantines are in place."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1191498/grab-to-refund-riders-in-overcharging-cases","title":"Grab to refund riders in overcharging cases","date":"04:56 AM November 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines will refund its cut to its riders whenever it overcharges, as part of the new conditions imposed by the competition watchdog in an effort to hit the ride-hailing giant where it hurts most.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Grab Philippines will refund its cut to its riders whenever it overcharges, as part of the new conditions imposed by the competition watchdog in an effort to hit the ride-hailing giant where it hurts most. It would take some time, however, before customers get any compensation under what is called the “disgorgement mechanism,” the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said in a press briefing on Monday.  Essentially a state-mandated refund, the disgorgement will have a lag time of about two months after the PCC issues its order, assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration. Grab riders will see the overcharges refunded in their GrabPay accounts.  Investopedia defines disgorgement as an act of repayment for an ill-gotten gain, but this jargon can barely capture how many riders feel whenever faced by the daily dilemma of choosing either Grab’s unreasonably high prices or the poorly managed and outdated modes of public transportation. “That’s the concept of the disgorgement. It is something that is not due you but you obtained, and it is really because you are exercising market power,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  The PCC ruled on the refund of overcharges more than a year after Grab bought out Uber in Southeast Asia. Uber, however, is a minority shareholder in Grab. “So if you were not dominant, if you were not a monopoly, you should not have been able to impose this kind of excessive fare,” Bernabe added. The disgorgement forms part of a revised set of government conditions that the PCC had to renegotiate with Grab starting August, after the company’s operations remained problematic despite PCC’s earlier efforts to curb its anticompetitive behavior. August also marked the first year of Grab’s voluntary commitments to the PCC, in which the company’s operations were monitored for four consecutive quarters. Only the results of the monitoring for the first nine months were released so far, and the PCC said it fined Grab a total of P23.45 million for essentially overcharging its riders during this time.  But a little more than P5 million of this amount would be refunded to Grab riders, since the conditions imposed on the company were revised late into the monitoring period. Assuming Grab will not file a motion for reconsideration, customers can use their refunds sometime in January next year, since the order was only issued this November. But the money will only be paid back as fast as Grab is willing to cooperate. So far, Grab Philippines has filed motions to reconsider the fines in the first six months of supervision, although the antitrust body has upheld the fines. Asked for comment, the company said it would now pay accordingly for the penalties imposed by the PCC so far. This means payment of P11.3 million in fine for Aug. 10, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018, and P7.1 million for Nov. 11, 2018, to Feb. 10, 2019; and P5.05 million in refund for Feb. 11 to May 10. Results of the fourth quarter monitoring—covering May 11 to August—have yet to be released. The fines declined over the months that the PCC monitored Grab, suggesting a disconnect between its compliance with the antitrust body and the improvement many riders hardly felt. A violation could lead to a fine of up to P2 million per breach, a separate fine from the refund that Grab should give back to its customers, the PCC said. The revised commitments for pricing will extend for one more year starting this month. Other conditions, such as those allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing apps, will be extended for four years. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); All this is in an effort to enable a viable player to enter the market and compete with Grab. There are other players in the market, but PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan has noted that Grab Philippines still controls “almost 99 percent” of the market. According to Bernabe, the PCC needs to give new companies more time to grow, since the entry of a big player does not necessarily mean a big enough competitor. Gojek, for example, has gained only 15 percent of the market in Singapore within a year, despite pouring a lot of resources into the market, Bernabe said. The company is trying to enter the Philippines but has been set back by government regulations. “We have observed that the competition in the marketplace has not really improved. And we don’t know if this will improve within a one-year period because the competition will depend on new entrants coming in or existing players growing bigger,” Bernabe said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/269418/uber-looks-to-raise-up-to-9b-in-initial-public-offering","title":"Uber looks to raise up to $9B in initial public offering","date":"06:34 PM April 28, 2019","snippet":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts.","body":"NEW YORK — Ride-hailing giant Uber is aiming to raise $9 billion in its mammoth initial public stock offering that, while smaller than initially expected, still dwarfs most stock market debuts. The San Francisco-based company expects to be valued at $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion, falling well below prior estimates that rose as high as $120 billion, in a sign that investors may be taking a more cautious approach to ride-hailing after the stock performance of Uber’s rival, Lyft.  Even so, Uber is on track for one of the largest IPOs in history. The company plans to sell 180 million shares for between $44 and $50 each. Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/25736/lyft-ipo-sets-rollout-for-ride-hailing-sharing-economy","title":"Lyft IPO Sets Rollout for Ride-Hailing, Sharing Economy","date":"04:34 AM March 30, 2019","snippet":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share.","body":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share. Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest.  Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/988698/grab-passengers-face-fine","title":"Grab passengers face fine","date":"07:24 AM May 09, 2018","snippet":"Amid mounting complaints by commuters against drivers, and vice versa, ride-hailing giant Grab said on Tuesday it might impose charges on passengers who would cancel their bookings, in the same way that Uber had.","body":"Amid mounting complaints by commuters against drivers, and vice versa, ride-hailing giant Grab said on Tuesday it might impose charges on passengers who would cancel their bookings, in the same way that Uber had. Cindy Toh, Grab marketing head, said the company might start charging the cancellation fees before July as part of its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and rider experience after acquiring Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  Toh said the company was keen on protecting not just its riders but also its driver-partners. “Of course when passengers cancel, the driver you book is already en route to your location. They spend money on that; that’s time away from their business,” she said.  Uber charge Uber used to impose charges based on how far the driver had already traveled before the trip’s cancellation, or when a rider cancels more than one ride within a short period of time.  Despite public impression that drivers are more likely to cancel bookings, figures from Grab show that drivers back off their commitments only 8 percent of the time, compared with 12 percent by passengers, according to Toh. She said the company had yet to set the amounts to be charged, as it was still studying various schemes, adding that it would only impose fees “within the limits” of the waiting time—the time a passenger’s ride is supposed to show up at the pickup point. Standard waiting time Grab currently does not impose any penalty on passengers who cancel bookings within the standard waiting time of seven minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare. Passengers who cancel three bookings after the waiting period get “deprioritized,” which means they should expect to be served later than others in their succeeding bookings.  Grab currently allows its drivers to cancel 5 percent of their trips. Those who cancel more than 10 percent may face sanctions such as suspension or blacklisting from the platform, Grab public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said. Some patrons of the ride-hailing service expressed concern that some drivers might exploit the cancellation fees. Twenty-two-year-old Julian Elona, who uses Grab often to get from Manila to Eastwood, Quezon City, said the ride-hailing company needed to first protect passengers from abusive drivers before implementing such a scheme. “It might get to a point that if the driver and passenger disagree [on their arrangement], the driver might hold out on the rider who would then be forced to cancel and pay the fee,” Elona said. “What if you’re faced with picky drivers who force you to cancel, or if you’re rushing and have no choice but to cancel your booking? It might be unfair for the passengers,” said Jazzmin Carilla, a 21-year-old public relations writer and frequent Grab user. Commuters’ group The commuter welfare group, National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection (NCCSP), said it recognized that drivers, too, had rights against passengers who frequently canceled their trips. “However, [Grab] should first set guidelines on when it is acceptable to cancel a ride. Why should you be penalized if the driver cannot immediately fulfill your riding requirements?” said NCCSP head Maricor Akol. “There must be a standard time allotment wherein passengers are allowed to cancel … [but] at the same time, [Grab] has to come out with a comprehensive plan to issue penalties so the riding public cannot renege on their bookings,” Akol added. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Of the five other transport network companies (TNCs)—Owto, Micab, Hirna, GoLag and Hype—only Owto charges a cancellation fee, which amounts to P50. Grab, Hype, GoLag, Owto and Micab were recently allowed to operate in Metro Manila and other large urban areas, while Hirna is available in Pampanga province and the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Iligan, Davao and Iligan. Go Jek An Indonesian TNC, Go Jek, has also expressed interest in challenging Grab’s domination in the Philippines. Aileen Lizada, board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, noted that Go Jek had been used to charging unregulated surge rates of up to five times in Indonesia. “I told them that here, up to times two only. I asked them if they could survive. They said they need to study [Philippine regulations],” Lizada said. “Go Jek is big, so we need to study [their application] well as we need to protect the local players,” she added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1111756/grab-imposing-p50-fine-for-cancelled-bookings-no-shows","title":"Grab imposing P50 fine for cancelled bookings, no-shows…","date":"03:53 PM April 29, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Passengers of ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines who will cancel after five minutes of a confirmed booking or those who do not show at their pick-up points after five minutes will be fined P50.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Passengers of ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines who will cancel after five minutes of a confirmed booking or those who do not show at their pick-up points after five minutes will be fined P50. “Grab is mindful that cancellations are frustrating for both the passengers and our drivers. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement.   Grab Philippines on Monday said its new policy is aimed at reducing unreasonable cancellations for drivers and passengers.  “Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” he added. Grab said the cancellation fees incurred will go directly to the driver to compensate them for fuel and effort they have spent travelling to the location of the passenger.  The cancellation fee and no-show fees, however, will not be applied to passengers if the ride is cancelled within five minutes of getting an assigned a driver, if the driver is not moving towards the pick-up point, if the driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival, and if the driver indicates that he has arrived when he or she has not. The ride-hailing company said it is willing to refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours. The updated policy is effective on Monday, April 29, but Grab said is doing a staggered toll out to both passengers and drivers, which will be completed by the end of May. Among the other policies the ride-hailing company put in place to further discourage cancellations include: For drivers:  For passengers: Meanwhile, passenger’s accounts could be suspended for 24 hours should they cancel a ride twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations in a week, Grab said. Drivers will also be penalized or locked out of the platform if they excessively ignore or cancel passenger bookings without proper reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab said it has notified the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) about its new cancellation policy.  /gsg"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1415811/qcpd-nabs-grab-car-driver-cohort-for-robbing-killing-passenger","title":"QCPD nabs Grab car driver, cohort for robbing, killing passenger","date":"11:43 AM April 07, 2021","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Police authorities arrested recently a Grab car driver and his accomplice for allegedly robbing and killing a lady passenger in Quezon City earlier this month.  The victim, Carla Antasuda, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in Quezon City on April 2, Police Major Elmer Monsalve of Quezon City Police District Crime and Detection Unit said over Teleradyo. Reports said Antasuda booked a ride through the ride-hailing app Grab past 11 p.m. at UP Techno Hub on April 1, to bring her home in Pasig City. She was able to book a Toyota Innova with plate number NDA-3563, driven by the suspect John Lester Alhambra.  The vehicle that arrived to pick her up, however, was a Mitsubishi Montero but with the same driver indicated on the app. Antasuda got inside the vehicle anyway, without knowing that another person, identified as Bryan Kennet Yumol, was hiding at the back.  The suspects later declared a holdup, but the victim resisted. She was stabbed several times and her body was thrown in a vacant lot in Barangay Sauyo, Novaliches, Quezon City. The victim’s remains were found at noon the next day. The two suspects were arrested later at night at the Sauyo Flea Market. Monsalve said that the Grab app was secure but some people find ways to take advantage. “Napaka-secure niyan. Kaya lang wala naman system na perfect. Nasa tao pa rin ang problema hindi sa platform. Ang problema mismo yung driver,” he said. (The app is secure, but no system is perfect. The problem is with the people, not the platform. The problem is with the driver.)  The police official suggested the riders to share their location to their family and friends through the Grab-tracking locator for their own safety.

If the average commuter leaves home before 5 a.m. to get to work on time and makes the trip home past 10 p.m. to avoid the so-called rush hour, what’s left? Grab seems to be doing its best. It has to, under this much scrutiny. It’s policing the drivers made social-media-famous for overcharging or the all-too-common and obnoxious practice of leaving would-be riders hanging without canceling the rides they booked. But it’s a numbers game, according to Grab Philippines head Brian Cu, with 600,000 ride demands daily and only 35,000 drivers to satisfy them. And the passengers are always on the losing end—it’s either they can’t book a ride, or they overspend when they do.  It’s not an entirely hopeless situation. We may have said goodbye to Uber—which is sorely missed and generally considered to be the lesser of evils when it came to ride-hailing apps—but as of today the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has approved operations for a total of five of these companies, with the goal of challenging the monopoly that Grab has on the market. But we can’t fail to notice that in doing so, the government is expecting these companies to relieve the burden on the Filipino commuter, a band-aid solution if there ever was one, because we don’t necessarily take cabs for the sake of blowing money on a solo ride. It’s most often because the lines and the general inconvenience of public transport are a huge deterrent. Bridges and bypass roads under the “Build, build, build” project are expected to improve the situation, with the Department of Public Works and Highways claiming to foresee a “drastic improvement” in road traffic conditions by 2020. There are also reports that traffic has improved slightly on Edsa in the last month. But it seems that even with better traffic, we still can’t help our commuters find an immediate way to go from point to point without them enduring the Hunger Games for flagging down rides or getting on jeeps or buses. A recent example: A road incident last Monday was enough to cause hours of traffic, with commuters forced to walk kilometers to get home.  Maybe more trains, better trains, or new trains in other areas are the solution, but these aren’t going to happen in the next six months, so in the meantime there’s an unreasonable drain on commuters’ time, productivity and income, as well as a real and unavoidable cause of unhappiness. And those who opt to buy cars to avoid commuting—described by many Filipinos as the “worst part” of their day—are not helping, but just contributing to Metro Manila’s “carmageddon.” App-based transport services themselves add to the traffic, with up to 15,000 cars added on the road per day. It’s a vicious cycle, and not one to be improved by infrastructure alone, or by regulating ride-hailing apps which are privately owned and whose prices aren’t subject to strict regulation. It’s time to stop blaming Grab and other private companies for what should be a government responsibility.  kchuarivera@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1203038/ltfrb-overcharging-tncs-face-sanctions","title":"LTFRB: Overcharging TNCs face sanctions","date":"05:12 AM December 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Don’t abuse your discretion in charging fares this holiday season or there will be sanctions, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) warned transport network companies (TNCs) on Wednesday, marking the second time in a week that it cautioned ride-hailing services amid reports of price gouging.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Don’t abuse your discretion in charging fares this holiday season or there will be sanctions, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) warned transport network companies (TNCs) on Wednesday, marking the second time in a week that it cautioned ride-hailing services amid reports of price gouging. According to LTFRB chair Martin Delgra, the transport board continues to receive “mounting complaints” not only on overcharging, but also on the insufficient number of drivers on the road to cater to the swell of passengers during the holiday season.  He noted in a statement that the LTFRB had issued around 49,000 provisional authorities and 11,000 certificates of public conveniences (CPCs) to transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers, all under nine competing ride-hailing platforms, including Grab. In theory, this meant that there should be 60,000 drivers on the road to accommodate the riding public. The current cap for TNVS drivers is at 65,000.  Grab, which according to the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has cornered 99 percent of the country’s ride-hailing market, currently has 36,000 drivers on its platform. But while the TNC  assured the public that these drivers were all active, the number was staggeringly disproportional to the 700,000 to 800,000 bookings made daily. “The question here is why are there only a few units on the road?” Delgra asked. “The TNCs have to clarify this to us and to the riding public.”  “Do not abuse the clamor for TNVS this holiday season because we will not hesitate to revoke your franchise should you continue to violate its terms,” he added. Delgra also reminded the TNCs that they must follow the fare structure guidelines set by the LTFRB, warning that the board was continuously reviewing and monitoring their fare setting computation to determine any violation. Grab was penalized earlier by the PCC for supposedly charging beyond the acceptable fare range.

Thousands of Uber partner-drivers are in the process of transition following Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, effectively monopolizing the TNVS sector in the country. Drivers are trying to finish their transfer before April 8, the day Uber application goes offline.  Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said the merger would result in the migration of some 20,000 to 24,000 drivers from Uber. READ: Uber will accept bookings only until April 8, after which it merges with Grab Lizada said the LTFRB now issues a generic franchise to drivers and operators to allow them to become affiliates of other TNVS platforms. Currently, the LTFRB is trying to fill up the common base supply of 65,000, which represents 75 percent of all ride-hailing app’s bookings, the official said. Lizada said that Uber drivers can go to the LTFRB if they would like to check if their names are already in the master list. They should bring the following requirements: the verified application, proof of Filipino citizenship, any government ID, OR/CR, and the operator’s data sheet. /je"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1206091/grab-to-start-refunding-overcharged-riders-starting-dec-31","title":"Grab to start refunding ‘overcharged’ passengers on Dec. 31","date":"01:10 PM December 26, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting December 31, 2019, ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines will start reimbursing passengers who were overcharged on certain periods this year.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Starting December 31, 2019, ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines will start reimbursing passengers who were overcharged on certain periods this year.

Less 18 percent The 8,000 “colorum” drivers account for nearly 18 percent of its current active drivers (45,000) who stand to lose their source of livelihood.  Grab president Brian Cu admitted that the massive slash in the TNC’s number of available vehicles was a “painful step” for both drivers and commuters. “We would like to avoid this from happening, but we are bound to comply with our regulator,” he said.  Cu expressed hope, however that the 8,000 drivers would take advantage of the 10,000 new slots for transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers that would become available on June 10. The issue of colorum vehicles was a carryover problem due to Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber’s Southeast Asian operations in April 2017.

The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand.

Under the Free Motorcycle Ride Project for Medical Frontliners program of the ride-hailing service, the 1,000 Angkas riders who will provide free rides to health workers will be assigned near the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, and Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Based on an agreement between the Joint Task Force COVID Shield and Angkas, some Angkas riders will also be on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, and in Ospital ng Maynila and Fabella Hospital in Manila.  Task Force Commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said Friday that medical workers on their way home may approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of a free ride. Aside from this initiative, Angkas also turned over 1,000 protective barriers to the task force, which will help facilitate the distribution of the materials to qualified riders.  Eleazar said the barriers will be forwarded to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified recipients. He said motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives, and friends who work as medical frontliners will be prioritized in the distribution. According to Eleazar, this initiative from Angkas is “a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic.” “We in the JTF COVID Shield believe that there are a lot of people out there who continue to extend assistance to their troubled kababayans as revealed by the countless good deeds that we regularly see in the social media since the entire country was placed in community quarantine,” he said. The government has earlier allowed motorcycle pillion riding for essential workers or authorized persons outside of residence under MECQ, provided that they install protective barriers in the motorcycles and follow minimum health protocols. The motorcycle that should be used should also be privately-owned and not for hire. Previously, only married couples and live-in partners were allowed for motorcycle pillion riding, a limitation set in place to help prevent the further spread of the coronavirus disease.

In a statement, PCC said it ordered both ride-hailing firms to keep separate and independent operations until the antitrust body wraps up its review of the acquisition.  PCC had issued a set of interim measures to preserve the same business conditions prior to the deal. This means riders and drivers should still be able to choose Uber as an alternative to Grab for the time being. The order echoes a similar move made by PCC’s counterpart in Singapore, which ordered Uber to continue operating the app for another week, or until April 15, due to similar anti-competitive concerns.  Feasibility Uber’s compliance to the order in Singapore “indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said.  This comes despite claims made by Uber officials that the company has officially left the market, leaving no one behind to man the app. The antitrust body, however, did not buy this explanation. Since Uber acquired a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s regional business as part of the takeover deal, it is not true that Uber has indeed left the country, Balisacan said. “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he said. Integration “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he added.  Last month, Grab announced it would acquire Uber in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. The deal has also put other competition authorities in the region on their toes. In the Philippines, PCC previously said the acquisition would result to Grab controlling around 80 percent of the ride hailing market in the country. This is a concern especially since Grab has been known for its relatively higher rider fees and how it discriminates against rider destinations. PCC officials raised these concerns during a public hearing with Grab and Uber representatives on April 5. Penalties Should Grab and Uber fail to comply in five working days, they would have to “show cause” within 24 hours after the end of the five-day period, according to an excerpt of the interim measures. The parties should then explain “why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” PCC did not list the possible penalties. However, according to the Philippine Competition Act, erring parties would have to pay P50,000 to P2 million for each violation. Moreover, they would have to eventually pay a similar amount for each day they did the violations until the parties fully comply with the order. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The duration of the review depends on the cooperation of the companies, Balisacan said in a previous interview. Under current rules, the review could end in a matter of weeks, or even extend up to six months. Not business as usual Representatives from Uber and Grab are yet to comment on the matter. However, during the public hearing on April 5, officials and lawyers from both companies wanted business to go as planned, noting that some of PCC’s concerns were unwarranted. Uber’s next move is yet to be seen. But according to Brooks Entwistle, Uber chief business officer for Asia Pacific, the company, which has been losing money in Southeast Asia, does not intend to return to the market. Falling apart “Our people are gone. Our funding is gone. Our marketplace is falling apart by every day as we transition [to Grab],” he said during the public hearing. In the same hearing, Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said the acquisition involves driver contracts as well as other data that drivers consented to give. The deal does not include the integration of both Grab and Uber systems, she said, therefore concerns such as Grab’s access to Uber’s pricing mechanisms were unnecessary. “We think, that if it means the commission is going to compel to reverse that business decision, we think that is a burdensome and disproportionate response to what is a valid management protocol,” she said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1138334/cebu-drivers-wont-join-metro-manila-tvns-strike","title":"Cebu drivers won’t join Metro Manila TVNS strike","date":"07:10 PM July 05, 2019","snippet":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8).","body":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8).

Informed of the Cebu drivers’ appeal, Delgra said he has yet to receive a formal request.  “If there is a problem, let us talk,” Delgra said. “Let us not inconvenience the public by staging a transport holiday which is similar to a transport strike,” said Delgra, who is in Cebu for the launch of a government driver scholarship program.

Grab’s surge pricing during the morning rush hour on Monday shocked a number of commuters, who were forced to look for other means of transportation just to get to work.  One of them was Joyce Yu who opted to take the bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip that usually costs her up to P250 only. Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares, which range from P300 to P600. A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set back riders by almost P300, when hours earlier the same trip only cost around P150.  Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times, while the government processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. Grab government communications manager Fiona Nicolas said that while they have already implemented the new surge rate that the LTFRB imposed, fares may remain high in in the interim because of the limited number of drivers that are currently in their system.  “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its former rival’s Southeast Asian operations. This was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive to Uber to cease its operations as a TNC, despite an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue to serve the public for the duration of the motu propio review on the deal. To protect the public from Grab’s exorbitant fares, the National Center for Commuters Safety and Protection called on the LTFRB to expedite its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto to provide the riding public an alternative.  “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” the group’s head Maricor Akol said. Meanwhile, the LTFRB called on the public to report to them picky Grab drivers as well as those who force them to cancel their bookings.

Grace Poe has every reason to suspect the actions of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against ride-hailing service providers such as Uber and Grab.","body":"Sen. Grace Poe has every reason to suspect the actions of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against ride-hailing service providers such as Uber and Grab. The LTFRB seems bent on making it difficult for this modern-day transport service to prosper in the country. And it’s difficult to fathom why.  It all started with the unusual delay in the LTFRB’s crafting of the implementing rules and regulations to govern the internet-era public transport service starting two years ago. And while it was taking its sweet time to come up with the rules, it ordered a freeze on the approval of franchises for the so-called transport network vehicle services (TNVS) firms.  The result: tens of thousands of prospective Uber and Grab drivers failing to get the necessary permits and, in turn, less available vehicles for the commuting public. Worse, Uber and Grab were penalized with monetary fines and threats of cancellation of their permits for accepting in their networks drivers without the LTFRB franchises, the approvals of which the agency itself had frozen.  Enter 2018 and the LTFRB is training its sights on constricting TNVS firms again. First, it wanted to ban small or compact cars from being accredited by ride-hailing companies, even if these are brand-new units. Yet, at the same time, it allows dilapidated or ill-maintained taxicabs to ply the streets of the metropolis. Poe had earlier questioned the logic behind the LTFRB plan. She argued that while safety is a paramount concern in any mode of public transportation, the fact that many hatchback or compact cars have been allowed to operate as TNVS for the past two years without incident, then the LTFRB should consider the livelihood of those to be affected by its plan. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada had been quoted as saying that the agency was planning to ban and remove the accreditation of small, compact cars or non-2,000-cc-rated vehicles for Uber and Grab, citing passenger safety. If this policy is ever implemented, then it should apply to taxicabs, of which nearly all units fall below the 2,000-cc engine rating.  Besides, Poe noted, if such small vehicles were safe for personal use and to carry family members, how are they not safe to ferry passengers? Last Monday, the senator had to again call the attention of the LTFRB for yet another move against ride-hailing service providers. The agency now wants to limit the number of cars for the entire TNVS sector to 45,000 units in the metropolis, or less than half the number currently operating in Metro Manila. The LTFRB also plans to cap the number of TNVS cars to 500 in Metro Cebu and 200 in Pampanga. The agency recently issued Memorandum Circular 2018-003, which sets a “common supply base” for TNVS providers. All ride-hailing companies will share this pool, without exceeding it. This sounds silly because there are about 100,000 TNVS vehicles operating under Uber and Grab — a number that is not sufficient to satisfy the current demand of the commuting public — and the LTFRB should start with this as the base and adjust accordingly using scientific analysis. Indeed, the LTFRB has to disclose the formula it uses to come up with those numbers. What supply-and-demand assumptions did it consider? It should make public the minutes of any consultation meetings it had to come up with those figures. Poe put it aptly: “Some formula would have been used because these figures, which are important to the riding public, cannot and should not be plucked out of thin air.” Besides, the disclosure of this important issue is what the rules on freedom of information require in the interest of transparency. If the LTFRB wants to impose such stringent measures on ride-hailing firms, fairness dictates that it should also impose the same safety standards on all kinds of public utility vehicles — taxis, jeepneys and buses.

This means the LTFRB cannot apprehend “colorum” Grab and Uber drivers yet even after July 26 while the LTFRB has no decision on the transport network companies (TNCs) appeal, both Senators Grace Poe and Jose Victor “JV” Ejercito assured on Wednesday.  “This will prolong (Grab and Uber operations). The LTFRB said they will not execute the ban while there is a motion for reconsideration from the companies,” Ejercito told reporters. Poe and Ejercito, leaders of the Senate committee on public services, met with representatives from LTFRB and those from the TNCs.  Leo Gonzales, Grab’s public affairs department head, said Grab will file the appeal on Thursday. Until then, Grab drivers are free to operate until the motion is pending before the LTFRB.  “There’s nothing to worry about sa ating mga pasahero at riders. Tuloy tuloy muna hangga’t maayos ang issue pero hindi natin alam hanggang kailan ‘yan,” Gonzales said. The LTFRB has an existing order that it would begin apprehending “colorum” Grab and Uber drivers starting July 26. The regulatory board can impose fines of up to P20,000 and impound the vehicle of drivers with expired or no permits. In a statement after the meeting, Poe said both the LTFRB and ride-hailing firms will continue with the technical working group meeting “in order to find a win-win solution for both government and the TNCs.” “Let us allow the LTFRB to do its job. They have to regulate common carriers to ensure accountability and to prevent the “dynamic pricing scheme” of TNVS from overcharging passengers during peak hours. On the other hand, government must be forward-looking. Ride-hailing services is now a necessity because these provide the comfort and reliability that many of our people look for in public transportation,” Poe said. Poe also filed Senate Bill No. 1501 or Transportation Network Services Act seeking to institutionalize and regulate ride hailing services. JE"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/250125/taxi-hailing-app-5th-tnc-get-ltfrbs-ok","title":"Taxi-hailing app is 5th TNC to get LTFRB’s OK","date":"05:02 AM May 02, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Monday approved the accreditation of another taxi-hailing app, making it the fifth transport network company (TNC) to challenge Grab’s monopoly in the country.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Monday approved the accreditation of another taxi-hailing app, making it the fifth transport network company (TNC) to challenge Grab’s monopoly in the country.

The five TNCs are expected to compete against ride-hailing giant Grab which has dominated the local market following its March buyout of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. Grab hit by complaints In the past weeks, however, Grab has been deluged by complaints from passengers, mostly about canceled bookings, prompting the TNC to sanction almost 500 drivers. The LTFRB also ordered Grab to stop collecting a P2 per minute travel charge which was implemented without first securing the transport board’s approval. Grab, however, said it would file a motion for reconsideration as it insisted that the charge was legal."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/259584/grab-to-appeal-pccs-p12m-penalty-over-merger-violations","title":"Grab to appeal PCC’s P12M penalty over merger violations","date":"04:59 PM October 26, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines is planning to file a motion to ask the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to reconsider its decision to slap the ride-hailing company a P12-million fine over the company’s merger violations.","body":"Grab Philippines is planning to file a motion to ask the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to reconsider its decision to slap the ride-hailing company a P12-million fine over the company’s merger violations. Earlier, the PCC, the country’s anti-trust body, penalized Grab with an P8 million fine for its failure to maintain the pre-merger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber, Grab’s acquired party, was also fined P4 million for the same set of violations.  READ: Gov’t fines Grab, Uber P16M for ‘causing undue difficulties’ on merger review In a statement on Friday, the ride-hailing firm said it disagrees with the PCC’s decision, saying they had completed the transaction and complied with the interim measures order.  “We respectfully disagree with PCC’s decision. Grab completed the transaction legally, and did not violate the interim measures order,” Grab legal counsel Miguel Aguila said in a statement on Friday. Grab also argued that its “price algorithm” has remained the same after the Land Transportation and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspended its time component in fares.   READ: LTFRB orders Grab to pay P10M for overcharging customers Aguila added that Grab’s price hike was affected by the “higher incidence of surge” which means there is a low supply of vehicles with high demand of passengers. “The supposed increase in price was affected by the higher incidence of surge, which was driven by the low supply of vehicles and high concentration of demand. Fare and surge rates remained within the LTFRB-approved range,” he said. Grab added that their promos and incentives were also maintained but instead used “ka-Grab” rewards program to address issues on the “imbalance between supply and demand.”  Meanwhile, Grab reiterated that their operations remains separate and that they neither managed Uber’s operations nor have violated PCC’s interim measures. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and driver data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” Aguila said.  /muf"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/290650/grabbike-prepares-to-deploy-15000-riders","title":"GrabBike prepares to deploy 15,000 riders","date":"04:06 AM February 17, 2020","snippet":"Grab Philippines wants to have 15,000 bike riders on the road under its motorcycle-taxi service, a move which will expand the reach of the ride hailing giant in congested urban cities.","body":"Grab Philippines wants to have 15,000 bike riders on the road under its motorcycle-taxi service, a move which will expand the reach of the ride hailing giant in congested urban cities. Grab Philippines is already preparing to revive GrabBike, a service the government had stopped nearly four years ago since there were no guidelines then. Lawmakers have yet to pass a bill that would legalize motorcycle-taxis, while regulators still needed to conclude a pilot test that would determine if motorbikes were safe for public transport.  But with perception over motorcycle-taxis changing over the last few years due to public outcry over unreliable mass transport and road bottlenecks, Grab said it was ready to provide solutions. “We’re getting ready on our end in case it opens up. We’re setting up our training facilities, the design of the jackets and materials that are needed, training the trainers, but we haven’t trained the drivers yet,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu.  Cu told reporters last week on the sidelines of the launch of GrabKitchen that the firm was willing to invest and train drivers, but they needed certainty on the fate of motorbikes. He said Grab intended to maximize the 15,000-rider cap set by the government. To do so, he said the firm would allow its current fleet of bikers, or the 20,000 GrabFood partners, to also use GrabBike.  Demand for GrabFood usually has a down time at certain points of the day, usually after lunch. The rider can then opt to switch to providing GrabBike services. Asked why the ride hailing giant would still venture into motorcycle-taxis, he said it was a “natural fit” for a firm operating in congested urban areas like Metro Manila. GrabBike is also present in other countries, such as Vietnam. If plans fall into place, the move will allow Grab Philippines to further expand its presence in the life of the commuting public, even at a time when the ride hailing giant has been flagged by regulators for alleged privacy and competition violations. For now, Cu does not consider motorcycle-taxis, such as Angkas or JoyRide, competitors of Grab’s four-wheeled ride hailing services. “I think it serves a different market. So if you’re saying we’re competing with Angkas, or JoyRide, or with motorcycle taxis, it’s as if you’re saying we’re competing with the UV express, with the jeeps, with the trains,” he said.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber’s ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10 and 15 percent after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticised Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248514/grab-uber-deal-create-monopoly","title":"Grab-Uber deal to create ‘monopoly’","date":"05:13 AM April 03, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/79400/photo-app-help-grab-drivers-make-pinpoint-pickups","title":"Photo app to help Grab drivers make pinpoint pickups","date":"08:43 AM September 18, 2018","snippet":"The Grab driver can’t find you?

To help its drivers find clients who booked its service, Grab launched a photo-sharing feature on its GrabChat app, which could also help clients avoid paying costly cancelation rates.  “Grab is introducing photo-sharing on GrabChat – the first regional ride-hailing app to do so! So if you are waiting for your ride at SM Megamall, or NAIA Terminal III Departure area, and not sure if your driver can find you – just snap a quick photo of where you’re standing and send it to your driver – all through GrabChat,” the ride-hailing company said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is important in a country like the Philippines where roads can be complex, and pick-up locations may not be as straightforward as ‘in front of the mall’. With these photos, we’ll be able to better understand which locations are confusing, why they are so, and how we can improve them,” it added.  According to Grab, the photos shared between the drivers and passengers would be removed once the trip is completed. Only Grab would have a copy of the images “for investigation purposes in the event of harassment reports.”  However, it noted that drivers should update the app in order to receive images from their passengers. “Passengers and drivers should make sure they have the latest versions of the Grab app. If either party is not on a version of the app that supports the feature, the ‘camera’ icon will not be visible and neither party will have access to this function,” Grab said. The photo-sharing feature of Grab is now available in the country. /cbb"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/99202/uber-loses-2-9-billion-offloads-bike-and-scooter-business","title":"Uber loses $2.9 billion, offloads bike and scooter business","date":"07:39 AM May 09, 2020","snippet":"NEW YORK — Uber lost $2.9 billion in the first quarter as its overseas investments were hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, but the company is looking to its growing food delivery business and aggressive cost-cutting to ease the pain.","body":"NEW YORK — Uber lost $2.9 billion in the first quarter as its overseas investments were hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, but the company is looking to its growing food delivery business and aggressive cost-cutting to ease the pain. The ride-hailing giant said Thursday it is offloading Jump, its bike and scooter business, to Lime, a company in which it is investing $85 million. Jump had been losing about $60 million a quarter.  “While our Rides business has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, we have taken quick action to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, focus additional resources on Uber Eats, and prepare us for any recovery scenario,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement. “Along with the surge in food delivery, we are encouraged by the early signs we are seeing in markets that are beginning to open back up.” On Wednesday, San Francisco-based Uber said it was cutting 3,700 full-time workers, or about 14% of its workforce, as people avoiding contagion either stay indoors or try to limit contact with others. Its main U.S. rival Lyft announced last month it would lay off 982 people, or 17% of its workforce because of plummeting demand. Careem, Uber’s subsidiary in the Middle East, cut its workforce by 31%.  Uber brought in $3.54 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 14% from the same time last year. Revenue in its Eats meal delivery business grew 53% as customers shuttered at home opted to order in. The company exited markets where its food delivery business was unprofitable, including the Czech Republic, Egypt and Honduras. But it added key accounts including Chipotle, Dunkin’ and Shake Shack, and it enabled delivery from grocery and convenience stores.  “At a time when our rides business is down significantly due to shelter-in-place, our Eats business is surging,” Khosrowshahi said on a conference call with investors. “The big opportunity we thought Eats was just got bigger.” Gross bookings grew 8% to $15.8 billion, with 54% growth in the food delivery business and a 3% decline in rides, on a constant currency basis. Uber’s bottom line was hurt in the first quarter when the value of its investments in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi, Singapore-based Grab and others plummeted by $2.1 billion as demand collapsed in those regions. The challenges are continuing in the second quarter. In April, rides were down 80% globally compared to last year, Khosrowshahi said. But rides have been increasing for the past three weeks and bookings in large cities across Georgia and Texas, two states that started re-opening, are up 43% and 50% respectively from their lowest points, he said. Demand for the Eats business grew 89% in April, excluding India, and “we’ve seen an enormous acceleration in demand since mid-March,” Khosrowshahi said.  Grocery delivery could be a part of Uber’s future in the U.S. “There’s going to be more room for more than one player,” Khosrowshahi said. “We’re in many of these cities already. So we just have the infrastructure to be able to get started in these cities … in a very low cost way.” Uber updated its driver app to make it easier for ride providers to pick up delivery work, and nearly 40% of drivers in the U.S. and Canada cross-dispatched to work for the Eats platform in April, the company said. But getting into grocery delivery would take time, and the boost in restaurant delivery is not enough to stem Uber’s losses, said Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization. “This is a brutal body blow to Uber’s path to profitability, and potentially even its existential future, because few rational people are wiling to put themselves into harm’s way to ride in a vehicle, and many drivers have their own concerns,” Schiffer said. “Uber customers would rather chew glass than sit in the backseat of one of those cars.” Uber’s investment in Lime came as part of a $170 million funding round, which also included Alphabet, Bain Capital Ventures, GV and other investors. Customers will still have access to electric Jump bikes and scooters in the Uber app, but Lime will run the operation. To help keep drivers and riders protected during the pandemic, Uber says it will require drivers and riders to wear a mask beginning sometime in the coming weeks. Lyft made a similar announcement Thursday.
