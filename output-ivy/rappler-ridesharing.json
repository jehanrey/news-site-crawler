Japan's Toyota and ridesharing titan Uber said they had entered into a memorandum of understanding to explore collaboration, starting with trials in countries where ridesharing is expanding. \"Through this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient, and attractive mobility services to customers,\" Shigeki Tomoyama, senior managing officer of Toyota Motor Corporation, said in a joint statement. The deal includes a strategic investment by the Toyota Financial Services Corporation and its Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership, although no figure was disclosed. The partnership will create new leasing options enabling car buyers to lease their vehicles from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments with what they make as Uber drivers. Toyota and Uber are also exploring collaboration on developing in-car apps and setting up a program to sell Toyota and Lexus vehicles to Uber. \"Toyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide and we look forward to collaborating with Toyota in multiple ways going forward,\" said Emil Michael, Uber's chief business officer. Separately, German auto giant Volkswagen said it had made a $300 million strategic investment in Uber competitor Gett, which has a presence in more than 60 countries worldwide including London, Moscow, and New York. \"The ride-hailing market represents the greatest market potential in on-demand mobility, while creating the technological platform for developing tomorrow's mobility business models,\" it said in a statement. Shahar Waiser, Gett's chief executive and founder, said the company \"provides VW with the technology to expand beyond car ownership to on-demand mobility for consumers and businesses.\" Toyota and Volkswagen are not the first carmakers to link up with rideshare apps. In March, General Motors and Lyft unveiled a joint car rental service for drivers, a move aimed at boosting the number of vehicles available for the Uber rival. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/infografis-millenial-malas-punya-mobil-pribadi","title":"Benarkah millenial malas punya mobil pribadi?","date":"Nov 28, 2017 4:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Banyak yang lebih memilih ridesharing ketimbang memiliki kendaraan pribadi","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia —Mereka yang hidup di Jakarta pastilah mengerti benar kesengsaraan dan penderitaan yang harus dilalui pengguna jalan raya setiap hari saat beraktivitas. Jalanan yang lengang dan lancar nyaris jadi pemandangan langka di ibukota. Wajar saja, karena menurut riset yang digagas Uber, ternyata tercatat 69% warga Jakarta memiliki mobil pribadi. Ini bisa terlihat di jalanan ibukota setiap hari. Bahkan di kawasan-kawasan perumahan banyak memiliki mobil meski rumahnya tidak memiliki fasilitas garasi. Satu keluarga dalam satu rumah pun terkadang bisa memiliki 2-3 mobil.  Masih menurut riset serupa, diketahui bahwa jumlah mobil di Jakarta saat ini sudah mencapai 4 juta unit. Maka secara matematis, jika kecepatan perkembangan jumlah mobil terus terjadi seperti sekarang ini, Jakarta diprediksi akan mengalami kemacetan tak bergerak (standstill) di tahun 2022 nanti. Mungkin karena alasan-alasan tersebut pula kaum millenial ibukota seperti tidak lagi tertarik memiliki mobil pribadi. Dari 9000 responden yang mengikuti riset ini, tercatat 50% dari mereka tidak tertarik memiliki mobil pribadi. Sementara 61% generasi milenial di Asia memilih skema berbagi tumpangan sebagai opsi untuk komutasi harian mereka.  Mengapa? Simak alasannya di bawah ini. Waktu yang berharga Ttingkat kemacetan memang semakin tak tertahankan. Bayangkan saja, jika dihitung, rata-rata warga Jakarta menghabiskan waktu 90 menit per hari hanya untuk terjebak macet dan mencari parkir. Dan angka itu meningkat 1,8 kali lipat di jam-jam sibuk. Tentu lebih baik menghabiskan waktu yang berharga itu untuk keluarga dan kehidupan pribadi daripada bete di jalanan, kan? Kepedulian lingkungan Tak semua millenial cuek dengan kondisi lingkungan di sekitarnya. Mereka yang lebih memilih opsi ridesharing untuk bepergian di ibukota tentu paham bahwa tingkat polusi yang diakibatkan kendaraan sangat tinggi. Tercatat, mobil-mobil di Jakarta mengeluarkan jumlah karbon dioksida sebanyak 22 juta metrik ton per tahunnya. Lebih hemat Punya kendaraan pribadi tidak murah. Bukan hanya harga mobilnya yang tidak murah, tapi biaya hariannya juga. Apalagi di Jakarta. Rata-rata warga Jakarta menghabiskan uang Rp 11 juta rupiah per tahun hanya untuk bayar parkir!

Called Micab, the service launched in 2012 in Cebu before expanding to a few other provincial markets. In April this year, it got the nod of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to operate in Manila.  Since Grab acquired chief rival Uber's Southeast Asia operations in March, the ridesharing market has practically operated in a monopoly. The arrival of Micab, and other upcoming ridesharing services such as Owto, Go Lag, Hype, and Hirna, is expected to restore some balance to the market. For consumers, the arrival of new players sparks hope that it will eventually be faster to book a ride, and that drivers will behave more fairly at the risk of losing customers to other players.  We talked to Eddie Ybañez, founder and CEO of Micab, on how they'll be addressing issues that currently plague the ridesharing market. Micab's primary edge against other competitors, says Ybañez, is that it won't be charging booking fees and do surge pricing because the business is supported by its ad service, MiAds. Watch our quick video above for the rest of his answers or read the transcript below: Q: What’s your edge over the competition? Eddie Ybañez: At Micab, what we’re doing is we’re improving the taxi industry by providing safety, and a more convenient way to hail a ride. But the good thing with this is this promise comes very affordably. Because whatever the existing fare structure is, that’s what passengers have to pay. We don’t have a booking fee or surge pricing. I think that’s what our edge is compared to all the other players.  Q: How many taxis will Micab be able to bring to the ridesharing market?  EY: Our partners are capable of producing, in Manila alone, 15,000. That’s our target. That’s our target but the moment our other fleets sign on, we’ll have more taxis. Our target is about 30,000, maybe. Q: Now we’re at 5,000 in Manila? EY: 5,000 by June.   Q: When do we reach 15,000? EY: We’re targeting early next year to reach 15,000 in Manila. Nationwide, the 15,000-taxi goal is now doable, because they have already signed on.  Q: How are you addressing bad driver behavior?  EY: Before, there was no platform, no system for taxis. It was just the passenger and the driver who knew what was going on during the trip. If the driver did something, only the passenger would know – unless he posts it on Facebook or something.  But with Micab now, passengers have the power to report, to rate the driver, to commend the driver or file a complaint. The moment a 3-star rating is reported – even without details – our customer service will call the passenger and driver to investigate. Depending on the severity of the complaint, the drivers may be forced to go under re-training, or they will be taken off the platform, penalized by the operator, or if it’s a criminal offense, government agencies can step in, and impose penalties.   The driver’s license can get suspended for the next 3 months, 6 months or 1 year – that’s an existing ruling at the LTFRB. We’re actually sharing the system with the taxi operators and the government agencies.  Q: Will drivers see their passenger’s destination prior to accepting a trip? This has been seen as a reason why drivers are able to cancel on and pick passengers at will.  EY: Brainstorming on the decision whether to retain the driver’s ability to see passenger destination or not was tough. But eventually, the decision for us to allow the driver to see the destination won.  Why? As much as possible, we don’t want confrontations. We don’t want them to fight in the streets just because, say, a driver finds out that the destination is Bulacan. They might just end up fighting.   But since we’re allowing that, we’re limiting the number of times a driver can ignore or reject a request.  The moment a driver rejects 3 requests in one day, they will be blocked in the system for a day.  This will affect their rating. The moment they reach a 3-star average rating, they won’t be able to get passengers unless they do re-training.  Q: What happens when a passenger reports a driver who asks for additional fees?   EY: The operations team will investigate the incident. When they investigate, we’ll have access to their conversation on the app. So we can trace that. So passengers are actually protected. If a driver asks for a fixed contract rate for a trip, which is illegal, we can even report that to the LTFRB.  There’s a record of the conversation between passenger and driver. There’s evidence.   This is the big difference between now and then. Now there’s someone looking at them. The drivers themselves will behave better knowing that someone is monitoring them, like a parent to a child. Q: How fast can a passenger book a ride?  EY: Currently, we average 10 minutes, but we’re still ramping up in Manila. We haven’t even launched officially, but we’re operational already. The app is downloadable already. There are around an extra 1,000 cabs [about to be activated].  But we’re trying really that by the end of June, we have 5,000 cabs.  Hopefully, the moment more cabs get enabled – it’s just supply and demand, really – ride acceptance becomes faster. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/smart-uber-free-wifi-ridesharing","title":"Smart-Uber team-up brings in-car Wifi to ridesharing service","date":"Sep 9, 2015 1:01 AM PHT","snippet":"The team-up's free Wifi initiative will first occur with select Uber Black vehicles, rolling out to other Uber vehicles in the coming months","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Uber riders who want to stay connected on the road have one new option they can use.

Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday giving it an estimated valuation of some $80 billion, one of the biggest tech listings in recent years but rather lower than its earlier hopes of around $100 billion. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in cities around the world. It will also come in the rear-view mirror of a troubled market debut for Uber's largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15% of its value since its March IPO. Strikes that took place Wednesday highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange, where Uber is set to list shares, with some signs reading \"Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.\" Similar actions took place in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington and in Uber's home town, San Francisco. Protests were held in Britain as well with drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow called on to log off apps and demonstrate outside Uber offices, according to the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. \"While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,\" Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. \"In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\" Lyft shares skid Uber's inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft's losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"UBER\" sometime next month. \"We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and 'little brother' to Uber,\" Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is \"paving a similar road\" to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the \"Amazon of transportation\" in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between \"skyports,\" taking off and landing vertically. Uber's platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-united-states-law-enforcement-data-requests","title":"Uber reveals US law enforcement data queries","date":"Apr 13, 2016 3:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The global ridesharing giant says it got hundreds of requests from American agencies in the second half of 2015","body":"WASHINGTON, USA – Uber said Tuesday, April 12, it received more than 400 requests from US law enforcement agencies in the second half of 2015, and gave authorities some information in the vast majority of cases.

The vast majority of requests, 368, came from state authorities and 47 from federal officials. The report also said Uber received 33 requests from regulatory agencies, providing data in less than half of those instances. It also received 34 requests from airport regulatory agencies. US technology firms such as Google, Facebook and Apple have begun releasing periodic transparency reports as part of an effort to show how customer data is protected in the wake of revelations of government surveillance. San Francisco-based Uber, which allows individuals to offer rides via a smartphone application, has expanded to hundreds of cities worldwide and more than 60 countries, drawing protests from the taxi industry and regulators. The company has become one of the biggest venture-backed startups, with a valuation of more than $50 billion based on private investment disclosed to date, with some reports saying the valuation is over $60 billion. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/california-assembly-bill-5-ridesharing-employees","title":"California governor signs law making gig workers employees","date":"Sep 19, 2019 9:56 AM PHT","snippet":"The law challenges the business model of the rideshare platforms and others which depend on workers taking on 'gigs' as independent contractors.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – California governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a controversial law that could shake up the \"gig\" economy by reclassifying rideshare drivers and others as employees. The legislation, which is being closely watched in other states, responds to critics who argue that companies like Uber and Lyft shortchange contract drivers by denying them employee benefits. Newsom said the new law was a first step toward better treatment of employees and would enable more workers to unionize. The governor called the measure known as AB5 \"landmark legislation for workers and our economy\" and said it would reduce \"worker misclassification\" that denied benefits such as minimum wage, sick leave and health insurance. \"The hollowing out of our middle class has been 40 years in the making and the need to create lasting economic security for our workforce demands action. Assembly Bill 5 is an important step.\" The law challenges the business model of the rideshare platforms and others which depend on workers taking on \"gigs\" as independent contractors. Efforts by Uber and Lyft to negotiate a compromise to the bill passed by state legislators apparently failed, given the governor signed it into law unchanged. The measure was hailed as a watershed moment for labor activists seeking more rights for gig and freelance workers. \"Big thank you to all the gig workers, union members & activists who spent countless hours rallying to deliver this historic win,\" the California Labor Federal said in a tweet. \"We proved when working people stand together, we win!\" Uber balks Uber said it has no plans to immediately reclassify drivers as employees in January, when the law takes effect. The law \"does not provide drivers benefits; give them the right to organize, or classify them as employees,\" Uber chief legal officer Tony West said on a call last week with reporters. Uber had pressed for a new classification that considers workers independent while guaranteeing benefits, and has allocated millions of dollars to get a referendum on the ballot to support an option that would let drivers remain independent while providing safety nets. \"It was a leadership moment that was lost by California, to be able to lead that third way that fits th 21st century economy and the way the world works today,\" West said. Uber and Lyft, whose business models are likely to be hit by the law, are seeking a referendum in the state that would overturn the measure. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-flying-car-prototype-photos-uber-elevate-2018","title":"Uber's 'flying taxi' prototypes shown off at Uber Elevate","date":"May 9, 2018 11:43 AM PHT","snippet":"Commercialization of the flying taxis may begin around 2023, and can be summoned on-demand just like a ridesharing car","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – It's not a bird, nor a plane. But Uber's new prototype vehicle, known as the eCRM-003, unveiled Tuesday shows off its vision of the future of transportation – a \"flying taxi\" that aims to alleviate urban congestion. A model of Uber's electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle concept (eVTOL) – a cross between a helicopter and a drone – was displayed at the second annual Uber Elevate Summit in Los Angeles. \"Our goal is to radically improve global mobility,\" said Uber Aviation product chief Nikhil Goel. Goel said the all-electric flyer can achieve speeds over 300 kilometers (200 miles) an hour with a range of 100 kilometers (60 miles) on a battery charge. \"We fly a lot so we can prove to the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and the public that these aircraft are safe,\" he said. Uber has become a global force in transportation with its ridesharing service, but is also working on autonomous vehicles and other forms of transport. Uber plans the first demonstration flights for Los Angeles in 2020 and commercialization of the flying taxis in 2023, saying these could be ordered on demand just like a ridesharing vehicle. Eric Allison, who heads Uber's Aviation programs, said the flying vehicles are part of an overall strategy allowing people to do without personal cars. \"The rational choice for transportation will be less and less to own and drive a car,\" Allison said. \"We want to price it so low, it'll be irrational to drive your car.\" Here are 3 other concept vehicles seen at the event:  The first flying taxis will be designed with a pilot, according to Allision, but over time can be developed as autonomous vehicles. At the conference at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles, Uber showed films and models of a futuristic city with such vehicles, seemingly inspired by the film Blade Runner. The concept includes \"skyports\" that would serve as hubs for the aerotaxis. Several other companies along with Uber are trying to develop similar kinds of aerial devices.  Uber operations director Jeff Holen says the obstacles to  the new transport mode are mostly around regulations of air space, adding, \"The technology exists... we can solve this today.\" – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/ridesharing-reduces-mass-transit-use-united-states-study","title":"Ridesharing reduces mass transit use by 8.9% in US – study","date":"Mar 31, 2021 5:37 PM PHT","snippet":"The MIT study shows transport network companies increase congestion intensity by almost 1% and the duration of congestion by 4.5%","body":"Ridesharing, in its relatively short history, has been built up as a commuter alternative that's more environmentally friendly than taking the cab or owning a car.  But a study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Future Urban Mobility Interdisciplinary Research Group at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, and China's Tongji University found that it may not exactly be the case.  The study is titled “Impacts of transportation network companies on urban mobility,” recently published in the journal Nature Sustainability.    In the US, they found the entrance of ridesharing services by transport network companies (TNCs) in the market reduced mass transport ridership by 8.9%, and only reduced private vehicle ownership by 1%.   The services also increased road congestion intensity by almost 1% and increased the duration of congestion by 4.5%, citing \"deadheading\" miles or miles travelled without a passenger as a possible cause for TNC services' added effect on congestion. Studies estimate about 40.8% of TNC miles are deadheading miles in the US.  The study also found that the ease with which commuters can access ridesharing services discouraged them from merely walking or taking public transportation, which are greener alternatives.  These findings are showing that ridesharing services, according to the study, have a negative net effect on the environment, contrary to predominant belief.  The study takes into account Uber and Lyft, two of the biggest TNCs in the US.  “We are still in the early stages of TNCs and we are likely to see many changes in how these ridesharing businesses operate,” says Hui Kong, postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Urban Mobility Lab, and an author of the paper.  “Our research shows that over time TNCs have intensified urban transport challenges and road congestion in the United States, mainly through the extended duration and slightly through the increased intensity. With this information, policies can then be introduced that could lead to positive changes.”  The authors are not dismissing the potential of TNCs completely however, saying that their possible benefits could indeed be tremendous but translating this promise into actual environmental and congestion-easing gains could also be very complicated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/russian-rideshare-app-yandex-taxi-share-user-data-police-coda-story","title":"Russian rideshare app Yandex.Taxi shares user data with police","date":"Mar 12, 2020 5:15 PM PHT","snippet":"A police officer on trial for framing investigative reporter Ivan Golunov revealed he learned the journalist’s address by requesting his ride history from an app co-owned by Uber","body":"In June and July 2019, Coda Story covered the arrest of the Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov on spurious drug possession charges, and the ensuing public outcry. Since then, the charges against Golunov have been dropped, and in January five Moscow police officers were charged with fabrication of evidence and drug trafficking. According to Russian news website Baza.io, one of these officers, Igor Lyakhovets, said that he had obtained the reporter’s address by requesting his travel history from Yandex.Taxi, Russia’s most popular rideshare app. Yandex.Taxi has publicly confirmed that it received and complied with this request. It was a minor detail in Lyakhovets’ account of the Golunov investigation, but one that has shed light on the ability of Russian security services to carry out detailed surveillance of anyone who uses everyday online services, such as taxi apps. It also raised questions about the security of user data in the many countries outside Russia in which Yandex.Taxi operates. Concerns have risen over whether Yandex.Taxi went far beyond its obligations in giving the Moscow police Golunov’s user data. On March 2, the Russian digital rights group Roskomsvoboda published a report noting that Yandex.Taxi is not listed on the public registry of “information dissemination organizers.” Such organizations are required to grant Russian authorities access to all user data under the controversial “Yarovaya law,” a package of new measures and amendments to existing statutes focused on public safety and counterterrorism enacted in July 2016. But Yandex.Taxi argues that it was compelled to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies, citing a different law – known as the “operative-search activities” law, which regulates police investigations – which applies to any organization, regardless of whether it is on the registry or not. But according to Kirill Koroteev of the legal advocacy organization Agora, this law stipulates that requests for private data are not binding in the absence of a court order. No such court order appears to have been given, but Yandex.Taxi spokeswoman Natalia Zhuravlova told Coda via email that while “certain types of enquiries – for example, requests to reveal text of private correspondence between people – do require a corresponding court decision,” requests for ride histories do not. Golunov raised a further question concerning the legitimacy of the request Yandex.Taxi received from law enforcement. According to Golunov, it was not made via the correct channels, but rather was sent in an email, from an address at the domain Mail.ru – a popular Russian email server. Golunov told Coda Story that he saw evidence of this during the court proceedings. This detail has not yet been made public, as the trial is ongoing. Yandex.Taxi, however, denies that the request was made via email. In a Facebook post, the company’s spokesman Vladimir Isaev said that he personally saw the signed paper that was submitted to the company’s lawyers. In a text message, Golunov explained why the question of whether the request was made via email is significant.  “I don’t like the situation with Yandex.Taxi – that information about my movement is available to any person who can write a letter to Yandex.Taxi and sign as a police officer,” he wrote. “I think that this kind of information should only be shared by the company if there’s a court order.” Whether or not Yandex.Taxi gave up more information than they legally had to, this case shows the extent to which the Russian authorities expect unfettered access to private companies’ information, and do not see the need to give any reason for their requests. “I think it is also highly important to mention that usually, enquiries by the authorities don’t contain any details of cases or names of people in question,” wrote Zhuravlova. “They also don’t mention whether the person in question is under suspicion or whether they are a victim of a crime. As an example, they might contain just a phone number or an internet ID.” International repercussions According to its website, Yandex.Taxi operates in 17 countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and West Africa. In Georgia, where it is one of the two most popular rideshare apps, the news of the company’s involvement in Golunov’s case was met with alarm. Speaking to Georgian television reporters, parliamentarian Irakli Abesadze called for an investigation of Yandex.Taxi by state security services, in order to determine whether the app also shares Georgian users’ data with Russian authorities. Privacy concerns related to Russian access to Yandex.Taxi’s international user data long predate this week’s reports, and are not confined to Georgia. In 2018, the Lithuanian defense ministry’s National Cyber Security Centre published an investigation that found that the Yandex.Taxi app in Lithuania regularly sent encrypted communications to Russian IP addresses. Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis publicly urged Lithuanians not to download the app, owing to concerns that it stored excessive user data with inadequate security. Asked whether Yandex.Taxi would have handed over user data to the Russian authorities had their request concerned the travel history of a passenger outside Russia, Zhuravlova responded: “The responsibility for rides-related data is carried by the legal entity, which operates the service in a particular country. For example, Russian Yandex.Taxi LLC will handle the enquiries about rides in Russia, provided the enquiries are made according to established legal procedure. Enquiries about rides in Georgia will be handled by the Netherlands-based Yandex.Taxi B.V., while enquiries about rides in Ghana will be handled by MLU Africa B.V. and so on.” Yandex's partnership with Uber In 2018, Yandex and Uber merged their rideshare operations in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Russia into a single entity. Named MLU B.V., it is jointly owned by the two companies and officially based in the Netherlands. Today, if you open the Uber app on your phone in one of these countries, you are redirected to Yandex.Taxi, or another service operated by Yandex. In Russia, a separate Uber Russia app is available, with Yandex listed as the developer. In the U.S., according to Uber’s privacy policy, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena must be submitted by law enforcement before the company shares its user data. Uber has also published transparency reports detailing the number and frequency of these requests. However, an Uber spokeswoman told Coda Story via email that Uber and Yandex.Taxi “operate separately with different products, infrastructures and policies.” Uber declined to comment on Yandex.Taxi’s involvement in the Golunov case.

The Japanese auto giant's president Akio Toyoda unveiled the new initiative at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, seeking to get ahead of rivals offering single-use autonomous transporters. The \"e-Palette\" vehicle platform features a boxy electric-powered minibus designed to handle deliveries or even bring retail services to consumers, but can also be used for ridesharing and other purposes. \"It is a flexible platform that can be adapted to a range of services,\" Toyoda said, including ridesharing, retail, medical services or entertainment. The media demonstration showed how the vehicle could deliver packages or even enable consumers to try on shoes or apparel. The new initiative is part of an effort to transform Toyota from an automaker to a multifaceted \"mobility\" company, Toyoda said. Partners in the project, which is set to be deployed \"in the early 2020s,\" include Amazon, Uber, Pizza Hut and China-based Didi. Rival Japanese automaker Mazda will also participate in development. The company said it hopes to showcase the technology at the 2020 Olympics in Japan. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/hackers-stole-data-57-million-uber-users","title":"Hackers stole data from 57M Uber riders, drivers – CEO","date":"Nov 22, 2017 7:06 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber says hackers compromised personal data from some 57 million riders and drivers of the ridesharing service in a 2016 incident","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA (3rd UPDATE) – Uber said Tuesday, November 21, that hackers compromised personal data from some 57 million riders and drivers in a breach kept hidden for a year. \"None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,\" said a statement from chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over at the ridesharing giant in August. Two members of the Uber information security team who \"led the response\" that included not alerting users that their data was breached were let go from the San Francisco-based company effective Tuesday, according to Khosrowshahi. The Uber chief said he only recently learned that outsiders had broken into a cloud-based server used by the company for data and downloaded a \"significant\" amount of information. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Uber's new boss Khosrowshahi learned of the incident. \"You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it.\" Khosrowshahi said that what he learned about Uber's failure to notify users or regulators prompted corrective actions. Need to change Uber is notifying drivers whose license numbers were swiped, and offering them credit and identity theft protections. The company also said it is notifying regulators, and monitoring affected rider accounts for signs of fraud. \"While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We are changing the way we do business.\" Khosrowshahi inherited a litany of scandals and a toxic workplace culture when he replaced Kalanick. Kalanick's brash style has been credited with driving Uber to the leading spot in the smartphone-summoned ride market, but also blamed for fostering an atmosphere of impropriety and rule breaking at the company. A planned tieup with Japanese tech giant SoftBank suggests the ridesharing giant is set to come of age in the business world, but it still faces a long road ahead. The deal would give Uber an additional $1 billion in capital and could allow SoftBank to acquire as much as 14% of Uber over time. While Uber has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, it is trying to move past scandals and missteps that have included executive misconduct, a cutthroat workplace, and potentially unethical competitive practices. One step toward the future was the hiring of Khosrowshahi earlier this year, which left founder Kalanick in the background. But Uber needs to clean up governance and other practices in order to meet its goal of a 2019 stock market debut that will open up the privately-held firm to greater scrutiny. Under Kalanick, Uber reached an eye-popping valuation of $68 billion, unprecedented for a private firm.  But at the same time, it has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators, and faces possible bans in cities for failing to live up to local rules. The deal with SoftBank is aimed at getting past the clashes between Kalanick and early investors like Benchmark Capital, which has sued the former CEO. SoftBank is expected to buy up shares from some investors by pumping in as much as $9 billion, in a so-called tender offer to Uber stakeholders. Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said earlier this month that some details are not yet final. Uber called the SoftBank deal \"a strong vote of confidence\" in the company's long-term potential. But Uber has other issues as well. It is in court facing Waymo, the former Google Car unit, which has alleged the theft of trade secrets on autonomous vehicle technology, in a case pending in California. Uber's use of software aimed at thwarting rivals like Lyft has also hurt its image, and could create further legal woes. Uber is facing tougher competition around the world, with rivals in Asia and Europe ramping up efforts and the expansion of US-based Lyft – which recently announced it would launch services in its first city outside the US market in Toronto, Canada. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/malware-xcodeghost-apple-ios-appstore","title":"Malware snuck into Apple's App Store may affect millions","date":"Sep 21, 2015 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Among the affected apps are social networking app WeChat, Chinese ridesharing service Didi Kuaidi, and business card reader CamCard","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Apple on Sunday, September 20, was working to clean up the iOS App Store following instances of malicious iPhone and iPad programs being placed into the App Store for download. Among the affected apps are social networking app WeChat, Chinese ridesharing service Didi Kuaidi, and business card reader CamCard. According to Forbes, the infection stemmed from developers downloading third-party copies of Xcode, a developer tool for iOS and Mac OS X applications. Instead of downloading Xcode directly from Apple the third party downloads were altered such that malware was added onto apps with the altered Xcode, now called XcodeGhost. Palo Alto Networks senior researcher Claud Xiao added that the malware not only appears to take non-sensitive data, but also \"can be remotely controlled by the attacker to phish or exploit local system or app vulnerabilities.\" In this case, evidence suggests this was used to acquire an affected user's iCloud credentials from users of the infected apps. Tencent has updated the WeChat app to version 6.2.6 to get rid of the bad code, adding that it had found no evidence of data loss. The full list of affected apps is available on the Palo Alto Networks blog. – Rappler.com iPhone image from Shutterstock"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/bam-aquino-ltfrb-grab-uber-reasonable-standards","title":"Bam Aquino to LTFRB: Work with Uber, Grab on reasonable standards","date":"Jul 13, 2017 11:49 AM PHT","snippet":"Senator Paolo Benigno 'Bam' Aquino IV pushes for the proposed Rideshare Support Company Act which seeks to encourage 'new, affordable, and safe transportation options'","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Senator Paolo Benigno \"Bam\" Aquino IV has urged transportation officials to work with rideshare companies in developing reasonable standards amid the clamor of commuters for better options. Aquino made the call a day after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slapped a P5-million fine each on Grab and Uber for letting some of their drivers operate without permits. \"We need to provide the commuting public with better options and alternatives to improve their daily commuting experience. The government must work with rideshare companies that share this mission and develop suitable standards and requirements for them,\" Aquino said in a statement on Wednesday, July 12. \"I urge the LTFRB to address this issue of penalties for rideshare companies. Then we can focus on passing legislation to develop the industry and to ensure these new transport networks are held accountable for offenses,\" he added. Last year, Aquino filed Senate Bill 696 or the Rideshare Support Company Act, which seeks \"to encourage new, affordable, and safe transportation options and ensure the safety of the riding public by imposing safety and financial responsibility standards and requirements.\" \"In any industry, increased competition often leads to improved quality, improved service, and lower prices for consumers. For the commuting public, this is a change they have long clamored for,\" the senator said in his explanatory note to SB 696. The LTFRB said it considered public sentiment in dealing with the rideshare companies, as shown by its decision to impose hefty fines on Grab and Uber. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in LTFRB MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber's operations should have been shut down. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Tuesday that the interest of the riding public \"overrides\" the provision. On Wednesday, Aquino renewed his push for SB 696 which seeks to institutionalize a regulatory framework for the new type of service. SB 696 clarifies the regulations governing transportation network companies or rideshare support sompanies (RSCs), and rideshare network drivers and vehicles. Under the proposal,  RSCs must obtain a certificate of accreditation from the LTFRB before getting an authority for a qualified rideshare network driver after a thorough background check and submission of required documents. – Rappler.com"}]}
