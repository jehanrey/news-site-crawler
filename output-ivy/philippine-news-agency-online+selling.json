The suspects were arrested in an entrapment after selling 30 boxes of Clungene rapid test kits worth PHP204,000, to a poseur buyer at around 11 a.m. on Scout Bayoran St. in Barangay South Triangle. Police officers also seized from the suspects' possession assorted rapid test kits worth PHP30 million. “An entrapment was immediately conducted which resulted in their arrest as soon as they received the marked money,” CIDG director Maj. Gen. Albert Ignatius Ferro said. One of the suspects, Marize Santiago, was found to be connected to a Chinese online selling group that offers unauthorized rapid test kits for Covid-19. Ferro said the suspects failed to show the operatives their license to operate or special permit to sell and distribute the test kits. \"Na-verify po natin sa FDA (Food and Drug Administration) na sila, itong grupo na ito ay walang license to operate, base po sa ating pag-check kahapon sa FDA. (Per our verification with the FDA, this group has no license to operate, based on our coordination with FDA yesterday),\" he said. The suspects also yielded National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) cards and badges. Ferro said they will coordinate with the NBI to determine the authenticity of the IDs and badges and why the suspects have them. \"Sa tingin ko po, ito ay hindi ordinaryong grupo (I believe this is not an ordinary group). Practically, they are avoiding taxes. It is economic sabotage because they do not want to pay the proper taxes,\" he said. He said the operation is part of the efforts to run after those who take advantage of the pandemic to earn money by illegally marketing medical devices through illegal online selling websites being catered by unauthorized online sellers of Covid 19 rapid test kit. He said the medical devices include Joinstar, Clungene rapid test kit, Innovita antibody test, Sanli disposable virus specimen, and Wondfo rapid test kit. The suspects are now facing a case of violation of the Republic Act 9711 or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009 in relation to FDA Circular No. 2020-016 or the prohibition of online selling of FDA certified Covid-19 antibody test kit.

Dr. Marco Rafael Ardamil, head of the Public Health Division of the Provincial Veterinary (ProVet), said the decision was made during their Monday meeting because of the implementation of the “courtesy lockdown” from April 5 to 19, 2021 against the surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). As of April 4, Antique has 238 total cumulative cases with 141 active, 134 recovered, and eight deaths. “Starting April 5 to 19, the ASF checkpoint in the southern border of Antique to Iloilo and the northern border of the province to Aklan is being suspended,” he said in an interview. Also suspended is the checkpoint at the Lipata Port in Culasi town where there is a roll-on, roll-off (RoRo) operating from Batangas Port and at the Antique Airport here. The suspension is due to the Executive Order 30 issued by Governor Rhodora J. Cadiao on Monday for the provincial government employees to implement alternative working arrangements due to courtesy lockdown, which discourages Antiqueños to travel outside of their municipalities to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Ardamil said. Cadiao, during a media virtual press conference, said she has directed the capitol employees to only have a skeleton workforce to attend to the public for the next two weeks. Meanwhile, Ardamil said they are appealing to suppliers and online sellers not to take advantage of the situation by transporting pork-based products from ASF-affected areas like Luzon and Mindanao areas. “We have the Provincial Ordinance Number 2020-242, which was approved last December 22, 2020, prohibiting the carrying, transport, shipment, and trading of pork and pork products including but not limited to canned goods and food items containing pork originating from anywhere in the country affected by ASF,” he said. He said that local consumers are also being urged to help keep Antique ASF-free by not patronizing online selling. “With the courtesy lockdown, we anticipate online selling to again become rampant so we dissuade consumers from ordering online the pork-based products,” he said.

Apayao tourism officer Rebecca Tamaken-Mamba confirmed this on Friday as all tourist spots in Apayao are closed. For the meantime, the hidden gems of Apayao dubbed as, Cordillera’s last frontier for nature’s richness, will remain exclusive for its residents until it is ready to welcome tourists again. Like in various parts of the country, Apayao's eco-tourism industry is among those widely affected by the pandemic restrictions. Exactly a year now since Governor Eleanor Bulut-Begtang issued memorandum order no. 82, directing all mayors and the provincial tourism office to close down all tourism spots in the province, several displaced tourism workers have shifted to farming and fishing, and online selling just to make ends meet in this time of crisis. “The decision to close down the tourism spots in the province is among the measures of the provincial government towards the prevention of possible case and transmission of Covid-19 within Apayao,” said the governor in a public statement. With eased travel protocols, local officials have been directed to closely monitor their own turf and ensure the implementation of the said memorandum. In support to the most affected residents due to pandemic, the Apayao government in collaboration with various government institutions such as the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Technical Education Skills and Development Authority, and Department of Agriculture, among others, continue to provide free skills training, as well as livelihood support and financial assistance to affected residents. As of February 2021, the Provincial Treasury Office reported a total of PHP5.4 million has been allocated to assist students, persons with disabilities, senior citizens and solo parents as they each received PHP5,000 worth of financial assistance. This is apart from the additional PHP5 million congressional initiatives which benefited 998 individuals from its seven municipalities.

In President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s Talk-to-the-People Address Wednesday night, the Department of Trade and Industry presented data that total investment increased to PHP137 billion, which is 64.65 percent higher than last year’s PHP83 billion.  Roque said employment also improved as 12,013 individuals were employed from January to March 19, 2021.  The employment figure is 13.28 percent higher compared to the same period last year where employment reached 10,605, he said.  Roque said the number of new businesses also increased with 916,163 business names registered in 2020, which is 44 percent higher than the previous year.  Meanwhile, Roque said e-commerce business registrations reached 88,574 before the end of 2020, compared to just 1,700 at the start of last year.  “Talaga naman pong nag-boom talaga ang online selling at delivery ngayong may pandemya. Isa itong halimbawa na meron pa rin pong mga opportunities pati sa gitna ng krisis. (Online selling and delivery is truly booming this pandemic. This is an example that there are opportunities in a time of crisis),” he added.  To help affected businesses particularly the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), Roque said the national government’s livelihood programs continue to provide assistance.  “Mula Enero noong nakaraang taon hanggang Marso ngayon taon, mayroon tayong na-assist na (From January last year until March this year, we assisted) 56,281 MSMEs, nakapag-conduct ng (conducted) 15,653 Negosyo Clinics, nabigyan ng (gave) 377,406 na mga indibidwal ng impormasyon na may kinalaman sa ibat-ibang livelihood opportunities (individuals an information concerning various livelihood opportunities),” he said.  Aside from these, Roque cited the assistance provided by other government financing institutions like the PHP5.28-billion loan from Land Bank of the Philippines under its I-RESCUE lending program where 208 borrowers were assisted including MSMEs, and the DBP Response-MSME Recovery program where PHP12.5 billion were disbursed to 346 beneficiaries.  Roque said the loans guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation under its MSME Credit Guarantee Program increased by 360 percent from PHP207 million in December 2020 to PHP952.5 million last month.  As of February 2021, he said the program’s MSME beneficiaries reached 8,839.  In the same press briefing, Department of Finance Assistant Secretary Paola Alvarez relayed the clarification made by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III during President Duterte’s Talk-to-the-People Address.  Alvarez said the Philippines’ vaccination deployment program budget is still PHP82.5 billion, of which the PHP12.5 billion will come from the General Appropriations Act; PHP58.4 billion from loans from the World Bank (PHP24.3 billion), Asian Development Bank (PHP19.5 billion), and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (PHP14.6 billion); and PHP11.6 billion from savings and other official development assistance (ODA) arrangements as necessary.  Meanwhile, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairperson Benjamin Abalos Jr. in the same press briefing, assured that the Metro Manila local government units (LGUs) are one in enforcing major policies, and has been cooperating and helping one another to control the infection and lower the number of cases.  On another matter, National Task Force against Covid-19 Special Adviser Dr. Ted Herbosa said abolishing the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and replacing it with another inter-agency body in the middle of the country’s response to Covid-19 would be detrimental to everyone.  Herbosa said “we now know what works and what doesn’t work unlike a year ago” and the current numbers are not indicative that the IATF did or did not do anything amid the nature of the virus and the presence of the new variants.

City Councilor Joe Orlando Acharon, chair of the council’s committee on consumer welfare, said Friday they are currently working with the city’s executive department and other concerned agencies to set off the activation of a task force and the implementation of the necessary interventions. He said the move is mainly aimed to protect the city’s thriving hog industry from the possible entry of the dreaded African swine fever (ASF), as well as local consumers from unscrupulous traders. Citing their monitoring, he said traders of various meat products from the city have continued to thrive online and their activities are mainly unregulated. Acharon said among the popular products are processed pork such as chorizo and tocino that come from unknown sources. “This very risky since some of these products might have been sourced from areas with confirmed cases of ASF,” he said in an interview over radio station Brigada News FM. City Mayor Ronnel Rivera issued an executive order (EO) in August last year that required local online sellers of processed meat and other related products to secure permits from the city government and other regulatory agencies. Under the EO, online meat sellers are required to register with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as secure licenses as meat vendors from the city’s Business Permits and Licensing Division. Violators will face a fine of PHP3,000 for the first offense and PHP5,000 for the succeeding offenses, and the confiscation of their illegal products. Acharon said they are currently working on setting these measures into an ordinance to ensure its proper enforcement. He said the registration requirement will cover all online meat sellers, regardless of the volume they are selling or the extent of their operations. “It is important for us to properly monitor all of them, know where they source their product, and be able to track them down later on in case a problem comes up,” he said. Acharon added the city can also generate additional income later from the registered or legitimate sellers or traders.

Both were arrested by the joint operatives of the Navotas City Police Station, Quezon City District Field Unit Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (QCDFU-CIDG), and Philippine Air Force intelligence on Tuesday. Sinas said the arrested suspects are leaders of Christian CG, a criminal group engaged in online selling. “We remind the public to be vigilant and to immediately report any suspicious online transactions. We cannot discount the risks associated with unauthorized medical products that could possibly endanger public health,” Sinas said. He also called on those engaged in food or health product businesses to get pertinent legal documents from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to avoid conflict with the law. The police operation stemmed from information shared by the FDA of the illegal online sale of unregistered Covid-19 rapid test kit without having valid permits or licenses from the FDA.

He added there is a big potential in Philippine e-commerce as it grew double-digit in 2020. Philippine e-commerce is also expected to be a USD9.75-billion industry by 2025, outsizing the e-commerce sector in Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, he said. He said Amazon Global Selling will be launching more webinars, bite-sized simplified content, and accessible information to help sellers in their online selling journey. “2021 would be an exciting year for our team and will continue to do our best to help sellers in the Philippines launch their products successfully,” he added.

Lopez said the number of online sellers dramatically rose since the pandemic started. From 1,700 online retailers registered with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) from January to March 2020, there were 86,000 online business registrations with the department by the end of last year. For January 2021 alone, registration of online retailers reached 1,539. “But even as our entrepreneurs have adjusted their business models to the ‘new normal’ of the pandemic, they still need to be ‘smarter entrepreneurs”’ to compete in the global market. This means our entrepreneurs should know how to differentiate themselves from their competitors, while also offering innovative and relevant solutions to present-day issues in society,” Lopez said. He added that the DTI offers e-commerce programs to support the digitalization of MSMEs, such as the CTRL+Biz Reboot Now! Webinar, that teach entrepreneurs to transform themselves into digital businesses; the Pivot…Embrace Technology project which helps to upskill and reskill displaced workers; and Sari-Sari Linker that digitizes “sari-sari” stores, or the mom-and-pop stores. Lopez added that the DTI also collaborated with Amazon to support Filipino MSMEs to expand their market. “DTI’s digitalization programs will surely help with the boom of enterprises that happened last year and is still happening now. More importantly, these new MSMEs can aid in our country’s recovery, especially as our economy gradually reopens and more businesses restart their operations,” the DTI chief said.

In a message to reporters, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra noted that the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), co-chaired by the DOJ and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), has been continuously trailing perpetrators during the last few years. Many cases have been filed in court and convictions secured. \"The IACAT is very much aware of the geographical areas usually poverty-stricken areas where victims abound and in what countries the predators are usually based.

I will request the AMLC for a copy of the report and refer the matter to the IACAT for appropriate action,\" Guevarra said.

Alarming ito lalo na't ang kalaswaan na ito ay dulot rin ng kahirapan (This is alarming especially that these lewd acts are a result of poverty),\" Go said, adding that \"poverty is not a reason for one to sell one's soul.\" His pronouncements came after reports indicating that some students have been resorting to selling their obscene photos and videos online to support their needs amid the ongoing pandemic. \"Pwedeng makasuhan kung sino 'yung kakuntsaba at pumapayag sa mga ganitong pagbebenta ng malalaswang mga larawan (Those who are in cahoots with the perpetrators and are allowing the sale of these lewd photos can be charged),\" Go said during an ambush interview right after he personally led the distribution of assistance to market vendors in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon on Tuesday.Go also said President Rodrigo Duterte has been informed of this issue and is deeply concerned with the welfare of these children. He added that the President plans to call on cybercrime units of various concerned agencies for a meeting to address this situation and strengthen safeguards to protect the youth.

CWC Executive Director Mary Mitzi Cajayon-Uy concurred with Go's statement but said it is difficult to police the Internet for such acts. She, however, agreed that there is a need to encourage families to come forward and work with the government through CWC should they need assistance on such matters. Cajayon-Uy said the CWC will validate first about those involved in the online selling of photos and videos. Once this is confirmed, the Inter-Agency Council Against Child Pornography may be tapped to intervene on the issue. Go also told students in distress to seek his help if they need support for their education rather than resorting to selling lewd photos and videos online.

Although she couldn't leave her home in Valenzuela City unless, she said gets dolled up to feel and look good. Her looks usually consist of flowy dresses or chiffon tops, hoop earrings, and her smile that radiates energy. Laudale, 30, is a flight attendant, but she’s currently on leave because of the pandemic. After realizing she had accumulated so many articles of clothing, she decided to sell them online. After all, it wouldn’t be her first time doing it. “I’ve been an online seller since college. But it was an off and on thing because of my schedule. But this pandemic, I started to focus on doing live selling,” she said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. Despite being stuck indoors, Laudale said style could not be compromised, especially since she was selling women’s apparel. “I believe that imaging is important when you sell. My mom usually reminds me to fix myself to look presentable because it matters. And only during live I really get to fix myself so I go all out,” she added. While selling items online has been around for the longest time, venturing into livestreaming has been relatively new. Laudale has taken advantage of Facebook Live feature to speak to her potential buyers through witty sales pitches. “Ito malaki tsaka para kang pupunta sa Baguio, sis…para kang may kaakap (This one’s big and wearing it makes you look like you’re going to Baguio, sis…it feels like a hug),” she would say, describing a cotton long-sleeved blouse. Live selling allows Laudale to showcase her preloved clothing items while conversing with potential customers who, in turn, negotiate prices. To purchase an item, she said customers simply have to type “mine” or “pa-mine lang po” on the comment section of her livestream, send her a screenshot of the clothing item they want, and send her a private message. She calls most of her customers “sis”, but once they purchase she classifies them as “miners”. She would then write the item’s negotiated price on masking tape and stick them on to indicate that an item is sold. “After posting/live, I send the buyers their invoice indicating their total along with where to send their payments and how it’ll be shipped. Then I’ll be waiting for their payment confirmation. I schedule delivery mostly Mondays and Wednesdays so that I can send them out in batch. Then it’ll take at least two to three days for Metro Manila or three to seven days for provincial for the parcel to arrive,” she said. A lot of preloved clothes can be almost brand-new, but others might need stitching or extra buttons. But what happens when people complain about clothing items and want to return them? “I indicate the ‘No Return, No Exchange’ rule in my posts every time. Since I sell preloved clothes, they know how to keep their expectations in check. But in some cases, I come to terms where we end up in a win-win situation, she said. The secret to her success is how she values her customers. Every once and a while, Laudale would include gifts to \"top miners\" who purchase clothes from her store. Gifts could be bags, wristlets, or even a vanity mirror with LED lights. It's a small gesture, but it can mean a lot to loyal or repeat buyers. Mannequins and models It’s no secret that Laudale sometimes wears some of her clothes to show potential buyers what they look like, but to save time and effort she displays the outfits on a headless mannequin. “I have an old mannequin that I’ve had for 10 years already. The new one I bought around two months ago,” she said. Selling live is no easy task. Laudale spends three to four hours talking, standing, putting on clothes on the mannequin and taking them off again. Lucky for her, time flies when she’s having fun. According to Laudale, her experience as a flight attendant has helped sharpen her communication skills to some extent. But it’s really the experience of selling that gets her on a high. “I really like being in front of the camera!” she said, chuckling. “I think [being a flight attendant] does help me. But selling is really what I like doing maybe that’s why I’m comfortable because I’m in my zone.” Every time she goes live, Laudale said she fully enjoys the opportunity to show off her preloved clothes while at the same time generating sales. She said she would usually go live once or twice a week and post photos of items to be sold days prior. “By God’s grace, I usually sell everything I have for the day,” she said. Laudale herself loves shopping, but growing older made her realize that she could score fashionable clothes for so much less. \"I really love clothes but I'm not willing to spend so much. I'm a thrifter myself. Before I returned to online selling, I would go for plain shirts and pants. Now that I see too many dresses, I’m choose to draw back and say no,\" she said. Because she loves online selling so much, she said she plans to continue doing it even when the current situation improves, maybe even do it full-time. Laudale’s online shop “Tindalera” can be found at https://www.facebook.com/kickass.shop. Prices of pre-loved items start at as low as PHP80.

This is a program of the City Government of Davao that aims to help members of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community of the city, particularly those who express their intention to help themselves and their communities. LGBT rights advocates have lauded the program, noting how it ensures that a sector that has always been marginalized are now being empowered economically — without the government being dole out with its assistance. One of the beneficiaries is lesbian partners Jofail Jeminico Failagutan and Iris Sabanal. They were able to access P10,000 cash from the program at the height of the pandemic. They said they used the money as additional capital for their small sari-sari store that features a Vendo loading station for mobile phones in a densely-populated community in Bucana, Davao City. “Kung tabang lang ang hisgutan dako gyud kaayo ni og tabang sa amoa labi na sa among pang-adlaw-adlaw nga panginahanglan (It has really helped us with our daily needs),” Failagutan said. He added that the anti-Covid-19 measures of the government have affected their livelihood — but she wasn’t complaining. “Usahay mingaw tungod sa curfew karun pero ana man ang negosyo muhinay, usahay mukusog (Because of the curfew, sometimes business is slow. But doing business is always like that — it’s not good all the time),” he said. Failagutan is one of the conveners of the Davao Pretty Butch, a group of lesbians organized on May 12, 2012. Over the years, membership of the group has increased to 115 and today. The members are active in community activities that promote the rights of LGBT and highlight their plight. One member of the group engaged in a milk tea business, while another one in online selling of ‘ukay-ukay’. In this group, the program has assisted 20 members. In another group, the United LGBT of Bunawan Organization (Ulbo), the program also extended financial aid to 20 gays. Jojo Erebias, one of the leaders of the group, said the assistance came right at a time when life was “pigado kayo (depleted).” “It was hard for many of us,” he said. “But the assistance from the city government was able to provide us with the needed help and relief.” Erebias used the money to buy salon supplies that she also resells to small salons in their community. Part of the money, she said, she used to slowly build her own salon. Another Ulbo member, Hector Tomas, used the money to put up a makeshift store that sells soft drinks, coffee, candies, noodles, and balot. “We are thankful that the City Government of Davao has extended its arms to help people like us,” Erebias said. She pointed out that the livelihood assistance has encouraged them to work hard and not rely on government dole-outs “Maulaw man pud ta magsige og pangayo og tabang sa gobyerno. Dili man pud pwede nga magsalig na lang ta kanunay sa uban (It’s not right for us to always ask for help from the government. And it’s not correct that we always rely on others),” she said. The money dispensed by the program, according to focal person Norman Baloro, should be returned to the government after two years. Baloro, who is a commissioner of the Commission on the Urban Poor, explained that members of the LGBT community who accessed the financial aid should repay the P10,000 in 2 years without interest. Today, at least 840 LGBT have accessed the fund. They represent 28 different LGBT groups. They were made to undergo basic business management training to “capacitate them for financial literacy and resource management.” “The city, under the good leadership of Mayor Inday Sara Duterte has consistently been rolling out livelihood programs, as part of its comprehensive anti-poverty strategy, but this year’s livelihood program is unique in a sense that its target key population beneficiaries are from a doubly marginalized sector which is the LGBT, belonging to the urban poor,” Baloro said. “The incremental impact of this program cannot be overstated since it deeply cuts through socioeconomic class and gender and sexuality lines,” Baloro stressed. The “Rainbow Mag Negosyo Ta day”, is a sustainable livelihood program for the LGBT sector to earn basic entrepreneurial skills, was rolled out in October 2019 with a budget of P8.4 million budget offered as a non-interest bearing loan. The program is similar to “Mag Negosyo Ta ‘Day”, another anti-poverty program of the LGU for women. “This program aims to help our LGBT sector to become productive for themselves, and even for their family and community. At the same time, this is also essential because we also help them to become self-reliant and independent,” Baloro said.

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported on Friday the online Bahandi Trade Fair held on November 16-20 has generated total sales of PHP8.12 million, with PHP1.56 million in sales, PHP6.55 million in booked orders, and PHP501,600 under negotiation. The total sales figure is 162.5 percent higher than the PHP5 million target, DTI 8 (Eastern Visayas) director Celerina Bato said. \"From the original PHP1 million target sales, we increased it to PHP5 million after our Undersecretary's (DTI Regional Operations Group Undersecretary Blesila Lantayona) challenging but very inspirational message during the opening ceremony. Indeed, we were a bit apprehensive as this was our first time to stage a virtual regional trade fair plus the unstable and poor connectivity that the Region 8 MSMEs have, most especially in the provinces,” Bato said in a statement. The top-seller producer for the food sector was Alboco Food Industry, a maker of peanut butter, based in this city while for the non-food sector, the top-seller was Ma. Delza's Native Products, a producer of native bags and mats in Basey, Samar. “To all the 100 MSME exhibitors who participated, I hope that they have learned a lot and something new from virtual online selling out of their participation in the first-ever virtual trade fair as they gained sales as well,” she added. The 100 MSMEs in Eastern Visayas joined the opening program of the trade fair via Zoom. Aside from the respective MSMEs Facebook page, their products were also displayed through the Bahandi Eastern Visayas Regional Trade Fair social media page.

Dr. Flora Bigot, head of the Provincial Veterinary Office, said Tuesday they are currently gearing up for the full implementation on Dec. 4 of Ordinance No. 36, which sets the “regulatory guidelines and preventive measures to prevent the entry of ASF” in the province. She said the ordinance mainly strengthened the two executive orders previously issued by Gov. Reynaldo Tamayo Jr. on the initiatives against the ASF. It includes the mechanisms on the entry and shipment of live hogs, pork and its by-products and the regulatory measures on online selling of pork and other related products, she said. “It now has more teeth in terms of the enforcement aspect as it provided penalties for violators,” Bigot said in a media forum in Koronadal City. She specifically cited unregistered traders who will be caught selling pork and processed by-products that are sourced from areas with confirmed cases and outbreaks of the ASF. Violators will face a fine of PHP3,000 and confiscation of the concerned products for the first offense, and PHP5,000 fine along with confiscation for the second and succeeding offenses. Bigot said they are currently pushing for the adoption of the ordinance by the province’s 11 municipalities and lone city, and inclusion in the penalties the cancellation of business permits of violators. She clarified that the movement of live hogs, pork and its by-products from authorized areas or those with no ASF cases is allowed, provided that shippers secure and present proper permits and other necessary documents. The ordinance requires transported live hogs to have veterinary health certificates and veterinary shipping permits while pork products should have meat inspection certificates issued by the National Meat Inspection Service and veterinary shipping permit. Pork by-products should have proper permits from the Food and Drug Administration and other supporting documents. “The entire province remains ASF-free right now and we want to sustain that to protect our hog industry,” Bigot said. This city and South Cotabato province are currently among the top producers of live hogs and pork in the country, and ships out at least 15,000 heads every two weeks to Metro Manila and Luzon. The South Cotabato Swine Producers Association, an association of commercial swine farms based in the area, has a combined sow population of 55,000 and produces over 45,000 heads of hogs a month. About 10 percent of the group’s production is consumed in Region 12 (Soccsksargen) and it supplies the 90 percent surplus to the markets in Luzon and Visayas.

But even if he was a commission-based only hairdresser, Dennis was earning enough before the pandemic. “I had no daily wage, except for the commission from the clients that I handled. But I had no complaints because the salon business was doing well until the pandemic happened,” he said. The 32-year-old hairdresser felt the severity of the repercussion of the pandemic to his livelihood when, during the lockdowns, he had to rely on the help of his sister to get by. “The food ration from the government also meant a lot,” he said. Even when the government allowed salons to reopen in June, things remained hard for all salon workers. There were days when Dennis returned home with only P25 \"take-home pay\" — and those were \"lucky days\". “Minsan talaga — wala (Sometimes there is none),” he said. His worries, however, were eventually dampened when the local government of Davao implemented the \"TUPAD\" Project for Dabawenyos who lost their jobs in the time of the pandemic. A project of the Department of Labor and Employment, TUPAD or “Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers is a community-based package of assistance that provides emergency employment for displaced workers, underemployed and seasonal workers, for a minimum period of 10 days, but not to exceed a maximum of 30 days, depending on the nature of work to be performed.” During her State of the City Address recently, Mayor Inday Sara Duterte said the project has also helped jeepney drivers whose incomes have been greatly reduced because of the distancing requirements in public transportation. “And just very recently, we used the same assistance to help out the displaced workers of the businesses affected by the liquor ban,” she said. Commissioner Norman Baloro of Commission on the Urban Poor, who facilitated the implementation of the project in Davao, said the LGU received P71,424,740.00 as of December 11 last year. As of now, the program has covered 5, 697 Dabawenyos and it aims to cover more displaced workers. Complementing TUPAD program is the LGU’s own \"Work For Davao Cash for Work\" initiative that has provided cash assistance to at least 20,180 Dabawenyos who lost their jobs during the pandemic. The program targets to cover 42,915 beneficiaries. Baloro, who is also the focal person of the Davao’s Work for Davao, announced that the city has recently opened for a special batch of Dabawenyos — serving 23rd and final batches of beneficiaries who were affected by the pandemic lockdowns. The program has a budget of P169,944,000 from the Local Government Support Fund downloaded from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). Through the program, a worker-beneficiary will receive P3,960 for their 10-day community work. Dabawenyos who are interested to become beneficiaries are invited to submit applications from November 25 to 27, 2020 to the City Social Welfare and Development Office near them. Mark L. Gacutan, a resident of Barangay Talomo, was one of the first beneficiaries of the program. He responded to the invitation of the local government after the company he was working with shut down because of the pandemic. “For almost 4 months I was jobless,” he said. When he was accepted, he was tasked to assist other applicants for the program. “Maraming kwento ng bawat ka-barangay namin ang narinig ko. Pakiusap. Hinaing sa sitwasyon natin ngayon. At lubos ang kanilang pasasalamat kqhit hindi pa nila alam mung magiging qualified ba sila (There are many stories from barangay residents – appeals and sentiments. They are thankful though still awaiting for the approval of their applications)” he said. Gacutan said his acceptance to the program opened not only an opportunity for him but also for others. “Magandang experience ang dumating sa akin. Dahil sa Work For Davao, nagsimula akong makapagtinda online ng mga homemade foods (I was able to pursue online selling for homemade food). Nagsimula  ako sa puhunan ng (My starting capital was) P2,000,” he said. “Sa unang linggo ko, nadoble ang puhunan ko. Sa 2nd week ganon din. Sa ngayon, madami na din ako naging reseller (My capital doubled on the first and second weeks. Now I have many resellers),” he added. But the most important lesson he picked up from his experience with the \"Work For Davao\" program was “community participation and involvement.” “I also felt the concern of the government for its people. And the local government does not discriminate — it helps everyone,” he said. For Dennis, the salary he received from TUPAD  helped him through the pandemic. But his experience also helped him realized one important lesson in life. “Working at TUPAD during the pandemic taught me a lot of lessons — it is the importance of saving money for the rainy days,” he said. He also realized the importance of education. “I failed to finish my college studies. I think it would have been easier for me if I had a college education,” he said. Baloro, meanwhile, pointed out the objectives of government interventions such as \"TUPAD\" and \"Work For Davao\" Program. “Promoting self-reliance is an integral role of the government. The City Government of Davao fosters community involvement and participation of Dabawenyos through the Work for Davao Program,” he said. \"Aside from giving the opportunity to retrenched individuals due to Covid-19 pandemic, allowing them to work for a couple of days and earn money, Work for Davao beneficiaries experienced more than that. They were able to build linkages and establish connections in their own barangays,” he added. He highlighted the impact of these programs not only on individual beneficiaries but also on the entire community. “They were able to help not just their own families but improve the entire community as well. There is a realization that City Government of Davao functions as a safety net helping individuals who were out of work due to Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1121925","title":"DTI sees lower sales at Region 8’s ‘Bahandi’ trade fair","date":" November 16, 2020, 1:50 pm","body":"TACLOBAN CITY – The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is eyeing only PHP1 million sales from the first virtual “Bahandi” trade fair linking local producers with buyers through digital means.  DTI Region 8 (Eastern Visayas) regional director Celerina Bato said the online trade fair from Nov. 16 to 20 targets lower sales since there are many limitations in online selling, especially for those micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) and buyers who are not used to the online trading platform.  “Unlike physical trade fairs wherein buyers touch the products, this virtual trade fair will solely depend on the product photos that will be uploaded on virtual platforms.

He also reported some discussions that transpired during the Cabinet meeting with President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on Oct. 13, 2020. He said with more than seven months of battling against Covid-19, the country should have already equipped itself on preventing the transmission, as the government shifts its strategies from risk avoidance to risk management. “Tayo ay magre-reopen ng economy.

Meanwhile, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) is eyeing to allow people aged 16 to 65 to go outside their homes in efforts to increase generated income of businesses, and further revive economic activities. “Iba pa po yung nag-open tayo ng economy, pero kung marami naman tayong hindi pinapalabas ay mahinang-mahina yung mga businesses, yung mga kita ng ating mga workers (We have opened the economy, but many are not allowed to go out which in return slows down income of businesses and workers),” he said.

These changes are evident in the way people meet and do their daily tasks. What used to be crowded places suddenly became so quiet and empty. As life is likened to a television series or movie, the show must go on for people despite the situation. While many view the situation as hopeless and gloomy, there are still those who see a silver lining and strive to move forward with the hope of a better tomorrow. For psychology professor James Philip Ray Pinggolio, the pandemic has brought a lot of realization and positive changes. \"The pandemic has brought many challenges, and I had a hard time adjusting. But if we look around, there are actually opportunities amid the crisis that people are dealing with,\" he told the Philippine News Agency in an interview on Sunday. As a professor, the main challenge for Pinggolio is the online method of teaching. \"It is really hard as I am used to seeing my students every day. It is hard to give the lessons, assessments, and even to communicate online,\" he said, adding that it is also hard to require students to submit on time. Pinggolio admitted that he is not used to just staying inside the house, as he is fond of traveling to unwind. \"There are many beautiful things this pandemic had caused,\" Pinggolio said. First, he had more time for God and his family. \"I realized I forgot to give importance to my family, especially to my parents. I was busy with work. I did not have time to eat with them, bond with them, and to check how they are doing. (Before the) pandemic, I was busy and did not have the time to pray and attend the church. (The pandemic) made me realize the importance of faith in God.\" Another positive side was that Pinggolio now has time to care for his physical health. Now he has the time to exercise, and even to care for plants. Further, Pinggolio decided to put up a small business, to be more productive even if he is in his house. \"It is up to you how you would make things worthwhile. There are many things that can be done inside the house,\" he said. To keep one's sanity, Pinggolio suggests balancing priorities is crucial. \"The best way for me to keep my sanity is first, accept that things change, and only God knows what will happen next. Have faith,\" he said. He said it is important for people to increase positive emotions. \"We have to acknowledge the negative feelings. However, we should not forget the positive emotions. Not every day is a sunny day. There could be times that are rainy or stormy. We have to deal with it,\" he pointed out. To have self-compassion is also important, according to Pinggolio. \"Do not be hard on yourself. Do not overindulge on negative feelings. Lift your spirit. Do not feel you are alone,\" he said. Housewife Glenda Flaviano also saw the brighter side of the situation. Apart from being able to bond more with her kids, Flaviano said she was able to save some money since going to the mall for non-essential purposes is restricted. \"Not much has changed in my lifestyle. The main difference now is that my kids are here. I am trying online gaming so I could play with them,\" she shared. Flaviano was also able to expand her online selling business during the pandemic. For media relations manager, Pao Oga, on the other hand, speaking with his loved ones and friends virtually, working out, watching Netflix has kept him busy to adjust to the situation. \"I was too bored thinking of the current situation and the fact that I am stuck at home. But now, I realized I have a choice to go out to buy food and other essentials,\" he said, adding that he was able to adjust with the situation. As non-contact sports were eventually allowed by the government, Oga added that he is also able to play badminton with his friends while observing safety measures.

Initially, members of the Facebook group were only family and friends in their neighborhood until they invited more people in the private group and reached more than 1,000 members by the end of 2019, Ramos said. When the pandemic hit the country, however, they added online food sellers and buyers mostly from Malolos and neighboring municipalities in Bulacan like Guiguinto and Calumpit. According to Ramos, Food Malolos Group now has over 20,000 members with some members are based in Metro Manila. Of the total members, around 70 percent are online food and food-related sellers – 10 percent of which had their physical stores before the pandemic, and the rest are new online entrepreneurs. From sideline to livelihood Kris Villanueva, an online seller in Food Malolos Group, has resigned from her work as a teacher and guidance counselor in a private school and decided to focus on her business. Villanueva said cooking and online selling were not new to her as she loves to cook and was selling her specialty ‘relyenong bangus’ (stuffed milkfish) as a sideline before the Covid-19 pandemic. She and her partner decided to expand their food business as they now also cook and sell other Filipino food.  “In terms of income, I proudly say that it’s better in business. You will learn how to budget, limit your expenses, and save from your earnings. Eventually, your business will grow as long as you know how to handle your money. Plus, you don't have bosses! You have all your time. And no more paperwork, but more on accounting,” she added. Villanueva said they are planning to open their physical store once the Covid-19 health crisis is over. “For now, we will continue what we've started, selling food online since we're known already and we’re having customers from different areas in Bulacan,” she said. Villanueva is still doing teaching jobs but only for tutorials as she focuses on her online food venture. Source of income for displaced workers Food Malolos Group also provided a new source of income for people who lost their jobs but have motorcycles. Ramos said they have seen the need to also include riders to cater to delivery services for food sellers and their customers. Since the group’s system is not as sophisticated as delivery apps, he said Food Malolos Group’s administrators manually assign delivery men to online food sellers. Food Malolos Group, which maintains standard delivery fees, also regulates its members by requiring them to indicate prices of products they are posting and to follow the standard delivery fees for riders. “Hindi kami naniningil sa riders ng membership fee gaya ng mga delivery apps. Nagbubutaw lang sila araw-araw ng PHP35 dahil required para sa business permit namin na kumikita kami (We don’t ask our riders for membership fee, unlike delivery app companies. They just give us PHP35 per day as dues because we have to earn so we can get business permit),” Ramos said. He said people behind Food Malolos Group earn an average of PHP30,000 a month from riders’ PHP35-per-day contributions. “Ayaw talaga sana naming maningil pero kailangang kumikita ka para mabigyan ka ng business permit (We really don’t want to charge fees but we need to so we can get business permit),” he added. He is also proud that Food Malolos Group is registered with the Department of Trade and Industry and now pays taxes to the government. “Gusto lang naming makatulong sa komunidad namin noong ECQ. Natutuwa naman kami na marami na rin pala kaming natulungan lalo na ‘yong mga nawalan ng trabaho (We just want to help to the community during the ECQ. We are happy that we have helped many especially those who lost their jobs)” he added.

The city government on Thursday signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the administrators of Valenzuela Online Palengke and Valenzuela Online Tiangge to enable local entrepreneurs to gain a wider market. Mayor Rex Gatchalian said the pact seeks to provide the necessary support for small-time sellers shifting to the new normal of online selling. \"We will help her get these pages out in the market through boosts and online ads. In return, her pages will become the online marketplace for our home-based entrepreneurs who wish to get their products in the digital marketplace,\" Gatchalian said in a social media post on Thursday night. \"This is our way of helping our micro, small, and medium entrepreneurs.\" Under the agreement, the city government would boost the posts of local SMMEs and online sellers on Facebook to help them reach a wider range of audience apart from their pages' followers, targeting consumers residing outside Valenzuela. “We tapped into existing capacities out there, through this partnership, we want to make sure that there is space for SMMEs to be able to sell and get their products out there,\" he said. The city government would be in charge of the advertising, boosting, placing banner ads, and provide other online efforts for these Facebook pages, Gatchalian added. Meanwhile, Donna Aguirre, administrator of Valenzuela Online Palengke, thanked the city government for helping small entrepreneurs expand their businesses amid the health crisis, a move that she described as \"timely\". “I am very grateful because the group is supported by the city government of Valenzuela. I am also very thankful for this project because it will help our online sellers who have been displaced by this pandemic,\" Aguirre said. Two weeks right after the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila, she began to create a community group to curate online sellers in Valenzuela City. Aguirre initially created a Facebook group for personal online browsing and purchasing of necessities without needing to go out, which follows the minimum health standards to halt the transmission of Covid-19. \"At least nakikita natin ‘yung (we can see the) support ng (of the) city government for small businesses. Hindi lang yung malalaking businesses ‘yung sinu-support, pati yung mga maliliit na businesses din (They are not only supporting big businesses but small businesses as well),” she said. According to the city government, Valenzuela Online Palengke has gained more than 25,000 members, leading to the establishment of the Valenzuela Online Tiangge, its counterpart for non-food items. With nearly 19,000 local SMMEs in Valenzuela, it said some small businesses have resorted to online selling via Facebook to continue earning while some physical stores' operations and public transportation are still limited. \"This endeavor also goes with the national government’s initiative to provide assistance to affected businesses and communities during the pandemic by expressing its support through the grant of financial assistance by the means of social media advertisements and as passed by the City Council in its Resolution No. 1802, series of 2020, last September 14,\" the city government said.

Mischael Aquino, 29, a mother of two, said she and her husband John Paul introduced ‘puto-pao-all-in’, an addition to their ube halaya business and sold it online with the help of their resellers during the lockdown.  “We sold it before at PHP35 per styro(foam) and it was a hit since we were the only one selling puto-pao (native rice cake stuffed with meat) topped with our very own ube halaya, cheese, and salted egg,” she said in an interview Tuesday.  Aquino said they sold 100 to 150 sets of puto-pao daily during the lockdown and their customers were from the different parts of Pangasinan.  The family’s business was established in 2018 but it took off in 2019 with the help of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the city government of Dagupan, she added.  “DTI provided us with training on how to do business. I was a graduate of DTI’s Kapatid Mentor Me Program batch 4. The DOST helped us with improving our products and innovating new products as well as with the labeling, while the city government along with DTI sent us to exhibits to showcase our products,” Aquino said.  She said ube halaya has been the business of her husband’s family since 1995. Her husband took interest in pursuing it after his father died.  “We continued the business in 2017 and became involved with the training of DTI. Later on, we were able to introduce other products aside from the ube halaya, and the latest was the ‘puto-pao-all-in’,” she added.  Aquino said her husband resigned last year from being a barangay nurse to focus on their business.  “Our business provided for our needs now. My husband and I, together with our 10-year-old (son), and sometimes, we hire one of our neighbors to help us in our production. But mostly it is just us working together,” she added.   Jarold's Super Dessert offers ube halaya, pichi-pichi, yema spread, ube jam, ube bar, maja, and their puto-pao-all-in, among others.  Its products are exhibited at the SM Center Dagupan until Oct.10 as part of the “Go Local, Buy Local” campaign of the city government.

In an interview Tuesday, Benjamin Sabiniano, owner of the newly opened woodworking factory, said the pandemic has hard-hit the business industry due to restrictions in travel that made it almost impossible for them to outsource materials as well as deliver their products.  “I used to work in a woodworks factory here in our barangay. Despite the restrictions in travel, there are still customers and online selling was also a big help,” he said.  Sabiniano said when he finally got enough money from his ‘paluwagan’ (money lending system), he decided to open his own factory and hired his nephews while one of his daughters marketed their products online.  “We focus marketing in the town and other nearby towns that do not require travel pass or authority,” he added.  Sabiniano’s woodworks prices range from PHP2,500 to PHP10,000 depending on what kind of furniture or woodwork their clients order.  He and his nephew build living room sets, dining room sets, cabinets, tables, and chairs, among others. Due to the indoor plant trend, they are also starting to accept orders for plant cabinets or display racks.  He added that when they have not enough raw materials for the woodworks, most of them look for other jobs like helping their former employer while some are into agriculture.  Sabiniano said the government’s subsidy has also helped his family get through the lockdown.  “The first months of the pandemic paralyzed our business since everything has been stopped. Fortunately, we have received a subsidy from the national government as I am a member of the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps), which was a big help for us to survive,”  said Sabiniano, who has nine children.  Meanwhile, Jorel Montemayor, one of Sabiniano’s workers, said he was glad that they are now able to continue their work at the factory.  He admitted that loss of income in the first months of the pandemic got him “feeling so down”.  “I have two children and I felt sad that I couldn’t buy them enough milk. Then I learned that our work continues even (though) there was a lockdown at that time since there were orders online,” he said.

It's not easy, according to Jaramine Manalang, a solo parent of five. She said Christian Ribay, her eldest son, is doing portraits or artworks in exchange for some money to raise funds for a laptop or a personal computer for his online classes. “Raising five school-age children is not an easy task for ‘complete’ families, more so for a solo parent like me,” says Jaramine. Amid the pandemic, Jaramine has to make ends meet most especially for her children. Because of the “no face-to-face policy” for this academic year, the blended online learning was introduced by the Department of Education through the utilization of printed modules and online classes. But purchasing a laptop, tablet, or a personal computer does not fit in Jaramine's budget. Her son, Christian, a Grade 11 student taking up Fine Arts and Design at the University of Perpetual Help Molino Campus in Bacoor, Cavite, will not be able to work without a computer for his online classes. Seeing Christian’s talent and his eagerness to finish studies so he could eventually help her in raising his siblings, she said it breaks her heart that she is unable to provide for her son’s needs. Not knowing where to get the money for his son’s laptop or tablet, Jaramine turned to Facebook for help. Jaramine wrote a post on Facebook: “Hello and Good day everyone. I am asking for a little time from all of you. I am raising funds for my eldest son Christian Ribay called, #ChristiansArtForACause. On his behalf, he is accepting a job to draw a portrait of you or any work of art, the price is cheap for an amateur like him”. Jaramine said the funds they will be collecting will be used to buy Christian the gadget that he needs for his online classes. Currently, Christian has availed of a government voucher, which is already a big help for them. “It is very important for me to finish my studies so I can help my mom and my younger siblings,” Christian said. His classes already started last August 24 and admits that he finds it very hard to cope with the challenge. Jaramine worked as a cook for a catering business before the pandemic. But because of Covid-19, the catering business had to close, leaving Jaramine unemployed with children to feed. She got into online selling of various items which somehow helped her earn some income, which is still not enough. “I am a solo parent of five, for years now. And it took so hard for me to raise them alone. Buying a laptop or PC is a very hard thing for me to do,” she said. Jaramine also posted sample artworks made by Christian on her Facebook post. “He is very eager to finish his studies and wanted to help me, his family, in the future. I hope with a little help from you all, his dream and wish will be possible,\" she said. Christian just finished doing a portrait for two friends of his mom scheduled to be delivered anytime, and he is just excited as he loves drawing very much. “I do a portrait or a drawing for about three hours, depends on the type of artwork, and I am enjoying it,” Christian said. \"For those may be willing to help me with my studies in exchange for my artworks, that would be a big help for me and my family”. Not giving up and believing that they, together with all the other parents struggling during these trying times, Jaramine believes there are still kind-hearted people who are willing to help them, most especially his son, Christian. While many families wade through the same situation they face, she told them to “be strong, do not give up and make your children your source of strength to continue fighting so you could take care of them\". Those who are interested to help them may directly message Jaramine Manalang or Christian Ribay through Facebook.

Calling the act as “unacceptable”, Domagoso is also requesting the Bureau of Immigration to deport the two Chinese nationals listed as part of the incorporators of the EFBPI. He said that upon examination of the registration papers of the EFBPI, it revealed that the company has two Chinese nationals and three Filipinos as its incorporators, whom Domagoso described as “in effect are the company owners”. The two Chinese nationals were identified as Shi Zhong Xing and Shi Li Li. “We are requesting that deportation proceedings be initiated against Shi Zhong Xing and Shi Li Li,” Domagoso said in his letter. The letters will be sent to the NBI and the BI on Monday. Domagoso said that the two Chinese and the three Filipinos should be held responsible for the violations committed by the EFBPI. “Their utter disrespect to the country as shown by the violations of EFB should not be countenanced. We cannot let these foreign nationals insult our nation and our people,” the letter reads. On Thursday, Domagoso ordered the closure of the business establishment together with the other three stalls selling the products in Divisoria Mall. The closure of the business establishment was prompted by the viral photo of EFBPT’s cosmetic product “Ashley Keratin Treatment Deep Repair” wherein the packaging is labeled with address in “Manila, Province of China” Domagoso said that the misinformation in the packaging of the said product “is an affront to the sovereignty of the Philippines and an insult to its duly constituted authorities” The company, Domagoso said, committed violations of prevailing laws and regulations such as Section 40(a) of RA 7394 otherwise known as the Consumer Act of the Philippines, Section 10 of RA 9711 otherwise known as the Food and Drugs Administration Act of 2009, and Engaging in online selling without the requisites permit.

Stray cats and dogs are starving, too. For Josephine and her daughter Jenica Victoria, the sad plight of animals in these trying times include the uncertainty on where to find food and the displacement caused by restrictions and lockdowns amid the pandemic. Each day, they prepare animal food and venture out to drop off meals for more or less 30 cats and dogs at various places in Poblacion Pulilan to Plaridel Highway in Bulacan. They used to feed stray cats and dogs near the roads, gas stations, and in some closed establishments. Despite the risks of the dreaded disease, they patiently come out and hike for hours daily to make sure that stray animals are provided with food. Feeding stray animals In an interview, Jenica told PNA that during months of doing helping stray cats and dogs, she said they cannot help but get attached to the animals. They committed to feed the cats and dogs until the community quarantine is lifted. Five months since the community quarantines in the National Capital Region and other parts of Luzon, Jenica thought that the closure of restaurants and other food establishments would leave out stray animals to expect for leftover meals. During the lockdowns, she and her mother made sure the cats and dogs have enough food to eat. \"Nakita naman namin ang sitwasyon po nila nun panahon ng ECQ na struggle na nga sila makahanap ng pagkain lalo pang mas naging mahirap lalo wala talaga silang source dahil sarado lahat (We saw their situation during the enhanced community quarantine when they struggled to find food. It became even more difficult when establishments were closed and they lack any source of food),\" she said. Jenica and her mother did not complain about the bad weather just to help the animals in the middle of the crisis. At first, they were called out by authorities for not staying at home amid the restrictions. It pushed them to secure an agricultural certification, a permit allowing them to do stray feeding.  They have started to make DIY (do-it-yourself) stray feeding and water dispenser to preserve foods for cats and dogs. The challenge of walking three hours every day became meaningful to Jenica and Josephine. \"Masaya po kami pag nakikita po namin silang nabubusog at nakikita po namin yun saya sa mga mata nila pag dumadating kami kahit na di sila nakakapagsalita, naipaparamdam po nila sa bawat kawag po ng buntot nila na appreciate nila ang ginagawa po namin sa kanila (We are happy to see them full and seeing joy in their eyes when we arrive. Even if they can't talk, they made us feel appreciated by wiggling their tails),\" Jenica shared.  Meanwhile, Jenica assured that while they are doing the stray feeding, they are still adhering to health and safety protocols.

The Department of Tourism (DOT) launched the Philippine Harvest e-commerce site, accessible via phharvestdot.com, in partnership with IT solutions company Cloud Panda PH. Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat encouraged the public to maximize the use of the internet by supporting local businesses. The new e-commerce site is a stand-alone online platform that aims to promote Philippine culture through food that is local, organic, artisanal, and indigenous, and to alleviate the economic impact brought by the pandemic to the local farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises. Philippine Harvest products can also be delivered by the merchants straight to the customer, making culinary experience more obtainable to every Filipino household. All partner-merchants will have access to the business tools available in the online platform. They will also be provided with their respective accounts for order tracking, inventory management, product catalogues, and links to their social media sites, among others. “Cloud Panda has been developing applications and software that provide assistance to businesses. We are happy to be working with them now more than ever, knowing that they will help us strengthen the Philippine Harvest initiative in making Philippine-made produces readily available to the Filipinos,” Romulo-Puyat added. “Our country’s agricultural harvest is considerably vast, it only needs an effective channel to reach the right consumer, and I believe the technology that we have today can help us achieve that goal,” Cloud Panda PH Co-founder Carlito Macadangdang said. “I believe that Philippines Harvest initiative is the right path in moving people and produce towards a common goal, to help feed the economy during these trying times,” Cloud Panda PH co-founder Jonathan So added. The DOT’s Philippine Harvest started its online leg on April 22 through its Facebook page at facebook.com/PhilippineHarvest and was also made available via Grab Philippines on July 6.

Dr. Allan Poquita, BFAR-7 regional director, said his office has monitored a growing number of fishermen and other individuals in the region that have resorted to online selling of seafood products to earn a living amid the health crisis. He attributed this to the difficulty of some fisherfolk in bringing their products to the market due to the quarantine measures imposed in many areas. “We are happy that people are venturing into this enterprise to cater to the needs of people in their localities nowadays,” he said during a virtual talk show hosted by the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas over the weekend. Provincial fishery officers in Central Visayas, who also joined the online talk show, shared the same observation, saying that many people have responded to the crisis by either selling seafood online or peddling them on the streets. Bohol provincial fishery officer Candido Samijon said they have recorded more than 1,000 people in the agricultural island who have been peddling fish products in recent months in high-traffic areas like Tagbilaran City. “People selling seafood online is also increasing here,” he said in Cebuano. The BFAR-Cebu office is also encouraging people to explore income opportunities in fish selling, especially at this time when many livelihoods have been lost during the crisis. Meanwhile, BFAR-7 is set to increase fish production in Central Visayas through the provision of fingerlings and technical assistance to small-scale fisherfolk and their organizations. Poquita said the plan is in response to the call of Agriculture Secretary William Dar to refocus the agency’s programs in order to respond immediately to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic to the fishery sector. The agency has also stepped up its regular price monitoring, fishing boats distribution and constant dialog with fisherfolk groups to ensure the fishery sector’s sustained contribution in the government’s food security program, he said. There are more than 100,000 registered fisherfolk in Central Visayas, according to BFAR-7 data.

In an interview on Tuesday, Opalyn Caguiao, one of the owners of Soping Garden, said their customers have increased, especially for indoor plants, as well as succulents and cactus.  To meet the growing demand, Caguiao said they have increased the number of their workers from only four or five to 12.  “They are also family members and relatives who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic but since the demand for our products and services increased, we accommodated them to work for us,” she added.  Caguiao attributed the rise in the popularity of plants and gardening to the Internet or online selling.  “We also have resellers who promote our products online,” she said.  However, Caguiao said the prices of plants from their suppliers have also increased, hence, the need for them to adjust their costing.

We also offer something new in our menu every week, everything that’s on trend we should have so people keep on choosing us,” he said. DCCI president Tria said businessmen need to be mindful of challenges and opportunities, as well as market preferences, under certain economic conditions. “Innovation and digitalization will be critical. The recent months have shown that Davao has opportunities for business that are resilient even during disruptions, like food production and exports, BPOs, agribusiness and digital services. As the economy continues to recover more businesses will begin their restart under new normals,” he added.Improving business climateHe said the LGU has helped businesses by waiving penalties and interest on business taxes that were falling during quarantine periods and extended deadlines for real property tax payments.“This, of course, apart from the measures to contain and control infections,” Tria said.The local government has provided support for local farmers by ensuring the transport of their goods to markets. “This also helps local businesses by ensuring raw material supply especially for local restaurants,” he added.The LGU, he said, laid out several programs such as ”Work for Davao and Eskwela Davao” that are helping many who were unemployed or lost their jobs during the quarantine period.“As a whole, this will drive both demand and consumption which is good for business, the climate of which has improved,” Tria added.

In an interview during the Laging Handa PH program aired over state-owned PTV Wednesday, Guballa said small business owners need not worry about registration and about paying taxes if their earnings do not exceed PHP250,000 annually since they are exempted from paying income tax.  He said registration fee for online sellers is PHP500 and that is the only fee they need to pay unless they do not qualify for tax exemption.  “What we want to tax are the big businesses involved in digital transactions like Lazada and those operated by foreign entities like Netflix,” he added.  Guballa further said the call for business owners with digital operations to register with BIR has been made since 2013.  “We just reiterated recently because the number of businesses engaged on online selling rose during the lockdown,” he said.  Guballa said what the government wants is to collect value-added tax (VAT) from big businesses using digital transactions.  For service providers that have main offices overseas like Netflix, Guballa said tax that will be collected is VAT since its service is being consumed locally.

In a virtual briefing Wednesday, InLife executive chairman of the board Nina Aguas said the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is “a reality we all face” since it hampered companies’ operations.  “The exact financial outcome of InLife would be continuous work in progress as we slowly begin to appreciate the still unmeasurable impact of Covid,” she said.  At the end of 2019, the company’s net worth stood at PHP39.33 billion with asset base at PHP138.2 billion.  Gross benefits and claims paid reached PHP11.1 billion, legal policy reserves amounted to PHP58.2 billion, and business in-force totaled to PHP356.45 billion.  Aguas said demand for risk protection and health care coverage is on the uptrend, but they do not want to put any figure on their end-2020 results because “we still do not know really the sentiment of the future policyholders or our clients and customers.”  “Even though we’re very optimistic, I would not give out a number to say really that it will be better or it would be worse because I think this is the worst that we’ve seen,” she said, citing that no industry has imagined the current situation happening a year or five years ago.  She advised their policyholders to exercise caution on their investments and in managing risks and assured them “our investment team is continually monitoring this financial market and is ready to take measures and prudent action as opportunities arise.”  Meanwhile, Aguas said InLife is open for a partnership on healthcare services like telemedicine to be able to cater to more clients.  She said they registered an uptake on interest for their healthcare products especially during the quarantine period starting mid-March, which was implemented by the government to arrest the spread of Covid-19.  “We saw a phenomenal rise of those buying prepaid insurance, health coverages, for example, in the early months including today. So we are investing. We’re doing it internally now with no partners but that is not to say we will not do so because the opportunity is clearly there, particularly on the healthcare side,” she added.  During the same briefing, Raoul Littaua, InLife senior executive vice president, said while they registered increased inquiry during the quarantine period, these did not automatically translate to actual sales.  He said they were able to equip their agents to adapt to online selling of InLine products during the quarantine period but customers also need to adapt to the new way like digital selling, electronic signatures, online payments, and online presentations.  “Consumers, in general, also need to do a lot of adjustments,” he said, adding that insurance products are not a simple product of signing up for.

I don’t think that is the immediate issue,” he said in a statement Wednesday.  Funa said the enhanced community quarantine’s (ECQ) initial impact will be on the insurance companies’ investments and sales of their products.  “That is why I allowed them to resort to online selling. In terms of investments, we all know that all industries will take a hit,” he added.  Under Republic Act (RA) 10607, otherwise known as the Insurance Code, new players are required to have a PHP1-billion paid-up capital.  For existing insurance companies, they are required to have a minimum net worth of PHP250 million by June 30, 2013; PHP550 million by Dec. 31, 2016; PHP900 million by Dec. 31, 2019; and PHP1.3 billion by Dec. 31, 2022.  Insurance Commission (IC) Media Relations Officer lawyer Joanne Frances D.C. Castro told journalists in a Viber message they did a survey among insurers regarding Covid-19 coverage and related claims “in order for us to make an initial impact assessment of the Covid-19 pandemic.”  “No update on the results yet because the deadline for this was yesterday (April 29),” she said, adding they will make public the results of the survey once it is available.

Nufable led personnel of DTI-Negros Occidental in meeting with representatives of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)-Bacolod on Tuesday, after coordinating with the group from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG)-Negros Occidental in Bacolod last week. Nufable said they discussed the guidelines on the implementation of the prevailing 60-day price freeze, specifically the ceiling that should be followed by retail establishments. On Tuesday afternoon, the NBI arrested three persons during an entrapment operation in a store on Galo Street here. The suspects sold to the agents two bottles of 250 mL of ethyl alcohol at PHP90 each, which is way higher than the PHP41 ceiling price set by the DTI. Also found in the possession of the suspects were 37 gallons of ethyl alcohol and 104 bottles of 250 mL alcohol. Engiemar Tupas, officer-in-charge industry development division of DTI-Negros Occidental, said they have also been receiving reports of overpriced face masks and alcohol sold online. As of Monday, at least three complaints from cities of Bacolod, San Carlos and Kabankalan have been lodged before their office. “We warned these local online sellers and advised them to take down their posts. However, some of them continue to sell overpriced products,” he said. For instance, alcohol products are sold from PHP500 to PHP1,000 each, which is more than triple the ceiling prices. “Some of the products sold online are even adulterated as these have no brands and labels,” Tupas said. He added that they have already forwarded the complaints to the NBI and the CIDG. After President Rodrigo Duterte declared a state of public health emergency on March 8, a 60-day automatic price control (APC), especially among basic necessities, took effect. Other products covered by the price freeze include drugs and other medical supplies like face masks and alcohol classified as essential by the Department of Health (DOH). The price of masks should be within the ceiling of PHP3 to PHP12 while alcohol should be sold in the range of PHP17.25 to PHP74.25 depending on the brand and net weight. In a memorandum, the DTI said that online selling of any of these emergency medical supplies that are beyond the price ceiling is prohibited. A seller who commits any act of illegal price manipulation or violation of the Price Act shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to PHP2 million, it added.

In a radio interview on Thursday, DTI Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said the department had an arrangement with big online selling platforms to refuse sellers that offer expensive hygiene products.  “They will not accept it if they are overpriced,” Castelo said.  In the United States, an online merchant who had 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer can no longer sell his products online after e-commerce company Amazon suspended his account and other online sellers who are overpricing their products.

Please report to us if you know local online sellers,” she said in an interview Friday. Since Thursday, some residents here have started complaining in their Facebook posts about the limited stocks of alcohol and face masks being sold in the market. Reishan Paredes, a mother of three from Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, said a 150-milliliter (ml) pocket-size alcohol is now more expensive than a 500-ml similar brand of alcohol, which she just bought for PHP73 barely last month. While posting a photo on Facebook of the price comparison, which she finds too excessive, Paredes said panic buying really causes an artificial shortage. With this, the DTI is urging consumers to report online stores and individuals who are hoarding and selling overpriced rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, and other medical supplies. The DTI reminded the public that under the Price Act, hoarding and other illegal acts of price manipulation are punishable and subjected to a penalty of imprisonment for a period of not less than PHP5,000 to more than PHP1 million.

He said Duterte has agreed with DTI’s proposal and the EO is expected to be out “as soon as possible”. Lopez said the EO will include measures against online sellers that are overpricing personal hygiene products. “Online selling of masks and/or medical devices including alcohol, sanitizers, and the like will be strictly monitored and profiteering and hoarding will be dealt with,” he said. He added that the EO will arm DTI with “visitorial powers” together with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and National Bureau Investigation (NBI) to prevent hoarding and profiteering. “For the deputization also of NBI and PNP for police and intel support. Extra warning for online sellers for overpricing and hoarding,” Lopez said. Edmond Ramos from Bulacan has encountered an online seller selling 500-milliliter isopropyl alcohol at PHP350 per bottle, which is only PHP75 per bottle in supermarkets. Joe Marie Torrefiel, also from Bulacan, said he already reported to DTI an online seller that prices a box of 50 pieces of surgical masks for PHP1,700. Consumers also shared their own experiences as they observed panic buying in supermarkets and groceries. Arjhay Dulalia, who went for their regular shopping in a supermarket in Valenzuela City on Wednesday night, said they queued for nearly four hours in the cashier as many of the customers were buying supplies more than what they needed. The team leader of the said supermarket in Valenzuela City told the Philippine News Agency that cashiers and other staff have to extend their working hours as customers flocked the store that day and bought supplies in larger volumes. “We were really stressed. We had a very long queue and our workers have to extend working hours to refill stocks in preparation for the next day,” he said. On the other hand, a supermarket in Meycauayan City, Bulacan implemented its own measure to prevent panic buying by limiting the purchase of alcohol up to two bottles per customer. Laban Konsyumer Inc. president Victorio Mario Dimagiba said the behavior of panic buying among consumers by going to supermarkets can even cause the spread of Covid-19. “The panic buying we are seeing violates the experts’ advice to limit social contact,” Dimagiba said in Filipino.

Under the Grow with Google program, the MSME Caravan will be conducted nationwide this year to train entrepreneurs in utilizing Google platforms, such as Google My Business and the Primer app that are useful in daily operations, as well as to improve the entrepreneurial skills of MSMEs. “We are glad to partner with the Department of Trade and Industry in our mission to digitize MSMEs in the country. Combine that with the new tools and opportunities of the internet and there is no limit on what’s possible for them,” Google Philippines Country Director Bernadette Nacario said. On the sidelines of the event, Google Philippines Head for Government Affairs and Public Policy Yves Gonzales said the program targets the MSMEs in provinces where there is low awareness in going digital for their businesses. “One key challenge in their mind is they have to pay for the tools,” Gonzales said, adding that both Google My Business and Primer are free online platforms. Google My Business allows entrepreneurs to be more searchable online by registering their business information like address, map direction, and contact details. Gonzales said registered businesses on this platform appear on “near me” function of Google, which helps those who are searching for stores, products, and services near their current location. “When you have a tourist coming to the Philippines and he wants to try lechon in the Philippines, the first thing that the tourist will do is to search Google Maps or Google Search ‘lechon near me’. When you have your own website, you will be searchable and be searched in the Maps,” he said. From 2017 to 2019, searches for stores, products, and services on Google’s “near me” have increased by 2.5 times. “Another important thing is validation. It adds credibility to the MSME, especially when we are talking about exporting. When a potential buyer looks up your business, the first thing they’ll ask themselves is let’s go to their website and let’s see who their corporate people are and their experiences. It really helps the business to grow internally and even export-wise when they have their own website,” he added. The Primer app enables business owners to download lessons and courses such as digital marketing, branding, and online selling. Gonzales said this platform is helpful for those who cannot attend the MSME Caravan or those who would like a refresher of lessons from the Caravan. Data from the DTI show that 99 percent of establishments in the country are MSMEs. They employ 63 percent of the workforce and share 25 percent of export revenues.

Yang said some relatives of the missing persons, whose ages range from 16 to 22 years old, admitted that some of them were involved in illegal drug transactions. \"A parent of one of them mentioned something about the involvement of his child in illegal drugs. Meanwhile, one said his/her sibling is missing and is also involved in illegal drugs,\" Yang told reporters during the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) regular press briefing held at the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Station 10 on Tuesday.

The social media posts about the white van and missing children in Metro Manila have become viral for several times in the past. Recently, a video clip from closed-circuit television (CCTV) uploaded on Facebook captured how a minor was allegedly taken by a group on board a white van in the southern part of Metro Manila. Pasay City Mayor Emi Calixto-Rubiano earlier instructed Yang to look into reports about the alleged kidnapping incidents in the city. The mayor also reminded citizens to first report these incidents to their nearest community police precinct before posting it on social media. For his part, NCRPO acting director Brig. Gen. Debold Sinas belied reports that the abductions were staged by syndicates involved in selling internal organs. He said reports, particularly those circulating online, in which a white van is going around Metro Manila and other nearby provinces to take children for their internal organs were all fake news.

Dar said the DA is still implementing the 1-7-10 protocol wherein the government culls all pigs within the one-kilometer radius of the affected farm, while the movement of pork and pork products within seven kilometers is limited. It also conducts surveillance and monitoring within the 10-kilometer radius. He also confirmed there are already four areas cleared of ASF -- Barangays Bagong Silangan, Tatalon, Tandang Sora, and Pasong Tamo, all in Quezon City. The DA chief also noted that there is one barangay in Palayan City that have been earlier affected by the ASF virus but was already cleared. \"ASF can be controlled if everybody cooperates with the government,\" he said. On the reported selling of pork and pork products online, Dar said this should be prohibited. \"Dapat hindi mangyari yun (It should not happen). We have to tell the authorities, show us and we will confiscate those sales,\" he said. \"What we are implementing are related to food safety.

When asked why the ASF continues to spread to other areas, the DA chief admitted that there are \"lapses\" as some backyard raisers \"are keeping their pigs, they still sell their produce even if it has been contaminated with ASF virus.\" \"Another reason is that some hog traders transport their products from one area to other areas affected with ASF. This one of the major problem we encounter now,\" he added. As such, Dar appealed to all backyard hog raisers, commercial hog raisers and hog traders \"to be properly advised that if you do this illegal trade, you will be brought to court.\" \"The Department of Justice (DOJ), as part of the Cabinet decision, will now lead in bringing these hog raisers to court if they don't cooperate with the law,\" he said.

Co-founder Maricris Ansagay described Caviteñaraketeras as an informal, close group of some 691 women members composed of micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs), housewives and freelancers. “(They) bonded together to widen products and services, to share our business knowledge and best practices to the new and aspiring ones, and support each other in reaching out to a wider marker,” she said on Monday. Created in October of 2018 by founder Jhodielyn “Nham” Sonit, herself a certified “raketera”, a person who juggles with multiple jobs and sells just about anything, the community was built to support Caviteñas who are willing to be entrepreneurs or business owners, part time or full time. Sonit, who not only works as a virtual assistant for a Canadian firm but also maintains her own business involving chili garlic and shrimp paste on the side, met Ansagay in a bazaar in December last year. “That’s when we thought of the idea to locate people like us, group ourselves and together create our niche in Cavite’s wide market,” Ansagay said. The women-only group encourages members to earn, upgrade their skills and services, or just to do something productive, and might soon open its membership to men. Members are from Cavite, whether aspiring entrepreneurs or business owners engaged in online selling, business owners with brick and mortar store, and other service-based business such as food, crafts and baking. In May 18, dubbed ‘raket day’, they will meet with new members and get to know new products and find possible suppliers at the City Works Space at the Aguinaldo Highway here.

Back in February, President Rodrigo Duterte called Boracay Island a cesspool. Two months after, he ordered its closure for six months. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) was the lead agency of the task force created to oversee its rehabilitation aided by the Department of Tourism (DOT) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). In October, prior to the reopening of the island, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu declared that Boracay’s waters, particularly at the White Beach, are safe for swimming. “We declare now that Boracay Island is no longer a cesspool, but an island whose body of water surrounding it has passed the standard fit for swimming,” Cimatu said during the October “Salubungan” when the island was first opened to Aklanons. The water quality monitoring of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) showed the coliform level at the White Beach just within 3 MPN (most probable number) per 100 millimeters. The standard is 100 MPN. The people of Aklan led by Acting Mayor Abram Sualog commended the changes. “A lot has changed, big changes happened. First, our beaches are cleaner. We now have a bigger road. It’s a big help for the local government unit that the national government entered to help us solve our problems, especially on infrastructure,” he said. Infrastructure Engineer Al Fruto, assistant regional director of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 6 (Western Visayas), said before the year ends, a substantial accomplishment will be visible in terms of the implementation of their PHP540-million projects. He said the “modest contribution” of their department is the rehabilitation of major roads, particularly the gaps in the circumferential road. “Initially, what we did was to rehabilitate and upgrade the first 4.12 km. from Cagban Port passing the Rotonda to the main road and will terminate before the plaza of Barangay Balabag,” he said. The circumferential road stretches to about 20 km. The project also covers Bulabog road of almost 500 meters that serves as an alternative route going to Mt. Luho and Barangay Yapak. Not only did DPWH complete the gaps, it also widened the road from the width of 8 to 12 meters. Fruto said there are “well-meaning friends” who helped pro bono and established a design that would complement the overall concept of really rehabilitating the island.  They also tapped the services of consultants, who helped rehabilitate Iloilo City and suburban areas, such as the group of architect Paulo Alcazaren. “We consulted landscape architects to come up with an ideal concept of designing a road complete with the furniture of a road such as pedestrians, sidewalks, tree planting, pavement marking, signages,” Fruto said. The PHP540 million is “just really the tip of the iceberg,” he said, adding their office has “totally committed to help in the rehab of the island.” “Actually, what we planned a year before the pronouncement of the President of Boracay being a cesspool. We have interventions that we have started,” he said. He added the closure gave them the “opportunity to implement the plan that we have worked on.” The regional director said that they have a PHP1.7-billion action plan to fully rehabilitate and improve the main road of Boracay. “The success of the interventions of the government anchors on infrastructure support. We really look at all major roads of the island will be walkable. There will be traffic regulations, such that there are defined paths, loading and unloading areas,” he emphasized. The DPWH is designing roads with a wider space for pedestrians. “From what we have experienced in Iloilo City, it is possible if we can provide the proper infrastructure, so it becomes friendly to pedestrians,” he said. As part of infrastructure support, the Department of Energy (DOE) committed for at least 200 units of electric tricycles for Boracay as part of its vision to ensure the sustainability of the electric vehicles program. The local government of Malay is eyeing to phase out all diesel-powered tricycles on the island and replace them with e-trikes and other electric-powered vehicles. The Boracay Interagency Task for Rehabilitation will also put up 16 designated stops for passenger vehicles along the main road. Resorts and hotels with transport services will also be required to have Euro-4 compliant vehicles. Resorts and establishments The closure of Boracay Island resulted in the issuance of 487 notices of violations to non-compliant establishments by the EMB. Non-compliant establishments are slapped with fines ranging from PHP60,000 to PHP80,000 upon determination by the Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB). Among the prominent infractions are violations of the Philippine Clean Water Act, Philippine Clean Air Act and for operating without an environmental compliance certificate (ECC). They are also mandated to comply with the requirements before they can again engage in business. DENR Memorandum Circular No. 2018-06 mandates that establishments with 50 rooms and above are required to have their own sewage treatment plant (STP) while those with 49 rooms and below, to have clustered STP. As of December 14, the DENR-DILG and DOT already accredited 279 establishments accounting for 9,868 rooms. Daily, 6,405 tourists are allowed to enter Boracay, but 19,000 tourists are allowed to stay. Micro, small and medium entrepreneurs One of the sectors hit by the closure were the micro, small and medium enterprises. Ma. Carmen Iturralde, director of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in Aklan, said the sales of the MSMEs in the province were affected because “most of them supply goods to Boracay.” In support, they were provided with marketing assistance through local, regional and national trade fairs that earned for them close to PHP25 million in sales. The “Bagong Buhay Boracay” store also generated more than PHP800,000. The Small Business Corp. attached to the DTI also released more than PHP2 million in loans under the “Pondo sa Pagbabago at Pag-asenso (P3)”. Their displaced workers were also provided with starter kits after attending their preferred skills training. As of October, more than one-half of the 215 beneficiaries received their starter kits under the local livelihood seeding program (LSP). Some 67 training courses on entrepreneurship and financial literacy were also conducted, benefitting 7,500 participants. Iturralde said that if there is one thing good about the closure, MSMEs were able to look for other markets. “It also opened opportunities for them. There are other markets for their trade,” she said. In fact, one entrepreneur expert on Information Technology developed an online marketing platform known as “oneAklan”. Products of MSMEs can be seen in the application available in Android phones (Google playstore) and IOS (Apple store). It is also integrated with the social media because it has its own Facebook account.  Currently, 38 MSMEs in the province are using the platform. The first-ever homegrown online selling was developed by Selah Studio owned by Aklanon Heinz Z. Militar, a recipient of the DTI’s “Kapatid Mentor Me” Program. Assistance for displaced workers The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) was quick to come up with a package of interventions to mitigate the impact of the closure. DOLE 6 Director Cyril Ticao said that as of the end of November, the department has disbursed PHP48.63 million for various projects they have implemented in the island. Through the “Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Ating Displaced/Disadvantaged Workers”, DOLE engaged 5,005 workers. The Boracay Emergency Employment Program Adjustment Measures Program (BEEP AMP) offered a comprehensive package of assistance to formal sector workers. Under this program, displaced, suspended, and retained workers were provided financial assistance of 50 percent of the prevailing minimum wage in Western Visayas or equivalent to PHP4,205.50 per month. Ticao said as of November 30, DOLE received 32,308 applications and 17,264 were already processed. DOLE has disbursed PHP382.23 million for their financial support. The Department of Social Welfare and Development Office (DSWD) 6 focused on assisting individuals in crisis situations (AICS), cash-for-work program, livelihood assistance, and relief operations. Through AICS, financial assistance were provided to beneficiaries for the payment of their transportation expenses to affected workers, as well as medical, educational, and burial assistance, as well as food. As of December 10, DSWD spent PHP43.97 million for the 18, 077 beneficiaries served through AICS program. Meanwhile, the cash-for-work program served 5,933 beneficiaries and spent PHP57.57 million for their salaries. The program assisted residents and non-residents (workers) to gain income and at the same time attend to the needs in rehabilitating the island, such as the conduct of a clean-up drive, wetland clean up, mangrove planting, communal gardening, underwater clean-up, canal dredging, vegetative fencing, garbage collection, and cleaning of debris. Livelihood assistance was also provided to some 10,596 displaced workers from the informal sector through the provision of grants for alternative income-generating activities, such as engaging in micro-enterprises or employment. The department has spent PHP158.94 million for their livelihood. DSWD assured that it will sustain the gains of rehabilitation efforts and improve social protection mechanisms for vulnerable sectors in the coming months. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) 6 has diverted its priority to Boracay Island in terms of providing multiple higher-level skills. Through the Special Training for Employment Program (STEP), the department provided opportunities for the beneficiaries, displaced workers or residents of the island, to acquire skills training to upgrade their competencies for higher paying jobs. During the six-month closure, covering the period of April 26 until September 15, a total of 2,903 enrolled in these training courses and 1,981 of them completed the courses. The department disbursed more than PHP40 million for their training. When the island opened last October 26, another batch of 200 trainees was again enrolled and 143 of them already completed their training while the remaining is ongoing and expected to be completed by December 31. The department allotted PHP3.7 million for the complete training package of the beneficiaries. Support for vulnerable groups (IPs, women) Duterte, true to his commitment, distributed land titles to the Indigenous Peoples (Ati) on the island through the Agrarian Reform Program. A total of 623 Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOA), consisting of 274.0352 hectares of land under the Agrarian Reform Program, were distributed to 484 agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) from Boracay and other areas in mainland Aklan on November 8. Six CLOAs went to members of the Boracay Ati Tribal Organization (BATO) composed of 45 families covering 3.2064 hectares. The 3.2 hectares of land in Barangay Manocmanoc is part of the 7.9 hectares of land originally turned over by the DENR to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). At least 31 families from the Tumandok tribe of Boracay also received their CLOAs. The Department of Agriculture (DA) has chosen the Ati community and the 35-member Boracay Women Producers Cooperative as recipients of their interventions. Vic Nabor, executive assistant to the Regional Executive Director, said two greenhouses were established at the Ati Village and Boracay Women Producers Cooperative. “These greenhouses use soil-less and hydrophonics technology to produce high-value vegetables. Along with the greenhouses is the conduct of training for soilless culture and the operation of the greenhouses,” he said. An Organic Urban Garden was established at the Ati Community Learning Center Compound in Boracay. They were provided with training courses in partnership with the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI), the training arm of DA. These include food/product processing, such as fruit jellies, vegetable patties, salad and juices, to be made available at their proposed Boracay Ati Fresh Garden. The Boracay Women Producers Cooperative trained on rice by-product processing, packaging, and marketing as a livelihood support. As support continues to pour in, the task force also looked into the lapses of local government unit officials in Aklan. Charges were filed against 17 officials in Aklan before the Office of the Ombudsman for alleged violation of the Local Government Code and Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corruption Practices Act. A day before the opening, the Office of the Ombudsman handed a preventive suspension order to Malay town Mayor Ceciron Cawaling for alleged neglect of duty, which resulted in the degradation of Boracay’s environment. Sualog served as acting mayor of the town. While Boracay is now open to the public, rehabilitation efforts will continue. A marine biodiversity assessment is going on with the assistance of the Boracay Business Administration of Scuba Shops BBASS, a group of drivers and scuba shop operators in the island. The biodiversity assessment will be necessary for the rehabilitation of Boracay’s coastal and marine areas. A memorandum of agreement between the DENR led by Cimatu and BBASS was signed on October 15. BBASS will also assist the DENR in policing the coastal areas of the island and in the information, education, and communication campaign. Acting Mayor Sualog said they are now focused and working together with the task force to implement the policies that were set for the island, such as the control of visitors and regulation of activities on the beach front. He added that they are now helping the task force to ensure that all businesses are compliant. “We are hoping that all will be compliant soon,” he said, adding that he has already requested the task force to set up a one-stop shop again in Boracay to help the business sector comply with their requirements.  (With reports from Annabel J.

He also had burns and hematoma in the upper and lower eyelids. E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat e-liquids to produce aerosols that users inhale, mimicking the act of smoking. Meanwhile, vaping devices or vapes are used to vaporize cannabis, tobacco and other herb blends for inhalation. They are battery-operated as well. According to DOH, vaping devices can cause severe burns and injuries that may require intensive or prolonged medical treatment. DOH said the patient’s mother reported that he swapped the batteries of his vape through an acquaintance in social media, who already deactivated after the incident. In connection to this, DOH cautioned parents and guardians to discourage minors from using e-cigarettes and vapes and from accessing them through social media. \"These devices are not toys and they contain concomitant health and safety hazards which may lure teenagers to pick up the habit of smoking,” DOH said. DOH said it will continue to investigate about the safety and health issues of these devices and their online selling with the help of the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Trade and Industry. “FDA regulates e-cigarettes as medical products because of its nicotine content and no device or e-liquids have been registered nor evaluated by the agency for safety, efficacy and quality,” DOH added.

The Philippines is among the world's top producers and exporters of raw coconut but has not yet fully tapped the product's full potential to rake in additional revenues, noted UCAP Chairperson Dean Lao Jr. in a press briefing on Monday. \"Much value-adding is done overseas. What we want is to bring this to the Philippines, which can offer more than just crude coconut oil.\" Four global trends are fanning the demand for value-added coconut products, noted UCAP Vice-Chairperson Marco Reyes. Such trends, he cited, are rising consumer interest in health and wellness, increasing population of the aging, emergence of the green movement, and the onset of the information revolution. \"The world is changing and we're correspondingly seeing an exponential increase in demand for value-added coconut products,\" Reyes said. Although UCAP does not have data yet on the actual global demand for value-added coconut products and the Philippines' market share on these products, Reyes is bullish about the prospects, as he noted studies showing coconut and its value-added products are increasingly known as natural alternatives for health and wellness. He said studies have shown that coconut consumption helps address aging-related conditions like failing memory. \"In line with the green movement, developed nations are looking for products which are organic, sustainable, and renewable,\" he said. One such product, he cited, is biofuel, which is a blend of coco methyl ester and diesel fuel. Biofuel, he stressed, enhances vehicle performance and helps reduce dirty emissions. He added the emergence of online selling platforms due to technological advances has further opened up opportunities for trading value-added coconut products. UCAP is inviting the public to attend the Aug. 14-16 National Coconut Week (NCW) celebration in Metro Manila to learn about the coconut and the value-adding opportunities from this crop. The 1st World Coconut Congress will also be held during the week-long celebration of the so-called \"tree of life\". \"There'll be six sessions with the finale being on health and wellness,\" UCAP Executive Director Yvonne Agustin said at the Monday press conference. About 20 experts on coconut and various aspects of this crop's production are expected at the event, Agustin said. The Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) is supporting the WCC and UCAP's call for value-adding. \"We want to increase coconut's contribution to the economy and the way to do this is through value-adding,\" PCA market research and promotion chief Rose Villaruel said at the press conference. Villaruel said the 2018 NCW celebration will feature discussions on business opportunities from coconut husks, noting these are minimally used as an economic resource at present. Discussions at this year's NCW will also tackle integrated pest management, she added. Both WCC and NCW will be anchored on the theme \"The time is now\", signifying the call for action to bolster the local coconut industry. NCW celebration is mandated under Proclamation 142 series of 1987, the PCA said.

Duterte to Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drive against fake drugs, the FDA on Sunday reiterated its warning on the potential danger posed by counterfeit drugs to the health of Filipinos. “These may be contaminated, contain wrong, or no active ingredient, or are being dispensed at the wrong dosage,” said FDA Director-General Nela Charade Puno in a statement. Puno added that fake drugs may cause adverse effects to their health instead of curing them. “These fake drugs may cause more harm than good to their health if taken,” she added. As a tip to avoid falling prey to counterfeit drugs, the public was advised by FDA to buy only from accredited drugstores and pharmacies. “The consumers should purchase them only from government-licensed pharmacies and make sure they have the Certificate of Product Registration from the FDA,” she said. The FDA official issued the warning after Duterte himself expressed all-out support to war against manufacturers and sellers of counterfeit drugs. \"The President’s backing has given us an even stronger resolve to put a stop to this practice which endangers the well-being of the public,\" she added. With that she vowed to further intensify the joint operations between the FDA and the Philippine National Police (PNP) against the perpetrators which the President described as “economic saboteurs”. Data shows that the FDA-PNP Joint Task Force D-PUNCH (Destroying Products Unfit for Human Consumption) has resulted in the seizure of more than PHP76 million worth of assorted counterfeit drugs from the period of March 2017 to March 2018.
