The strike, the first since TNVS drivers were introduced by the Department of Transportation in 2015, was by far the strongest action taken by the sector, which recently lost 5,000 members who failed to get a franchise from the LTFRB.  At press time, however, the number of participants could not be estimated. Ballpark figure  Only Janina Pineda of Hatchback Philippines, which has 15,000 members, gave a ballpark figure, saying they expected 35,000 TNVS drivers to join the strike. There are currently around 45,000 TNVS driver-members. Even as the coalition leaders warned of a tougher commute for regular riders next week, it was apparent during their press briefing on Thursday that the plan to hold a mass action had been rushed and had yet to be cascaded properly to their members.  For example, it was clear that the decision to go offline for 12 hours—between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.—did not sit well with some groups. Aylene Paguio of TNVS Organization Philippines said they were informed of the planned mass action just a few hours before it was publicly announced. “We still have to convene our members. There’s a lot [at stake] here not only for the drivers, but also for the passengers,” she said. However, Ninoy Mopas of Thugs Manila, another TNVS group, expressed confidence they would be able to rally the support of their members, including those who had already been accredited by the LTFRB. “We’re still working out how exactly to carry this out. We also don’t want the riding public to be adversely affected by this, and also the drivers who rely on this to earn a living. But one thing is for certain, we will carry this out on Monday,” he said.  Grab appeals to members In a statement, Grab said that while it recognized drivers’ rights to free speech and assembly, they should also “show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides.” “Let us take the high road and not resort to any rash actions that would directly affect the passengers we are all committed to serve,” it added. But Ariel Inton of the Lawyers for Commuters’ Safety and Protection also called out transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab for failing to help their driver-partners secure a franchise. “If the TNCs are there to assist then I don’t see why TNVS drivers should have difficulties in complying with the requirements,” he said. “By helping them, this will also help the LTFRB in sorting out the requirements.” According to Inton, they were mulling filing administrative liability charges against LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III for failing to take action on the 5,000 hatchback units deactivated early this month. This was on top of the writ of mandamus filed recently, asking the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to compel the LTFRB to enforce Memorandum Circular No. 2018-25, which allowed hatchback vehicles to operate as TNVS units until 2021."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1316090/house-panel-urges-govt-task-force-to-allow-tnvs-units-on-roads","title":"House panel urges gov’t task force to allow TNVS units on roads","date":"04:45 PM August 03, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The House transportation committee has asked the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) and the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 to allow ride-hailing service Angkas and other transport network vehicle service (TNVS) to resume operations and provide public transportation especially for those who need to go to work amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The House transportation committee has asked the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) and the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19 to allow ride-hailing service Angkas and other transport network vehicle service (TNVS) to resume operations and provide public transportation especially for those who need to go to work amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The strike, the first since TNVS drivers were introduced by the Department of Transportation in 2015, was by far the strongest action taken by the sector, which recently lost 5,000 members who failed to get a franchise from the LTFRB.  At press time, however, the number of participants could not be estimated. Ballpark figure  Only Janina Pineda of Hatchback Philippines, which has 15,000 members, gave a ballpark figure, saying they expected 35,000 TNVS drivers to join the strike. There are currently around 45,000 TNVS driver-members. Even as the coalition leaders warned of a tougher commute for regular riders next week, it was apparent during their press briefing on Thursday that the plan to hold a mass action had been rushed and had yet to be cascaded properly to their members.  For example, it was clear that the decision to go offline for 12 hours—between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.—did not sit well with some groups. Aylene Paguio of TNVS Organization Philippines said they were informed of the planned mass action just a few hours before it was publicly announced. “We still have to convene our members. There’s a lot [at stake] here not only for the drivers, but also for the passengers,” she said. However, Ninoy Mopas of Thugs Manila, another TNVS group, expressed confidence they would be able to rally the support of their members, including those who had already been accredited by the LTFRB. “We’re still working out how exactly to carry this out. We also don’t want the riding public to be adversely affected by this, and also the drivers who rely on this to earn a living. But one thing is for certain, we will carry this out on Monday,” he said.  Grab appeals to members In a statement, Grab said that while it recognized drivers’ rights to free speech and assembly, they should also “show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides.” “Let us take the high road and not resort to any rash actions that would directly affect the passengers we are all committed to serve,” it added. But Ariel Inton of the Lawyers for Commuters’ Safety and Protection also called out transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab for failing to help their driver-partners secure a franchise. “If the TNCs are there to assist then I don’t see why TNVS drivers should have difficulties in complying with the requirements,” he said. “By helping them, this will also help the LTFRB in sorting out the requirements.” According to Inton, they were mulling filing administrative liability charges against LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III for failing to take action on the 5,000 hatchback units deactivated early this month. This was on top of the writ of mandamus filed recently, asking the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to compel the LTFRB to enforce Memorandum Circular No. 2018-25, which allowed hatchback vehicles to operate as TNVS units until 2021."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1143642/breaking-dotr-allows-hatchbacks-to-operate-as-tnvs-units-permanently","title":"BREAKING: DOTr allows hatchbacks to operate as TNVS units permanently","date":"01:11 PM July 19, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) will now allow hatchback-type and sub-compact vehicles to permanently operate as transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) will now allow hatchback-type and sub-compact vehicles to permanently operate as transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units.

In a video of closed-circuit television footage uploaded by several social media pages, a rider wearing a red shirt whose face was covered was seen scouting two vehicles parked along a street in Makati City, acting as a delivery courier.  After ensuring that he would not attract attention, the robber opened his motorcycle compartment, wore a pair of gloves, and broke the sports utility vehicle’s window just by pushing it. However, the logo on the compartment box did not escape the eyes of netizens, who quickly noted that the robber used a box from a transport network vehicle service firm Grab.  In a statement after the incident, Grab said that they are aware of the incident, and would be willing to assist authorities to track down the suspect.  However, they admitted that they could not identify whether the robber was indeed a part of their fleet, as the motorcycle used did not have a plate number while the rider’s face was covered. “We are aware of a video involving a motorcycle rider breaking into a parked car. As the rider’s vehicle did not have a plate and as he was wearing a face cover at the time of the incident, we are unable to confirm the identity of the rider and verify his registration as a Grab delivery-partner at this stage,” Grab said.  “Grab does not condone such behavior. We stand ready to assist the authorities with their investigations. Should the offender be identified as a Grab partner, we will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety and reliability of our platform,” it added. According to Grab, their delivery-partners were screened properly, requiring them to submit various clearances from the police, from the National Bureau of Investigation, and the barangay — aside from various tests and motorcycle registration papers. On Facebook, people speculated that the suspect was merely using the compartment box from Grab to cover his plans, as people would not suspect delivery couriers of illegal activities should they park next to vehicles. “Hindi naman (legit) na Grab rider yan.

Ninoy Mopas, president of the TNVS group Thug Philippines, circulated a statement saying the transport holiday would push through although they would “give the freedom to each and every one of our members to go online or offline.” This amounted to a free pass for drivers uneasy about joining the strike, which was originally set between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. today, Monday.

This gets worse during rainy days and Fridays; at certain hours, only 2 out of 10 will get a ride,” Grab said in its email. “It is because the LTFRB limits the number of drivers on the road who serve you,” it added.  /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1138166/ltfrb-sets-dialogue-with-tnvs-drivers-operators-on-july-9","title":"LTFRB sets dialogue with TNVS drivers, operators on July 9","date":"01:04 PM July 05, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has set a dialogue with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers and operators on Tuesday, July 9.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has set a dialogue with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers and operators on Tuesday, July 9.

Singapore-based Grab has acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber’s last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. The senator noted that many TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride but this option, he said, would no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9.  Thus, Pimentel said, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB “to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry.” “The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,” he said.  READ: After Grab-Uber merger, LTFRB says 3 new TNVS to enter PH He said the LTFRB should strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country’s TNVS guidelines. “We need real competition, not potential competition,” said the Senate president. “As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service—and this is where the LTFRB must come in.” Pimentel also called on the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. “Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. They should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” he further said. /jpv"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1180821/tnvs-franchise-application-now-online-ltfrb","title":"TNVS franchise application now online – LTFRB","date":"12:59 PM October 23, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines – Transport network vehicle service (TNVS) drivers and operators may now schedule their appointments for existing franchise transactions online.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Transport network vehicle service (TNVS) drivers and operators may now schedule their appointments for existing franchise transactions online.

What we need to do is prioritize the most active drivers and proven track record of good service – yung umaasa dito sa kanilang livelihood.

Libiran added that the memorandum circular would take effect as soon as it was published. The announcement was made on Friday, a day after Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade ordered the LTFRB to implement Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, which allowed hatchbacks to operate as TNVS units until 2021 provided they operate only within Metro Manila and charge cheaper fares.

The LTFRB initially stood by its memorandum circular, arguing that it was merely abiding by Department Order 2015-11, which stated that only vehicles with an engine power above 2,000 cc could be used as public transport.  While hatchback drivers welcomed the DOTr order, they expressed hope that authorities would also relax the supposedly rigid requirements in applying for a transport franchise.

During the public hearing called by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday, lawyer Ariel Inton, who is speaking for the TNVS drivers, said that the groups were ready to submit position papers within the week.  LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said that the board would discuss these claims before arriving at a decision on whether to allow hatchbacks to be part of various TVNS fleets. “[The board will meet] if you submit the position paper,” Delgra told Inton, who pressed the LTFRB chief on when the board would convene to address the issues.  Several sectors have expressed concern about the use of the hatchbacks as public transportation because of the absence of an elongated rear chassis, which would give more room between passengers on the backseat and the vehicle behind in case of an accident. In the hearing, LTFRB officials stressed that the vehicles initially allowed to operate consists only of sedans, Asian utility vehicles (AUVs), sports utility vehicles (SUVs).  Inton countered, however, that if hatchbacks were deemed unsafe, multinational companies would not invest in manufacturing and selling them. He also noted that more “unsafe” modes of transportation had been actually operating in the country right now. “Ia-address natin ‘yung safety issue. ‘Yung mga hatchback ay safe naman ‘yan. Kung hindi safe ang hatchback dapat hindi na binebenta ‘yan. Pangalawa, katulad ng sinabi natin, we argued before the board na nai-submit na ‘yan [applications of hatchbacks],” Inton explained in an ambush interview. [We addressed the safety issue. Hatchbacks are safe. If they’re not safe, then they should be sold. Secondly, as we have said, we argued before the board to submit the applications of hatchbacks.] “Hindi ko malaman kung bakit sinasabi nilang delikado eh. Eh ‘yong tricycle nga mas maliit eh, but the local government unit gives franchise. And then, ‘yong memorandum circular na nagsasabing okay, accredited hatchback, tatanggapin. So ibig sabihin hindi ‘yong issue ng safety,” he added. [I don’t get why they’re saying its dangerous. A tricycle is smaller, but the local government unit gives it a franchise. And the memorandum circular says it‘s OK, hatchbacks can be accredited. So that means it‘s not a safety issue.]  Last Monday, hatchback drivers staged a protest by not operating for their mother TNVS companies, causing an increase in surge prices among commuters. They also intended to file a case against the LTFRB at the Office of the Ombudsman but canceled it upon the agency’s call for talks.

LTFRB Board Member Atty. Aileen Lizada said three local ride-sharing companies Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their accreditation before the agency.  “So if you say that there is no competition, soon there will be, and any competition is good for any industry because it benefits the riding public,” Lizada said in a press conference at Grab’s processing center at Mega Tent in Libis, Quezon City. The announcement came days after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move that secured the Singapore-based company’s dominance in the region’s TNVS industry.  Lizada also allayed concerns that the merger would result in higher fares as public utility vehicle operators have to first secure the LTFRB’s approval before increasing their fares. “Grab on its own, just like any other public utility vehicle, cannot increase its fare on its own,” she said.  “We also have monitoring.

All the more that we will be strict in monitoring,” she said.

In a statement, Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade said he had directed the LTFRB to implement Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2018-5 which allowed accredited hatchbacks to operate for a limited time—until 2021—provided they charge much lower fares and limit their route to within Metro Manila.  According to Tugade, the MC should be implemented until it is “modified and/or amended.” The DOTr, however, clarified that only the hatchbacks that were among the 55,000 TNVS units included in a master list and whose applications were filed between March 5 and Dec. 15, 2018 would be recognized.  Welcome change in policy Ninoy Mupas, one of the leaders of the TNVS coalition who wrote to Tugade and President Duterte to air their grievances, said they welcome the policy change.  He added, however, that his group would continue to lobby for the LTFRB to also accept the applications of hatchback drivers who applied after Dec. 15, 2018. The LTFRB has yet to issue a statement on the DOTr’s order. But earlier, it stood firm on its opposition to hatchbacks, saying these were unsafe because they did not meet the technical requirements for public transport vehicles. Last month, a group of deactivated hatchback drivers asked the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to order the LTFRB to implement the MC. Amendments needed Transport Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon said the LTFRB would need to amend the MC to allow the permanent classification of hatchbacks as TNVS units, and to reenlist TNVS units that were previously removed from the master list.  “In bigger metropolitan areas like London and Tokyo, hatchbacks are allowed to operate as public transport. If first-world countries and cities allow it, why can’t we? These vehicles are more fuel-efficient and, thus, are good for the environment,” De Leon said.

But the LTFRB has questioned the existence of the “colorum” drivers despite its order to remove them as early as May. “We don’t know which of them we should approach about this problem,” De Leon said.  The mass deactivation coincided with the LTFRB’s opening of 10,000 new slots for transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and Grab said it would help affected drivers who wanted to apply. The 8,000 colorum drivers account for about 18 percent of its active operators. Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said the company had set up a help desk for franchise application and job fair for other Grab platforms at 11 Malakas St., Quezon City, until June 14.  In the meantime, however, Grab drivers wrestled with the cost of the deactivation on their families. “I’ve gotten used to this being my source of income every day,” said Marlon Novo, who earned about P2,000 daily for the past three years. “As long as I drove, I would have something to take home to my family. The impact of this is going to hit me hard.” De Leon said the timing of the purge was unfortunate as a lot of Grab drivers have kids to send to school. TNVS drivers need to secure a provisional authority or a certificate of public convenience to operate legally, but many have decried the document-heavy application process as laborious and unfair. Hatchback Community, which counts among its ranks about 1,000 drivers facing deactivation, said the LTFRB has refused to process the applications of its members since February 2018, citing safety concerns over the vehicle size.  “But before these cars are even sold, there is quality control,” said Novo, who owns a hatchback. “I use this car to drive my family. If it wasn’t safe, I wouldn’t use it.” Christian Lloyd Magsoy, Defend Job Philippines spokesperson, urged Grab and LTFRB to pay attention to the drivers’ concerns as “their livelihoods are at stake here.”"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/243055/ltfrb-sets-dialogue-with-tnvs-drivers-operators-on-july-9","title":"LTFRB sets dialogue with TNVS drivers, operators on July 9","date":"July 05,2019 - 01:44 PM","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has set a dialogue with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers and operators on Tuesday, July 9.

The list of applicants is full already. Priority will be given to existing applicants. Let’s not worsen street congestion with more and more new cars everyday,” Cuizon said. When asked about LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada’s announcement that the agency would only process TNVS permit applications received as of July 2017, Cuizon said it was only fair for drivers who applied ahead. He added that the original deadline for accepting applications was September 2016, and that time, the region had recorded at least 740 applications. Cuizon, in a previous interview, said that the LTFRB Central Office had allotted only 500 TNVS slots in Cebu, while there are around 800 pending applications submitted to the regional office and more than 6,000 pending applications to the offices of Transport Network Companies (TNCs) like Grab and Uber in Cebu. “If Grab and Uber only stopped accepting new operators after the September 2016 deadline set by LTFRB, the problem would not have grown as big as it is today,” Cuizon said in phone interview on Saturday. He said that there are 740 pending applications for franchises in LTFRB-7, and of this number 103 units were earlier issued provisional authority (PAs), a temporary permit to operate as a TNVS. He also said that out of the 103 units only 48 came back to renew their PAs. When Grab Philippines was sought for a comment, Leo Gonzales, Grab Philippines head for public affairs, said in a phone interview on Saturday that they stopped accrediting applications since July 16, 2017. “Grab officially stopped accrediting applications as of July 16, 2017.

He said that he was hopeful that the LTFRB would consider to review the Memorandum Circular which limits to only 45,000 units. “For the cap in Cebu which is very small. We are not happy for the cap of 500,” he said. But Cuizon said TNCs could not blame the LTFRB for this. “They cannot also blame the LTFRB because we did issue repeated warnings.

Cuizon said the mesage should tell people that there are just “too many pending applicants, way more than the slots that may be opened, hence new hopefuls should stop buying new cars.” “There is no way that they can be accommodated since fairness dictates that those who fell in line first will be given priority. Even the 7,000 will not be approved wholesale; many of them will still be unable to get slots,” said Cuizon. Last February 1, an estimated 2,000 TNVS drivers affiliated with Grab, Uber and U-Hop organized a TNVS Unity Day, which made known to the public that they share “one voice and one goal.” The group said TNVS drivers provide convenience, safety and comfort to the riding public. TNVS drivers wore white T-shirts with the words “one voice, one goal.” The gathering was funded from their personal money. The plan is to have an annual TNVS Unity Day every February 1. Montanez said they were inspired by the February 1 turnout of supportive TNVS drivers that they are currently organizing a formal group to support TNVS. “We will work on building an open line of communication with Sir Ahmed with the organization of a formal TNVS Cebu group so we can truly have one voice and communicate our one goal,” he said."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/164117/ltfrb-chairman-hatchbacks-tnvs-can-operate-cebu","title":"LTFRB chairman: Hatchbacks as TNVS can operate in Cebu","date":"February 17,2018 - 10:16 PM","snippet":"","body":"THE Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has allowed hatchback cars to operate as Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) in Cebu. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III confirmed what he said during the Senate hearing on public service last Thursday that hatchbacks or compact vehicles would also be allowed in Metro Cebu, contrary to a new LTFRB memorandum, which limits hatchback cars only in Metro Manila. “Yes, in the same conditions in the MC (Memorandum Circular) namely those with car loans and only during the transition period to allow them to repay their loans,” Delgra told Cebu Daily News in a text message on Saturday. Under the Memorandum Circular 2018-005, “Hatchback units shall be accepted subject to a transition period of three years in order for the peers to recoup their investment.” Provided also that the hatchback units shall charge for a lower fare rate approved by the LTFRB. “That will be discussed with the TNC (Transport Network Companies) Grab and Uber in the separate petitions for a fare hike pending before the board,” he said.

Last month, the LTFRB planned to ban the accreditation of compact cars as ride-hailing cabs.

However, given that many hatchback or compact cars have been allowed to operate as TNVS for the past two years without incident, then the LTFRB should consider the livelihood of those affected by their order,” Poe, chair of the Senate  committee on public services, said in a statement.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada has said that the agency is planning to ban and remove the accreditation of small, compact cars or non-2,000-cc rated vehicles for Uber and Grab, citing the safety of the passengers. However, Poe said that the owners of compact cars who have already registered with TNCs under the old guidelines “should not be suddenly deprived of their livelihood.”  “The agency should comply with due process and at (the) very least act humanely by providing a considerable amount of time as a transition period for the owners of these vehicles,” she said. Poe noted that if such vehicle is safe for “personal use and to carry family members, how is it not safe to ferry passengers?”  Once implemented, the LTFRB’s plan would not just take away the livelihood of TNVS operators and drivers, but also result in fewer TNVS servicing the TNVS-riding population, Poe pointed out. “Given this, will the LTFRB now lift the moratorium on TNVS applications?” she asked. The senator said that the LTFRB should not just impose stringent measures on hatchbacks alone but also to all kinds of public utility vehicles to ensure the safety of the riding public. “Lastly, it goes without saying that all public transportation vehicles should be safe, environmentally friendly, and comfortable. If the LTFRB imposes such stringent measures on hatchbacks, then they should impose the same safety standards to all kinds of PUVs and not just the TNVS,” she said. “Are two-year old hatchbacks any less safe than a 10-year old taxi or one that is not well-maintained?” she added.    /kga"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/243146/cebus-tnvs-groups-decision-not-to-join-july-8s-transport-holiday-hailed","title":"Cebu’s TNVS groups decision not to join July 8’s transport holiday hailed","date":"July 05,2019 - 11:01 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman, Lawyer Martin Delgra, has expressed his gratitude to the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) groups in Cebu for assuring the public that they will not participate in the transport holiday on Monday, July 8. “O di maayo, nalipay ta nga nakadungog niana,” Delgra said, while describing that Cebuano’s are good at resolving issues by means of dialogue. (That is good. We are happy to hear that.)

But despite the assurance of TNVS drivers and operators groups in Cebu that they would not participate in the transport strike, TNVS groups in Cebu are appealing to the government to allow all existing ride-hailing platform units to operate. Delgra, however, said that he would first have to check with Grab Philippines of how come existing TNVS units in Cebu had reached around 3,000 despite LTFRB’s order to limit its operation to only 1,500 units. “Mao na akong klaruhon sa Grab kay gilikayan man gani na natong problemaha sa una nga niabot sa 100,000 ang colorum. Mao to atong gisulbad, atong gihan-ay ug gihatagan nato og quota ang Cebu,” he added. (That is what we would want to clarify with Grab because we tried to avoid that problem we once encountered where the colorum vehicles reached 100,000. That is what we solved and that is why we gave them a quota of vehicles in Cebu.) Aside from Cebu, TNVS operation in Manila is also pegged at 65,000 units and 250 units in Pampanga. Some TNVS operators in Cebu are worried that their livelihood might get affected if they would become deactivated, specifically those who were not included in the list which was endorsed by Grab for the processing of their provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC). Delgra also belied the allegation that they were implementing unreasonable processes in granting franchise applications. “Kay ang process flow ana, parehas ra na sa jeep, parehas ra sa taxi, parehas ra sa bus. Parehas ra tanan,” he said. (The process for that is the same as the process in getting franchise applications of jeepneys, taxis and buses. They are all the same.)

The transport group United Transport Koalisyon (1-Utak) lauded the action of the LTFRB and expressed intention to charge Velox for allegedly using dummy investors for its Transport Network Vehicle Services. In stopping the Velox application, the LTFRB said the government, first and foremost, must be sure to uphold the Philippine sovereignty against suspicious companies applying for business in the country.  Velox is a Singaporean Firm with 60 percent shares owned by Velox South-East Asia Holdings, Pte., Ltd. 1-Utak Rep. lawyer Vigor Mendoza said they will review if there is any criminal liability on part of the Velox such as Anti-Dummy Law, tax evasion, perjury and falsification of public documents.  The Philippines’ Anti-Dummy Law, the group said, prohibits foreigners from intervening in the management, operation, administration, or control of any nationalized activity. The group added that Filipinos who will be found in cahoots with foreign firms in the Anti-Dummy Law also face violation of this law, by committing a criminal act punishable by five- to 15-year imprisonment. This was after the group received information that the company is allegedly using Filipino dummy partners to comply for the requirements of the Constitution. “Hindi pa nagsisimula binabastos na ang ating saligang batas. Kahit mayaman sila wala silang karapatan tapak tapakan ang ating batas,” Mendoza said.

In the video, Daza shared four top don’ts of ride-sharing to make sure everyone keeps themselves in check.  “When I take Grab, I always find myself chatting with the driver,” she wrote. “Their stories gave me an idea for a video to remind everyone on how to be good Grabbers. Check out the dont’s when you ride share.

In a statement, the country’s biggest tax-collection agency said that it was supposed to suspend Uber’s local business operations under its “Oplan Kandado” program following an audit of the company’s VAT compliance for the period July 1 to Dec. 31, 2016. The investigation was made under a letter of authority issued by revenue officers of Revenue District Office No. 47, East Makati, Revenue Region No. 8, Makati City, the BIR said.  A letter of authority is an official document that empowers revenue officers to examine and scrutinize taxpayers’ books in order to determine their correct tax liabilities. “Records of investigation showed that Uber is registered with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) as a transportation network company (TNC) with a pool of transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) operators and drivers who use its transport system to get clients/passengers for transport from one place to another. It provides pre-arranged transportation services for a fee using an internet-based application or digital platform to connect passengers with drivers using personal vehicles. It likewise ensures the compliance of its TNVS operators and drivers with the LTFRB,” the BIR noted.  “As such TNC, all of Uber’s earnings are derived from the transportation services made by its TNVS operators and drivers within the Philippines. Hence, its gross receipts from such sale of services is subject to the 12-percent VAT and not to the 3-percent common carrier’s tax,” the BIR explained. “Although Uber religiously filed its VAT returns on time, it declared its sale of services rendered within the Philippines amounting to P413.85 million as zero-rated sales, contrary to the ‘cross border doctrine,’” the BIR said. According to the BIR, the cross border doctrine meant that “no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority.” “Conversely, those destined for use or consumption within the Philippines shall be imposed with the 12-percent VAT,” the BIR added. “The act of Uber of declaring its sale of services as zero-rated and not paying the VAT due thereon is a clear violation of the Tax Code which is one of the grounds for its suspension or temporary closure. Section 115 of the Tax Code, as implemented through Revenue Memorandum Order No. 03-2009, authorizes the BIR to suspend or close the business operations of a taxpayer for a period of not less than five days for failure to: register; issue VAT official receipts or sales invoices; file correct VAT returns; or pay the correct VAT,” according to the BIR. To avoid closure, Uber settled its unpaid VAT dues last Feb. 13."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/263349/ltfrb-indonesian-ride-hailing-firm-go-jek-cant-operate-in-ph","title":"LTFRB: Indonesian ride-hailing firm, Go Jek, can’t operate in PH","date":"05:28 AM January 10, 2019","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the application of Indonesian ride-hailing company Go Jek to operate in the Philippines over foreign ownership issues.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the application of Indonesian ride-hailing company Go Jek to operate in the Philippines over foreign ownership issues. Go Jek’s rejection further cements Grab’s hold on the Southeast Asian market, particularly in Manila, where the Singapore-based firm has captured 90 percent of the market, according to local anticompetition officials.  LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  While Grab hails from Singapore, its local subsidiary, MyTaxiPH, complies with the foreign ownership requirement. Should Go Jek reconstitute its ownership and board composition, it can appeal for reconsideration, Libiran said. Go Jek statement In a statement, Go Jek said the company “continues to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines.” With Go Jek facing a roadblock, the Philippine ride-hailing industry remains split among 10 players: Grab, u-Hop, Micab, Hype, e-Pick Me Up, Owto, Hirna, GoLag, Ryde and SnappyCab. Grab and u-Hop have yet to renew their accreditations. Grab’s s most serious competitor, motorcycle-hailing app Angkas, was edged out of the market last year after the Supreme Court stopped a lower court from preventing DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas drivers."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/177570/grab-says-fare-surge-temporary-entry-5-new-tnvs","title":"Grab says fare surge is only temporary with entry of 5 new TNVS","date":"May 30,2018 - 10:42 PM","snippet":"","body":"GRAB assured the public on Wednesday that its fare surge is only temporary given the recent accreditation of five new transport network vehicle service (TNVS). According to Grab, the additional TNVS in the country would lessen the demand and would later result to lower fare charges. “We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is a not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,” Grab said. This situation is likely to be temporary, especially given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB’s) accreditation of at least five new Transport Network Companies (TNCs) capitalizing on Uber’s exit,” Grab added. During a hearing on Tuesday, the LTFRB said it was not aware of the P80 minimum fare of the company. “Obviously not, in so far as the computation of the minimum fare is concerned,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said during the hearing on the fare hike petition of Grab. “Kaya po nalito kami doon sa minimum fare compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,” he added Grab also maintained its ground that all of its fares were “legal and upfront.”"},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/49809/nissan-almera-top-among-cebus-tnvs-providers","title":"Nissan Almera is top among Cebu’s TNVS providers","date":"May 31,2017","snippet":"","body":"Cebu City—Surprise, surprise! The top transport network vehicle service (TNVS) ride in this city that’s experiencing its own automotive boom is the Nissan Almera. Largely because of this, the three Nissan dealerships in the Queen City of the South are enjoying a boom in sales as well. Based on Uber Philippines’ data for the first quarter of 2017, the Almera led the list of top 10 vehicle brands in use, grabbing 20 percent of the TNVS market share.  Vios (Toyota) cornered 16 percent, while Mirage (Mitsubishi) and Picanto (Kia) each got 7 percent. The Wigo (Toyota), Rio (Kia), Accent (Hyundai), Avanza (Toyota), Ertiga (Suzuki), and Eon (Hyundai) rounded up the rest of the top 10. The Uber data was furnished to Inquirer Motoring by Michael Goho, EVP of Gateway Motors Cebu (a multibrand dealer which also launched Nissan Cebu South on May 25). “The Almera has become the trend here in Cebu with Uber and Grab operators. Cebuano passengers find the Almera more spacious, while drivers and operators find it more efficient,” observed Goho. Markane Goho, president of Gateway Motors Cebu, said that the Nissan Cebu South dealership has no special financing program yet for buyers who intend to register their vehicles with Uber and Grab, but that both TNVS companies had already expressed interest in partnering with the dealership. Ramesh Narasimhan, Nissan Philippines Inc. president and managing director, told the motoring media during the May 25 Nissan Cebu South launch: “From a sales perspective, Grab and Uber operators find the Almera extremely customer-friendly, which is one of the reasons Almera sales last year grew by 98.9 percent, virtually doubling the volume. “Last year, about 4,500 Almera units nationwide [were sold]. It’s still less than what we wanted, but better than where we were.” Another Nissan dealership in metropolitan Cebu, the Nissan Cebu Central, was launched the day after the launch of Cebu South. During this event, its president Brian Chua echoed the Gohos’ observations: “The feedback TNVS operators gave was for the Almera’s size and space. It’s more comfortable to ride in, particularly at the back seat. Despite it being classified as a subcompact sedan, it’s bigger.” Julie S. Tio, GM of Nissan Cebu Distributors Inc. (the original Nissan dealership in Cebu located in Mandaue City), said that “the Nissan Almera has gained recognition for being the most spacious vehicle in its segment. “Plus, there’s the fact that the Nissan air-conditioning system is the best. Some of our new customers for the Nissan Almera attest that they experienced the most comfortable ride while taking Uber or Grab. “Seeing the potential income from such a business, combined with lower maintenance costs of owning a Nissan vehicle, the Nissan Almera becomes a preferred vehicle for Cebuano entrepreneurs.” Tio also operates another Nissan dealership in Tagbilaran, Bohol province, which has been in operation since 2011. The two dealerships launched in succession in Cebu via Gateway Motors Cebu (for Cebu South) and Autosynergy Inc. (for Cebu Central) feature the Japanese marque’s global retail design Nissan Retail Environment Design Initiative 2.1 (NREDI 2.1). Cebu now has three dealerships, the original being Nissan Cebu Distributors Inc. located at M.L. Quezon Avenue in Mandaue City (established in 1993). The Almera is known for being the most spacious in its segment. Though not particularly remarkable in its exterior design, it blends in well with all the other entry-level cars in its category. The 1.5-liter Almera was first assembled in the Philippines in September 2012, and was officially introduced locally in January 2013. The Nissan Technopark, which has been operating since 1997 with an overall assembly capacity of 3,000 units per month (one of the largest in the industry), has positioned this sedan to compete head-to-head against the Toyota Vios, Honda City and Hyundai Accent. Now available in Cebu, the Almera has overtaken the traditional leaders—which has made its three dealers uber-excited."},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/60292/grab-tnvs-transport-holiday","title":"‘Show utmost restraint,’ Grab urges TNVS drivers","date":"July 04,2019","snippet":"","body":"AS a group of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers bared plans to stage a “transport holiday” on July 8, ride-hailing service firm Grab on Thursday urged caution, asking drivers to resort to dialogue with commuters and regulators, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said in a report. “We urge our TVNS partners to show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides,” Grab public affairs manager Nicka Hosaka said in a statement. Grab said that while it recognizes TNVS drivers’ right to free speech and peaceful assembly, it is also asking them to work with regulators and passengers through a dialogue, the Inquirer report said.  “In many ways, we also support the call for smoother processes and faster timelines,” Hosaka said. “Let us take the high road and to not resort to any rash actions that would directly affect the passengers we are all committed to serve.” On July 3 a group of TNVS drivers and labor group Defend Job Philippines said in an advisory they intend to temporarily stop operations and go offline from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on July 8. The groups said the transport holiday is a protest against the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) “pahirap policies” (or policies that make conducting business difficult) which include alleged inconsistencies in its processing of registrations and applications for TNVS.

But how can Grab and Uber be punished over rules that are impossible to follow? In 2015, LTFRB chair Winston Ginez legalized TNVS, the drivers or contractors and the apps that dispatch them. In July 2016, the LTFRB suddenly suspended processing of TNVS certificates of public convenience (CPCs). This was “pending review of existing policies.”  The “review” was so thorough that the halt was indefinite and still in effect today, a year later. Grab and Uber are legal, but drivers are not—and have no way to be. TNVS CPCs are valid for one year and expired during the “review.” Thus, last July 11, Grab and Uber each paid a P5 million fine.  Given this chaos, how can one name a driver without a CPC a lawbreaker — LTFRB precisely refused to process them! This recalls the “no plate, no travel” policy right before Easter weekend in 2015, when many plates were not yet released (“Is LTO’s ‘no plate, no travel’ rule unconstitutional?” 4/6/15).  First, consider due process. A law must be implemented justly and fairly. LTFRB cannot revoke TNVS CPCs through a vague, indefinite suspension. The public cannot even challenge a repeal never announced. And LTFRB confiscates people’s jobs or means of transport without due process. I had a memorable conversation one Uber ride from Ortigas to the Mall of Asia. I rode with a security guard who got a car loan and drove for Uber. He worked even longer hours to pay off the loan, but was proud to finally own his business. The LTFRB violates due process and basic fairness by suddenly depriving the  former guard of livelihood, leaving him unable to pay his loan. Even arbitrary interference with business models violates due process. Why ban surge pricing when taxi drivers demand extra fares? Why set minimum hours for drivers and destroy the ride-sharing concept?  This is not abstract philosophy. In the 2009 White Light case, our Supreme Court struck down a Manila ordinance prohibiting motel room rentals for less than 12 hours, to discourage “short time.” It decried a measure that “needlessly restrains the operation of the businesses of the petitioners as well as restricting the rights of their patrons without sufficient justification.” Second, consider our Constitution’s principles. Art. II, Sec. 20: “The State recognizes the indispensable role of the private sector, encourages private enterprise and provides incentives to needed investments.” Art. XIV, Sec. 12: “The State shall regulate the transfer and promote the adaptation of technology from all sources for the national benefit. It shall encourage the widest participation of private groups, local governments and community-based organizations in the generation and utilization of science and technology.” Art. XII, Sec. 6: “The use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good.” The LTFRB swore to uphold each line, written in the blood of patriots. Third, consider the economics of regulation. We cannot have laws for the sake of having them. As I wrote in “Uber: clash of law vs common sense” (11/14/15), the apps deliver accident-free, mugging-free, hygienic and odorless service without regulation. Clearly, LTFRB regulation has negative economic value. We must abolish the LTFRB, not the apps. The lesson is to never believe that law must halt the march of science or undermine common sense. Fortunately, it is no longer up to the LTFRB’s erratic style. Sen. Grace Poe, Senate committee on public services chair, has called for formal legislation on TNVS and will hold a hearing on Aug. 3. Poe might have a fourth mindset: Laws, like technology, evolve. Recall the movie “With Honors”: “The beauty of the Constitution is that it makes no set law other than faith in the wisdom of ordinary people to govern themselves.” React: oscarfranklin.tan@yahoo.com.ph, Twitter @oscarfbtan, facebook.com/OscarFranklinTan."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/140160/senate-committee-steps","title":"Senate committee steps in","date":"July 19,2017 - 10:32 PM","snippet":"","body":"Transportation Network Companies will continue to serve to commuters while the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) resolves their appeal for a reconsideration of the board’s decision to already suspend their operation. Senator Grace Poe said the solution was reached during a closed-door meeting with TNCs — Grab and Uber — and LTFRB called by the Committee on Public Services on Wednesday. “The public uproar caused by the issuance of LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008, suspending the acceptance of applications for (Transport Network Vehicle Services) TNVS in Metro Manila made it necessary for our committee, the committee on public services, to step in,” said Poe in a press statement after the meeting. Poe said that while there is a need to allow LTFRB to regulate public transport, the need for TNVS cannot also be disregarded. “Let us allow the LTFRB to do its job. They have to regulate common carriers to ensure accountability and to prevent the ‘dynamic pricing scheme’ of TNVS from overcharging passengers during peak hours.

Ride-hailing services is now a necessity because these provide the comfort and reliability that many of our people look for in public transportation,” Poe said. Poe said that LTFRB and TNCs agreed to reach a “win-win solution” during their meeting. Grab and Uber agreed to share their data with LTFRB to help the board in crafting guidelines that will consider the actual number of TNVs on the road and not just the TNVs that have been issued accreditation. LTFRB, on the other hand, will push with the implementation of Memorandum Circular No. 2016-008 and will allow TNCs to file their motion for reconsideration on said memorandum.

However, LTFRB-7 Director Ahmed Cuizon said that there are 500 slots for Cebu. “We are still waiting for the guidelines, since the new memorandum circular states that only 500 TNVS units are allotted for Cebu,” he said. According to Cuizon, there are still around 800 pending applications submitted to the LTFRB-7’s office, while more than 6,000 applicants are pending at the offices of Transport Network Companies (TNCs) like Grab and Uber in Cebu. During a press briefing in Quezon City last Friday, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III issued a memorandum circular limiting the number of TNVS units to operate as ride-hailing cabs nationwide. Under the Memorandum Circular 2018-03, LTFRB set a “common supply base” of 45,700 TNVS units, including those that already have a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), and the 13, 977 pending applications, leaving a little over 32, 000 applications slots available effective on February 3. Cuizon said if the guidelines would come with a ‘first come, first served’ policy, the LTFRB-7 will prioritize the 800 pending applicants. “Besides, in my opinion and in the interest of fairness, those who applied ahead should be prioritized,” he said. He thus warned drivers who plan to buy new cars for a TVNS to rethink their options as they may not be granted a franchise. “There are hundreds, even thousands of TNVS applicants who have lined up ahead of you. Please consider all factors first before you decide on spending your hard-earned money on new cars, only to end up losing out in the race for 500 franchises,” Cuizon added."},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/21298/makakabiyaheng-taxi-at-tnvs-nadagdagan-ng-17k","title":"Makakabiyaheng taxi at TNVS nadagdagan ng 17K","date":"05/31/2020","snippet":"","body":"DINAGDAGAN ng Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board ang bilang ng mga taxi at Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) units na maaari ng bumiyahe bukas.
