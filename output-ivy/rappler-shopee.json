Those loyal to Shopee know that it’s more than just a digital shopping platform. It’s a space where you can play games, watch livestreams, interact with other people, and even communicate on now.  When the pandemic started, it also became an avenue for donations with the first launch of Shopee Bayanihan. By making the donation process easy, many Filipinos were able to show their compassion and share their blessings.  It’s with this same intention and vision that Shopee launched the 11.11 Big Charity Drive. It aims to raise awareness and donations for underprivileged children in the Southeast Asian region.  Locally, 11 foundations will be benefiting from \"Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata\": Mano Amiga Philippines; World Vision Philippines; Young Focus for Education and Development Foundation, Inc.; Fundlife International, Inc.; GMA Kapuso Foundation, Inc.; Save the Children Philippines; Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Philippines, Inc.; Project Pearls, Inc.; Project Smile Philippines; Kythe Foundation, Inc.; and PGH Medical Foundation, Inc. You can donate until December 12.  Here’s how you can do that. You can donate directly to the 11 foundations through the dedicated in-app space within Shopee. You can donate as low as  P10 or as high as P2000 pesos.  It works exactly like purchasing any other product from Shopee so you don’t have to worry about a complicated process. Just choose a beneficiary, “purchase” your donation, and that’s it! From November 9 to December 12, there will be special Shopee Live streams co-created by Shopee and leading brands to bring users exclusive deals while giving back to those in need.  When you make a purchase, the participating brands will donate proceeds or the same product to selected foundations. If you’re not a livestream person, there’s no need to worry. Leading partner brands will also launch exclusive charity collections and offer a wide range of vouchers for charity. These will be available only on Shopee from November 9 to December 12. Whether you’re the type to donate directly or if it’s something you’ve been planning on doing but always seem to forget, \"Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata\" allows you to give back as much as you want in your way.  This Christmas, let’s not forget that everyone deserves to be joyful  – you, me, and most especially children in need. We all deserve simple gifts, and with \"Pamaskong Pambata,\" Shopee reminds its shoppers that we can care for others while caring for ourselves too. Shoppers can expect big deals and discounts from leading brands.  Check out more details on \"Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata\" on https://shopee.ph/m/pamaskong-pambata.

On a popular Indonesian gossip account on Instagram, the paid post appeared to imitate women warning about the dangers of dating apps, using screenshots to make it appear to be a real discussion. Using the format and portraying predatory male behaviour, one slide featured a man sending a woman a message, that turned out to be a Shopee advertisement. Shopee Indonesia director Handhika Jahja said the advertisement has since been removed and the mistake would not be repeated. \"Sexual harassment is a topic that needs to be handled with great care and seriousness, not as a joke or a promotion,\" he said in a statement. \"We sincerely apologize for the use of materials that are not appropriate for marketing materials.\" The commercial was slammed online, with social media users saying it belittled and undermined victims of sexual abuse and harassment, many of whom are afraid to speak out. On Twitter, users called for a boycott of Shopee, posting their shock and disgust alongside the hashtag #UninstallShopee. Using the guise of a sexual abuse report for an advertisement was heartbreaking, said one user, @HwhippedHyunji: \"I'm out of words, this is utterly unacceptable.\" Nenden Sekar Arum of SAFEnet, which monitors online behavior, including threats, violence and disinformation, said it made light of a serious issue. \"The content was insensitive, as though it denied the experience of gender based online violence, which is currently increasing,\" she said. \"It could even stir up trauma for survivors.\" Reports of gender-based violence have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to Komnas Perempuan, Indonesia's commission on violence against women. \"We appreciate Shopee's quick response,\" said the commission's head, Andy Yentriyani, adding that Shopee and other firms needed to set policies that would prevent and properly address sexual violence. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/beyond-the-buy/redecorate-space-with-shopee-finds-products","title":"Redecorate your space with these Shopee finds","date":"Dec 4, 2020 5:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Transform your home without the guilt of overspending","body":"We’re not the same people we were pre-pandemic.

Whether you’re looking to redecorate another corner of your house or just want to redo certain spaces again, these Shopee finds are sure to help you get that perfect “home aesthetic” you’re looking for.   Getting a new work table should veer you away from that all-too-familiar cozy vibe of your house. Plus, this table has small drawers to keep your new work station neat and clean. If working from home is giving you bad posture, investing in a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse is a good investment. Lift your screen nearer eye-level and type at a 90-degree angle to improve your overall posture.  Purchasing a shelf to organize your work items is also a good call to make sure your things aren’t cluttered about your laptop. At the same time, they’ll only be a reach away from you whenever you’re in the zone.  Can’t choose between a work table or a bookshelf? Get both with this purchase.  Use this affordable noise-canceling headset for those long Zoom calls on your computer or client calls on your phone. Alternatively, you can also use them for chismis-time at night.  Change your workstation to a gaming station with a keyboard switch. These will light up your game.  Are you really buying a gaming keyboard without a mouse? Who are you kidding?  Curtains have a way of changing an entire room’s atmosphere. This shop has patterned, plain, pastel, and dark curtains. Check out which one – or ones – suits your taste.  You can do the same easy fix to your bedroom by changing up the bed covers. This shop also sells sofa covers and pillowcases. Mix and match to make your home fit your moods.  If a shelf is too big of a commitment, but you still need something to put your things on, this pretty hanging swing is a good alternative. You can put tiny home decorations or your small plants here to liven up the place. This desktop organizer is great for office stationery or makeup items. You can even use this for random objects you’re not sure where to put.  For that plantita life without the commitment. These classy artificial leaves will give you that exact vibe you want.  Put your plants in the same room with these pretty minimalist paintings. The big plus is they’re cheap enough that you can easily redecorate any time you want to.  Okay, hear me out: pots – made of recycled plastic. I know you’re sold. This shop also has other designs! Cozy up your rest zone with this adjustable floor lamp that’ll give you that dim-lit cafe vibe.

So, here are some items that can help you out with that. Are you still feeling sweaty even though your electric fan’s on steady mode, blowing wind at speed number 3 directly at you? Why not try a fan that’s blowing air directly on your neck? It can’t get closer than that. If you’re looking for something that mimics the coolness of an aircon but not its electricity bill, try out this mini air cooler you can use at your desk while you work. Just a word of caution though, you’ll need to constantly refill this item with ice, especially in this weather.  A cooling drink is an obvious solution to this sweat-er weather. But with ice cubes melting that quickly and your drinks rising back to room temperature in minutes, is it really helping? Try using a vacuum-insulated bottle for your favorite juices to keep them at just the right temperature. If keeping the air conditioner off is out of the question, then opt for an energy-efficient model. This inverter air conditioner will help you save energy and cut costs.  This herbal pad is both a cold and hot compress. During the summer, you can put it over your shoulders to cool off. During the colder season, you can use it as a hot compress to massage your shoulders and ease tension. This prickly heat cooling powder has a lot of users who swear by it. If you haven’t tried out this cooling powder yet, you definitely have to stock up for this 3-month challenge we call summer. My personal favorite is the lavender scent.  Loose, quick-dry clothes are a default for Filipinos when March comes. But if you lost yours at the laundry or if you don’t have enough, you can easily buy oversized dri-fit shirts at this link.

Last April, the Philippines’ unemployment rate was at an all-time high at 17.7% – translating to 7.3 million Filipinos.   One of the ways Filipinos coped was by turning to online-selling, with over 75,000 online businesses registered during the pandemic.  But starting a business isn’t easy, especially if you’re not tech-savvy or even an entrepreneur in the first place. In response to this, Shopee readily launched programs and assistance to online sellers and helped Filipino entrepreneurs transition easier to the online marketplace. At the beginning of the lockdown, Shopee launched the P200 million Seller Support Package to help over 300,000 local micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) transition online. The package benefits include lowered commission and operational costs and increased sales and marketing support.  Education was also a highlight in the Shopee ecosystem. The company has a platform called Shopee Seller Education Hub, where around 6,000 sellers learned all about the basics of selling. For more advanced topics like live streaming, they also launched Seller Masterclasses.  For sellers who have very little experience with online selling, they also have the Seller Center, which houses all the tools sellers can easily utilize to monitor, maximize, and optimize sales.  Aside from these, the Shopee app also has popular tools like the integrated mobile wallet Shopeepay and Shopee live, where sellers can interact with their customers in realtime. With all these tools and options, sellers can optimize their approach to their customers, and rest assured that they are free to try new things in the online marketplace. Shopee Bayanihan is Shopee’s initiative to uplift sectors in need of help, with local communities as beneficiaries. Under this initiative, they raised funds for Filipinos in need during the Enhanced Community Quarantine.  After this successful campaign, they launched offshoots such as the Shopee Bayanihan: Frontliner Package, a 3-day campaign with Filipino frontliners as the beneficiary, and Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata.  (READ: Give love on Christmas Day: How to donate while enjoying Shopee’s 11.11 Big Christmas Sale) While many companies are pivoting their approach to their business and operations, Shopee is only growing bigger and strengthening its mission: to support local communities and Filipino entrepreneurs.

Shopee hosted a meet and greet at the Samsung Hall in SM Aura on the same day.  The hashtag #ShopeeScam trended both in the Philippines and worldwide.  On May 10, Shopee released the mechanics for their Black Ticket promo, which offered customers a chance to attend the meet and greet if they spent enough on the site. According to the mechanics, those who wanted to join the promo needed to register for it by May 25. Those who were among the 568 Top Shopee spenders for cumulative purchases within the period of May 11 to May 25 would get one pass to the event. Of the 568, the Top 40 would be given a chance to get tickets. In the terms and conditions, it was specified that participants in the promo needed to spend a minimum of P4,000 to qualify as a top spender. It also stated, \"For orders to be counted to the buyer's total accumulated purchases, orders must be placed from May 11-25 and must be received and completed by June 1, 2019.\" But according to some fans on Twitter, the site changed the terms and conditions on June 5, a day before the event, to say that orders must be received and completed by May 25, 11:59 pm. Screenshots were posted by Twitter user and BLACKPINK fan account @jkkjllmpcy, who claimed that aside from the change in the mechanics, there were also supposed discrepancies in the leaderboard.

At the time, users were worried sensitive information, such as personal pictures or other data, was being sent out from the device to Shopee for some unknown reason. While Shopee users were alarmed about potential data privacy violations stemming from the issue, the company's statement said the copying mechanism was a bug that was localized to the device itself. The company explained how, while images were copied onto the folder mentioned, \"the affected images were only copied locally on the user’s own device and were not accessible to Shopee employees or unauthorized parties.\" Shopee has since disabled the feature in the 2.60.07 version of the application on Android phones. Images copied by the bug should be automatically deleted once users opt to patch to that version of the application.

We earn a small commission when you shop using these links. I got engaged in January 2020, thinking I had all the time in the world to plan for a December wedding. Well, technically, I did have all the time I needed since we couldn’t go out for months. But that was the catch: I had to plan a wedding without going out of the house. Fortunately, we were able to secure some of the crucial things – church and reception venue, rings, photo and video suppliers – before the world went into lockdown. But there was still so much more to do.  Instead of waiting and doing nothing, I did what I could, wore my producer hat, and coordinated the most important event of my life – from my bedroom. Just through chats, text messages, phone and Zoom calls, I was able to book a caterer, event stylist, makeup artist, florist, lights and sounds company, baker, and wedding gown designer.  Looking for these major suppliers was pretty straightforward. I found most of them by searching on Facebook and Instagram. Getting my hands on the smaller things like shoes, accessories, envelopes was where it got challenging. These are things you usually find in the mall, a place you didn’t really want to go to in 2020. So how did I shop in a mall without going to the mall? Of course, Lazada and Shopee! I wasn’t much of an online shopper but my pandemic wedding turned me into one. I have no regrets, though. I wasn’t just able to get most of the things that I needed conveniently, but these little details helped complete the (limited, socially-distanced, and masked) wedding of my dreams.  Here are some of the things I bought from Lazada and Shopee and how they turned out during the actual wedding: There were only less than 20 people who needed to get an invitation. So, instead of getting a print studio to do it, we decided to DIY and saved tons of money. Get the envelopes for P17 each I only had a maid of honor and one secondary sponsor as part of team bride but that didn't mean we couldn't get matching shoes and socks! Get the socks for P60+Add the shoes to your wishlist (P3,995) My nephew couldn't go with us to the church to perform his role as the ring bearer but I made sure he was still all dressed up for the photos. Get the suspender and bow tie for P60 I was able to use this dainty headpiece for my ceremony and reception looks. Since it's affordable, I got a few more pieces for my bridesmaids, mom, and aunts. Get this headpiece for P47 My niece went out only once in 2020 to be at my wedding. Though she couldn't go to the church, we still dressed her up for the occasion. Get this dress for P932 Other than these pretty things, I also got essentials like face masks and face shields from Shopee. We made sure that all of our guests and suppliers were wearing proper protective equipment.  Are you getting married soon? How about instead of going out, try checking out Lazada and Shopee first for the things you need? Who knows, you might find it just like I did – and have a safe and beautiful event. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/beyond-the-buy/shopee-products-under-100-pesos-for-girls","title":"5 'it's a girl' things you can buy in Shopee for under P100","date":"Oct 26, 2020 2:57 PM PHT","snippet":"For new shoppers, use the code RAPPLERSHPOCT to get P200 off","body":"I know what you’re thinking.

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian screen-shot and shared the pages during a virtual Senate committee hearing on online transactions on Thursday, September 3, attended by officers from Lazada and Shopee. “Siguro (Perhaps) we can forgive 'yung mga (those) pirated software, pirated movies and videos, but something that we consume is very dangerous, and this is being sold on online platforms,” Gatchalian said. A product called Paragis Cafe Latte Mix and other consumable items with the same brand claiming to be health boosters were on sale on Lazada at the time of the hearing. Meanwhile, Wheyl Co JUST Whey Protein Powder for Keto/Low-Carb Diet was on sale on Shopee. Its page said 1,200 units of the product had already been sold. Both products were named in separate Food Advisories on the FDA website as unregistered items, Gatchalian found. “The FDA verified through post-marketing surveillance that the above-mentioned food products are not authorized, and the Certificates of Product Registration have not been issued,” the FDA notice stated. “Since these unregistered food products have not gone though the evaluation process of the FDA, the agency cannot assure their quality and safety. The consumption of such violative products may pose health risks to consumers,” the notice went on. Gatchalian asked Lazada and Shopee to explain – especially since they had just presented the Senate panel with the measures they take to protect their customers. “What are they doing to stop this? Obviously, the answer is they’re doing something but as we speak right now…it’s still happening,” Gatchalian said. “The platforms are not doing enough to stop this kind of unscrupulous activity,” the lawmaker added. Lazada CEO Raymond Alimurung acknowledged “that is occurring.” “I would like to reiterate that the presence of a violation will not necessarily correlate to us not doing enough or not doing our responsibility,” said Alimurung, a doctor by profession. For pharmaceuticals and supplements, Lazada uses artificial intelligence to weed out dubious sellers from their roster, based on names and images of “hundreds and thousands” of products, Alimurung said. Only “whitelisted” or approved sellers can sign up on the platform. “There is still a chance that some of these are going to get through, and what we do is we respond to complaints and notices by regulators and add it to what we’re doing,” he added. Alimurung noted the “practical difficulty” of scouring 50 million products’ names and images. To avoid problems like this, the company “will probably need to go in a direction where no small seller can list on our platform, or the entire food and pharmaceuticals category will be deactivated.” “I understand the concern. We take it seriously and we’re doing a lot. But we would like to brainstorm with your body and the authors of the bill on how we would do it, because there is a practicality aspect that I think we need to jointly figure out,” Alimurung told the Senate panel. Earlier in the hearing, Shopee public affairs officer Jaimmie Hans Segovia said the company has “a procedure for taking down counterfeit items” as a way to protect intellectual property rights. She was not given a turn to speak about the FDA-flagged supplements sold on the platform. Senate Bill no. 1591, filed by Gatchalian, seeks to protect consumers as more online enterprises open because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez told the panel that more than 75,000 online businesses have registered with the Department of Trade and Industry since the pandemic took hold in March, followed by stay-at-home policies from the government. (READ: How the pandemic is crushing company earnings) Regulating these new businesses, many based in their owners’ homes, has been tricky for the government. How does it police – and tax – these nascent enterprises without strangling them? During the hearing, the Optical Media Board presented the “pandemic level” of proliferation of counterfeit movies, software, and unregistered electronic devices on sale on platforms like Lazada and Shopee. Gatchalian said new laws should set a proper “regulatory environment” without discouraging small business owners, many of whom were displaced from their former jobs, or unable to find one. Senator Pia Cayetano pointed out that fake and uncertified products are not limited to online stores. She said many counterfeit items are sold even in reputable malls – including supplements. Cayetano said she once joined a raid in a mall when she was practicing intellectual property law. Her client was out to round up fake Lacoste products. “Hindi tayo mamamatay kung may Lacoste na mabentang fake (We wouldn’t die if fake Lacoste is sold). I don’t think you’ll get a skin disease if you wear a fake shirt. But when it comes to food, or pharmaceuticals, or supplements, there could really be health concerns,” she said. However, “they happen online and offline.” “It’s a very valid concern and we need to find solutions, but I think we will go in the wrong direction if we’re simply saying that we should immediately close our doors to online platforms,” Cayetano said. “Let’s address that problem holistically,” she added.  Wheyl Nutrition Company, the distributor of JUST Whey Protein Powder, reached out to Rappler and said the FDA has lifted the warning on the product, which comes in several variants. Wheyl co-founder Jason Reyes showed Rappler certificates from the FDA showing the product line has been registered with the agency since 2018. The protein shakes were indeed unregistered in 2017, Reyes said. Wheyl received a warning from the FDA at the time even with their application pending with the agency, he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/fda-orders-shopee-lazada-stop-online-sale-medicines","title":"FDA orders Shopee, Lazada to stop online sale of medicines","date":"Jun 14, 2019 12:16 PM PHT","snippet":"The Food and Drug Administration says the sale of drug products online places 'the lives of the general public in danger and at risk'","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday, June 14, ordered online shopping platforms Shopee Philippines and Lazada Philippines to immediately stop the sale of medicines until they secure the proper llicenses.

But why not give your significant other (SO) something different this year? Tune in to their preferences by getting to know their inner world.  One of the sure ways to go about this is getting to know their natal chart. (READ: Planets, signs, houses: Your guide to understanding astrology)  You can base the gifts below according to their Sun sign – the typical zodiac signs that we follow – or according to their Venus sign. Venus is associated with love, aesthetics, and expectations; it’s what we channel in our romantic relationships.  Earth signs are very practical people, but underneath their straightforwardness usually lies very sentimental and emotional hearts.  They are homebodies that love to splurge. Find their vice – usually food, accessories, K-pop merch, etc. Check their collection and find what they don’t have yet.  You can check out legitimate K-pop merch at Nabi Shoppe. They are avid overthinkers, so something that can help them relax for a day or two will do them good.  Get these 5 Under PH x Lumière Co. PH aromatherapy shower steamers for that rush of relaxation without the hassle of a long bath.  They are the most sentimental of the bunch. They keep a very small and very close circle near their hearts, so gifts with a touch of personalization will get you extra points. Create your own gift packages for them with their favorite things, and insert something like this customizable Spotify acrylic frame with your special song. Water signs are known for their emotional nature, so always think of gifting them something with sentimental value. It doesn’t have to be expensive, but it does have to be thoughtful.  They love receiving a gift that shows you remembered something about them. Writing them a deeply personal letter will probably mean more to them than an expensive bouquet.  Purchase stationery materials like this vintage letter paper and write down your favorite moments with them. They have a possessive nature, whether they show it or not.  Prepare gifts that can match with your SO, like this his and hers lock and key bracelets.  They love things that can help them escape the monotony of everyday life.  Gift them something that will transport them to a different space, like these Himalayan crystal salt lamps that can transform a room in a second.  Air sign personalities definitely come in different colors. They’re often curious and excited about the world, so they love that feeling of discovering something.  They love new information, so if they’re a bookworm, then get them a new book from the genre they like. Make sure to recheck their collection so you don’t get them the same one! If you don’t know where to start, check out this 75th Anniversary edition of Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods And Heroes. They generally love clothes, accessories, and anything that makes them feel pretty.  If your SO is into accessories, buy them a bunch of affordable but quality jewelry from this online store. They are usually conscious of their impact on the planet, so chances are, they’re into eco-friendly products.  Get them something like this gift package of assorted Nature Lust products to help them with their eco journey.  Fire signs are passionate people. If you ask them what gift they want, they’ll either be candid about it or be really obvious by dropping hints.  They are quite straightforward by nature. You’ll easily spot the things they love and hate. Maybe get them a stuffed character from their favorite show, like any of these We Bare Bears plushies. They love feeling special and remembered. Give them something one of a kind like a surprise complete with their favorite food and a wall decorated with photos of the two of you.  Don’t forget to put up warm lights on the walls for that extra special ambiance. They love to travel, so to spice up their home experience, you can take the time to help them fix their rooms up, just to give them a different view. To start, you can browse different wall decorations like these floating shelves where they can put anything they want – from photos to plants to favorite books.  Make sure to shop during  Shopee’s 2.2 Cashback Sale to get the most out of your purchases! – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/true-wireless-earbuds-shopee-sale-march-3-2021","title":"True Wireless (TWS) earbuds for every budget","date":"Feb 26, 2021 1:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Whether you’re a student or a working professional, reliable, affordable earphones are a must-have today","body":"Good quality gadgets aren’t just a luxury purchase these days.
