The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

Through adversities such as rising unemployment, frontliner burnout, and back-to-back typhoons, Shopee aims to use the power of e-commerce to give back to local communities. Martin Yu, Director at Shopee Philippines, said, “Shopee is committed to empowering different communities through e-commerce. Shopee’s strengthened digital ecosystem has supported over 300,000 local MSMEs as they transitioned online. Through Shopee Bayanihan, our CSR initiative, we have also helped uplift frontliners and children in need. It is part of our goal to harness the digital ecosystem’s potential to provide opportunities for every Filipino—from aspiring entrepreneurs, ordinary families, and the impoverished. ” Helping MSMEs revive their livelihood and embrace digitalization With unemployment rates reaching an all-time high, Filipinos turned to online selling as a source of income. To help these entrepreneurs enter the online market, Shopee partnered with LGUs and government institutions to launch various initiatives and strengthened its ecosystem to support sellers.  Through collaborations with the Quezon City and Cavite LGUs and USAID, Shopee has onboarded over 1,000 sellers this 2020 and provided digital marketing training to 500 female entrepreneurs. Shopee also partnered with the Department of Trade and Industry to assist in onboarding sellers from Regions III, IV, and XII. In addition, Shopee’s carefully designed ecosystem allows sellers to succeed in the e-commerce landscape: Unlocking the potential of e-commerce for the community Shopee also uses its platform to provide opportunities for local communities. Shopee Bayanihan is Shopee’s CSR initiative to uplift sectors in need of help. For its first project under Shopee Bayanihan, Shopee partnered with 39 organizations to raise funds for Filipinos in need during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. Shopee also launched Shopee Bayanihan: Frontliner Package, which provided frontliners with Shopee vouchers, Unilever vouchers, and mobile load from Smart. More recently, Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata raised funds for 12 local foundations focused on increasing awareness for children’s needs.

Ronnel Abrenica, head of the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) Trade Enforcement Bureau, said Shopee has been trying to appease the customers, flying out some of them to Thailand for a concert of the Korean pop group BLACKPINK there.  Abrenica said trade officials would try to come up with a decision on the case next week and would know by then whether the DTI would file formal charges. Shopee is being investigated for possible violations of the Consumer Welfare Act.  The online store launched a marketing gimmick to entice buyers by offering tickets for a meet-and-greet session with BLACKPINK in exchange for buying items in the online shop. The contest offered tickets for at least 500 customers who would buy the most from the online shop.  The 568 customers who spend the most buying items from Shopee would win a ticket for the event while the top 40 spenders would go on stage and meet with the band up close and get its members’ autographs. BLACKPNK had already held its concert on June 6 and angry customers went on Twitter with the hashtag #ShopeeScam to express rage at 116 of the customers being left out of the meet-and-greet event. The 116 customers were given notices that they had won tickets but the promised tickets, according to Abrenica, never materialized for unexplained reasons. Abrenica said the DTI was also investigating reports that other customers had spent more than the 116 who had been declared winners of the contest for tickets to get up close with BLACKPINK and were the rightful winners. The DTI, according to Abrenica, would also investigate if Shopee had, indeed, changed the rules of the contest without informing the department—changing the June 1 deadline for proof of purchase to May 25.  Abrenica said at least 10 formal complaints had been filed so far. He told reporters Shopee could be held liable for changing the rules. Shopee, Abrenica said, could also be fined P300,0000 for each customer deceived by the contest.

The trade official added that consumers also complained of transactions that happened in other platforms such as Facebook. “So far, we have broken down the number of complaints against platforms. We understand that Shopee and Lazada are among the three biggest platforms in the Philippines that are very active, which would probably explain the number of cases filed against them,” Castelo said.

Ronnel Abrenica, head of the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) Trade Enforcement Bureau, said Shopee has been trying to appease the customers, flying out some of them to Thailand for a concert of the Korean pop group BLACKPINK there.  Abrenica said trade officials would try to come up with a decision on the case next week and would know by then whether the DTI would file formal charges. Shopee is being investigated for possible violations of the Consumer Welfare Act.  The online store launched a marketing gimmick to entice buyers by offering tickets for a meet-and-greet session with BLACKPINK in exchange for buying items in the online shop. The contest offered tickets for at least 500 customers who would buy the most from the online shop.  The 568 customers who spend the most buying items from Shopee would win a ticket for the event while the top 40 spenders would go on stage and meet with the band up close and get its members’ autographs. BLACKPNK had already held its concert on June 6 and angry customers went on Twitter with the hashtag #ShopeeScam to express rage at 116 of the customers being left out of the meet-and-greet event. The 116 customers were given notices that they had won tickets but the promised tickets, according to Abrenica, never materialized for unexplained reasons. Abrenica said the DTI was also investigating reports that other customers had spent more than the 116 who had been declared winners of the contest for tickets to get up close with BLACKPINK and were the rightful winners. The DTI, according to Abrenica, would also investigate if Shopee had, indeed, changed the rules of the contest without informing the department—changing the June 1 deadline for proof of purchase to May 25.  Abrenica said at least 10 formal complaints had been filed so far. He told reporters Shopee could be held liable for changing the rules. Shopee, Abrenica said, could also be fined P300,0000 for each customer deceived by the contest.

The trade official added that consumers also complained of transactions that happened in other platforms such as Facebook. “So far, we have broken down the number of complaints against platforms. We understand that Shopee and Lazada are among the three biggest platforms in the Philippines that are very active, which would probably explain the number of cases filed against them,” Castelo said.

JG Summit is among the institutional investors that participated in Sea’s new round of funding amounting to $550 million, based on a press statement released by Sea on Monday.  “We look forward to working closely with Sea to deepen its presence in the Philippines and to nurture the growth of our country’s eSports and e-commerce ecosystems,” said Lance Gokongwei, president and chief operating officer of JG Summit Holdings. Majority of the new capital will be invested in the growth of its e-commerce platform Shopee, with afocus on key markets such as Indonesia. Shopee has more than doubled in size in the past nine months and now has an annualized gross merchandise value exceeding $3 billion, the statement reported.  Founded in 2009 as Garena Interactive Holding Ltd., Sea is the company’s new brand at the corporate holding company level to reflect its leadership across multiple platforms. “Garena is a brand that is beloved across our game ecosystem, our Shopee brand has become synonymous with e-commerce in our region, and AirPay is quickly becoming a leader in digital financial services,” said Sea founder, chair and group chief executive officer Forrest Li. “We cherish these three brands, and are now embracing an overall identity for our entire company.”  “Our new name draws inspiration from the acronym for our region, symbolizing our strong ‘home court advantage.’ In addition, the sea connects every one of our markets, symbolizing our corporate motto of ‘connecting the dots.’ Finally, Sea is a humble, authentic word that evokes the pioneering spirit of exploration – a wonderful symbol of our corporate values,” added Li. The statement did not say how much JG Summit invested in Sea. Apart from JG Summit, other investors in this round of funding included: –  Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd., a leader in the insurance, securities, and banking industry inTaiwan; – Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., a global institutional asset management firm;GDP Venture, a leading growth investor focused on the Indonesian consumer internet industryand an existing investor in Sea;  –   Hillhouse Capital, a global firm of investment and operating professionals who manage over US$25 billion in assets on behalf of institutional clients such as family offices, sovereign wealth funds,pensions, and U.S. and European university endowments and foundations; and, – President International Development Corp., an investment arm of Uni-President Enterprises Corp., which is one of the largest food conglomerates in Asia and also one of the largest retailers in Taiwan."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/293997/lazada-shopee-zalora-top-list-of-most-visited-online-stores-in-ph","title":"Lazada, Shopee, ZALORA top list of most visited online stores in PH","date":"05:01 AM April 03, 2020","snippet":"As people turn toward online stores and marketplaces to buy what they need during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brands could take into consideration which platforms are most visited by consumers to ensure that they still reach their target markets—and here in the Philippines, these are Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and BeautyMNL, says the “Year-end Report on Southeast Asia’s Map of E-commerce.”","body":"As people turn toward online stores and marketplaces to buy what they need during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brands could take into consideration which platforms are most visited by consumers to ensure that they still reach their target markets—and here in the Philippines, these are Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and BeautyMNL, says the “Year-end Report on Southeast Asia’s Map of E-commerce.” According to the report, put together by price comparison website and online catalogue iPrice Group in collaboration with mobile data and analytics platform App Annie and web analytics services company Similarweb, in the Philippines, Lazada’s market share is at 59 percent, with over 34 million visits in a month. The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

Ronnel Abrenica, head of the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) Trade Enforcement Bureau, said Shopee has been trying to appease the customers, flying out some of them to Thailand for a concert of the Korean pop group BLACKPINK there.  Abrenica said trade officials would try to come up with a decision on the case next week and would know by then whether the DTI would file formal charges. Shopee is being investigated for possible violations of the Consumer Welfare Act.  The online store launched a marketing gimmick to entice buyers by offering tickets for a meet-and-greet session with BLACKPINK in exchange for buying items in the online shop. The contest offered tickets for at least 500 customers who would buy the most from the online shop.  The 568 customers who spend the most buying items from Shopee would win a ticket for the event while the top 40 spenders would go on stage and meet with the band up close and get its members’ autographs. BLACKPNK had already held its concert on June 6 and angry customers went on Twitter with the hashtag #ShopeeScam to express rage at 116 of the customers being left out of the meet-and-greet event. The 116 customers were given notices that they had won tickets but the promised tickets, according to Abrenica, never materialized for unexplained reasons. Abrenica said the DTI was also investigating reports that other customers had spent more than the 116 who had been declared winners of the contest for tickets to get up close with BLACKPINK and were the rightful winners. The DTI, according to Abrenica, would also investigate if Shopee had, indeed, changed the rules of the contest without informing the department—changing the June 1 deadline for proof of purchase to May 25.  Abrenica said at least 10 formal complaints had been filed so far. He told reporters Shopee could be held liable for changing the rules. Shopee, Abrenica said, could also be fined P300,0000 for each customer deceived by the contest.

Not anymore.","body":"There was a time when the online shopping space was practically the exclusive domain of the female of the species. Not anymore. According to Shopee, the leading mobile shopping platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan that just celebrated its second year in the Philippines, men have emerged as a high growth market. They are staying longer and buying more through the Shopee mobile app.  And what do they buy? Mainly clothes, shoes, accessories, consumer electronics, mobile phones and accessories, sports equipment, fitness apparel and outdoor gear. The top preferences across age groups vary.  For Filipino men aged 20-24, Shopee data show that they buy more fashion items and accessories and shop more often than the other age groups. They are trend conscious but have lower spending power. For those aged 25-30, wellness, hobbies and sports items are popular. Then for those aged 31 to 35, and most likely married, with higher purchasing power comes the ability to buy more toys, skincare categories, as well as items for babies and children. “Men do tend to be more adventurous when looking for products. They are also more about specifications and price, rather than brands,” says Macy Castillo, head of commercial business for Shopee Philippines.  “There are still more women buyers, but the men’s market is definitely growing. That is one trend we noticed from last year. We also noticed that for men, they tend to spend more but buy less frequently,” Castillo adds. A surprise growth category for the male buyers is health and beauty, says Castillo, with the number of male buyers in the category surging by 228 percent in the last year alone. To build on the growing male market, Shopee is doubling its efforts to get more merchants who will cater to the male market, entrepreneurs as well as brands who can sell electronics, gadgets, accessories and even collectibles such as toys and action figures. But while the male market is growing—with the number of male buyers more than doubling over the past year—it is still the women who dominate, mainly millennials and a mix of those who want branded items and those who can’t resist a good deal. Going forward, Castillo sees Shopee featuring more of the branded goods, or “official shops” like those of Unilab, Samsung, PC Express and Belo, although there will always be space for individual sellers who have helped make Shopee a vibrant online marketplace that continues to expand.  The number of downloads of the free app has grown to 25 million across seven countries in the region as of June this year and more are expected to sign up as the mobile shopping site gets more goods for buyers to choose from. “We do have a lot of the brands coming in, which is different from a year ago, when we were more on the small and medium sellers. Now we are concentrating on getting these brands. There is demand for them,” explains Castillo. Shopee will also continue inviting individual sellers to join the Shopee network. This is why it has gone to the extent of constantly mounting seminars to help individuals sell their goods online, make a business out of the Shopee network. For Castillo, e-commerce is now accepted by the Filipino market but still has great room for growth, especially for Shopee that was set up from the start to be exclusively on the mobile phone. By downloading the app, Filipinos can already start shopping and so can everyone else on its network. “The Philippines has 56 million people on mobile and 99 percent are on Facebook. It makes sense for us to go mobile e-commerce so people can shop anytime and anywhere,” says Castillo. “There is a greater convenience that we give with mobile, given that the people on average unlock their phones about eight times a day. And it appeals across genders.” Its data so far show that Filipinos do most of their browsing and buying over Shopee over their lunch break and before going to bed, indicating that the working class makes up the bulk of its market. And they have been making Shopee exceed its financial expectations. In the Philippines, Castillo says buyers check on the Shopee app about 14 times a month or almost every other day. They tend to look, check the price, see what’s new and then eventually buy. The shift in behavior augurs well for the bottom line of the young company. “There has been a whole shift in behavior. Last year, we grew several times over 2015. This year, we are hoping to continue doing that growth trend. So far, we are doing very well, our expectations have been exceeded,” says Castillo. And that’s thanks in part to Filipino men who now swear by the benefits of online retail therapy."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1130368/online-sellers-shopee-lazada-ordered-to-stop-peddling-medicines","title":"Online sellers Shopee, Lazada ordered to stop peddling medicines","date":"04:08 PM June 14, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ordered online stores, mainly Shopee and Lazada, to stop selling medicines.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ordered online stores, mainly Shopee and Lazada, to stop selling medicines.

Ronnel Abrenica, director for the Department of Trade and Industry’s Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau (DTI-FTEB), said a resolution would be out next week in connection with the so-called #Shopeescam, a hashtag that trended worldwide on Twitter. Abrenica said they had so far received 10 complaints from angry fans, collectively calling themselves “Blinks” or the fanbase of Lisa, Jisoo, Jennie and Rosé, the endorsers of the platform in South Korea.  Based on earlier mechanics, top Shopee spenders within a set timeframe would win one pass for the meet-and-greet, while the top 40 from the list would be able to go on stage and have an autograph with Blackpink’s members. Abrenica, who had met with Shopee representatives on Friday, said 568 eventually made it to the winning list. However, an additional 116 fans also received notices they would be able to participate.  Abrenica said the promised tickets were eventually revoked for various reasons, including a claim that Shopee’s computer system had mixed up the list of top spenders. “Our major concern is those who were notified. [Shopee] should have had a clean list before they [sent out notices],” Lopez said. Abrenica said the probe would look into whether or not Shopee had indeed changed the mechanics of the contest midway without informing the DTI. Some fans alleged Shopee changed to May 25 the original June 1 deadline for all purchases to be made. Abrenica said Shopee could be held liable for changing the mechanics alone, the penalty of which could reach P300,000. He said the company could also be fined up to P300,000 for each complaint received. Abrenica noted the company has already been making settlements to appease several fans who were left out of the list, including flying one to Thailand for a Blackpink concert."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1359221/eco-groups-urge-e-commerce-sites-to-reduce-plastic-use-packaging-waste","title":"Eco-groups urge e-commerce sites to reduce plastic use, packaging waste","date":"02:38 PM November 11, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Public interest groups have urged top e-commerce sites such as Shoppee and Lazada to reduce their plastic use and packaging waste as they mount their respective 11.11 one-day super online sale.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Public interest groups have urged top e-commerce sites such as Shoppee and Lazada to reduce their plastic use and packaging waste as they mount their respective 11.11 one-day super online sale. Through an open letter on Wednesday, 150 diverse groups advocating for a zero waste and toxics-free society have urged online shopping sites to take steps to cut their packaging footprint as the country grapples with increasing plastic waste and pollution crisis.  “We make this appeal to all online shopping platforms to heed our plea for sustainable e-commerce that will not cause further harm to our ailing environment and climate, and endanger the health of humans and other living organisms,” EcoWaste Coalition Policy Advocacy Officer Patricia Nicdao said. “With the surge in e-shopping, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot help but be concerned about the huge amounts of plastic packaging produced, consumed and disposed of by the multi-billion peso online retail industry,” the groups wrote.  The groups lamented that much of these packaging wastes are going straight to garbage bins, buried in landfills, incinerated in cement kilns, clogged in drainage canals and river systems, or dumped into the world’s oceans harming marine life. “As two of the top e-commerce sites in the country, we appeal to Lazada and Shopee to set a good example in preventing and reducing the generation of packaging waste, particularly by diminishing plastic use, from online retail transactions,” the groups said.  They presented recommendations to the online shopping sites and others to cut down on their plastic use and packaging waste: 1.  Make public their plastic footprint (i.e., types and quantities of plastic packaging materials used annually); 2.  Adopt a plastic packaging waste prevention and reduction policy, including plastic-free packaging choice at checkout, returning used packages with reverse logistics and other schemes, and incentives for reduced packaging; 3.  Transition to ecological and safe options for delivering goods, including appropriate product packaging, to reduce disposable and unnecessary plastic and packaging waste; 4.  Implement time-targeted and measurable phase-out plans for plastic packaging materials;  5.  Communicate such phase-out plans to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers; and to 6.  Create a merchants’ section for those who sustainably package their products. The groups also called on e-commerce sites to offer, partner with, and provide incentives to developers, makers, distributors, dealers and customers of alternatives to single-use plastic bags, sachets, cups, cutlery, beverage and water bottles, straws and even diapers, panty liners and sanitary pads. Aside from providing customers with a plastic-free shopping experience, the groups further urged online shopping platforms to purge their sites of products that pose health and safety risks This includes non-compliant toys and childcare articles, contraband cosmetics containing lead, mercury and other contaminants, banned mercury-containing medical devices, proscribed or recalled products, etc."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/306846/pilmico-makes-feeds-and-pet-food-more-accessible-online","title":"Pilmico makes feeds and pet food more accessible online","date":"08:00 AM September 08, 2020","snippet":"As part of their digitization efforts, Pilmico Foods Corporation (Pilmico), one of the country’s top feeds and flour producers, has partnered with Shopee to make their products more accessible to the market.","body":"As part of their digitization efforts, Pilmico Foods Corporation (Pilmico), one of the country’s top feeds and flour producers, has partnered with Shopee to make their products more accessible to the market.

Shopee reportedly said there was a system error, and that the fans who complained weren’t really part of the top 568 spenders. In the mechanics, it stated that they will have a pass to enter the event, while 40 will meet BLACKPINK.

So the 119 inadvertently bumped off, they’re supposed to get tickets but didn’t get tickets to get in,” Lopez told GMA News. During the meet-and-greet event, fans accused Shopee of changing the rules at the last minute to accommodate influencers and celebrities. If found guilty, Shopee could pay a fine of at least P300,000. DTI-Trade Enforcement Bureau head Ronnel Abrenica also told Inquirer.net that Shopee will pay “for each customer deceived by the contest.” If what Abrenica said is true, the total fine could be over P35 million. Yikes. Regardless, DTI has ordered Shopee to compensate the aggrieved party and that the site’s team is now getting in touch with the affected customers. “They should have a program to settle all complaints. We will watch this closely,” Lopez said. We just have to wait for DTI’s final decision on the matter. We will update you once more details emerge.

The free insurance coverage will be given to riders from foodpanda, Gogo Xpress, Shopee Xpress and Ninja Van. Just last month, Manulife also extended P3 billion worth of free life insurance coverage to 60,000 Grab and Lalamove riders, protecting the riders and their families, in the event of injury or death while on duty.  Since the start of the enhanced community quarantine, app-based delivery riders have been among the frontliners carrying on with their duties amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Manulife Philippines recognizes the importance of these delivery partners – who bring food and other necessities to Filipinos and keep businesses moving – during the quarantine period.  “It’s a privilege to be able to extend our free insurance coverage to even more delivery drivers, who help us remain safe at home while risking themselves,” said Richard Bates, president and chief executive officer of Manulife Philippines. “By delivering essentials, they also help keep companies in business, and this insurance coverage is our way of recognizing our heroic frontliners and showing how we value the work they do.” Foodpanda, Gogo Xpress, Shopee Xpress and Ninja Van commended their riders for their commitment to help transport goods for both customers and businesses in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. “Our delivery riders alleviate the anxieties of both customers and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) by helping them reach each other in the most efficient and safest way possible. Manulife’s free insurance coverage for our riders rewards their sacrifices, and shows that their safety and protection are our priorities, too,” foodpanda, GoGo Xpress, Shopee Xpress and Ninja Van said in a joint statement. “It also affirms the kind of unity and support we can do for our community, so we can help protect each other when it matters the most.” The Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. opened its doors for business in the Philippines in 1907.

This is the line that most of us would get giddy about knowing that our order is here. But a family in Catigbian, Bohol, tells a different story after they were surprised by the online purchase made by their three-year-old boy. Marloue Mahumot, the netizen who shared their story online told CDN Digital how it all happened. It was on December 8 when his nephew Nathan Paña told him and his mother that he was going to buy something in an online shop.  “Bantog ra pag December 8  sa gabie while nag decorate akong sis (mama sa bata), ingon among bata nga “Mama Len order ko shopee”. Ingon sad akong sis nga “diha ka bataa ka!” Wala ra sad gamind akong sis adtong gisulti sa among bata kay kinsa man tawn pud mag expect nga tinuod na diay nga niorder sya at his age nga 3 years old pa,” he said. (Well, I recalled that on the night of December 8 while my sister  [the child’s mother] was decorating the house, the child said that “Mama Len I will order from Shopee”. My sister said “You just stay there child!” She did not take it seriously and did not mind what her son told her because who would expect a child would really order something online because he is still three years old.) And on the morning of December 20, his grandmother got a text from the delivery man saying that he was on his way to deliver the parcel and that it was cash on delivery. They were shocked! They told the driver that they would want to cancel the order but the driver said it could not be canceled anymore. To their surprise, when the parcel arrived, it was a big box with a rechargeable motorcycle inside, which Nathan had ordered. Lucky for Nathan that his uncle, Marloue had extra cash with him and was able to pay for the parcel. “Among gi ingnan nga i cancel lang namo, pero mohilak man siya. Kasabot na guro ni siya unsay cancel haha,” he added. (We told him that we will cancel the order but he would cry. He must have understood what it meant to cancel the order.) Well, instead of scolding Nathan, the family just laughed off the whole incident and looked at Nathan with happy hearts as they watch him play with his dream toy. But, to Nathan’s family, there is one more parcel coming your way, a backhoe truck toy ordered by no other than, Nathan. /dbs"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/136000/online-selling-buying","title":"Online selling,  buying","date":"04:07 AM December 09, 2020","snippet":"Several weeks back, my household helper told me she was leaving her job and returning to her home province to be with her children and help them with the challenges of online classes.","body":"Several weeks back, my household helper told me she was leaving her job and returning to her home province to be with her children and help them with the challenges of online classes. When my son found out, he went, “Did you know she has an online business selling clothing? She’s rich now!”  He was exaggerating, of course, about the instant wealth, but it was good to know our helper had managed to get into the new digital economy, one which is promising but which can be precarious, too, for both buyers and sellers. Let’s start with online buying.  First and foremost, do be aware of the many online marketing gimmicks that work on your psychology. One strategy is to fabricate scarcity: “3 items left so buy now.” Or the bandwagon effect about how many thousands have been sold. Another gimmick: As you scroll through a website, beware of the intentional changes in font size of the text, a slightly larger one making readers pause… and possibly buy.  There are so many other gimmicks, some unethical but tolerated even by reputable companies, an example being “chum boxes” or native advertising, which many media outfits allow on their sites. As you read a legitimate news article, you might get a box that looks like a news item—for example, “Filipino doctor discovers diabetes cure”—but which will bring you to a site offering products, some of very dubious quality. Second, don’t let your guard down with big sellers like Lazada and Shopee, which are really digital supermalls, with thousands of “tenants” who depend on the two giants’ marketing campaigns to get people to pick from the many products of both manufacturers and sellers. In return, the “tenants” have to pay a certain percentage back to their “landlords.” Both companies started out as Singaporean firms, but Lazada was bought by Alibaba, the Chinese multinational company of Jack Ma. It is convenient to shop with these big companies, which end up offering products cheaper than in regular stores, at least most of the time, and with an assurance that the products are not fake. Given the large numbers of resellers, though, there will be dishonest ones who will slip through, so be on guard. Something I find very annoying with Lazada and Shopee is their taking your order and then getting back to you and saying the supplier could not be contacted, or cannot provide the item. They refund you, but with a sizable deduction; for a recent purchase I made which could not be fulfilled, the amount I paid, P8,454, was refunded only P7,663.  Whenever you can, order COD (cash on delivery) to avoid those refund pains. Large companies are not always more efficient. I’m holding my head in shame now for falling for the 11/11 (Nov. 11) sale of Rustan’s, which sent out part of my order quickly and then faltered. When I followed up three weeks later, they replied with a totally useless email about lockdowns causing delays and inviting me to avail of a “complimentary Beauty Addicts membership.” I will keep readers informed on Rustan’s performance. With the prices they charge, you’d expect better service than to lure you with cheap marketing schemes. Whenever possible, do patronize smaller sellers. When Shopee rejected one small supplier’s product because they could not provide the specified dimensions for a product I ordered, the supplier contacted me directly to apologize and asked if they could still provide me with what I needed. I said yes and they filled out the order within a week. I’ve gone back to them with additional orders. And let’s not forget the gig economy of delivery services, the drivers of Lalamove, Grab, and others, who have been so badly affected by the pandemic. When I recently ordered some food, the seller texted me to say a Grab driver was on the way and to pay him P125. Minutes later, the seller texted again to say they were able to use a discount voucher and to pay the driver only P75. When the driver arrived, I paid him P125 and told him people shouldn’t be cutting down on their earnings. Coming up: 12/12. One of my younger daughters is asking for an advance on her Christmas gift, in cash, so she can do online shopping that day. The digital economy’s here to stay.

The new unit, JG Digital Equity Ventures (JG DEV), will focus on industries that intersect with JG Summit Holdings’ ecosystem. The new unit has earmarked $50 million to deploy to early stage startups and also for successful portfolio companies raising funding at later stages across Southeast Asia.  Before the creation of this new unit, JG group has already made at least $40 million worth of investments in technology startups, which includes SEA Ltd., operator of e-commerce firms Garena and Shopee, and Oriente, a digital lender operating in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. “Digital is a key pillar to JG’s future. There is no shortage of ideas in the digital space, so we must focus on a few big bets that generate the most value,” JG Summit Holdings chief executive Lance Gokongwei said in a press statement on Friday.  JG DEV intends to invest in startups that will augment or disrupt its core businesses.  These are companies operating within the new media, the consumer sector, retail and financial services verticals. It will also focus on technology platforms that will power future industries, including digital health, data and logistics. “JG is known to have very strong offline businesses. Our group is behind the pack in this digital journey, so our challenge is to leapfrog from where we are,” said JG DEV chief executive officer Bach Johann Sebastian.  While investing in startups, JG DEV also intends to build digital businesses in-house and enter into joint ventures that play off its Philippine ecosystem, which includes Cebu Pacific, Robinsons Retail, Universal Robina Corp. and Robinsons Land. It is putting together teams of product managers, software engineers, data specialists, investment professionals, and other digital talent who will be working in an environment that favors being scrappy, smart and imaginative. JG DEV’s current portfolio includes mobile app Cashalo, which allows users to access online and offline financing using their smartphones. Also in the mix is the startup Growsari, which links up over a million sari-sari stores directly with suppliers.  It also includes, Snapcart, an app that provides analytics services to brands by processing offline data like grocery receipts. While new to the game, JG DEV expects to work for its advantage its parent firm’s ecosystem and its team’s bias towards execution and operations. “Given the unique combination of the JG’s extensive ecosystem, massive customer base and its forward-thinking leadership, I’m confident that JG DEV will emerge as a digital leader in Asia,” said Ian Estrada, chief operating officer of JG DEV. /muf"},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/96741/blackpinks-jennie-allegedly-had-a-panic-attack-during-their-mg-event-in-manila","title":"BLACKPINK’s Jennie allegedly had a panic attack during their M&G event in Manila","date":"Posted on June 7, 2019June 7, 2019","snippet":"","body":" ICYMI: BLACKPINK was in Manila again for a meet and greet event. Despite the initial excitement of fans, multiple controversies and problems also popped up. One of the most concerning cases is Jennie allegedly having a panic attack during an onstage interview. This was first reported by Philippine Concert Scene on Facebook after they reposted a series of photos from the event. Here, you can already see how Jennie was breathing through her mouth and touching her stomach. This was further supported by a video posted on Twitter. Jennie did appear to be hyperventilating, but she was also smiling and keeping her composure all through out. You can also see Lisa checking up on Jennie and Jisoo handing her a glass of water.  There’s no official statement yet as to what happened to Jennie. It could be a panic attack or she was just feeling dizzy because of the heat. Either way, fans rallied behind her and blamed Shopee, who hosted the event, and their staff for not handling the incident better.     Before the event started, fans were calling for a boycott after the e-commerce site allegedly scammed them. This mostly came from fans who reportedly spent over P100,000 to secure a meet and greet slot, as well as fans whose slots were suddenly revoked on the day of the event. According to Shopee’s meet and greet mechanics, fans were required to register from May 11 to 25, and should also spend a minimum of P4,000 on the said period “to qualify as a Top Spender.” A fan meet pass would be given to 568 Top Shopee spenders and 40 of them would go up on stage to meet BLACKPINK. However, on the day of the event, Allkpop cited fans accusing Shopee of changing the mechanics at the last minute. “It was said that they earned more or less than PHP 2.5 Million from Blink’s alone. Fans also became suspicious as the new winners from their Twitter contest are allegedly trolls and some are newly made accounts,” the site reported.  There were also cases wherein fans were told their win was a “mistake.” They were reportedly given a gift voucher worth P1,000 for the inconvenience. Many also complained that several influencers and celebrities were invited to the event. (This was also backed by YouTuber AC Mondragon.)    On top of that, fans attached the #SHOPEESCAM hashtag to tweets claiming that the meet and greet event was rushed and BLACKPINK was mistreated.  Shopee later released a public apology to the fans. “The event fell short of the high standards that Shopee users and BLACKPINK fans expect, and hear our community’s feedback loud and clear,” they said in a statement. “Although we took immediate steps as soon as we discovered our errors to ensure the rightful winners of our contest could claim their prizes, we know that the entire process caused confusion, disappointment, and upset for many Shopee users and BLACKPINK fans.”  Based on fan’s accounts of the event and Shopee’s admission, it seems like the event did need several improvements. We hope the fans get the answers they’re seeking regarding the sudden change in mechanics because this shouldn’t have happened. We also hope the BLACKPINK ladies are alright, especially Jennie.

Joey Salceda is pushing for taxation on digital services—specifically, subscriptions to video and music streaming apps, ads on social media sites, and making online sales platforms as withholding tax agents—to offset an estimated P120 billion in foregone revenues once the government cuts corporate income taxes to 25 percent to soothe the pain inflicted by COVID-19 on businesses.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — House ways and means committee chair and Albay Rep. Joey Salceda is pushing for taxation on digital services—specifically, subscriptions to video and music streaming apps, ads on social media sites, and making online sales platforms as withholding tax agents—to offset an estimated P120 billion in foregone revenues once the government cuts corporate income taxes to 25 percent to soothe the pain inflicted by COVID-19 on businesses. Salceda told the Inquirer on Monday that he intended to call these new tax measures as “Netflix tax,” “Facebook ads tax,” and “Lazada tax,” respectively.  In the case of “Netflix tax,” Salceda said the current standard digital services tax slapped on subscriptions worldwide was 5 percent, although he noted that Chile imposes a higher 19 percent. Salceda said the Philippines might as well slap a new 12-percent tax on subscriptions to video and music streaming sites, a market currently worth about P5 billion.  At present, whatever subscription fees were being collected by apps like Netflix or Spotify weren’t levied any tax by the Philippine government, Salceda noted. For “Facebook ads tax,” Salceda said the idea was to “require that digital advertisements be made through a country representative of Facebook and Google so it becomes least problematic.”  As such, collection of 12-percent value-added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax among digital advertisers will augment the current revenue base, he explained. “The big money is in finding a way to tax the advertising on Facebook and Google,” Salceda said, adding that these two tech giants operate like a duopoly in the country as they dominated the online space here. Citing a model proposed by 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics winner Paul Romer, Salceda said tax on digital advertising will be “based on how much companies earn from displaying the ads in the tax jurisdiction, because that’s where value is created.” As for the proposed “Lazada tax,” Salceda noted that only 50 percent of vendors who sell their goods and services via online marketplaces like the Alibaba Group’s Lazada, Amazon, and Shopee, among others, pay VAT. Among online sellers, “around half are fully-compliant [with VAT payments] since they are large taxpayers and accredited shops,” he said.To capture the still unpaid VAT, Salceda said these online platforms will be tapped to also serve as withholding tax agents of their suppliers.  With sales of the Philippines’ e-commerce sector estimated to reach about P260 billion this year, VAT collections should reach around P30 billion, Salceda said. Once passed into law, Salceda said the government can block online or digital platforms that will neither pay the right taxes nor comply with tax laws. For Salceda, these proposed new taxes on all digital platforms in the country being used by Filipino citizens and Philippine residents alike, alongside the pending higher motor vehicle user’s charge (MVUC) pending in the Senate as well as the bigger 5-percent franchise tax on Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) seen hurdling the Lower House soon, can keep revenue streams alive despite the Department of Finance’s (DOF) push to cut the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent by July from 30 percent at present, instead of the original plan to gradually reduce it over a 10-year period. Based on Salceda’s calculations, the higher MVUC will raise P24 billion, while the so-called POGO tax will generate another P44 billion during the first year of implementation. Under the DOF’s proposed Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (Create), new investors will enjoy “targeted, time-bound, and tailor-fitted tax incentives to proactively attract the right types of investment (demand driven led by the Board of Investments, not supply driven, to attach investors leaving China, etc.),” Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua said last week. An upgraded version of the pending Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Reform Act (Citira), Create will also retain tax perks of existing investors for the next four to nine years, longer than Citira’s 3-7 years, Chua had said. Create formed part of the economic team’s up to P160-billion Philippine Program for Recovery with Equity and Solidarity or “PH-Progreso” being pitched to Congress in order for the economy to recover quickly. First-quarter gross domestic product already shrank by 0.2 percent and the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown during the second quarter was expected to bring the Philippines into recession, with full-year GDP seen declining by 2-3.4 percent in 2020."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316535/singapore-faces-talent-crunch-as-tech-giants-scale-up","title":"Singapore faces talent crunch as tech giants scale up","date":"03:39 PM January 27, 2021","snippet":"SINGAPORE — At least three recruiters approach Singapore-based software engineer Xiao Yuguang every day with job offers.","body":"SINGAPORE — At least three recruiters approach Singapore-based software engineer Xiao Yuguang every day with job offers. Demand for Xiao’s skills has soared since he graduated in 2014 with a computer engineering degree but now he just ignores the offers, having recently joined TikTok owner Bytedance after several years with Southeast Asia’s Grab.  “It’s not like I want to change jobs frequently,” said Xiao. Singapore is aiming to become a regional tech hub but faces a severe talent crunch as more firms move in, interviews with more than a dozen recruiters, companies and workers show.  China’s Tencent, Bytedance, U.S.-based Zoom Video Communications and unicorn Grab and Sea Ltd are among companies expanding in Singapore, fueling a war for tech talent in the city-state, where the jobless rate had reached a 16-year high due to a coronavirus-induced recession. “Certain member companies have been expanding their operations … and looking to hire more data scientists, more coders,” said Lei Hsien-Hsien, chief executive officer at the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore.  “So the demand is very strong but the supply is relatively weak, which then slows down some of the expansion plans.” Up to 500 new tech vacancies are posted each week on job sites, according to NodeFlair, which is helping hire for Bytedance and Sea’s e-commerce business Shopee. The information communications sector would need another 60,000 professionals over the next three years, cabinet minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in June. In response to a Reuters query on the figure, the communications ministry said in mid-September there were nearly 10,000 tech-related job postings on a government-run careers portal and another 6,800 jobs and traineeships would be created by June 2021 through industry partnerships. Border curbs due to the coronavirus and tighter foreign worker policies are delaying overseas hiring, exacerbating the shortage, some headhunters said. Some tech professionals can command pay increases of up to 30% when they switch jobs.  “It’s not sustainable,” said Daljit Sall at recruitment firm Randstad, who expects salaries to even out once borders reopen and as the talent pool develops. The government has been re-training thousands of people with tech skills while the intake for IT courses at Singapore colleges has risen 17% over the past three years to about 7,600 for the 2020 academic year. Singapore, an Asian base for many multinationals and banks, has for years had a tight labor market and the country of 5.7 million people does not yet have the capacity to quickly match the tech skills and experience the industry needs. “There are a lot of tech companies coming in and it’s a small island,” said Raagulan Pathy, head of enterprise Asia Pacific at Zoom, which plans to hire hundreds of engineers. “The simple maths of it means that at a certain point you are going to run out of talent,” said Pathy, adding that Singapore’s program for allocating visas for foreign workers was pragmatic. For now, the labour crunch does not seem to be putting anyone off. The Economic Development Board (EDB) is getting healthy interest from global tech companies keen to expand operations, it said. “We constantly seek to ensure companies who set up here have access to a strong Singaporean workforce complemented by a diverse foreign workforce,” said Managing Director Chng Kai Fong. The EDB has various programs to bridge the skills shortage including one that helps tech companies bring in talent from overseas and a new work visa for top-tier tech executives. The work visa, launched this month, has prompted many inquiries, recruiters said. But it is limited to 500 participants and has strict criteria. Companies are finding ways to cope.

During a Senate hearing on the proposed Internet Transactions Act, OMB chair Atty. Anselmo Adriano said the emergence of the e-commerce market has paved the way for a “new upsurge of intellectual property piracy.”  “E-commerce sites and social media platforms became huge enablers for pirates and counterfeits,” he said. “The nature of e-commerce platforms make it easy for pirates and counterfeiters to hide in private dedicated marketplaces or move between different territories to avoid capture,” he added.  Adriano presented slides that showed thousands of counterfeit software listings, including Adobe and Microsoft Office products as well as software games, being sold for “very cheap” prices on Lazada and Shopee, two of the most popular online shopping sites in the country. “These are selling various items that are found for the Adobe software that is being sold, 1,607 items found for Adobe,” he said as he flashed a screenshot of the listings.  Moving onto another slide, the OMB official showed senators an item for a “cracked” Abobe Photoshop software which is being sold for as low as P18. “[We also saw listings for] Auto Cad, which you would probably know is very expensive software. We found 92 items being sold on the internet for very, very cheap prices. One is being sold for as low as P40,” he also said. In addition to this, Adriano said they also discovered around 900,000 OMB-regulated products, like media devices, for sale online without prior license or permits from the board. “For 2019, we were able to confiscate approximately 40,000 pieces of USBs, SD cards, and internal hard disk drives from various sellers…valued at over P20 million,” he noted. Lazada Philippines CEO Raymond Alimurung told the Senate committee that the company has an “intellectual property portal” that allows legitimate brand owners to flag counterfeit items and notify Lazada.  “We will react very quickly,” Alimurung said. “Now it is possibly of course that they (brand owners) are not doing it or that they are not doing it fast enough,” he added. He also stressed that Lazada is doing its best to address problems of unauthorized sale of such products on its platform. He added that Lazada works closely with regulators like the OMB and even the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. “When we receive a notice, we’ll act very quickly,” he said. “We also respond to customer complaints so I think it’s important to note that it is not for the lack of doing a lot of things that those (counterfeit items) are there,” he added. “It’s just that we just have to continue to develop a better mousetrap as these guys try to develop better mice,” Alimurung further said. As for Shopee, Atty. Jaimmie Hans-Segovia said the e-commerce site also has a mechanism to address counterfeit items. “We have a procedure for taking down these counterfeit items where legitimate intellectual property rights owners can notify Shopee and request that listing of what they believe are counterfeit products be taken down and we act on this,” she said.

In an advisory issued on March 4, the regulatory body said: “The FDA strongly reminds all concerned stakeholders and the general public that online selling of all types of FDA-certified Covid-19 test kits (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR, antibody, antigen-based) is strictly prohibited.”  It reminded the public that these Covid-19 test kits with FDA special certification “are strictly for medical professional use and not intended for personal use.” FDA Director General Eric Domingo ordered regional field offices and regulatory enforcement units to “conduct exhaustive monitoring” of Lazada and Shopee to determine if Covid-19 test kits were being peddled on these online selling platforms.  The FDA also said it would “implement immediate regulatory and enforcement actions as warranted” against violators of Republic Act No. 9711, or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009. Since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the government has gone after the illegal sale of Covid-19 test kits, which are supposed to be administered by a medical professional in screening for the new coronavirus.  In May 2020, the National Bureau of Investigation arrested a former actress and her mother for the illegal sale of Covid-19 rapid test kits worth P78,000.The FDA has, however, issued as of February special certifications for a total of 380 Covid-19 test kits that are allowed for commercial use but under the supervision of a medical professional. Of the number, 129 are RT-PCR kits, 108 are rapid antibody kits, 68 are immunoassay kits, and 75 are other types of Covid-19 test kits."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/136061/an-inclusive-eco-friendly-online-economy","title":"An inclusive, eco-friendly online economy","date":"05:06 AM December 11, 2020","snippet":"After she retired as a public school teacher in San Pablo, my late grandmother Rosita started selling tamarind candies—Rosing’s Champoy—and to her dying days took pride in her entrepreneurship that has led to her products—which have since expanded to include peanut brittle—being sold in different parts of the country, including in SM supermarkets. Two years ago, she passed away, leaving my grandfather Basilio and second cousin Vikki Torres to continue her modest business, which supported the livelihoods of a handful of people.","body":"After she retired as a public school teacher in San Pablo, my late grandmother Rosita started selling tamarind candies—Rosing’s Champoy—and to her dying days took pride in her entrepreneurship that has led to her products—which have since expanded to include peanut brittle—being sold in different parts of the country, including in SM supermarkets. Two years ago, she passed away, leaving my grandfather Basilio and second cousin Vikki Torres to continue her modest business, which supported the livelihoods of a handful of people. The pandemic brought their small-scale business to a halt: The pasalubong centers and the restaurants that ordered from them shut down, and with international travel held in abeyance, they couldn’t count on their balikbayan customers either.  Such was the case for months until they decided to sell the products online. “This is where things are headed,” Ate Vikki told me. “We should at least try our luck.” And so last month, with the help of other relatives and a consultant, they opened their Lazada store, in time for the “11.11 sale.” My relatives are among the many Filipinos turning to the online economy to rescue their businesses—or keep themselves afloat by starting new ones.  Thankfully, it is easy to open an online store. While it took a lot of hard work (and paperwork) for my Lola to be able to sell her candies in SM, it took only days to set up the business’ presence in Lazada. It is similarly easy to do the same in Shopee, which is why many businesses often have parallel stores on both platforms. In terms of capital, it’s likewise easier: Unlike a physical store in a mall, for example, that will require months of rental advance and deposits, not to mention the cost of actually building the store, an online store will only take some elementary skills in layout, photography, and web development.  Finally, in terms of profit, the minimal commission and transaction fees allow sellers to offer products at a price point competitive against other sources. All of the above are liberating for small and medium enterprises, giving them a lifeline during the pandemic and likely beyond, with the online economy seemingly poised to become only more and more dominant. On the other hand, it is also easy to see how the online economy can exclude as much as it includes. We may have iconoclastic feelings against big corporations like SM, but will Shopee and Lazada be any different should they continue their growth? Empowering to SMEs the online economy may be—but what of the riders and workers who bear much of the effort, but are no less contractual and vulnerable as mall (non-)employees? The challenge, then, for our country and society is to make sure that everyone benefits from the online economy—from the entrepreneurs to the consumers and the people in between, especially the riders to whom we have outsourced the need to go out of our homes, with them bearing the risk for minimal pay. Of course, the onus is on the online sellers themselves to act on this equity considerations, but the government, too, has a role, not least of which is to ensure and facilitate internet access throughout the country, given how it’s become fundamental not just to our social lives but also to economic participation. Another challenge is to make the online economy environment-friendly. Alas, today all our individual packages come with layer upon layer of bubble wrap, and while this may be demand-driven (e.g., customers’ view that the more packaging, the better), can we not come up with solutions to reduce the materials needed? Can we not apply the principles “reduce, reuse, recycle”—in that order? Proven measures include grouping packages to minimize packaging, Amazon-style; using alternative packaging materials (e.g., EcoNest Philippines’ cassava bags and other products); and scaling up recycling practices and capabilities. Surely there are more ways, and I’m sure our environmental scientists and online sellers themselves have much to say in this important conversation.  Meanwhile, I would like to end this piece by calling on Shopee, Lazada, and other online platforms to pursue, support, and encourage plastic-free options within their ecosystems; for consumers to clamor for it, and for all of us—scientists, citizens, entrepreneurs, and government agencies—to work together to ensure that the online economy is inclusive, sustainable, and friendly to the environment. —————— glasco@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

According to the latest report released recently by price comparison platform iPrice Group, Tiki, Sendo, Thegioididong, Dienmayxanh and FPT Shop ranked sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth, respectively, by average monthly web traffic.  The five others in the top ten were Shopee (first) and Lazada (second), which were also conducting business in Viet Nam, and three unicorns from Indonesia – Tokopedia, Bukalapak and Blibli. The five Vietnamese e-commerce companies’ inclusion was concrete evidence of the size and potential of e-commerce in Viet Nam, which was forecast to surge 43 per cent by 2025 – the highest growth rate – by Google last year.  According to the iPrice report, monthly web traffic of Tiki surged by 69 per cent within a year from nearly 20 million to 33.7 million, helping it gain the sixth position in the top ten list. The impressive achievements came after Tiki received US$4 million of investment from JD.com in a round of series C funding in January 2018, which made JD become one of the largest shareholders in Tiki.  Ngo Hoang Gia Khanh, Tiki’s finance and development manager, told the media in May this year that Tiki targeted $50-100 million from strategic investment funds or groups of financial investors. Meanwhile, Sendo has posted strong development, especially in the second quarter of 2019 when its web traffic rose by 10 per cent to more than 28 million while other large sites, including Tiki, Lazada Vietnam and Shopee Vietnam, saw a decline. The report of iPrice Group also indicated that web traffic to the top ten e-commerce websites in Viet Nam in the first half of this year increased by 11 per cent compared to the same period last year. This data showed websites play an important role for e-commerce in Viet Nam, despite the significant competition from social networking platforms and mobile applications, the report noted. Viet Nam was also one of the two countries, along with Indonesia, that has seen an increase in e-commerce traffic, while the remaining four countries – Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines – showed a sharp decline.  Representatives of iPrice Group attributed the rise to the high competition in Viet Nam’s e-commerce market. They explained that Viet Nam has many e-commerce companies with strong financial potential in the top ten list and the rankings of the companies are not too far from each other. This competitiveness motivates the companies to continue to maintain multi-channel activities, including website channels, to reach customers continuously. Meanwhile, in countries like Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia, the competition is almost only between Lazada and Shopee, the representatives said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/272697/blackpink-promo-has-148-complaints","title":"Blackpink promo has 148 complaints","date":"05:10 AM June 16, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Almost 150 fans have now filed consumer complaints against the online shopping site Shopee over its recent meet-and-greet promo that dangled passes to the show of the K-pop group Blackpink for winners.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Almost 150 fans have now filed consumer complaints against the online shopping site Shopee over its recent meet-and-greet promo that dangled passes to the show of the K-pop group Blackpink for winners. As of Friday, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said it had received a total of 148 consumer complaints on what many on social media call the #Shopeescam, a spike from just 10 complaints filed last week.  The DTI’s Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau (DTI-FTEB) also filed this week a formal complaint against the e-commerce firm for changing its promo mechanics without government approval. DTI-FTEB Director Ronnel Abrenica said the bureau filed the formal complaint in DTI’s adjudication office, which could fine Shopee a maximum of P300,000 if it ruled in favor of the complainant.  It was not clear as of press time how the consumer complaints ballooned to 148 when, according to Abrenica, Shopee said that only 116 fans had received the wrong notice. He said DTI was now in the process of crosschecking the complaints it received against those  received by Shopee to cross out those who had already settled with the e-commerce firm.  The promo said top spenders within a certain timeframe would get free passes to the show.

The Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines said in a recent statement that it received a total of 135 IP violation reports as of September, exceeding the total 129 complaints received from 2015 to 2019.  Thirty-eight percent, or 51 complaints, were IP infringement matters such as two entities having similar marks or the unauthorized use of copyright works. Meanwhile, 32 percent were counterfeit complaints, while the remaining 30 percent were about piracy. Seventy-nine of the violators accused of counterfeiting and piracy operated online, most of whom—or 53 of them —used Facebook as their platform. Seven violators used Shopee, six used Lazada and three used Youtube, among other online platforms.  The reports and complaints were received by the IP Rights Enforcement Office (IEO), which has already acted on 108, or 80 percent of the total. Meanwhile, the remaining 27 were in different stages of validation. IPOPHL Director General Rowel Barba said the IEO will soon forward a draft of proposed updates to the 2013 Rules and Regulations on Enforcement, which the agency will finalize and issue “as soon as practicable.”  “The primary objective of the revision is to add more disruptive enforcement functions to the IEO, such as clearly including online counterfeiting and piracy in its coverage, coordinating with the National Telecommunications Commission to take down IP-rights offending posts and monitor marketplaces proactively based on findings of the IPOPHL, and elevate issues found to IP rights owners,” he said. Moreover, IPOPHL said it was being consulted in the creation of an agreement between e-commerce platforms and select rights holders for a protocol on the takedown of posts when illicit content or products are sold or posted for sale in their platforms. “Specifically, through the agreement, a notice and takedown system and procedure will be developed by online platforms to more swiftly address reports on counterfeit goods and pirated materials being sold online. We hope it will be signed soon this year once the remaining issues are resolved,” Barba added. While lauding online marketplaces for closely cooperating with the agency, IPOPHL said the surge in complaints showed the need to impose more policies that could effectively prevent counterfeiters and pirates from exploiting IP rights. One measure seen to improve the commerce environment, and which the IPOPHL said it strongly supported, was the solidary liability pushed in the Internet Transactions Bill or House Bill No. 6122. The IPOPHL is also keen on supporting the version of this bill before the Senate. The adoption of a solidary liability principle would put platforms and service providers entirely accountable for the infringing acts of their client-sellers, IPOPHL said.

You need some fertilizer for your house plants? Add to cart. Suddenly inspired to buy an exercise mat after a friend told you how yoga made her sleep so well? Select color. Add to cart. Feeling hungry after all the shopping? Add to basket, with all kinds of restaurants and grocery stores to choose from. Your order is being processed, the rider will be arriving soon.  This phenomenon has been around for a long time, and it has long been foreshadowed by other countries’ experiences—think Amazon Prime and Same-Day Delivery—but it expanded by leaps and bounds amid the pandemic. Even academic presses, once located in hard-to-reach locations inside universities, have now brought their titles to Lazada and Shopee, making authors, from Abad to Zafra, within reach. Home testing for COVID-19—antigen or PCR—can be requested through apps, and, of course, online payments, too. Another effect of the pandemic is to broaden the reach of this online economy to the provinces. At the height of the ECQ, I had to ask my Metro Manila-based friends to ship coffee beans, but now, most products can be shipped to most provincial addresses at prices much cheaper than in grocery stores (case in point, grains like quinoa and nuts like pistachios).  Finally, the efficiency has also improved: While deliveries in Laguna used to take weeks (if they arrive at all), my personal record, from order to delivery, is 28 hours. In Metro Manila, of course, it’s even more immediate: Once, I had misplaced my laptop charger and there was an important webinar coming up in a matter of hours. I scoured Facebook Marketplace for a replacement and within minutes, someone was arranging to send it to me via Lalamove. By the time the webinar started, my laptop was comfortably charged. Such is the growing importance of the online economy that the only sales that appear to matter right now are those online. The “11.11” (Nov. 11) sale was greeted by sellers and buyers alike with much fanfare, with Lazada hosting a virtual concert on its eve featuring the likes of SB19, Mimiyuuuh, and Ben&Ben. As expected, Lazada and Shopee are already touting Dec. 12—“12.12”—as the “Grand Christmas Sale” or “Big Christmas Sale.”  All of the above are a radical departure from just a year ago, when the mall was still people’s ultimate pasyalan and one-stop shop, where everything could be done from working out in Anytime Fitness to working in Starbucks. Arguably, the malls are still the preeminent quasi-public spaces in our cities, which is why public health officials fret over the loosening of further restrictions. (The other day, Metro Manila mayors announced they still would not allow minors inside malls.) At least for now, however, the pandemic has taken away the joy or comfort of being inside the mall, with its regimented pathways; all the paperwork and “rituals of disinfection” required just to enter each store, not to mention the need to don a face shield on top of a face mask, and of course, the fear of infection—which, however mitigable, is still much higher indoors than outdoors. Once the pandemic is over, malls will likely be back with a vengeance, but virtual stores have made inroads that are likely to remain. For me, for instance, there’s no buying nuts and grains in the mall again, especially since I can buy them much cheaper online. Surely, many sukî relationships would have already been forged by the time the quarantines are finally lifted; such is the inevitability of the online economy’s continued growth that even SM itself is a “tenant” of ShopeeMall and LazMall. But speaking of physical malls and their virtual counterparts, who benefits from the online economy apart from giants like Grab, Lazada, and Shopee? Small and medium enterprises may have found a chance to compete, but will their riders and workers fare any better than the malls’ contractual employees? What happens to all the packaging used to wrap our kettlebells and sleigh bells? And what new forms of exclusion do all of the above engender, given that money is the real genie? In my next column, I will be reflecting on the economic, environmental, and social implications of the continuing shift to the online economy. glasco@inquirer.com.ph For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

On the road, we now constantly see familiar brands like Lalamove, Angkas and Foodpanda zipping by on outfitted motorcycles. In offices and residential areas, delivery persons for online shopping apps Lazada, Shopee or Zalora have become part of the daily retinue of drop-ins. But all these, along with popular apps for games, music and movies, are generally all foreign. Where are Pinoys in the app economy? Why hasn’t any homegrown app made it big, yet foreign-made apps are now part of many Filipinos’ daily lives? A techie friend enumerated to me a few likely reasons.  First, our facility with English may be an advantage in the global job market, but in building the local app economy, it’s actually a drawback. Our non-English speaking neighbors can simply translate a popular app into their own language and immediately cash in on it in their national market. That’s not a viable path for our tech entrepreneurs, as an app in Filipino is not likely to fly in the mainly millennial market. They would have to compete in the much wider field of English-language apps, where the international market leaders already are. Second, our predominantly conglomerate-driven economy also gets in the way. A few family-owned conglomerates span vital sectors like utilities, banking, real estate, retail, insurance and, lately, higher education and health care, too. A Filipino tech entrepreneur with an innovative idea for any of these sectors must go through the corporate labyrinth to get to the right audience—usually a phalanx composed of a highly paid chief information officer, digital transformation officers, innovation strategy consultants and investment managers. These people would gladly snap up golden nuggets of wisdom and present it as their own to their corporate masters, with the original presenter tossed out of the picture. This, I’m told, is an all too common story experienced by many a young tech whiz in the country.  Some are offered a few million pesos to further develop their idea, usually the product of years of passionate pursuit of the next big digital play. The allure of a few million pesos offered to a group of young would-be tech entrepreneurs, most likely running low in funds and patience with each other, is often too hard to resist. The technology so acquired becomes part of the technology arsenal of the conglomerate. As the story line goes, that particular innovation is stopped from scaling up into a national app, but ends up stillborn and trapped within the limited space of the conglomerate’s corporate realm. Finally and fundamentally, the most formidable hurdle could well be the absence of a public national broadband network (NBN) spanning the entire country. One might liken an NBN to the public road network. Just as the road network allows agriculture produce and industrial goods to flow freely among farms and factories and their suppliers and end-users, an NBN would likewise allow free movement of digital services within the digital ecosystem.  Private for-profit corporations as national broadband providers simply won’t work. By nature, they are out to maximize profit and return on investment for their shareholders. Private providers would thus be like toll operators with a practical monopoly on the entire country’s digital “road system,” whose primary aim is not national development, but to make their shareholders happy. They cannot be expected to provide free or affordable broadband access to some 25 million Filipino youth in the public school system, to our burgeoning urban poor communities, or to our disparate farming and fishing communities. They will provide broadband access to those who will pay for it. And as current pricing goes, if you want higher internet speeds that are in fact already standard elsewhere, you’ll have to shell out more money and pay a higher price. Until we clear these hurdles, a robust app economy in the country will remain elusive. cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316997/baby-products-fitness-equipment-to-get-a-lot-of-love-in-2021","title":"Baby products, fitness equipment to get a lot of love in 2021","date":"05:02 AM February 05, 2021","snippet":"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, consumers everywhere changed their buying behavior.

In the Philippines, we saw the surge in online shopping, with approximately ​30 percent of Filipinos buying grocery essentials online​. At least half of Filipino consumers are expected to sustain their preference for online shopping once the pandemic is over.  The UP Population Institute and the UN Population Fund estimate a 2021 baby boom with approximately 2.56 million babies born this year. To compete in this space, online sellers should focus on ​essential baby and maternity products, such as items for feeding/breastfeeding and newborn care, as opposed to luxury items. On Shopee, pajama sets, bibs, baby wipes, and reusable diapers are some of the bestselling items in the Babies & Kids category, with thousands of sales a month. Baby cribs are among the most popular products on Lazada. Meanwhile, items related to breastfeeding—ice packs, storage bags, supplements like malunggay tea—are bestsellers on Babymama.ph  If there’s one thing the COVID-19 pandemic taught us, it’s to not skimp on safety measures. We foresee the sustained demand for personal protective equipment, such as masks, face shields, and disinfectants. This year, local travel restrictions are expected to ease up with news of vaccinations on the horizon. With tourist favorites like Boracay and Palawan opening up their borders to local tourists with heightened safety precautions, other destinations are expected to follow suit within the year. As confidence in local travel increases, entrepreneurs can expect a modest rise in demand for travel essentials such as beachwear and other travel accessories.  The explosion of new food sellers during the pandemic says it all—people are spending more time in their kitchens. And this newfound love for home cooking will stay, according to coronavirus consumer behavior research​. Searches for “baking” and “cooking,” as well as related terms, have also soared, ​according to Google Trends​. It is wise to look into selling cooking and baking tools, supplies, and equipment. Search Facebook buy-and-sell groups for cooks and bakers to ​find out what people are looking for​. Check out the most popular food items on Facebook and Instagram and figure out what tools and supplies are needed to make them. Demand for home fitness equipment has ​risen​. Not surprising, as gyms around the country are either closed or open on a limited capacity. Top sales on Shopee and Lazada include yoga mats and jump ropes. But other brands selling large equipment and weights have been thriving as well. Businesses such as Play Hard Fitness started offering delivery services of their multistation home gyms during the quarantine, and have even joined major online sales like 12.12. Sellers can also focus on verticals, especially if it is within their interest. For example, if you’re aiming to become a triathlete, sell apparel, gear and supplements that help triathletes train. Another area to capitalize on is people’s need to be outdoors and escape the city after long months of community quarantine. Case in point: Google searches for “biking” and “cycling” have risen.  Even before COVID-19 broke out, many Filipinos were already working from home (WFH). The Philippines is the world’s ​fastest-growing gig-economy market​, and these freelancers tend to work for overseas clients. WFH is here to stay. So think of items that make it easier. Find the best-value monitors, wireless keyboards, ergonomic chairs, standing desks, lamps and more. It’s crucial to meet buyers where they are. Even if a business has its own e-commerce website, it is still necessary to be present in the platforms where buyers are most comfortable browsing, asking questions, and making purchase decisions. It would be wise to stay up-to-date on the most relevant marketing trends for the coming year. With more consumer-to-consumer transactions and social selling taking place, messaging apps are now an important tool in any e-commerce seller’s arsenal. A ​2019 study commissioned by Facebook​ showed that 66 percent of Filipinos who made purchases through messaging platforms planned to spend more on c-commerce shopping in the future. The Philippines is one of the ​biggest adopters​ of c-commerce in Southeast Asia. No surprise there—​97 percent of internet users in the country use chat apps. But you don’t need the stats to tell you that. You’ve probably observed that your buyers like to ask you questions on Messenger or Viber. Filipinos are looking for more flexible options and discounted prices. To meet this demand, you can hold sales more frequently or at a larger scale. Try creative ways to put your products on sale or offer freebies without suffering a loss. Examples include product bundles, tiered pricing and free shipping for a minimum purchase. Raise your hand if you’re now part of an online barter group or have joined an online community for plantitas or other hobbyists. If groups like these allow sales posts, it’s worth pouring marketing time and effort here, as there’s a high potential for group members to be interested in your products. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Or if you’re looking at something you can manage in the long term, consider setting up your own interest group. TikTok ​took the bored, quarantined world by storm​ in 2020, and it’s not going away anytime soon. Of course, make sure first that your target customers are on TikTok. It’s going to take a lot of time and creativity to get your brand noticed on the platform, so there should be a clear potential return on investment here. But can TikTok actually influence buying decisions? According to this list of “​TikTok-Approved Products You Never Knew You Needed In Your Life,​” yes, it can.5. Weird, experimental ads Could 2021 be the year Filipino businesses dare to make surreal, quirky ads like those viral videos from Japan and Thailand? ​RC Cola’s ad​ may have left you scratching your head, but admit it—​it got people talking.​ And based on social media buzz, it looks like after surviving the weird year that was 2020, people are ready for more of these kinds of bizarre marketing campaigns. Before releasing a video designed to get buzz, make sure you’ve planned your marketing funnel. Where do people go after seeing your video? Provide links to relevant website pages, blog posts, or product listings to increase conversion. Filipinos like it when brands ​address issues​ they care about, ​including COVID-19​, in their marketing campaigns. Millennial customers​, in particular, expect brands to speak out. But ​Gen Z​ takes it a step further, and expects brands and their employees to walk their talk by supporting and contributing to social causes. So be careful not to shoot yourself in the foot. Don’t be woke for the sake of being woke—choose an issue that you truly care about and that you’re capable of supporting. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); On Facebook, videos have ​higher engagement​ among Filipinos compared to other types of posts. If you don’t have a YouTube channel yet, you might consider starting one, if your audience is there. But if you’re planning to hit many social networks—TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook—make sure you don’t get overwhelmed.

During a House trade and industry committee hearing on Thursday, DTI Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said that the number of complaints involving online sellers and buyers totaled to 8,059 in April and May.  For the first three months of 2020, however, there were only 985 complaints received by the DTI. “Usually [the complaints were about] defective products or deceptive transactions by the seller. Mostly, product-related or non-delivery or late delivery or the product delivered is not what is advertised,” Castelo said.  “Less than 1,000 po yung complaints that we have received from January to March but because everybody was at home during the height of the ECQ (enhanced community quarantine0 in April and May, it has risen [by] 8,000 kaya po naging 9,044 yung total number ng complaints natin,” she added. According to DTI data presented before the House committee, complaints involving online transactions before the “peak of the ECQ’s impact” rose by 78.22 percent in April and May.  Meanwhile, complaints involving two of the more popular shopping platforms like Lazada and Shopee decreased by 40.99 percent but complaints against individual sellers on Facebook Marketplace climbed by 62.16 percent. DTI figures also showed that complaints involving overpricing “substantially” increased by 51 percent, with 6,992 complaints recorded. But since products involved alcohol, face masks and other products that are not under the purview of the DTI, such complaints were referred to other agencies, such as the Department of Health, for appropriate action. Castelo also told lawmakers that authorities have so far arrested around 500 merchants. The total value of confiscated products, meanwhile, amounted to around P100 million, the DTI official added.  However, she said complainants usually lacked the interest to pursue the case or charges against the sellers. “Most of the time, either the complainant lacks interest, hindi na niya ipu-pursue, especially if it’s a non-existent seller. There are a lot of times that a consumer would just buy from any page or any online merchant without finding out kung sino po ‘yun or finding out the reputation, the track record or san ba mahahanap in case there’s a problem later on,” Castelo explained. “That’s why we always include that in our education to make sure, siyempre po it’s not always merchant ang at fault, pati po ang consumer must also be responsible…so that he or she would know how to file the complaint later on,” she added."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/258594/foreigners-dominate-ph-e-commerce-market-activity","title":"Why foreigners dominate PH e-commerce market activity","date":"05:01 AM October 08, 2018","snippet":"Local players in the Philippine e-marketplace reach more Filipinos in terms of social media activity.","body":"Local players in the Philippine e-marketplace reach more Filipinos in terms of social media activity. However, they struggle to establish a stronghold in terms of actual selling activity as international players are still the preferred choice for most Filipinos.  It comes as a surprise that only a few international players dominate the country’s e-marketplace traffic activity. Based on Kuala Lumpur-based iPrice Group’s Map of eCommerce in the Philippines during the second quarter of 2018, there were more local active players.  However, international players fueled market activity. In fact, the share of foreign players in the overall traffic accounted for 93 percent of the overall e-marketplace activity. Local players, on the other hand, only led in social media activity as they accounted for 75 percent of e-commerce activity from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter platforms. Foreign players  There were only eight foreign players engaged in e-commerce traffic in the Philippines: Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, eBay, Sephora, Sophie Paris, My Sale and Melissa Philippines. Of these eight players, Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and eBay were the top four most visited e-marketplaces in the country. Of the four, Lazada had a dominant 68-percent market share, at least triple the size of its closest competitor, Shopee. This trend is unique to the Philippine market because in its regional counterparts Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, foreign players have less than half of the overall e-marketplace traffic activity with 45, 20 and 47 percent, respectively. For Indonesia and Singapore, local players Tokopedia and Qoo10 were the most visited e-marketplaces.  The reason behind the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was traced to the Filipinos’ online shopping preference that is mainly based on brand familiarity. In fact, according to a Kantar Worldpanel survey, 84 percent of Filipinos (out of 3,000 household surveyed) preferred to buy from established companies despite the alternatives available in the market. This specific Filipino consumer behavior affected the local e-commerce players as majority of them have just started operating in the e-marketplace. Another factor that influenced the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was that majority of big local brick-and-mortar companies such as SM and Ayala malls were amplifying their online presence with e-marketplace partnerships with the more established players such as Lazada and Zalora instead of creating their own e-marketplaces. Meanwhile, the government’s project—road map of e-commerce—is mostly tied with international e-marketplaces wherein local brick-and-mortal companies and brands as well as MSMEs are encouraged to sell. More pressure While this will result in more customers and more jobs especially for MSMEs, it is putting pressure on the local players. The most visited local e-marketplace in the country is BeautyMNL, placing fifth overall with less than a million traffic. Meanwhile, Kimstore, a tech marketplace, placed ninth. The general e-marketplaces—Galleon, O Shopping and Takatack (which were previously in Q1 2018’s top e-commerce) all fell a notch, placing seventh, eighth and 11th, respectively. The only local e-commerce that accelerated in terms of ranking was Argomall as it jumped two notches to sixth in the overall e-commerce ranking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Interestingly, the majority of local players experienced inconsistency in traffic as there were occasions of leaps and slips. The e-marketplaces that saw increased traffic were Seek the Unique, Apartment 8 Clothing, Zeus, Straight Forward Clothing, Great Value Plus, Bayan Mall, TV Shop, Mall Hallo Hallo and CesaPH, which on the average rose in ranking by about seven notches. E-marketplaces that slipped in traffic were Adobomall, Watch Portal, Goods, Mommy Mundo, Bigmk, Abubot, which on the average declined in ranking by about eight notches. Despite the low market penetration and inconsistency in traffic of local players, the majority of local players found their market in social media. Overall, the local players dominated Instagram and Twitter as they attracted 70 and 51 percent, respectively, of the e-marketplace social media followers. Local marketplace The local fashion and beauty e-marketplaces: Apartment 8 Clothing, Sunnies Studios, BeautyMNL, Kimstore and CesaPH topped Instagram placing first, second, fifth, seventh and ninth, respectively. Meanwhile, social media activity for Facebook was taken over by international players as their share of social media followers in this platform accounted for 77 percent. Filipino consumers are among the most active on social media, spending an average of four hours a day. As such, Filipino consumers are highly exposed to brands leveraging their products in social media. Clearly, the popularity of social media is a huge opportunity marketplace for e-commerce and independent merchants alike.—CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1254000/cabinet-members-donate-part-of-salaries","title":"Cabinet members donate part of salaries","date":"05:34 AM April 05, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — In a bid to show that they feel and understand the suffering of quarantined Filipinos, most Cabinet members have agreed to donate up to 75 percent of their salaries to programs designed to address the coronavirus epidemic, according to Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — In a bid to show that they feel and understand the suffering of quarantined Filipinos, most Cabinet members have agreed to donate up to 75 percent of their salaries to programs designed to address the coronavirus epidemic, according to Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles. Some secretaries, he said, have even offered to donate a huge chunk of their pay up to December this year. Department secretaries are under Salary Grade 31, which translates to a monthly salary ranging from P262,000 to P301,000.  Nograles said he was one of those who chose to donate most of his salary to the COVID-19 programs, but he would leave it up to his colleagues in the Cabinet—comprised of 21 department heads and 32 Cabinet-level officials—to disclose if they made a similar move. “We say that we [will] fight this war together,” he said as Filipinos, stuck at home with nothing to do, used social media to call out local officials for their inaction or for using the national health emergency as a pretext for self-promotion.  Sen. Christopher Go spoke on a daily public briefing on government-run People’s Television Network to deny he had anything to do with corporate donations that were labeled with his name instead of the President or the government. Both the online shopping company Shopee and the LT Group Inc., owned by tycoon Lucio Tan, explained that they were only thanking Go, chair of the Senate committee on health, for helping them identify which health institutions needed help.  Other senators said they had been working and helping Filipinos cope with the enhanced community quarantine without fanfare and without media tailing their every move 24 hours just so they could grandstand during the COVID-19 crisis. “We know that this is not the time to seek fame or engage in one-upmanship. We should all win in this fight. No Filipino should be left behind,” Senate President Vicente Sotto III said in a statement. “Let’s devote our competence and energy to genuine public service, whether anybody is watching or not.” “Our duty as lawmakers is to promptly pass the enabling law so the executive department can use funds to respond during this health crisis. We did so in 18 hours. It’s not our mandate to repack rice and sardines with a complete PR team around us. Some of us do, without the PR team!” he added. Sotto did not name any official in his statement, but it was issued after Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso challenged officials, including senators, to help out during the crisis. On Thursday, Domagoso streamed a live message on his Facebook page asking officials, including senators, to help the residents of Manila in their hardships.  “Where are you? Where are you? My fellow citizens and I are looking for you. You’re always opposing things because you’re pushing your political interests. Are you heartless? You’re taking advantage of a leader’s weakness,” the mayor said. Sen. Panfilo Lacson made a more direct response in a Twitter post. “Yorme, the government is able to provide financial aid to our residents in Manila because our senators worked to pass the (Bayanihan to Heal as One Act) despite the threat of COVID-19. Your accusation that we have done nothing is wrong,” the senator wrote. Lacson said Sotto had been assisting health workers in Quezon City but chose not to seek publicity for it. “We have our own ways of helping,” he added. The following day, Domagoso made another Facebook Live stream and thanked Congress for the Bayanihan law that resulted in direct financial aid to 185,000 families in Manila.

There is at least one reason to believe that women may be harder hit on a more permanent basis by all the changes. In the Philippines, with Christmas season starting with the onset of the “ber” starting September, it has been some time now that we’ve felt the difference, especially with sparse crowds in erstwhile teeming shopping malls and restaurants. In December itself, parties with food and gifts galore have given way to usually food-less online gatherings featuring online games, prerecorded entertainment numbers, and whatever else creative minds can muster to fill up the time. But I’ve seen two of such parties include food delivered to the doorstep of the online participants, which somehow helps cushion the huge drop in sales of the usual food establishments. Related to this, what I’ve seen to be much busier than usual are the logistics and delivery services catering to online shopping businesses. This year, SM and the like have been replaced by Shopee and Lazada, and these firm’s names are coming close to being “genericized” to refer to shopping in general. In the case of one such delivery company that comes nearly every day to our family compound, we’re told that many additional motorcycle riders have been hired to service the surge in demand. The “11.11” and “12.12” promos that these dominant e-commerce companies have been mounting have succeeded in tickling the shopping itch in household consumers. I could tell how broad their clientele has become from how my grandchildren’s “yayas” are also frequent recipients of their deliveries, thanks to cash-on-delivery arrangements available in these shopping platforms.  Indeed, Lazada Philippines reported selling more than 2 million items within the first hour of Nov. 11, involving more than 70,000 sellers, of which 14,000 were reportedly first-timers. China-based Alibaba, its parent company, reported record sales of over $56 billion worth of goods within the first 30 minutes of Nov. 11, with orders peaking at 538,000 per second! Alibaba has effectively turned Nov. 11 into the Asian counterpart of Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving Thursday, traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year in America. Meanwhile, Singaporean-owned Shopee similarly reported record sales with its own 11.11 promo, with over 200 million items sold in 24 hours on Nov. 11. In the Philippines, the company reports that products in the Home & Living category topped sales, as Filipino shoppers bought over 1.4 million home decoration items such as wallpapers and window curtains during the Nov. 11 sale day. The marked shift to online retail platforms has important implications for the retail trade industry in the Philippines, which, together with wholesale trade, is actually our top source of jobs. This sector accounts for close to 9 million, or more than one-fifth of total jobs in the country. Recent years had seen malls sprouting like mushrooms all through our regions, but it seems that their owners now have to seriously think of how to repurpose their buildings for other uses under the emerging “new normal.” These alternative uses include warehouses for online retail businesses, which the mall moguls themselves see the inevitability of moving into.  An important implication of the shift from store-based to online-based retail is the likely diminished role women will have in this sector of the economy. While women clearly dominate the existing sales staff of department stores, malls, and even supermarkets, we are now seeing the prominence of logistics and delivery firms providing the “last mile” link to the end-consumers. And here, it is men who almost entirely make up this last mile link. I’ve seen many women driving motorcycles, but I have yet to see a female rider delivering our Shopee or Lazada purchases, and while I’m sure there are women riders out there doing it, they appear to be an exceptional and tiny minority. Given the dominant contribution of retail trade to the total employment of Filipinos, this “defeminization” of retail is one issue that we must be prepared to address.  cielito.habito@gmail.com For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

For the DOF, the digital services tax regime should be “able to collect VAT,” Dominguez added. Dominguez noted that these digital and online marketplaces still have tax leakages resulting in revenue losses for the government.  “It’s really enforcing the VAT to be fair to everyone, whether buying online or buying from the shelf,” acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua, for his part, told the Inquirer. House ways and means committee chair and Albay Rep. Joey Salceda told the Inquirer last Monday (May 18) that among online sellers, only about half, usually large taxpayers and registered enterprises, had been fully compliant with their VAT payments.  As such, Salceda had suggested tapping online sales platforms such as the Alibaba Group’s Lazada, Amazon, and Shopee, among others, to also serve as their suppliers’ withholding tax agents. Salceda had also proposed slapping new taxes on subscriptions to video and music streaming apps such as Netflix and Spotify, as well as advertisements on social media sites such as Facebook and tech giant Google. According to reports, Indonesia will impose a 10-percent VAT on foreign-owned digital services as it, like the Philippines, experienced a surge in online demand amid the COVID-19 lockdown but also struggled with tax collections due to pandemic-induced economic recession.

My weekend flights from pandemic house arrest will henceforth be entirely northward. I decided to prioritize securing the Easytrip RFID because I have always felt more at ease navigating the stretches of the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) and the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx). I had previously lined up to get the Autosweep sticker for SLEx. But, on the day I tried, when it was my turn, I found out that I couldn’t be served without an appointment booked online. Back in my car, I immediately went online to make an appointment only to learn that all slots for the weeks ahead had been taken, and that I must check again later. I just gave up.  In comparison, getting the Easytrip RFID tag for NLEx was bearable, which is not to say it was more efficient. Weeks before the old EC tags were to be decommissioned, I dutifully visited the NLEx customer service center in San Fernando, Pampanga, to have mine replaced with new RFID stickers and to have the unspent load in them transferred. To my dismay, I wasn’t even allowed to enter, because while I had a face mask on I didn’t have a face shield. I didn’t insist, thinking this might be a sign I was being spared from a possible coronavirus infection. A sympathetic guard offered to give me the forms to fill out and to return another day. In the meantime, I heard that RFID stickers were actually being sold online. Indeed, Shopee carried them. What a find, I told myself. But, to my disappointment, the seller of Easytrip RFIDs had practically closed shop, with a cryptic note: out of stock. Generic “RFID” stickers were being sold cheap in batches of five by other sellers. I was certain these would not work at the toll booths, but I could imagine that others might try sticking these on their vehicles.  One ordinary weekday, I made an early trip going north on my big bike and chanced upon a very short queue for RFID stickers at a gas station. Incredulous, I immediately joined the line, and, after a brief wait, I got my sticker in less than 5 minutes. Buoyed by this success, I convinced my daughter Kara and her husband LM to try the RFID booth at the Petron gas station in Marilao, where they were greeted by a long snaking line. They decided to proceed to the San Fernando customer service center, bringing with them three extra forms for one more bike and two other vehicles, with their corresponding OR/CRs. That attempt yielded no positive result. They were told that multiple RFID applications were no longer accepted unless the vehicles were actually there. The NLEx staff now insist on sticking the RFID strip themselves and testing it on site. On seeing Kara’s SUV, they told her that the available RFID stickers did not work on some car models because of metal surface interference, and that, unfortunately, her KIA Sportage was one of them.  Yet, on a chance visit to an RFID installing booth in a gas station, the staff saw no problem installing the Easytrip tag on the same vehicle. As though someone had worked a miracle on the car, the sticker could be detected and read without a problem. It became clear to me that the switch to the RFID cashless payment system mandated by the Department of Transportation for the two tollway operators—San Miguel Corp. and Metro Pacific Tollways Corp.—had not been thoroughly thought out. The system bore the marks of ceaseless improvisation, despite the fact that RFID tags had been in use by both companies for many years now. It was evident that neither company had taken the trouble to learn from the old system, or to test and evaluate the new one before rolling it out for compulsory implementation. They also appear not in any hurry to integrate their respective RFID systems into one. The long confusing lines at the Bocaue toll booths on the Manila-bound side of the NLEx I encountered last Wednesday abundantly demonstrated to me what was happening. All the available RFID lanes were open, yet the traffic was barely moving. Ahead, I noticed that the bar would lift up for one or two vehicles, and then it would stay in place again for some minutes. This was happening in all the other lanes. Ironically, the faster lanes were the few “emergency” cash lanes that were still open. Clearly, the RFID antennas weren’t consistently picking up or reading the signal from the RFID stickers. There are any number of possible reasons for this. One, some RFID stickers are not valid Easytrip stickers. Two, they may be valid stickers, but their being attached to a vehicle’s metal elements found on some headlights and the tint on windshields effectively “detunes” them. Three, the RFID strips themselves or the detection devices are of such poor quality or type that their transmission range is very limited. Or, four, the UHF or microwave signal in some zones is weak or uneven. Whatever the cause may be, the logjam of vehicles at the expressway toll booths is symptomatic of a pervasive culture of thoughtless disregard for the welfare of ordinary citizens. We Filipinos have learned not to expect much from government, and have turned increasingly to private entities for the things we need even if we have to pay extra for these services.  But, now, some private companies are starting to act more and more like the public corporations they have replaced. Secure in their monopolistic grip on businesses like tollways, they often manifest the same indifference to the troubles and inconvenience that their incompetence inflicts on the general public. public.lives@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/300293/fwd-dti-businesses-selling-intermittently-irregular-basis-not-required-to-register","title":"DTI: Sellers operating on ‘irregular’ basis not required to register","date":"11:25 AM June 19, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Sellers that are operating “intermittently or irregularly” as well as those selling homemade items as a hobby are not required to register, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said Friday.DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez made the remark after the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) urged online sellers to register their business activities and settle their taxes not later than July 31.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Sellers that are operating “intermittently or irregularly” as well as those selling homemade items as a hobby are not required to register, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said Friday.DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez made the remark after the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) urged online sellers to register their business activities and settle their taxes not later than July 31. “At any rate, the rule basically applies to those in business regularly selling even if such activity is small in size, it must be registered. Anyway, the annual income below P250,000 is exempted from the income tax according to the BIR ruling,” Lopez said during the online hearing of the House committee on ways and means.  “If one is just selling intermittently or on an irregular basis or selling homemade stuff as a hobby, it is understood they are not yet in business thus they are not required to register,” he added. The trade secretary however did not elaborate on the definition of an “irregular basis.”  Lopez, however, underscored the importance of registering businesses with the government, saying that it is key to consumer protection. “There is greater traceability if online sellers are registered and this increases the trust factor and confidence of online buyers in making the transaction online,” Lopez said.  “This addresses definitely the element of trust which is crucial if we are to grow the e-commerce industry in the country,” he added. Lopez likewise believes that registration of online businesses is good for the e-commerce industry if the country wants the sector to grow. He also noted that business registration will be beneficial for businesses in the future once their enterprise grows. “We believe that eventually, these unregistered businesses will register as they grow in size sooner or later, they would have to borrow from formal lending institutions that will require registered audited financial statements or if they get to serve larger establishments, official receipts for their sales will be required, thus they would have to be registered,” Lopez said. “DTI reiterates that business registration has always been the right way of doing business. It is needed in growing a business. It can also increase buyers’ confidence,” the trade secretary added.  Under BIR’s Memorandum Circular 60-2020, “all persons doing business and earning income in any manner or form, specifically those who are into digital transactions through the use of any electronic platforms and media, and other digital means” are reminded “to ensure that their businesses are registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 236 of the Tax Code, as amended, and that they are tax compliant.” Later, BIR clarified that the said memorandum was not targeted towards small-time online sellers, noting that it was not collecting income taxes from those who earn P250,000 or less a year."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/307730/the-new-normal-in-philippine-retail","title":"The new normal in Philippine retail","date":"04:06 AM September 19, 2020","snippet":"Colliers believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown are likely to redefine shopping experience in Metro Manila.","body":"Colliers believes that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown are likely to redefine shopping experience in Metro Manila. Even if the government fully relaxes the lockdown imposed throughout Metro Manila, subsequent personal distancing protocols likely to be implemented will reduce consumer traffic. This, in turn, is likely to result in a slower absorption of retail space all over Metro Manila.  Colliers projects vacancy rising to 12 percent in 2020 from 9.8 percent in 2019. In our opinion, the reduced mobility, observance of physical distancing and aversion towards the use of physical currency present opportunities for mall operators and retailers as these are likely to form part of the new normal in Philippine retail. For a consumption-driven economy like the Philippines, we are optimistic that mall operators and retailers may still tap pent-up demand. Stakeholders in the retail sector should be proactive especially with the projected rebound in economic output, recovery in overseas Filipino workers’ (OFW) remittances, and the potential impact of social amelioration programs on consumer demand.  By expanding online strategies and partnering with apps to facilitate seamless delivery, retailers should be able to offset any softer retail demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of a Colliers Philippines survey, women have a higher daily internet usage than men. Close to 60 percent of the female respondents spend seven hours or more online while only 45 percent of males allot the same amount of time. Respondents of the survey would usually allot around 3 to 3.5 hours daily on online shopping.  The survey also showed that the daily internet usage and time spent on online shopping increases with age. Those 51 years old and older spent more than 10 hours a day online, with online shopping reaching as much as half that. Younger respondents (21 to 30 years old) spent on average three to six hours a day online with two hours of that on online shopping alone. This supports one of our recommendations that retailers should increasingly target older shoppers and senior citizens. There should be a seamless online shopping experience, from adding items to cart to checking out using credit cards. Close to 80 percent of respondents encountered advertisements for products and goods online via social media. Retailers could take advantage of this by further strengthening their social media presence to expand the reach of their products. Based on the results of our survey, among the most popular e-commerce platforms include Lazada, Shopee, Instagram, retailers’ online stores, Zalora, Facebook Marketplace, and Amazon. Colliers believes that mall operators and retailers should strengthen their online presence by either utilizing existing e-commerce websites of their mall operators or setting up their own platforms to market their products.  But while we see opportunities amid the uncertainties, the central bank-forecasted drop in economic output in 2020 is likely to drag down consumer confidence which may impact retail space absorption in Metro Manila. This is likely to be compounded by the $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion (P153 billion to P306 billion) drop in OFW remittances and rise in unemployment projected by various government agencies and officials. Remittances, for instance, fuel private consumption, which cover about 10 percent of the country’s economy. There are several economic indicators that already point to some recovery. OFW remittances rose in June 2020, a reversal from three straight months of decline. Meanwhile, unemployment rate is starting to ease from a record-high 17.7 percent in April. These factors should help restore Filipino consumers’ purchasing power and benefit retailers and mall operators. The social distancing measures have been compelling consumers to rely heavily on deliveries. Mall operators and retailers should consider firming up partnerships with delivery companies that have modern warehouses and efficient logistics systems to maximize their shift from brick-and-mortar to online selling. The Colliers survey noted that more than half of the respondents that chose online shopping preferred e-commerce due to convenience. The survey conducted by Colliers Philippines shows tremendous opportunities for retailers that are agile enough to pivot to the “new normal” in Metro Manila retail. The lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 has forced malls to close, with only the stores supplying essential items such as groceries, medicines, and food for delivery open during stricter lockdowns. Colliers believes that social distancing is likely be part of the new normal even if the lockdown is further eased. Hence, a significant number of physical retail shops are likely to remain closed for additional time. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, brick-and-mortar retailers are trying to tap the demand by expanding their online presence. We recommend that retailers, especially higher-end brands, be more innovative to stay at the top of consumers’ minds. This may be in the form of home deliveries or personal shoppers. Selected retailers and operators have started tapping alternative platforms to reach out to customers during the quarantine period. Several mall operators have launched their respective Viber communities. Ayala and SM have also launched their personal shopping services. Mall operators should continue highlighting sanitation and property management procedures within their establishments. Developers should also line up marketing efforts to recapture pent up demand once the pandemic wanes and consumer confidence recovers. At Colliers, we always recommend that developers highlight projects that are within integrated communities. In our opinion, the pandemic has further emphasized the need to be in an integrated community where unit owners can easily access essential goods and services. Developers have been responding to this need by highlighting the presence of groceries and supermarkets that offer a wide array of merchandise, from F&B to basic house supplies to medicines. We already see this in the market, with brands such as MerryMart offering an expansive line of merchandise. We encourage developers and retailers to continue highlighting the integrated features of their residential projects, including the presence of groceries and hypermarkets within the community, as this is likely to be among the major considerations of unit owners post-lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic."},{"url":"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/333109/awra-briguela-apologizes-clarifies-sick-remark-in-blackpink-event","title":"Awra Briguela apologizes, clarifies ‘sick’ remark in BLACKPINK event","date":"10:38 AM June 10, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines – Teen comedian Awra Briguela apologized to BLACKPINK fans after receiving flak for supposedly poking fun at Jennie, one of the group’s members,  during their recent Manila visit.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Teen comedian Awra Briguela apologized to BLACKPINK fans after receiving flak for supposedly poking fun at Jennie, one of the group’s members,  during their recent Manila visit.   Briguela took to Instagram over the weekend to clarify that some fans may have misinterpreted what he said because of his lack of English language proficiency.   “Hindi ko intensyon na i-disrespect si Jennie kasi alam ko ‘yung pakiramdam nang i-direspect. Aware po ako/kami na may sakit siya kaya bakit naman po kami magbibiro about sa sakit niya,” he explained. “Nung time na ‘yun, nalito din ako sa pagkakaiba ng ‘sick’ na may sakit at ‘sick’ na parang astig. Tumawa kami dahil sa pag – English kong mali-mali, hindi dahil sa sakit ni Jennie,” he added.  Briguela, alongside dancer AC Bonifacio and GirlTrends member Riva Quenery, were criticized for supposedly laughing at the BLACKPINK member who was not feeling well during a meeting with fans.  The three went live via Instagram and answered questions from fans. One netizen asked about the event and Briguela said the meet and greet was “sick.” Quenery then chimed in and said “sick like Jennie,” which drew laughter from Briguela and Bonifacio. “Alam kong nagkamali ako at alam kong tatanga tanga din ako pero alam kong hindi sapat ‘yung pagkakamaling nagawa ko para sabihan niyo akong masama o pangarapin niyo na sana nawala na lang ako sa mundong ito,” Briguela said.  “Sana mapatawad niyo ako at sana kalimutan na nating ang mga nangyari. Alam kong ang sakit na may galit sa puso kaya sana tanggalin na natin ‘yan galit na ‘yan. Uulitin ko sorry ulit sa inyong lahat. God bless,” he added. Meanwhile, BLACKPINK’s meet and greet event was met with controversy after fans claimed they were scammed by  online shopping platform Shopee. Shopee has since apologized, but the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said it was already conducting an investigation. (Editor: Gilbert S.

In a statement, Bagong Henerasyon Rep. Bernadette Herrera-Dy said should the measure become law, VAT will be passed to consumers in the form of higher prices.  This, for Herrera-Dy, is “totally unacceptable at this time of economic uncertainty” brought by the coronavirus pandemic. She added that small-time businesses that operate on e-commerce sites such as Lazada and Shopee will also be affected.  “Many of our kababayans have lost their jobs due to the pandemic had to resort to selling products and services online just to make ends meet,” she said. However, she said she “fully supports” the proposed VAT to be imposed on subscriptions to Netflix, as well as other video and music streaming sites, which, according to Herrera-Dy, is “a market currently worth about P5 billion.”  This comes after the House committee on ways and means approved a bill which will impose additional taxes on streaming services and e-commerce sites. But small businesses, including those engaged in online selling whose sales are below P3 million, will continue to be VAT exempt, according to House panel chairman, Albay 2nd District Rep.

In a statement, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) advised the public that “it has not issued brilliant uncirculated 20-Piso coins” that were being peddled on digital shopping portals like Lazada and Shopee.  “The BSP reminds the public to beware of online sellers advertising brilliant uncirculated 20-Piso coins for sale,” the regulator said. “Brilliant uncirculated” is a term used by collectors to refer to coins that have never been circulated and, thus, retain their original mint luster, which makes these items command high prices among numismatic enthusiasts.  According to the BSP, the current 20-Piso New Generation Currency coins had been released to the public since December 2019. As of end-August 2020, 2.09 million pieces of the 20-Piso coins, worth P41.85 million, are in circulation.  “These 20-Piso new generation currency coins are legal tender and may be used as payment for goods and services at face value,” the central bank said. A cursory search of the Lazada e-commerce site showed that one seller was offering these mint grade P20 coins for P100 each. Several sellers were offering BSP-issued coins — many of them housed in their original packaging which are distributed by the central bank as commemorative tokens — of various vintages at varying prices. Lazada has since taken down the page for the P20 coin, with the online retailer telling ABS-CBN News in a statement that its team “does a daily manual sweep of product listings that violate existing policies and are removed when identified.” “We will continue to take strong action against sellers found breaching our platform’s terms and conditions,” Lazada said. Online retailer Shopee offers a similar line of BSP-issued coins for sale, including the P20 coin cited by the central bank which retails for P159 per piece on the shopping platform. The product page is still active as of this writing."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/105452/get-all-day-comfort-and-productivity-with-the-logitech-m190-full-size-wireless-mouse","title":"Get all-day comfort and productivity with the Logitech M190 Full-Size wireless mouse","date":"01:02 PM November 09, 2020","snippet":"Logitech, a world leader in mice and keyboards, introduces its M190 Wireless Mouse, which features a contoured shape designed to follow the natural curve of the hand.

Atty. Ferdinand Topacio commented on Locsin’s weight in a tweet last July 20, which was met with criticism from Twitter users, as well as talent manager Ogie Diaz and recently, Monsanto.  Monsanto, who starred with Locsin in ABS-CBN’s “Lobo” in 2008, took a jab at the lawyer yesterday, July 26 in a Facebook post. Sharing a photo of his statement, she said, “Mura lang po salamin sa Shopee, at free delivery pa. Bili na rin po kayo ng leeg at bra.”  “Mamaya na po sana tayo mangutya ng ganyan kung 6 footer na tayo at may 6-pack abs. Mmmkay.” (A mirror in Shopee is cheap and there’s free delivery too. Buy a neck and a bra too. Let’s keep that mocking for later when we are already 6-footers and have six-pack abs. Okay.)   She added in the comments section, “Sorry guys, di dapat tayo nangbo-body shame, pero sobrang nakakagalit ‘tong mga kuda niya.” (Sorry guys, we should not body shame, but his comments are so infuriating.)  “Ang bait ni Angel. Sobra. (Angel is so kind. Very much so.) She doesn’t deserve to be spoken of the way this creature did. #ProtectAngelLocsin” Diaz, meanwhile, wondered if Topacio’s “misconduct” was acceptable to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and urged the organization of lawyers to castigate him.

Shopback, the leading rewards and discovery platform in Asia-Pacific, expects P11.2 billion in transactions this year, which will also mark its highest since the app launched in the Philippines in 2015.  The success of the app reflects how the e-commerce market grew in the hardest of times, as brick and mortar establishments close in the middle of the pandemic. ShopBack partnered with e-commerce merchants and platforms like Shopee and Lazada. Demand already spiked in the first half of the year, as COVID-19 forced those who can afford to stay at home to just order almost anything online instead.  It saw 9.1 million orders in the first half of the year, an increase of more than 330 percent from the 2.1 million orders in the same period in 2019. This volume puts the Philippines in either the top 3 or 4 spot in the market, according to Shopback, which is present in eight other countries—Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, and South Korea.  In terms of value, these transactions are worth P5.6 billion, also an increase of more than 330 percent from the P1.3 billion worth of transactions in 2019. At a press briefing celebrating the company’s 5th anniversary in the Philippines, Shopback country manager Prashant Kala said he expected both volume and transaction to double at the end of the year. He said he hoped the pandemic “ends as soon as possible but this (e-commerce) trend is just going to go up.” Kala said there are two main reasons for the spike in e-commerce amid the spike in coronavirus infections. “One is convenience and second is the ease of finding more and more products that are there online,” he said.  The price of a product online is the same for users of Shopback, according to the company. It is unlike marketing strategy that marks up prices then offers discounts. On average, the app offers a 6 to 10 percent cash back across a wide range of item categories like food, groceries and general merchandise, Shopback said. Next month, the company said it will launch a feature that will allow users to compare the prices of over 10,000 products, choosing the best possible store with the largest cash back possible. It currently has at least 4 million users here in the Philippines. Along with its other markets, Shopback has a total of more than 20 million users. By the tailend of the year, Shopback expects to give at least P12 million to P13 million in cash back per month, which is more than twice the monthly cash back in the same period last year."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1193107/fda-online-drug-sales-hinder-drive-vs-counterfeit-meds","title":"FDA: Online drug sales hinder drive vs counterfeit meds","date":"05:00 AM November 22, 2019","snippet":"The booming industry of online sales,  particularly of medicines, is making it difficult for the government to combat the prevalence of counterfeit drugs, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said.","body":"The booming industry of online sales,  particularly of medicines, is making it difficult for the government to combat the prevalence of counterfeit drugs, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official said. “That’s one of the biggest challenges for us, the online sale of pharmaceuticals,” said FDA officer in charge  director general Enrique Domingo, adding that selling drugs online is illegal in the country.  Counterfeit drugs or medicines may have the correct ingredients but not in the correct amount or formulation.  They may also be composed of wrong ingredients, lack active ingredients or has low-quality ingredients.

The official said it was difficult to check the authenticity of medicines as well as personal care products being sold online by unlicensed sellers who are “ordinary individuals” with “no licenses to operate or sell pharmaceutical products.”  The FDA earlier issued a cease and desist order to online shopping companies Shopee Philippines and Lazada Philippines for selling drug products with no appropriate licenses to operate from the agency."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/107762/fall-in-love-with-the-vivo-y31-and-the-limited-edition-valentines-day-gifts-for-every-purchase","title":"Fall in love with the vivo Y31 and the limited-edition Valentine’s Day gifts for every purchase","date":"03:05 PM February 11, 2021","snippet":"Get a clearer shot at love and in capturing special memories this season of hearts with vivo’s Valentine’s-exclusive promo.

The IPOPHL said in a statement that it had proposed to revise the rules and regulations in the exercise of its enforcement functions and visitorial power. The agency is still gathering comments from stakeholders.  As they are now, the rules do not explicitly cover intellectual property rights-infringing activities that are conducted online. According to the IPOPHL, these rules had neither been amended nor even revisited since its approval and implementation in 2013. The latest proposed amendments were pushed by IPOPHL’s Enforcement Office (IEO) in an effort to give teeth when it comes to e-commerce.  Under the proposed new definition of IEO’s enforcement power, it would be able to enforce its mandate against the sale, streaming and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods online, among other activities. IEO Director Ann Edillon said this would allow the IEO to take down posts that sell counterfeit or pirated products through a warning notice and compliance order directed to the platform. To do this, an administrative complaint needs to be filed by the affected IP rights holder first.  When asked for further clarification, the IPOPHL said that the proposed rules did not discuss any liability that an online platform like Shopee and Lazada, for example, might have in case a merchant is caught selling counterfeit goods. “The way to go about it would depend on facts before the IEO. We may order the immediate blocking of a seller but we will not necessarily do that all the time. However, we will definitely always call the platform to immediately exercise its IP policy aside from possibly directing it to remove an infringing post,” Edillon said. “Where there is violation of, or resistance to, an IEO order issued in relation to an administrative complaint, IEO can file a case before the pertinent local government unit or the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) for the cancellation of the violating seller’s business permit. “ she added. Moreover, the proposed amendments also expanded the definition of an enforcement order to include the “permanent take down, blocking and removal of the infringing online sites or accounts.” IEO would also be able to issue a cease-and-desist directive and an order to remove the counterfeit and pirated good either from the online or physical establishment. If approved, the IPOPHL would able to issue orders that the National Telecommunications Commission would have to follow. At present, the NTC usually has to wait for an order to be issued by the court.

Through its cash back feature, Shopback provides consumers with more control over their reward usage with rebates transferable directly to their bank account compared with other incentive programs. Faced with an unfortunate reality due to the ongoing pandemic, Filipinos find themselves more dependent on online shopping, and looking for more ways to get the best value for each peso they spend. The first half of 2020 has seen a 376% increase in Shopback transactions compared to the same time last year. This growth is mainly driven by the surge of customer spending on essential items, food and grocery deliveries, which was brought about by the shift in consumer behavior amidst the global health crisis.   As the demand for daily essential items continues, Shopback, with its five years of service in the Philippines, commits to provide newcomers and loyal users with the expansion of partner merchants and even higher cashbacks with Shopback Top Picks like P&G, Nestle, Lactum, Sustagen, and Unilever. “We understand that the fight against this unprecedented pandemic is not yet over,” shares Prashant Kala, Country Manager of Shopback Philippines. “To help ease the community’s woes as we transition to a new normal, we have partnered with many well-loved local brands like Watsons, GrabFood, and Booky as well as established international merchants like Walmart, Love Bonito, Cult beauty, etc, so users don’t miss out on the best deals around the globe,” he adds. In addition to daily essentials, Shopback is also constantly working with partners like Canva, Linkedin, many VPN Services like NordVPN and antivirus programs to offer up to 50% cashback for those settling into work from home set-up. By September 1st, users can compare the prices of over 10,000 products on ShopBack and choose the best store available online for it. You simply have to search the product name and Shopback will give you all available store options and you can take your pick. With this function, users are able to decide where they want to shop at and which store gives the highest cashback.
