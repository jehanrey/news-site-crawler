One of things that I’m grateful for in the “new normal” is the convenience of deliveries.  For instance, Raffles offered an entire “fine dining” package so that you can enjoy at 4-course 5-star at home, from the appetizers to the petit fours in the end. Dusit Thani Manila had packages with tableware that you can keep. Chef Jessie Rockwell (as well as Chef Jessie’s Place) offers a customized fine dining menu. Never did I imagine that we would be able to have fine dining “delivered” to your home. Or ramen DIY kits. Or vegetables from Baguio and Baguio Country Club raisin bread through CLOY (Cordillera Landing On You-call 0917-8675188) delivered to your doorstep. Just the sheer amount of choices that can be brought to your doorstep nowadays is unbelievable.  There has been so much demand for delivery that the Philippines is now the first and only Asia-Pacific country to have Food Panda, a food delivery service, available in 100 local markets (your neighborhood/city). This benefits not only people who order but also small businesses who can avail themselves of the service although limited to their area. There are now also so many choices for delivery. I recently had to get chicharon from Bulacan and was so happy that aside from Grab and Lalamove there is now also Angkas, Transportify and Mr. Speedy.  Online delis are now also very popular. Last year, I discovered a site called Timplado (timplado.ph) that sells all kinds of local delicacies such as longganisa from all over the Philippines. The delivery services have also expanded from food to … practically everything! A new app called Pick.A.Roo has categories from groceries to party platters to booze to toys to hardware and kitchen appliances. Food Panda has a new service as well called Shops. And we also have to thank the riders. While they are probably just happy to have a job, you can’t dismiss the fact that there are some challenges that come with the territory. I asked Food Panda what they do to help their riders. First of all, they are somehow exposed to possibly coronavirus carriers every time they go to a restaurant or shop to get your food or other orders. You never know who might be asymptomatic out there. At the same time, they need to be careful to ensure that the customers are also safe. Food Panda addresses this by imposing proper handling guidelines for their riders, as well as requiring their riders to wash their hands every two hours and after each time they handle delivery.  Then there is the challenge of deliveries when it is raining. I asked Food Panda how they help their riders in this situation and they said they provide their riders with weather gear. Then there are cases of canceled orders, that reportedly would sometimes have to be covered by the rider himself. Food Panda addresses this by covering the expenses for canceled orders. Indeed, delivery services have kept the economy running while we were at a COVID standstill. A lot of home bakers and entrepreneurs would not have survived without these delivery services. Plus, delivery services have made staying home not only tolerable but at times even pleasurable. This is one “new normal” service that is proof that it can still be more fun in the Philippines even amid a pandemic."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1324687/24-7-food-delivery-allowed-in-metro-manila","title":"24/7 food delivery service allowed in Metro Manila","date":"01:19 PM August 20, 2020","snippet":"For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.","body":"For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Peñalosa, who won the Mansmith Young Market Masters Awards in 2017, shares here his thoughts on the challenges and trends in food delivery.  Q: How big is the food delivery market in the Philippines? When do you think or expect delivery to exceed actual restaurant visit? A: While exact numbers are hard to come by, it is very evident that the food delivery business is likely the main source of sales growth for retail food establishments.  Based on an online research study by Statista, the online food delivery market in our country is worth around P11 billion with almost eight million Filipinos using the service at least once in 2018. Given that digital delivery (orders placed via the web or mobile app) represents around 25 percent of the total pie, we are looking at a P44-billion industry that is growing by more than 20 percent annually, driven by online deliveries. Although dine-in foot traffic is challenged right now and the National Restaurant Association even projects that 70 percent of customers will be ordering food off restaurant premises (gen z and millennials are much more likely to use off-premise meal solutions) by 2020, I still believe that a good majority of customers would still make the effort to visit actual restaurant locations since everyone wants to enjoy that indulging dine-in experience once in a while but they would frequently opt for delivery since it provides more convenience.  Q: Is there any difference in the ordering method/s of different customer groups? A: There are two basic ways to order: voice (by calling and speaking to a call center representative) and online (order thru digital channels like website, mobile app, chatbot etc.). The tech-savvy millennials and gen z users are more inclined to take the digital route while the baby boomers and older generations prefer to talk to a live person at the other end of the line. While this seems to be a stereotyped generalization on user age groups, sometimes it boils down to the need of the user and nature of the transaction. A millennial might be more comfortable to call when she wants to relay special instructions like customizing the toppings on her pizza order or inquiring about a particular product or promo before ordering. The key is to have both ordering channels in place so that customers can seamlessly relay their delivery orders. Q: You had to experience being a call center agent and food delivery rider before finalizing the setup of Max’s food delivery. Any insights you can share with us about call center agents and food delivery riders after that experience? A: Yes! I definitely learned the ropes. I became a call center agent and then tried my best to keep my balance while driving an actual delivery motorbike.  It was a humbling experience for me that allowed me to understand the true nature of the industry. The food delivery business (or any other business for this matter) is all about your people: the agent who tirelessly goes on 24/7 shifting schedules, the kitchen personnel who cooks our Max’s sarap-to-the-bones fried chicken or bakes our New York’s finest Yellow Cab pizza, the delivery rider who traverses metro traffic rain or shine, the programmers that maintain our e-commerce system and countless other unheralded team members who ensure that each and every customer’s order is processed properly and delivered on time. The employees are the heart and soul of the business. More than our marketing tactics and technological innovations, our people who interact and play a key role in engaging with our customers are our main strategic advantage. Every day, I try my best to make them feel that they are important and that, yes, they do matter. At least that’s what I know Max’s Group is all about … we are family and we are all about our people. Q: What’s the business case of creating a fleet of in-house dedicated delivery riders versus thousands of outsourced delivery riders (Grab, etc.) readily available? A: Two words: operational control. You have full control over their area assignments and shift duty schedules most especially during peak operations. You control the branding through the uniforms they wear. You control the service journey platform that will guide them how to interact with your customers. But honestly, I recommend using them both: a healthy mix of dedicated and outsourced riders will ensure that there will be enough logistics personnel to process the volume of delivery orders. Q: What are keys to delivering speed while being cost-efficient in the delivery operations at the same time? A: Command center. Food production. Delivery logistics. The contact center team is like an air traffic control tower that directs and manages hundreds of delivery orders per hour so that all transactions are accounted for and attended to. The next key factor is the speed of production of the restaurant because they are the ones who actually cook and dispatch the packaged food items. Finally, you need to have an efficient and committed team of drivers who will do whatever it takes to deliver the orders on time. The right forecasting balance of manpower personnel to support the influx of orders is vital in ensuring cost-efficient operations. Q: What are major challenges in food delivery? A: If anything goes wrong with any of the three key factors I mentioned above, then operational efficiency is affected. Of course the weather plays a major role, too since the volume of deliveries significantly surges during inclement weather conditions. Dine-in patrons will be converted to delivery customers (because they will decide not to visit the restaurant if it is raining too hard or if it is too hot outside) and this poses a forecasting nightmare in terms of agent and rider manpower staffing and/or product inventory stock outs if you don’t have a contingency plan in place. Customers always want to have their food delivered faster, fresher and cheaper so you need to innovate and keep on experimenting with new ways of cooking and transporting orders. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Q: Can you share some trends in food delivery? A: Food delivery is here to stay and restaurant brands will need to offer this service if they want to be competitive. Over the years, we have seen the rise of “third party food delivery aggregators” that consolidate different restaurants into their digital platform so it is so much easier now for a food establishment to offer delivery just by partnering with these startup companies. We also expect more delivery orders being placed online through websites, mobile apps and other digital platforms as more and more digital native customers expect to satisfy their food cravings anytime, anywhere."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1366344/food-delivery-customers-generosity-moves-netizens","title":"Food delivery customer’s generosity moves netizens","date":"11:55 AM November 30, 2020","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines —  Good Samaritans come in many forms; but sometimes, they don’t show themselves and just ask food delivery riders to do the good deeds for them.  Such was the case of a food delivery customer who booked a rider last November 23. It was just another busy day for Mark Berdan when he accepted a booking from this extraordinary customer. Little did he know that he was about to be moved by the unusual yet heartwarming request of the customer.  As was usual, after accepting the transaction he went to fetch the order — 35 pieces of burger from a fast-food chain in Montillano street, Alabang.   Following the delivery protocol, Berdan messaged and informed the customer that was on his way to drop off the order. However, he was suddenly told not to go to the customer’s address. “[K]uya hindi mo na kailangan pumunta [dito]. [Y]ung 30 [pieces] ng burger pamigay mo along the way dyan sa mga nasa kalsada na nagugutom,” the customer replied to Berdan. (There is no need to go here. Distribute the 30 pieces of burger to starving people that you will see along the way.)  The customer also told Berdan to take home five burgers for his family. Baffled by the customer’s demand, Berdan was at first skeptical and asked if it was just a joke. He even insisted on delivering the goods to the customer. But the customer insisted, saying: “Hindi [ito joke], kuya, ginagawa ko yan lagi.” (No, this is not a joke, I’ve been doing this for quite some time now.) Berdan decided to give away the burgers to street dwellers and the homeless. He initially sent pictures of himself giving away the burgers to the customer, but he was told that there was no need for him to “show proof.” Berdan instead turned to Facebook to thank the unknown benefactor. His post became viral, gaining close to 10,000 reactions, as of posting time, and had been shared almost 9,000 times, with netizens praising both the customer and Berdan for their kind gesture. “Masaya po at nagulat ako sa sinabi po nya na ipamigay daw po sa mga taong nagugutom sa kalsada na madadaanan ko po kasi expect ko po didiliver po sa kanya ma’am,” Berdan told Inquirer.net over the weekend. (I was happy and shocked when the customer told me to give the food to starving people in the street. I was expecting to deliver those to the customer.) He thanked his customer once again for helping the people in need. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Masasabi ko lang po sa customer maraming salamat po sa talaga at sana po marami pa po syang matulungan maliit man para sa kanya malaking tulong naman para sa natulungan nya  god bless po,” he said. (The only thing I want to say to my customer is: thank you and I hope he/she can help more people in the future. This might be a small act for the customer but it is a huge thing for the people who received his/her help.)"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1413485/lugaw-other-food-items-essential-delivery-must-be-unhampered","title":"Lugaw, other food items ‘essential’; delivery must be unhampered — Palace","date":"08:04 PM March 31, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Rice porridge or “lugaw” and or any food products are considered essential goods and their delivery should remain unhampered, Malacañang said Wednesday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Rice porridge or “lugaw” and or any food products are considered essential goods and their delivery should remain unhampered, Malacañang said Wednesday.

Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera, who authored the proposed Magna Carta of E-Commerce Delivery Personnel, said “there may be more to this than meets the eye” in the recent cases of fake bookings victimizing delivery riders.  One of the recent cases involves a student who was surprised to see several delivery riders at his Quezon City home after P15,000-worth of food items were supposedly ordered under his name. But the student said he did not order the food items.  In many cases, such instances would result in delivery riders paying for the cost of the items. “This most recent incident of fake deliveries is intriguing because the residents of a particular address may have been specifically targeted or randomly targeted,” Herrera said in a statement.  “There may be more to this than meets the eye, which is why we are asking the NBI to investigate,” she added. Herrera appealed to food delivery services to cooperate with the NBI and the other authorities concerned. “They should turn over to the investigators all the directly relevant data on online fraud committed using their online systems or mobile apps,” Herrera said. “Please help the probers build solid cases so when the criminal trial ensues, those found guilty will go to jail.

The food delivery business (or any other business for this matter) is all about your people: the agent who tirelessly goes on 24/7 shifting schedules, the kitchen personnel who cooks our Max’s sarap-to-the-bones fried chicken or bakes our New York’s finest Yellow Cab pizza, the delivery rider who traverses metro traffic rain or shine, the programmers that maintain our e-commerce system and countless other unheralded team members who ensure that each and every customer’s order is processed properly and delivered on time. The employees are the heart and soul of the business. More than our marketing tactics and technological innovations, our people who interact and play a key role in engaging with our customers are our main strategic advantage. Every day, I try my best to make them feel that they are important and that, yes, they do matter. At least that’s what I know Max’s Group is all about … we are family and we are all about our people. Q: What’s the business case of creating a fleet of in-house dedicated delivery riders versus thousands of outsourced delivery riders (Grab, etc.) readily available? A: Two words: operational control. You have full control over their area assignments and shift duty schedules most especially during peak operations. You control the branding through the uniforms they wear. You control the service journey platform that will guide them how to interact with your customers. But honestly, I recommend using them both: a healthy mix of dedicated and outsourced riders will ensure that there will be enough logistics personnel to process the volume of delivery orders. Q: What are keys to delivering speed while being cost-efficient in the delivery operations at the same time? A: Command center. Food production. Delivery logistics. The contact center team is like an air traffic control tower that directs and manages hundreds of delivery orders per hour so that all transactions are accounted for and attended to. The next key factor is the speed of production of the restaurant because they are the ones who actually cook and dispatch the packaged food items. Finally, you need to have an efficient and committed team of drivers who will do whatever it takes to deliver the orders on time. The right forecasting balance of manpower personnel to support the influx of orders is vital in ensuring cost-efficient operations. Q: What are major challenges in food delivery? A: If anything goes wrong with any of the three key factors I mentioned above, then operational efficiency is affected. Of course the weather plays a major role, too since the volume of deliveries significantly surges during inclement weather conditions. Dine-in patrons will be converted to delivery customers (because they will decide not to visit the restaurant if it is raining too hard or if it is too hot outside) and this poses a forecasting nightmare in terms of agent and rider manpower staffing and/or product inventory stock outs if you don’t have a contingency plan in place. Customers always want to have their food delivered faster, fresher and cheaper so you need to innovate and keep on experimenting with new ways of cooking and transporting orders. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Q: Can you share some trends in food delivery? A: Food delivery is here to stay and restaurant brands will need to offer this service if they want to be competitive. Over the years, we have seen the rise of “third party food delivery aggregators” that consolidate different restaurants into their digital platform so it is so much easier now for a food establishment to offer delivery just by partnering with these startup companies. We also expect more delivery orders being placed online through websites, mobile apps and other digital platforms as more and more digital native customers expect to satisfy their food cravings anytime, anywhere."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1366344/food-delivery-customers-generosity-moves-netizens","title":"Food delivery customer’s generosity moves netizens","date":"11:55 AM November 30, 2020","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines —  Good Samaritans come in many forms; but sometimes, they don’t show themselves and just ask food delivery riders to do the good deeds for them.  Such was the case of a food delivery customer who booked a rider last November 23. It was just another busy day for Mark Berdan when he accepted a booking from this extraordinary customer. Little did he know that he was about to be moved by the unusual yet heartwarming request of the customer.  As was usual, after accepting the transaction he went to fetch the order — 35 pieces of burger from a fast-food chain in Montillano street, Alabang.   Following the delivery protocol, Berdan messaged and informed the customer that was on his way to drop off the order. However, he was suddenly told not to go to the customer’s address. “[K]uya hindi mo na kailangan pumunta [dito]. [Y]ung 30 [pieces] ng burger pamigay mo along the way dyan sa mga nasa kalsada na nagugutom,” the customer replied to Berdan. (There is no need to go here. Distribute the 30 pieces of burger to starving people that you will see along the way.)  The customer also told Berdan to take home five burgers for his family. Baffled by the customer’s demand, Berdan was at first skeptical and asked if it was just a joke. He even insisted on delivering the goods to the customer. But the customer insisted, saying: “Hindi [ito joke], kuya, ginagawa ko yan lagi.” (No, this is not a joke, I’ve been doing this for quite some time now.) Berdan decided to give away the burgers to street dwellers and the homeless. He initially sent pictures of himself giving away the burgers to the customer, but he was told that there was no need for him to “show proof.” Berdan instead turned to Facebook to thank the unknown benefactor. His post became viral, gaining close to 10,000 reactions, as of posting time, and had been shared almost 9,000 times, with netizens praising both the customer and Berdan for their kind gesture. “Masaya po at nagulat ako sa sinabi po nya na ipamigay daw po sa mga taong nagugutom sa kalsada na madadaanan ko po kasi expect ko po didiliver po sa kanya ma’am,” Berdan told Inquirer.net over the weekend. (I was happy and shocked when the customer told me to give the food to starving people in the street. I was expecting to deliver those to the customer.)

This might be a small act for the customer but it is a huge thing for the people who received his/her help.)"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1413485/lugaw-other-food-items-essential-delivery-must-be-unhampered","title":"Lugaw, other food items ‘essential’; delivery must be unhampered — Palace","date":"08:04 PM March 31, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Rice porridge or “lugaw” and or any food products are considered essential goods and their delivery should remain unhampered, Malacañang said Wednesday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Rice porridge or “lugaw” and or any food products are considered essential goods and their delivery should remain unhampered, Malacañang said Wednesday.

Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera, who authored the proposed Magna Carta of E-Commerce Delivery Personnel, said “there may be more to this than meets the eye” in the recent cases of fake bookings victimizing delivery riders.  One of the recent cases involves a student who was surprised to see several delivery riders at his Quezon City home after P15,000-worth of food items were supposedly ordered under his name. But the student said he did not order the food items.  In many cases, such instances would result in delivery riders paying for the cost of the items. “This most recent incident of fake deliveries is intriguing because the residents of a particular address may have been specifically targeted or randomly targeted,” Herrera said in a statement.  “There may be more to this than meets the eye, which is why we are asking the NBI to investigate,” she added. Herrera appealed to food delivery services to cooperate with the NBI and the other authorities concerned. “They should turn over to the investigators all the directly relevant data on online fraud committed using their online systems or mobile apps,” Herrera said. “Please help the probers build solid cases so when the criminal trial ensues, those found guilty will go to jail.

Manila Mayor Isko Moreno said on Wednesday that he had signed  Executive Order No. 35 to allow food companies with 24-hour operations to resume takeouts and deliveries.  “[This is the city government’s] own little way to protect jobs of Manilans and to help businesses operate and survive the COVID-19 pandemic,” Moreno said in a statement. “The City of Manila sees the need to slowly open the economy in the city, particularly in the food and restaurant industry and to balance this with the demand from the general public, which may serve as stimulus of economic growth,” he added.  Establishments in the food industry in Metro Manila were moving towards reviving their hampered operations due to the health crisis, allowing dine-in operations again when the government placed Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite, and Laguna under a modified enhanced community quarantine. This effectively dwindled operations again as not only did food chains stopped dine-in operations, but they also had to shorten operating hours.  With the transition of  those areas from an MECQ to a general community quarantine and with the latest executive order, Moreno believes that his order will help the city as the whole country grapples with new standards and regulations with the existence of the coronavirus. “For the meantime, we must learn how to live while there is COVID-19, and at the same time, we must learn to go back to work safely and to discipline ourselves, for us to help stimulate our economy,” Moreno said. “[All restaurants are] allowed to operate beyond the curfew hours of the city, provided that it shall cater only to those authorized persons outside of residence,” he added. However, he reminded establishments to adhere to the health protocols set by various national government agencies, to avoid more coronavirus transmissions. As of now, Manila has the second-highest number of coronavirus-infected patients, according to the Department of Health, which recorded 12,332 — although it also has one of the highest recovery rates at 63.8 percent.  “[All food establishments are] allowed to operate at 30 percent venue capacity, provided that it strictly adheres to minimum public health standards at all times as set by the government such as but not limited to social distancing protocols,” Moreno said. “Food establishments should be compliant with the protocols prescribed by Department of Tourism, or by the joint guidelines issued by the Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Labor and Employment, and Department of Health,” he added.

He chanced upon the driver while he and his family were ordering at the drive-thru at the same fast-food chain when he noticed that this driver was having a hard time disembarking from his bike. “I noticed a guy on motorbike parking and seemed to be taking time to go down from his bike. As he stood up, I realized that he was physically disabled with only one leg and saw that on the back of his bike was a Food Panda food delivery box,” he said. Ouano posted the photo yesterday, April 18 because he wanted to share with the world how this one PWD delivery food driver touched his heart. “ I immediately called the attention of my wife and we both felt deep respect and admiration for the man because despite his disability he was still working, risking his health to feed his family and serving people with food deliveries,” said Ouano. The photos he took serve as a great lesson to those who are complaining about the current situation but has the luxury to just stay home, unlike this delivery driver who is missing a limb but still works and functions better than those who have complete body parts.

In a now-viral video on social media, the delivery rider who apparently works for GrabFood was intercepted by barangay officials who insisted that such services are not allowed under the ECQ. According to barangay officials in San Jose del Monte’s Muzon area, the ECQ prohibits delivery services as a precautionary measure against the pandemic.  “Ba’t may Grab pa kasi? Bawal na po tambay, sir, eh,” the female barangay official said in the video, to which the rider replied that he has an order. “Bawal na nga po sir eh. Kasi hangga’t bukas kayo, may taong lalabas, may magdedeliver. Nonsense sir, video mo pa ako.” (Why are Grab riders still operating? The government has disallowed people to loiter. It is not allowed. Because as long as you operate, people will go out, someone will deliver. It’s nonsense, sir, even if you video-record me.)  The female barangay official initially thought that the rider was the shop owner. Discussions between the two ensued with the barangay official even contending that rice porridge is not essential because people can live without it. “’Di niyo ba naiintindihan, nandito babasahin ko ha, curfew hours natin — sige video mo para maintindihan mo, ‘di ba alam ng Grab ‘yan?” the barangay official asked, which the rider answered by saying they are only following guidelines set by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). (Can’t you understand, I’ll read this here, this is our curfew hours — go on, take videos so you would understand. Is Grab not aware of this?) “Pero ECQ tayo, sir. Teka lang, sir, may pinapa-implement tayo, 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., okay, curfew ‘yan,” the female official argued, even showing what appears to be printed slides from the IATF presentation.  “So dito naman, sa private establishments, essential goods and services, essential po ba si lugaw?  Hindi, kasi mabubuhay ang tao nang walang lugaw. Ang essential, tubig, gatas, grocery.”  (But we are under an ECQ, sir. We are implementing restrictions, like a 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.  So here, for private establishments, only essential goods and services are allowed to operate. Is rice porridge essential?  No, because people can live without a rice porridge; what is essential are water, milk, grocery items.) INQUIRER.net has reached out to the San Jose del Monte Police Station about the incident, and they explained in a phone interview that food deliveries are permitted as per IATF resolutions, even in an ECQ setup. Bulacan is one of the five areas included in the so-called NCR Plus bubble, along with Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal — which the national government placed under ECQ amid surges in COVID-19 infections. The San Jose del Monte Police also noted that no police officer was present when the rider was stopped and that the actions were done by barangay officials only. Also, the police said no complaints have been lodged before them as of this writing as the rider was only barred from entering the barangay. During the announcement of ECQ rules within the NCR Plus bubble, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque stressed that food shops and restaurants should remain open, but only for take-out and deliveries.

Fast-food giant Jollibee Foods Corp.’s delivery business in stores that remained open during the quarantine period is growing by an average of 50 percent versus same-store sales in the early part of 2020, Jollibee disclosed to the Philippine Stock Exchange.  In early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic reached local shores, local delivery business accounted for 5 percent of system-wide sales, up from 3 percent in the previous year. Delivery platform CocoDelivery, a unit of newly listed kiosk operator Fruitas Holdings Inc., increased its business by 20 times since the government’s lockdown order on Luzon, Fruitas founder, president and chief executive Lester Yu said.  At the beginning of the monthlong lockdown, Yu said Cocodelivery had been overwhelmed by the surge in volume given manpower constraints but the unit was able to adjust and cope by redeploying employees from other departments and business units. The products available on this platform are 100-percent fresh buko juice, Jamaican Pattie, Tea Rex milk tea, and selected Soy & Bean products like soy milk, taho and tofu. Fruitas has also rolled out a delivery service covering Metro Cebu.  Amid the Luzon-wide lockdown, Max’s Group Inc. (MGI) suspended all restaurant operations for 10 days as a precautionary measure but resumed operations in selected locations effective April 5, citing “authentic market demand.” As of last week, MGI reopened 47 branches of the following brands combined: Max’s Restaurant, Yellow Cab, Pancake House, Teriyaki Boy, Sizzlin’ Steak, Dencios, Maple and Kabisera. Despite closing majority of its stores during the lockdown, Shakey’s Pizza Asia Ventures kept select Shakey’s and Peri-Peri Charcoal chicken outlets operational for delivery and carry-out services albeit on a limited menu and shorter operating hours, running on a reduced and voluntary workforce. It is looking to gradually re-open more select outlets over the next few weeks. “This is an extraordinary time, but we are able to manage through by prioritizing a strong cash and liquidity position, and slowly increasing delivery and carry-out accessibility,” Shakey’s president and CEO Vicente Gregorio said. Gregorio added: “Amidst the short-term disruptions, we are also readying ourselves to bounce back in what we believe will be a new ‘post COVID’ world where a strong brand and delivery presence is key. Though the full effects of COVID remain unknown, we are firmly in this business for the long run benefit of all our stakeholders, including our employees and our guests, and we believe that the structural growth story of dining out in the Philippines is still intact.”  Jollibee also reported that its business in mainland China was now recovering. At the height of the COVID-19 breakout China in February, 107 of its 342 stores or 31 percent of its network in China were padlocked. But even during that time, the delivery business continued to operate. The delivery business – which accounted for 40 percent of sales of JFC’s biggest brand in China, Yonghe King – now accounted for 76 percent of its sales as of end-March and was growing by 20 percent versus same period a year ago. The number of padlocked stores in China had declined to 22, representing 6 percent of Yonghe King’s total store network. One innovation that has contributed meaningfully in China is the “contactless take-out,” where the customer sends and pays for its order by mobile phone application to a particular store and picks up the order outside the store at a specified time, without having direct interaction with the store crew, thus keeping social distancing even with a take-out purchase. In the North America, Smashburger suspended its dine-in services, but continued serving its customers through on-line delivery and take-out business. Philippine brands Jollibee, Chowking and Red Ribbon also continued to operate with drive-thru and take-out options. In Singapore, Jollibee’s delivery business grew by 256 percent during the crisis period versus year ago, increasing its sales contribution from 7 percent to 22 percent, and enabling total same store sales to grow by about 4 percent. Jollibee chief executive officer Ernesto Tanmantiong said: “While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to our operations in the Philippines and other parts of the world, we are already planning for the full restoration of our operations. We expect growth to resume even if gradually, driven by our delivery, take-out and drive thru business channels.” Jollibee deferred about P9 billion worth of capital expenditures from 2020 to 2021, citing operational constraints to the construction of facilities and to the uncertain demand volume due to limited mobility of consumers. Capital spending for 2020 was thus slashed by 64 percent to P5 billion.

But even then, one of the corporate catchphrases was “disrupt or be disrupted” or, more ominously, “innovate or be obsolete.” Indeed, many enterprises did so, for example by going— as the corporate vernacular puts it—all-digital in the way they execute their business or migrating to the cloud or automating business processes, etc.  Thence, also, saw the rise of mobile application-based business models made obvious by ride-hailing services, on-demand content consumption (aka “streaming”) and financial technology such as e-wallets. Of course, if there were first adopters, there were also laggards, be it due to budget constraints, complacence or plain obstinance. With the onset of the ultimate disruptor, the new coronavirus plague itself, little space was spared for stragglers in innovation.  As key markets if not entire populations were forced to work, study or simply stay at home, businesses needed to go where the customers are because, literally, no one was coming to them. Thus, enterprises both big and small have turned to delivery—as opposed to in-store dispatch of their products—as a transitory if not permanent means of business continuity. For example, Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. finally launched their Uniqlo Online store in the Philippines last July after years of being unavailable here, partnering with Air21 for deliveries. In May, homegrown conglomerate San Miguel used their Petron fuel stations as sites for rolling stores—refrigerated food trucks that offer their other brands such as Monterey meats and even ready-to-eat goods that are intended mainly for business customers such as restaurants. Today, the food trucks may no longer be rolling but the products continue to be available off-premises, through online ordering and delivery. As early as April during the enhanced community quarantine, independent oil firm Phoenix Petroleum Philippines Inc. had also turned to rolling stores and delivery services to ensure continuous operations of its FamilyMart convenience store chain. For this, FamilyMart used its Facebook page as well as GrabFood services.  “While many of our stores remain open to be of service, we want to bring FamilyMart closer to where we are needed,” said Henry Albert Fadullon, who has moved up as president of Phoenix from chief operating officer at the start of the pandemic. “FamilyMart will continue to innovate and adapt its services depending on the needs of the community,” Fadullon said. FamilyMart is continuing with the delivery services, although more recently, they have introduced in Cebu City a shop-through-the-window purchasing format for walk-in customers as well as drive-through shopping for motorists. For businesses that have no benefit of a large network of retail, delivery services are proving to be even more crucial. Elmie Marquez Domingo, who trained in baking at the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, started her entrepreneurial journey before COVID-19 by selling cupcakes, cookies, cakes, brownies and caramel bars that she herself made. “I trained in baking since I am very fond of desserts,” Domingo said. “At first it was a sideline, and my husband and I sold my products to colleagues at work, friends and relatives. And then I tried to expand my market through Facebook and Instagram.” This small business gained a following as Elmie’s Cake and Pastries Creation. Ironically, even for an online-dependent venture such as hers, community quarantine caused Domingo’s business to falter. “People were forced to stay at home and they needed things to keep them busy,” she said. “Many turned to baking. They are now making their own desserts and this meant fewer orders of my products.” The mother of a 5-year-old compensated by accommodating bulk orders and also expanded her portfolio with plasticware such as cabinets, plant pots, laundry baskets, and such. Still, another irony was that community quarantine hampered the delivery of Domingo’s offerings. “Many addresses were not accessible up to the doorstep because of quarantine,” she said. “Lalamove and such were not allowed into many subdivisions and customers are not willing to walk to the gates to pick up their purchases.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Their answer was to make the deliveries themselves, using the family’s subcompact hatchback. “My husband works from home but with lessened workload. In effect, he has long weekends and that gives him time to make deliveries with me,” Domingo said. A report titled “e-Conomy SEA (Southeast Asia) 2020”—jointly released by Google, Temasek and Bain & Co.—described the current situation of the digital economy as “resilient and racing ahead [at full velocity].” This study was based on an online survey that ran from Aug. 18 to Sept. 9. In the Philippines alone, they observed that food delivery and e-commerce were going strong with growth rates of 48 percent and 58 percent year-on-year, respectively. And, as observed elsewhere in the region, Filipinos have made the “flight to digital” and are “online with a purpose.” “In the Philippines, given the extensive COVID-19 lockdown periods, users went online searching for solutions to their sudden, new challenges,” the report said.“A significant number tried new digital services: 37 percent of all digital service consumers were new (slightly higher than the Southeast Asia average), with 95 percent of these new consumers intending to continue their behavior postpandemic.” The study shows that before the pandemic, Filipinos were spending four hours online for personal use. This shot up to 5.2 hours at the height of the lockdowns in April and May—the longest online time across Southeast Asia. Now it has settled to 4.9 hours daily. “With eight out of 10 users viewing technology as very helpful during the pandemic, it has become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives,” the report said.

Agriculture Secretary William Dar, who also heads the newly formed task force on food security, on Wednesday said the capacity limit was intended to reduce the possibility of contracting the coronavirus among people who delivered food.  “Food vehicles, haulers, delivery vans or trucks must only be occupied by a driver and two helpers,” Dar said in announcing the decision of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases, the temporary government body overseeing the Duterte administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. “We want an unhampered movement of agricultural products to ensure [adequate] food supply … but we also want to ensure that Filipinos remain healthy,” he added.  Previously, the government set no limits to the number of people that food vehicles could carry. Dar said the interagency task force originally wanted to limit the number to two—a driver and a helper—but this could impede the unloading of supplies.  Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (Sinag), the biggest umbrella organization for agricultural groups in the country, said it supported the task force’s decision but asked for exceptions to the travel ban this harvest season. Sinag chair Rosendo So cited, for instance, mango farms in Pangasinan and Zambales provinces, which he said were having manpower problems as they were at the peak of the season and were calling on the government to allow laborers to travel in groups to farms to harvest fruit. “We are OK with three people if they are handling commodities going to Manila, but in the provinces, it would be helpful if more than three people would be allowed on food vehicles to speed up the harvest,” he said. So denied allegations that food vehicles were being used to smuggle people in and out of Metro Manila, pointing out that identification cards and other documents were required at checkpoints. Certain industries are also asking for exceptions to lockdown restrictions, citing varying times of operations.  In poultry, for instance, egg harvesting can only be done at night to avoid shrinkage and mortality. In fishing, fishermen go out to sea before dawn. In both industries, people must be exempted from curfew to be able to do their work. Dar said discussions with local governments were continuing to allow work in agriculture to proceed to avoid disruptions in food production and distribution.

Herrera noted that Section 3(g) of the law specifically provides that “for delivery orders, the 20 percent discount shall likewise apply subject to certain conditions, i.e. senior citizen ID card number must be given while making the order over the telephone.” This covers food deliveries made through Food Panda, Grab, and other similar applications, said the lawmaker.

Lopez said food deliveries will limit the movement of people and open opportunities for  small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  “Ang ini-encourage natin, at least may food preparation at delivery (What we encourage is there should be at least food preparation and delivery),” Lopez said in a press briefing. President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire Luzon under an enhanced community quarantine which will be in effect from March 17 to April 13 to help contain and combat the viral pandemic.  Under the enhanced quarantine measure, only private establishments providing basic necessities related to food, medicine, banks, power, energy, water, telecommunications, among others will remain open. “Dahil yung ginawa ng mga ibang nag-lockdown, even in China, in Wuhan, yung delivery business ang lumakas. At least may hanapbuhay pa rin yung mga SMEs natin. Yan po ang mga opportunities sa ngayon,” Lopez said.  (In China, in Wuhan, where a lockdown was implemented, the delivery business boomed. At least our SMEs can grab the opportunity and still run their businesses.) Authorities in Hubei province in China, where the COVID-19 outbreak started, also put a halt to nearly all transportation and movement except for quarantine efforts, medical care and delivery of food and basic necessities. President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a state of public health emergency throughout the country due to rising transmission of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2. To date, the country has so far recorded 142 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 12 fatalities. Most COVID-19 patients recover from mild symptoms such as fever and cough.  The elderly and immunocompromised, or those with existing health issues, however, are vulnerable to more serious conditions such as pneumonia and respiratory problems. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic since it has already infected more than 160,000 people and killed over 6,000 worldwide.

Lockdowns have increased online consumer activity, similar to the SARS episode in 2003, which was a turning point for China’s e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com,” Maybank Kim Eng analysts Lee Ju Ye and Chua Hak Bin said in an April 20 report titled “Consumer Behavior During a Pandemic.”  Citing Google’s COVID-19 community mobility reports, usage of retail and recreation facilities such as restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas plunged 82 percent in the Philippines from Feb. 29 to April 11, compared to the baseline period covering Jan. 3 to Feb. 6. Also, Filipinos frequented groceries and pharmacies less often, as mobility dropped to 60 percent during the same period.  Mobility to workplaces declined 67 percent; via transit stations and public transport hubs such as bus and train stations, down 86 percent; and in parks and beaches, 59 percent. “Based on data compiled by Google’s COVID-19 community mobile reports, the Philippines and Malaysia—among the first countries to impose lockdowns—are showing the steepest declines in people movements,” Maybank said.  Maybank noted that food delivery services had a low penetration rate in Asean—for instance, only 5.5 percent in the Philippines last year, but “with the ban on dine-in services, more food merchants are signing up with delivery platforms such as GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.” The Philippine government had allowed these food delivery services to continue amid the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon and other parts of the country, which started in mid-March and would end by April 30. The newfound habit of ordering food online or through mobile apps was expected to spill over to a wider array of goods and services offered on the internet, Maybank said. “Asean’s e-commerce penetration is relatively low, but will likely rise significantly due to COVID-19. Online sales account for 4 percent in Indonesia and the Philippines, 4.4 percent in Thailand, 4.7 percent in Malaysia and 9 percent in Singapore, based on data from Euromonitor. This is well below the 30-percent rate in South Korea and China, and 13 percent in the US,” it said. On the flip side, Maybank said that “the ‘sharing economy’ tech players, after enjoying several years of generous venture capital funding, will be the worst hit.”  “Bookings on Airbnb have plunged by over 90 percent in some markets, and online searches for ‘Airbnb,’ ‘Booking.com’ and ‘AirAsia’ have fallen to record lows across Asean. Co-working space is another major casualty, as tenants halt payments and break leases. Ride hailing platforms face a plunge in ridership, but drivers are shifting to other types of work such as food delivery and logistics. Grab and Gojek are burning cash to provide financial support to drivers in order to maintain their fleet for the ensuing recovery,” it noted. On a lighter note, while most Filipinos stayed at home during the ongoing lockdown, consumers mostly searched for food and entertainment as well as details of the government’s social amelioration program on Google. From March 18 to April 16, the top Google searches in the Philippines included “Dalgona coffee,” “SAC (social amelioration card) form,” “Dalgona Milo,” “Netflix mobile plan,” “Vindale research” (paid surveys at home), “grocery store,” “Goldilocks Bakeshop,” “Minecraft,” and “recipe,” Maybank noted. Searches for “masks” and “thermometers” also climbed across Asean since the pandemic started during the last week of January.

This week, one food delivery man, Raymund Papellero, was recognized for his small acts of charity after a Facebook post on Easter Sunday, April 12, went viral.  Raina Ominga, a 31-year-old government employee from San Juan, said on Sunday she discovered why he kept buying bread in bulk from their business, Raina’s Bakery. “Sabi ni Kuya, lahat daw ng nakukuha niyang tip [every time] nagdedeliver sya, iniipon niya pambibili niya ng bread. Then pinapamigay niya sa mga taong nakikita niya sa kalsada along the way,” she said.  (The driver said that he saves the tips he receives when he delivers so he can buy bread. Then he gives it to the people in the street along the way.)   Ominga admitted to INQUIRER.net that their bakery, like other businesses, was affected by the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). “Bumaba ang profit (profit went down) due to curfew. But it doesn’t matter na kasi health issue ang involved e (anymore because a health issue is involved),” she said. “We just have to adapt.” When she learned of Papellero’s routine, she said, “I was actually surprised and amazed at the same time na ganun ginagawa niya (that he was doing that). I saw the kindness and purity of his heart. Right in front of my eyes, is hope. Amazing talaga (It’s really amazing).”  She continues to give updates through her account when Papellero comes to buy bread at their bakery; she says he comes even when it is his day off.  “Kindness gives us hope. It gives us light out of darkness.

He told INQUIRER.net he has been in food delivery for the past 11 years and is a regular employee of a pizza chain. His wife, who works in accounting, is unable to work due to the ECQ. On why he chooses to give away food on the streets, he explained, “Laking mahirap po ako. Hindi po ako mayaman, kaya naiintindihan ko po ‘yong sitwasyon nila.” (I grew up poor. I am not rich, which is why I understand their situation.) He said that when he was growing up in Cebu, his parents struggled in Manila and also experienced going hungry.

He said too that he will include coffee in his food giveaway so that people can enjoy it with their bread. Papellero’s kindness extends to his fellow drivers too. He said he went on paid leave for a few weeks after the ECQ started so others could have the chance to work. “Marami din gustong pumasok kasi wala din silang pagkukunan (Many want to work because they don’t have a source [of income],” he said.

Preschool teacher Cha Calubaquib, who lives in Quezon City, recalled on Monday, April 13, how she was struck by the gratitude of a driver to whom she shared food with.  When she decided to order food that day, she placed orders for the driver and frontliners in her building. However, that order nearly did not push through because no one was accepting her booking. Thankfully, driver Andrew Cucal got the booking and made the delivery to Calubaquib. When she told him of his order, he said, “Sakto nga po ma’am kasi gutom na ako. Iuuwi ko na sana sa bahay namin pero may [ide-deliver] pa po ako tapos uwi na po ako, may ulam na po kami.” (Right on time ma’am because I was getting hungry. I was going to bring this home but I still have a delivery. I will go home afterwards, with a meal.) He also looked for her on Facebook and messaged her pictures of him sharing the meal with his kids. “Single parent po kasi ako kaya malaking [tulong] po talaga maraming maraming [salamat] po,” he said. (I am a single parent, which is why it is a big help. Thank you very very much.) “When he shared the picture of him and his family eating, sobrang saya ng feeling kasi nakatulong ako sa kanila (I felt so happy because I was able to help) in that way,” Calubaquib told INQUIRER.net. “Ang saya lang ng feeling kasi sobrang grateful din ni Kuya Andrew eh (I felt so happy because Kuya Andrew was so grateful).” “Kuya Andrew was really genuine even when I met him downstairs to get my orders.

PDEA-7 Director Levi Ortiz, said that Baltazar had been monitored for about two weeks but was already reported before the month of August for his illegal activities. “Dugay na mi siya pero lately lang nibalik ang information. Katong panahona tungod sa pandemic — tawag ani nila walay bugas — so na stop atong operation. Pero lately lang mga two weeks ago nagsugod na pod balik until such time karon na consumate gyud atong negotiation sa iyaha,” said Ortiz. (We have heard of reports of him before but lately the information about his illegal activities. At that time it was because of the pandemic — they call it because of having no rice — so we stopped our operation. But lately about two weeks ago, we received information that they are back in operation and so we finally completed our negotiation with him.) One large pack of suspected shabu placed in a transparent plastic was confiscated from Baltazar which was said to weigh one kilo or P6,800,000 of value. “Wala ko kabalo unsay sulod sa kargamento… Ga tinarong ko,” said Baltazar. (I don’t know what was inside the package…I did not do anything wrong.) He also admitted that he had never been arrested since his last arrest in 2002 for robbery where he later got out of jail in 2007. Baltazar will be detained in PDEA-7 detention facility while a case for violating section 5 and 11 or the selling and possesion of illegal drugs of the Republic Act 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act, will be filed against him. With this incident, Ortiz said they would be coordinating closely with the police especially since that delivery service companies were prone to be used as decoys for drug personalities during this time. He said they would also discuss with the delivery service companies on how they would be able to come up with monitoring possible persons involved in the illegal drugs business./dbs"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1306909/lapid-goes-after-serial-cancelers-pranksters","title":"Lapid goes after ‘serial cancelers,’ pranksters preying on food delivery services","date":"04:51 AM July 15, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — “Serial cancelers” and pranksters preying on food delivery services may soon end up behind bars if this Senate bill is enacted.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — “Serial cancelers” and pranksters preying on food delivery services may soon end up behind bars if this Senate bill is enacted. The penalties are being pushed in a measure filed by Sen. Lito Lapid seeking to impose a fine of as much as P100,000 and a prison term of up to six months on customers found guilty of repeatedly or arbitrarily canceling delivery orders.  Lapid, a member of the Senate public services committee, said online delivery services saw a sudden spike as people were forced to stay in their homes as part of safety regulations to contain the spread of COVID-19. But many food couriers of delivery services have been victimized by “no-show” or bogus customers, as well as those who cancel food orders that are already in transit.  “[D]elivery riders have recently been exposed to unjustified cancellation of orders or even to instances of ‘no-show’ customers despite the fact that they have already advanced or paid the ordered items,” Lapid said in his Senate Bill No. 1677. “It’s unfortunate that delivery riders are being duped despite the risks they face to serve customers and earn a little.”  His bill would require delivery services to set up a reimbursement system that would make it easier for delivery riders to refund within one day the money they spent for canceled orders. “To facilitate collection against canceling customers, this bill also requires the implementation of know-your-customer rules, which will entail the submission and verification of proof of identity and residential address subject to compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” Lapid said.

In a Facebook post on Monday, Clariza said that he spotted Regala in Barangay 183 in Pasay City. The actor then asked for his help as he was suffering from a headache.  “Siya po si Mister John Regala, ang sikat na kontra bida.

That’s why he asked for my help and I quickly asked the barangay guards and police to help him.] Clariza said that despite he had to deliver something, he thought it best to stay with Regala until someone helped him out.  Regala, in an interview over DZRH on Tuesday, disclosed that he was suffering from liver cirrhosis. “Medyo malala na ang aking liver cirrhosis pero hindi naman ako nainom ng alak ever since. Di ko alam baka sa fatty foods ko nakuha siguro,” the actor said. [My liver cirrhosis is already severe. I have never drunk alcohol ever since. Maybe I got it from eating fatty foods.] “Tapos bukod dun, may tubig nga ako sa tyan, kailangan butasin ang aking tyan para mailabas yung tubig,” Regala added. [Aside from that, I have water in my stomach. So my stomach needs to be operated on so the water will be released.) “At isa pa, yung aking sikmura ay may mga varicose [veins] na. pag pumutok yun, ako ay sumusuka ng dugo. Sinusuka ko yung mga kinakain ko.” [And another thing, my throat has varicose veins. If it pops, I vomit blood.

In a statement on Saturday, MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim said the enforcers—who have not been identified—were arrested by authorities on Friday afternoon.  Based on an investigation by the MMDA, the motorcycle riders were on their way to deliver food to their customers when they got flagged down by the traffic enforcers at the Edsa-Ayala southbound loading and unloading bay. The enforcers then allegedly demanded from the riders some money, purportedly P500, and P100 respectively, so the delivery crews could pass through Edsa.  The delivery drivers gave in to the enforcers’ demand but they subsequently sought the help of members of the Makati City Police, who were at the time conducting “Oplan Sita” at Arnaiz corner Park Square Avenue Drive. The MMDA enforcers were consequently arrested. They are now detained at the Makati City Police headquarters, pending the filing of appropriate charges against them.  “We will not allow anyone to taint the good image of the agency. Both of them are automatically terminated from service,” Lim said. “The agency has no room for this kind of traffic enforcers.

As one of the casualties in the company’s retrenchment exercise, the former digital design director now earns up to $2,000 “in a good month”, which is about one-quarter of the salary he used to draw.  When projects dried up for the company early this year, Mr Yap, who worked at the firm for about two years, was laid off, along with at least two others. “I didn’t really react when I was told I was being let go. I was quite calm and went to pack up. It only sunk in the next few days,” he said.  In the weeks after, he tried applying for jobs in all sectors, including supermarkets, hospitals and cleaning companies, but the applications were either unsuccessful or he did not hear back from them. “There were moments when I felt this sense of dread, and I started to realize just how badly impacted the global economy was and how jobs were affected,” said Mr Yap, who is married with no children. His wife works as a software specialist.  He also feels that his age could pose an issue for some employers, and he has been told by recruiters that he did not make the cut because he is over-experienced. Since April, he has been making food deliveries on his bicycle. The one silver lining from this is that he has lost more than 10kg from cycling 12 hours a day. “Food delivery is pandemic-and recession-resistant. Everyone still needs to eat, so I decided to do this,” said Mr Yap, who has cut back on his non-essential spending, such as eating out. Some people have questioned his decision to become a food delivery rider after his previous post in a director role, but Mr Yap thinks nothing of it. “For me, a job is a job. You put your head down and bring some money home,” he said. His advice for others going through tough times is to be positive. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel, just that now the tunnel has got a lot longer.

Lapid filed Senate Bill 1677, which seeks to protect delivery drivers by requiring food and grocery delivery service providers to set up a mandatory reimbursement scheme for unjust cancellation of orders.  “If a customer cancels for at least three (3) times in a period of one (1) month, he/she, upon conviction, be subject to the penalty of arresto mayor or imprisonment of one month and one day to six months, the bill stated.” Lapid noted that a growing number of Filipinos opt to avail of delivery services for food and other items amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when the public is advised to stay at home.  Some delivery service drivers, however, have been victimized by unjustified cancellation of orders and even of “no-show” customers, even if the drivers have already paid for the ordered items in advance. “Masakit isipin na sa kabila ng panganib na hinaharap ng mga delivery rider para lamang makapagserbisyo sa mga customer at kumita ng maliit na halaga, sa huli, sila pa ang naloloko,” Lapid said in a statement on Tuesday.  (It is painful to think that despite the danger faced by delivery riders for the sake of serving customers and earning  meager income, they are sometimes being duped.) “Bukod sa nasasayang ang oras at salapi ng mga riders dahil sa pagkansela ng order, ang mas malala pa, may mga pagkakataon na ni hindi matunton ang address ng nanlokong customer dahil sa fake address. Hindi tuloy sila mapanagot at naiiwang lugi at abunado ang mga delivery riders,” the senator added. (Aside from the time and money wasted because of cancelled orders, some customers also can’t be located since they give fake addresses. Thus, they cannot be held liable and the delivery riders will have to shoulder the expense.) Lapid pointed out that the bill will require delivery service providers to establish a reimbursement scheme for the delivery drivers in case orders are cancelled. Reimbursement to the drivers should be made within one day from the cancellation under the bill.  To facilitate collection against customers who cancel orders, the bill also requires delivery service providers to implement know-your-customer rules which include the submission and verification of proof of identity and residential address subject to compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012. Under the bill, food and grocery delivery service providers that will fail to set up a reimbursement scheme will also be penalized with a fine not exceeding P500,000 and double the amount of money not reimbursed to delivery drivers.

This as the Transportation Network Vehicle Services firm bared a new system that will protect its drivers against unreasonable cancellation of food orders or no-show customers.  During the online hearing of the House committee on trade and industry, Grab spokesperson Atty. Nicka Hosaka said the new scheme may be implemented around August this year. “Currently , ang majority ng ating users (the majority of our users and) with our merchants as well, what really happens is if the delivery partner goes to our restaurants to order on behalf of the consumer, then the delivery partner will advance the payment… In the face of no show, Grab will reimburse the delivery partner 100%,” Hosaka told lawmakers.  “Moving towards August, we will be implementing this model whereby pagdating sa restaurant (once a food couriers arrives at a restaurant), the delivery partner will not need to bring out any cash. He will simply pick up the order and the restaurant already receives the payment straight via the app,” Hosaka added. Once the food courier has picked up the order, the courier will just receive the payment from the customer once the food items have been delivered.  “Ito ngayon ay meron tayong mine-maintain na driver wallet na tinatawag natin. So kung ano ‘yung kokolektahin niya from the eater, ‘yun naman ang made-debit sa kanyang wallet,” Hosaka said. (Food couriers have what we call driver wallet. So, whatever they collect from the customer, it will be debited from their wallet.) In case a customer does not show up to pick up their order, nothing will be taken away from their “driver wallet,” which has a maintaining balance of P1,500 to P2,000. This, however, can be cashed out by their food couriers anytime, said Hosaka. Under House Bill No. 6958 or the Food and Grocery Delivery Services Protection Act, filed by Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Alfredo Garbin Jr., cancellation of confirmed orders when the items are already in the possession of the delivery rider or in transit to the customer will be prohibited. The bill covers “instances wherein customers order food and/or grocery items for the purpose of pranking or those who have no genuine intention of availing of the services which causes damage and undue duress to the delivery riders and their corresponding service providers.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1268479/delivery-of-next-essentials-such-as-clothing-hardware-products-now-allowed-amid-quarantine","title":"Delivery of ‘next essentials’ like clothing, hardware items now allowed during ECQ","date":"05:16 PM May 02, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The delivery of “next essentials” such as clothing, hardware products and appliances are now allowed in Metro Manila and other areas placed under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The delivery of “next essentials” such as clothing, hardware products and appliances are now allowed in Metro Manila and other areas placed under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. “Even under the ECQ, we have expanded items that can be delivered since the ECQ has been extended, we recognize that many of our kababayans (fellowmen) will be needing more items beyond the essentials, so we are going to the next essentials,” DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez said during the “Laging Handa” press briefing, explaining what “next essentials” mean.

Instead of the traditional employer-employee model, companies who need services obtain them from the general public, leading to the formation of what is called the “on-demand economy” or “gig economy.”","body":"Technology has dramatically changed the way that people work and earn a living in the 21stcentury. Instead of the traditional employer-employee model, companies who need services obtain them from the general public, leading to the formation of what is called the “on-demand economy” or “gig economy.” This has allowed the rise of alternative work arrangements, which include “free lancers,” on-call workers, and temporary help agency workers. Examples of high-profile companies who participate in the gig economy are Uber and Lyft – companies who provide ride-share services, and GrubHub, which is an on-demand food delivery service.  More often than not, workers in the gig economy are not considered “employees” in the traditional sense. Many of them are labeled “independent contractors” (or ICs) and do not have the same rights and protections that employees enjoy. ICs are not entitled to minimum wage, to overtime pay for working more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week, protection from unlawful deductions, protection from unlawful discrimination and harassment, reimbursement for business expenses, workers’ compensation protection, additional benefits such as sick pay, health insurance, retirement and profit-sharing plans, and the right to the employer’s share of the social security, unemployment and disability taxes. There are several factors that determine whether a worker has been correctly classified as an independent contractor. The most important factor is the employer’s right to control the worker’s manner and means of performing the job.  If the employer dictates how the worker should do the work, what tasks to accomplish and how to accomplish them, then the worker is an employee and not an independent contractor.  The issue of “control” is the reason why many of the gig companies, including Uber and Lyft, have been sued in court. Their workers have accused them of misclassification, i.e., that even though these companies call them independent contractors, the companies continue to control the means and manner of doing the job. The most recent gig company to fall afoul of California’s misclassification laws is DoorDash, another on-demand food delivery service that is the main competitor of GrubHub.  DoorDash drivers, called “dashers,” sued the company alleging that they were incorrectly classified as “independent workers.” This misclassification allowed DoorDash to avoid paying the dashers the minimum wage or overtime hours worked and allowed the company not to reimburse the workers for business expenses. These, despite the fact that delivery drivers were regularly treated like employees – being directed in the many details of their work, instructed where to report for their shifts, how to dress, and where to go to pick up and await deliveries. The drivers claimed that driver services “are fully integrated into DoorDash’s business, and without the drivers, DoorDash’s business would not exist.” DoorDash insisted that the on-demand drivers were independent contractors rather than employees and that the company had complied with the Labor Code. Rather than proceed to trial, the company agreed to pay $5 million to settle the case. The company will pay class members $3.5 million with an extra $1.5 million if the company is profitable for an entire year, is acquired or goes public. The settlement will benefit 33,744 drivers, including drivers who were categorized as independent contractors who worked for the company and completed one delivery or more. Employees misclassified as ICs lose big time – in money and legal protection. Thus, workers classified as ICs should carefully examine the nature of their working relationship with their companies. If they are really employees, they are entitled to back wages, reimbursements for expenses, and the value of employment benefits such as health insurance, retirement or pension benefits.

(We encourage the use of online payment to avoid fake bookings, which means the products were already paid.) Under the scheme, bogus customers will book an order, usually through a cash-on-delivery mode, and have it delivered to a different address. In the end, the delivery men, who shouldered the payment for the items in the understanding that he will be reimbursed, usually end up paying for these purchases.  At the same time, Lopez also stressed the importance of the registration of the sim cards to trace the fake buyers. Such a measure has already been filed before the Senate. “Pangalawa isa ring panukala natin ififinofollow up ko nga rin ito eh ‘yung registration nung mga cellphone cards, ‘yung mga anong tinatawag dito, yung sim card para talaga may traceability kung sino ho ‘yung may intention o ‘yung mga naglilinlang o nanloloko dito ho sa mga online transaction na ito,” he said.  (Second, we proposed the registration of cellphone cards, the sim cards to have traceability who will have the intention to deceive people on the online transaction.) Earlier, Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera urged the National Bureau of Investigation to probe recent reports of food delivery riders falling victims to fake bookings. “Resulta ito ng hindi sila nate-trace maaaring pwedeng naano ‘yan, nagpaprank call o nanloloko sila so nakakagulo sila. At unfortunately, naaapektuhan ‘yung mga maliliit na negosyo rito so kawawa naman ho,” Lopez said. (This was because they were not being traced, some of them were doing prank calls. And unfortunately, it affects the small businesses.) Earlier, the Senate trade committee vowed to fast-track a “timely and “relevant” bill filed by Sen.

He then asked DOLE if these riders have insurance and health benefits.  “What protection are we giving these Food Panda drivers?” Gordon asked. “Do they have SSS (Social Security System), PhilHealth, and other protections? Do they have extra pay, supported during calamities?” he added.

It is a humble belief that the New Bilibid Prison through its Superintendents has discretion and prerogative to implement policy procedures,” he added. Kapatid has sent another letter to BuCor, asking that the decision be reconsidered, citing the case of political prisoner Jesus Alegre, 75, a farmer from Sagay, Negros Occidental, who has been held in the Maximum Security Compound for 16 years.  “Jesus Alegre is still very sick even after confinement at the NBP infirmary and check-ups at the Ospital ng Muntinlupa.

Lito Lapid that seeks to protect food and grocery delivery riders from fraudulent orders. The committee tackled Senate Bill No. 1677 which seeks to set up a mandatory reimbursement scheme for unjust cancellation of orders.  “Let’s fast-track this because it’s very timely, very relevant. Even after the pandemic,  this will be relevant because we have grown accustomed to online services,” Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, chair of the Senate committee, said, speaking partly in Filipino, during a hearing on Tuesday. “We will go beyond food and grocery delivery. All the delivery services where this is applicable, the riders are victimized,” he added, noting that his committee would immediately schedule a technical working group meeting to iron out the details of the bill.  Before this, service providers Grab Philippines and Foodpanda made separate manifestations detailing their systems to ensure the protection of riders from the fraudulent practice. Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said the company had gradually reformed its policy so that the payment of customers would be directly given to the service provider’s merchant partners.  “As of August 2020, there is no longer an advance that is done by the riders. We slowly rolled it out wherein our merchant partners will get the payment straight from those who order. There’s no longer any money paid out by our riders,” she told the committee. On the part of Foodpanda, regulatory and public affairs manager Rose Romero said: “Ever since Foodpanda operated, the riders never advanced the cash.” According to Romero, Foodpanda provides its merchant partners with a tablet device that records orders. “That what gets the orders transmitted through the app. From there, the orders are prepared directly. So riders need not go there [to the store] to order or even pay,” she said. “The cash advance of riders is really not applicable.” Meanwhile, Romero proposed that the bill also include provisions to protect “all players in the industry or in the community of users, such as the platform providers, the merchants, the riders and the consumers.”  While Grab and Foodpanda already have systems in place to protect their riders, Pimentel said the bill would be applicable to other delivery service providers who might be noncompliant. “If you have the correct policies…you should not fear the law. The policy is there. You already have a system…So we are really after the noncompliant,” Pimentel said. Further, he said the bill should be expanded to cover delivery services for non-food or non-grocery items. Lapid, the author of the bill, agreed with Pimentel, saying: “Sana all.” He used a Filipino catchphrase currently popular, meaning: “I hope it applies to everything or everyone.” Pimentel made the proposal to expand the coverage of the bill after the committee learned that Grab also offers a concierge-like service called the “Pabili” feature, where riders would have to advance cash. Customers can book deliveries for both food and non-food items. “So far, there have been no incidents of ‘no-show’ or canceled orders. In any untoward incident, Grab again is able to fully reimburse riders if there are those who were not fully paid,” Hosaka said. Lapid pushed for the passage of the bill as many Filipinos continue to rely on online delivery services during the pandemic. He said there had been numerous reported incidents in which riders were exposed to “fake bookings” — or the unjustified cancellation of orders. “Food and grocery delivery riders took on a crucial role in our day-to-day lives, especially during the current health crisis,” Lapid said.

Reyes was referring to the latest brouhaha to sweep the country— a viral video showing a delivery rider being stopped by barangay officials in San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan, for making food deliveries during the 6:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. curfew. Bulacan is part of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) bubble that included Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal, or areas with COVID-19 surges.  “Sa Pilipinas lang talaga kailangan ilinaw  pati ang lugaw bilang essential.

That is the confusing nature of the ECQ guidelines; many are prone to abuse.)  Earlier, videos of the rider who was stopped in San Jose del Monte’s Muzon area went viral on social media.

This, despite Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) resolutions allowing food delivery operations to resume even during an ECQ, with courier services delivering essential items allowed to operate at full capacity.

Bordaje said he saw the food delivery driver while he was walking at the vicinity of the Cebu IT Park in the afternoon of September 12. “I was walking from the parking area behind Pyramid heading to Ebloc2 building to work. I saw from a distance a food panda rider with crutches on his back,” says Bordaje. Bordaje said that he immediately took a photo of the food delivery driver and had this posted on his social media account hoping to also inspire especially the able bodied individuals to work to earn their keep. “The photo speaks a thousand words,” he said. Bordaje told CDN Digital that it was not his first time that he saw the food delivery driver near his workplace. “After seeing a Food Panda rider from a distance with crutches on his back, I knew it was him! I saw Kuya Food Panda again, this time handing orders to a customer. Several times I just see him on the road driving his scooter peacefully without problems, but unfortunately I was not able to ask for his name,” he said. Bordaje admitted that he felt pity the first time that he saw the food delivery driver. But he eventually felt respect for the person the next time that he saw him. “I know people who are physically healthy but are so lazy to work for money. I know adult people who own motorcycles yet struggling financially because (they are) too shy to use the bike for extra income. Lastly, I thought of healthy and strong people committing crimes and here’s Kuya, a disabled man working hard to make a living,” says Bordaje. Even netizens who saw Bordaje’s viral photo shared the same opinion of the food delivery driver. The photo which he uploaded on September 12 already earned 225 comments, 1,400 shares, and 3,200 reactions as of noontime today, September 14. The photo truly sparked a huge light of inspiration to everyone who loves making excuses. | dcb"},{"url":"https://sports.inquirer.net/398585/kings-holmes-violates-nba-bubble-rules-after-food-delivery-pick-up","title":"Kings’ Holmes violates NBA bubble rules after food delivery pick up","date":"05:06 PM July 15, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The NBA isn’t messing around with its strict rules inside the bubble.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The NBA isn’t messing around with its strict rules inside the bubble.

The incident circulated in social media after one Krizia De Lara (@xiaaaaaang) spoke about it on Twitter last Thursday, Sept. 26. She also posted photos of the driver. De Lara said the driver approached her and her sibling at the Met Live mall in Pasay City. She added that the driver was a victim of a “fake buyer” who ordered 14 pieces of milk tea, which totaled to P1,900.   To make up for the cost of the order, the driver sold the cups of milk tea at lower prices to people at the said mall, De Lara said. She then appealed to Grab Philippines to address the matter to avoid similar incidents from happening again.  The company told De Lara that their “delivery-partners are fully-reimbursed for unclaimed orders once reported.” “Customers with no-shows face account penalties, including suspension,” the delivery service added.

If you don’t have an on-site cafeteria, the temptation to have lunch delivered to your desk can be very strong. But in China, it’s not so much bad weather as air pollution levels that could encourage workers to use food delivery services. When repeated day in day out, this habit can considerably increase the amount of plastic waste created from take-out food packaging. So highlights a new study carried out by researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  Published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, the research focuses on China, which is one of the world’s biggest users of online food delivery platforms. The country counts around 350 million registered users and an estimated 65 million meal containers discarded each day. Office workers contribute over one-half of the demand for the services, the study states. Carried out between January and June 2018, the study analyzed the lunch choices of 251 participants in their workplaces in three of the country’s often smog-filled cities: Beijing, Shenyang and Shijiazhuang. They were asked to submit photos of their meals (over 3,000 photos were sent).  To complement this, the researchers also analyzed 2016 order data from an online food delivery platform based in Beijing (3.5 million food delivery orders from about 350,000 users). Both sets of data were then compared to PM2.5 (fine particle) measurements during lunchtime hours from the air-monitoring network in the three cities. Participants looked to food delivery when pollution was high  The data from the Beijing-based delivery firm revealed that a 100 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 particulate matter pollution in the air increased food delivery consumption by 7.2%. As for the study participants, the impact of a 100 micrograms per cubic meter PM2.5 shift on their propensity to order delivery was six times larger, at 43%. The researchers estimate that, on a given day, if all of China was exposed to a 100 micrograms per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 (as often happens in Beijing), 2.5 million more meals would be delivered, potentially using the same additional number of plastic bags or plastic containers. “Our findings probably apply to other typically polluted developing-nation cities, such as in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Vietnam,” the researchers warn. Is that enough to convince workers to come to the office armed with an array of Tupperware boxes? Or, alternatively, to brave the 10-to-15-minute walk between their workplace and a restaurant to enjoy the occasional meal outside the office, either with colleagues or alone. RGA RELATED STORIES:  Air pollution may increase risk of developing high blood pressure — study The new street furniture cleaning up urban air"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1258077/viennas-horse-drawn-carriages-ride-again-for-food-delivery","title":"Vienna’s horse-drawn carriages ride again — for food delivery","date":"12:22 AM April 14, 2020","snippet":"Vienna’s horse-drawn carriages, a staple of street life in the Austrian capital and a popular tourist attraction, have been sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic — so they are now helping deliver food to the elderly.","body":"Vienna’s horse-drawn carriages, a staple of street life in the Austrian capital and a popular tourist attraction, have been sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic — so they are now helping deliver food to the elderly. The carriages, or “Fiaker” as they are called in Vienna, are taking part in a food delivery scheme in one of the city’s central districts set up by the InterContinental Hotel, itself severely hit by lockdown measures taken to halt the spread of the virus.  Instead of catering to guests, the hotel’s kitchens have been turning out 200 to 300 meals a day for senior citizens in the area. Deliveries are made by volunteers using all manner of vehicles, including by part-time “Fiaker” driver Christian Gerzabek.  Despite business coming to a standstill, “the horses still have to be moved, they want to get out after the winter,” he says. “I thought that we should combine that.. with doing something good for people who need it,” he told AFP.  The scheme has been a lifeline for its elderly beneficiaries. One of them, Anneliese Nebenfuehr, said she thought the deliveries were “wonderful.” “I told the gentleman on the phone to give a kiss to the whole team,” she said. InterContinental general director Brigitte Trattner said carriage drivers were the first to respond to a call for delivery volunteers, with car drivers and cyclists also signing up. Describing the InterContinental Vienna as an intrinsic part of Vienna’s third district, Trattner said that when the coronavirus crisis broke “We naturally thought, is there anyway we can help?” The hotel plans to run the project until Monday, and after that Trattner says meals would be distributed to staff at the Rudolfstiftung hospital, which is also nearby.

Speaking in an interview on dzBB, Belmonte explained that even the city’s suppliers are having a hard time meeting the food demand.  “Nagaapela na wag na po ninyo akong i-bash. Kumikilos po tayo, intindihin po nila sana yung laki po ng problema. Hindi naman sa hindi tayo kumikilos pero yung suppliers din po natin nahihirapan mag-supply for 400,000 families pero ginagawan po natin ng paraan,” she said in an interview on dzBB. (I appeal that residents would not bash me, we are doing out jobs, please understand that we some of our suppliers are struggling because there are 400,000 families in the city, but we are doing everything we can).  Belmonte gave assurance to city residents that there would be enough support from the local government on necessities such as food. She, however, admitted that the city’s quick response fund may not be enough to sustain the provision of food until the end of the enhanced community quarantine declared over Luzon.  The mayor said the city council members have agreed that barangay officials would have to provide for the food packages of their constituents during the first week of the month-long quarantine. “On the fourth week, ubos na po ang quick response fund ng lungsod natin, because we calculated the amount of money we have to spend—kahit for three weeks na lang po dahil sagot na po ng barangay ang first week—mahigit P1 billion ang kailangan natin,” she said. (On the fourth week, our fund will run out because we calculated the money we have to spend—except for the fourth week because the barangays would shoulder it—for only the three weeks, we would need P1 billion). “Ang quick response fund po ng lungsod ay P400 million lang more or less at marami pa pong dapat asikasuhin dun sa quick response fund, hindi lang po pagkain,” she added. (The quick response fund of the city is only P400 million more or less and we have other things to address as well not just food).  The enhanced community quarantine took effect on March 17 and will be in effect until April 13. The measure sought to restrict residents to their homes to contain the virus by suspending the operation of public transportation, regulating the provision for food and essential services; and instituting a heightened presence of uniformed personnel who will enforce the quarantine. Belmonte however said that the city government would still be able to provide food supplies to its residents for the remaining weeks of the quarantine period. Belmonte said the local government is working with the private sectors and appealing for help from some government officials like senators or congressmen.

Duterte early on Friday told local governments to follow guidelines laid down by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases, which had mandated unhampered movement of cargoes despite the lockdown imposed on the entire Luzon to halt the spread of the new coronavirus in the country.  But Agriculture Secretary William Dar on Wednesday said that in the last 10 days, the prices of some foods had increased mainly due to failure of deliveries caused by the refusal of authorities manning the checkpoints to allow food trucks through. Prices of vegetables, for example, have significantly risen because local government directives inconsistent with those of the national government are being enforced at the checkpoints.  “We would like to emphasize that the threat of hunger is as real as the threat of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the new coronavirus). I believe my colleagues in the task force agree with me on the matter, hence our unified call to conquer this threat by allowing free movement in the food value chain,” Dar said. “Our actual monitoring and projections in production show that we have enough (food supplies). We just need to move the supplies from their origins to areas where they are most needed,” he added.  According to the agriculture department’s price monitoring reports, prices of basic goods in Metro Manila public markets have risen by 5 percent to 46 percent, mainly affecting vegetables, fish and meat. For instance, a kilo of “bangus,” tilapia and “galunggong” went for P169, P125 and P190 on March 12. By March 21, however, the same fishes were priced at P177.50, P132 and P200 a kilo on the average. Vegetable prices have risen the highest. Ampalaya, “sitaw” and eggplant sold for P77, P75 and P56 a kilo on March 12. But by March 21, these vegetables were going for P94, P88 and P82 a kilo. Garlic, mostly imported from China, showed a 25-percent increase in price—to P350 from P280 a kilo during the same period. In an interview with the Inquirer, Rosendo So, chair of the Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura, said authorities at some checkpoints along the expressways had been cooperative in recent days, allowing food trucks through. But the problem comes after the truckers have delivered their cargoes and they turn around to leave Metro Manila.  “Some suppliers are refused passage at the checkpoints because their trucks are empty,” So said, adding that the suppliers had to explain to the authorities that their trucks were empty because they had already delivered their load to markets in the metropolis. In the worst cases, he said, the suppliers had to call the agriculture department for help. Local governments’ insistence on enforcing their own quarantine rules was blamed for the difficulties that 40 truck drivers and helpers went through at the Port of Masbate earlier this week. Port officials refused entry to 20 trucks carrying food and medical supplies because they came from coronavirus-wracked Metro Manila. The trucks left the Port of Pio Duran in Albay province on March 20 and arrived in Masbate the next day. But Masbate port officials, invoking a local lockdown order, refused to allow the trucks through, saying the drivers and helpers might be infected with the coronavirus. “We have gone past too many checkpoints, nearly 40, but we have been allowed through,” one of the drivers said. “But when we got here in Masbate, we weren’t allowed. they said we might be sick. They said we might be carrying the virus.” The driver said port officials told them their cargo could be unloaded at the port, but they could not go in. The truckers refused, saying they had to deliver the cargo in the city. The truckers returned to Pio Duran, where they stayed in their trucks for days because no one offered them shelter or food. They said they spent their own money to get food, but they didn’t have much and knew they would soon have nothing to eat. The interagency task force came to their rescue. Ernie Vera, the task force chair for Bicol, ordered Masbate Gov. Antonio Kho to comply with the quarantine guidelines on unrestricted movement of cargoes and allow the trucks to deliver their loads. The trucks were allowed into Masbate on Wednesday. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Local travel restrictions enforced at checkpoints have also been blamed for the fall in watermelon prices in Infanta town, Quezon province. “Normally our watermelon costs P20 a kilo. It is now P10 a kilo but still no buyers are coming,” Charlotte Sollano, a watermelon grower from Barangay Pinaglapatan, told the Inquirer in an interview on Wednesday. The problem, she said, is that most buyers are from “out of town” and they are refused entry at the checkpoints. In a post on her Facebook page, Sollano narrated the plight of watermelon growers in Infanta and appealed to the local government to allow buyers through so that the farmers could sell their produce. When reached for comment, Infanta Mayor Filipina Grace America said vehicles carrying food could come and go provided they had the necessary government documents to show at the checkpoints. The problem, she said, is that watermelon buyers are using public utility vehicles like jeepneys and tricycles to transport produce. These vehicles are banned during the quarantine. To help solve the growers’ problem, America said she would offer use of government vehicles to transport watermelon to out-of-town buyers and markets. Meanwhile, the agriculture department is asking for a larger supplemental budget to boost the Philippines’ food production following the tightening of world supplies due to the coronavirus pandemic. Dar said local farms must be expanded to increase production and ensure there would be no shortfalls in supplies of basic commodities. The agriculture department has proposed a supplemental budget of P32 billion. Among the plans is allocating P7 billion to boost the National Food Authority’s procurement budget to increase its rice reserves, P8.5 billion to improve rice production, and P10 billion to upgrade the department’s Kadiwa outlets. —With reports from Delfin T.

The company’s Uber Eats unit began the tests in San Diego with McDonald’s and plans to expand to other restaurants later this year.  Uber says the service should decrease food delivery times. It works this way: Workers at a restaurant load the meal into a drone and it takes off, tracked and guided by a new aerospace management system.  The drone then meets an Uber Eats driver at a drop-off location, and the driver will hand-deliver the meal to the customer. In the future, the company wants to land drones atop parked vehicles near delivery locations and secure them to the vehicle for the final mile of the delivery.  Last year Uber and the city of San Diego won a bid from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to test food delivery by air. “We’ve been working closely with the FAA to ensure that we’re meeting requirements and prioritizing safety,” Luke Fischer, head of flight operations at Uber Elevate, said in a statement Wednesday. The company said the knowledge it gains from the tests will help with Uber’s planned aerial ride-sharing network. Also Wednesday, Uber announced that it would work with Volvo Cars to build a vehicle that comes off the assembly line capable of driving autonomously. The ride-hailing company’s self-driving system will be installed in production versions of the Volvo XC90 SUV. The vehicle’s steering and braking systems are designed for computer rather than human control, including several backup systems for both steering and braking functions and battery backup power. If the primary systems fail, the backup system will immediately act to bring the car to a stop.  Various sensors will allow Uber’s self-driving system to safely operate and maneuver in urban areas, the company said. Uber and Volvo Cars partnered in September 2016. This is the third car they’ve developed together. Volvo says it plans to use a similar vehicle to introduce its own self-driving cars in the early 2020s. Uber made the announcement at its third-annual Uber Elevate Summit. The announcements came on a day with a lot of activity in autonomous vehicle technology. Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle company partly owned by Ford, announced that it would expand testing to Detroit. The company already is testing vehicles in Pittsburgh, Miami, Washington, D.C., Dearborn, Michigan, and Palo Alto, California. Argo had deployed third-generation test vehicles based on the Ford Fusion gas-electric hybrid in all of the cities. They get better sensors and software including higher-resolution radar and cameras. Volkswagen confirmed that it has cut ties with autonomous vehicle software and hardware developer Aurora Innovation Inc., which has offices in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. The German automaker is working on a tie-up with Ford that includes a partnership with Argo AI.

(Some LGUs are imposing strict measures to protect their residents but they have to think of the general situation)  Eleazar lamented that if essential goods like food will not reach markets in some areas, residents might resort to looting supermarkets and other establishments as food and other basic goods become scarce in their areas. “Remember ang iniiwasan natin… yung magkagulo at magkaroon ng looting. Bakit nagkakaroon ng looting? Ito ay dahil nagkakagutuman na ang ating bayan,” he said.  (Remember we are avoiding looting and other illegal activities. Why do we have looting? It is because our countrymen can get hungry) “Gusto nating iwasan yun para huwag magkaroon ng looting dapat hindi magkagulo ang ating bayan so ibig sabihin nun, lahat ng basic needs pati itong mga food makapunta sa mga lugar na kailangan nila,” he added. (We want to avoid all of these illegal acts, It is important that all basic needs reach areas that need them) Eleazar also reminded local government units to coordinate their action with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) during the ongoing Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine. Under the IATF guidelines, the movement of cargo and the delivery of basic goods such as food and to and from Luzon should be unhampered.

Every order will be secured with a tamper-evident seal to ensure the food is not touched after being packed in-store. In conjunction with the launch of nationwide delivery, Jollibee is also donating 5,000 meals to healthcare workers at hospitals across the country. Every delivery care package will include a ‘Note of Joy’ from customers to show thanks and appreciation for hospital workers’ dedication and service during the COVID-19 pandemic. “At Jollibee, it is part of our mission to spread joy, and during this time we want to bring it to those who need it most, our healthcare workers,” said Maribeth Dela Cruz, president of JFC North America, Philippine Brands. “We’re looking forward to providing more than just a meal, but the appreciation from people all over the country for everything those on the front-lines are doing, day and night, for our communities.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1378285/hard-times-for-mumbais-dabbawalas-one-of-the-worlds-best-lunch-delivery-systems-now-lacks-customers","title":"Hard times for Mumbai’s ‘dabbawalas’: One of the world’s best lunch delivery systems now lacks customers","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"KOLKATA — Many of Mumbai’s office workers and schoolchildren have had the privilege of enjoying fresh home-cooked food delivered to them daily by a faithful network of “dabbawalas”. It is a practice that is more than a century old.","body":"KOLKATA — Many of Mumbai’s office workers and schoolchildren have had the privilege of enjoying fresh home-cooked food delivered to them daily by a faithful network of “dabbawalas”. It is a practice that is more than a century old. These workers – easily identifiable by their trademark white uniforms and white sidecaps, or “Gandhi caps” – make up more than just a lunchbox delivery system today.  They are a tourist attraction and a cultural icon in Mumbai – India’s “Maximum City”. Tourists queue up to take selfies with them and foreign business schools yearn to study their efficient working model. But the Covid-19 pandemic cast a shadow over them and threw a spanner in the well-oiled and globally renowned dabbawala machinery.  Children have been studying online and most of the city’s office workers continue to work from home since March. The result: the decimation of the dabbawalas’ customer base.  Their bicycles, which ferried lunchboxes on the final leg of their journey, rust away at Mumbai’s local railway stations. “If our customers are still at home and schools shut, who do we deliver the dabbas (lunchboxes) to?” asked Mr Subhash Talekar, the president of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association. “Because of the pandemic, our 130-year-old effort has been reduced to zero.” To cope with this crisis, many dabbawalas returned to their villages to farm on their ancestral land. Others have taken up different professions in the city and become watchmen, rickshaw pullers or manual labourers. The truly unlucky ones have yet to find a job eight months since their work came to a standstill.  Mr Kailash Shinde, who has worked as a dabbawala for 22 years, has been unemployed since April. He and his family, which includes three children, have survived so far mostly on his wife’s earnings as a domestic helper and material assistance, such as food rations, that he and other dabbawalas receive from well-wishers in the city. But this arrangement does not promise succour for long and the hunt for a job has become more desperate in an economy still crippled by the pandemic. “I am willing to take up one that pays me even 10,000 rupees (S$181), but I am yet to find a job,” said Mr Shinde, who earned around 5,000 rupees more every month as a dabbawala. The pandemic’s whiplash has now compelled the dabbawalas to think of alternate survival strategies. For the first time in November, the dabbawalas took to ferrying something other than lunchboxes when the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association (MTBSA) began delivering fresh produce and groceries. “Because our customers currently do not require their dabbas, we are supplying them fruits, vegetables and groceries that they need daily to their homes instead,” said Mr Vishnu Kaldoke, the MTBSA’s spokesman. The organisation sources fresh produce from farmers’ groups and sells it directly in Mumbai at competitive prices. While there were more than 5,000 dabbawalas working in the city and its suburbs before the Covid-19 outbreak, delivering 200,000 lunchboxes daily and returning them to their homes, only around 450 are now engaged in the practice. This new arrangement to sell fresh produce and grocery items has allowed another 500 to get back on the road. MTBSA hopes this reinvention will help retain workers so that they can quickly switch to delivering lunchboxes when normal work resumes. It is also expected to cushion dabbawalas from any threat that may arise from a post-pandemic work-from-home culture. The origin of the dabbawalas is traced to a Parsi banker who longed for freshly home-cooked food at his office and engaged the first such individual to bring him his meals. The idea caught on quickly and an entrepreneurial Mahadeo Havaji Bachche tapped into this opportunity to start a lunch delivery service with around 100 employees. What began with simple colour coding meant to be easily understood by illiterate dabbawalas has evolved over the years to reflect their expanded coverage. Besides colour, it today incorporates numbers and letters to indicate the collection point, the train to be taken, and the final destination of the lunchbox. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); All this information is marked on the lid of the lunchbox, which can change hands as many as six times during its daily journey and even travel over 50km one way. Slip-ups are, however, rare. A 2010 study by the Harvard Business School found they make fewer than 3.4 mistakes per million deliveries and accorded the dabbawalas a coveted “Six Sigma” rating. Laurels such as this have ensured they remain an iconic Mumbai institution, one that has weathered cultural shifts such as the growing popularity of takeaway lunches and online food delivery services. Banking on this illustrious track record, the dabbawalas are now praying that the pandemic recedes, allowing the city to pick up its frenetic pace again and them to win back their lunchboxes. “We feel that as long as a mother’s love remains for her son, a sister’s love for her brother, a wife’s love for her husband, as long as the family structure is retained in Mumbai, food will be cooked at home and sent out,” said Mr Talekar. And until that changes, he added, dabbawalas will remain at the service of Mumbaikars. “I am hopeful. It is hope that sustains the world.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

Some stay indoors, bailing out food delivery guys who get duped by unscrupulous customers.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Not all heroes wear capes and fly. Some stay indoors, bailing out food delivery guys who get duped by unscrupulous customers. They call themselves “Order Heroes”—a sort of Avengers team of 220,000 netizens rescuing delivery guys from botched no-show orders. They’ve assembled themselves organically on Facebook since March 29, or midway into the monthlong lockdown imposed on the entire island of Luzon to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.  The government has suspended public transportation but allowed food and courier services like GrabFood/Express, Angkas Padala, Lalamove/LalaFood, and FoodPanda to help quarantined households get a hold of basic necessities without having to leave their homes. But apparently, even a global pandemic can’t stop mean-spirited customers from duping couriers like Ron. On April 2, he took an order for chicken and pasta worth P420 from a fast-food restaurant in Pasay City, only to get stood up by the customer.  “I’ve arrived at your doorstep,” he messaged the customer, which he posted on the Order Heroes page. “Please get it from me, I have another booking request to attend to.” When it became clear he’d been canceled on, he posted both the exchange and a photo of the food on the page.  Odessa Galicia, 28, messaged the courier. “He was in Pasay, and I lived in Quezon City, so obviously it wouldn’t be ideal for him to bring the food all the way here,” Galicia said. “It was hard enough being under the sun and lining up for the food. So I told him I would just deposit the amount in his bank account so he can eat the food instead.” Ron at first insisted that she get the order, but “I really didn’t want to burden him even more after that experience with the original customer. I told him to give it to his family instead,” Galicia said. Fake customers have long plagued service apps like Grab, especially when transactions are cash-on-delivery (meaning, paid upon arrival). Couriers usually pay for the food out of their own pockets, hoping that the customer on the other end won’t dupe them out of the deal. But it seems especially more sinister to prey on couriers now, when even just leaving the house means risking contracting the lethal coronavirus just so they can bring money home to their families, said Mary Ann Ortiz, the creator of the group.  “The time, the effort it takes to accept orders at a time when just going out could mean serious consequences—these are dire matters. And yet some people still find the time to deceive delivery guys by canceling or not showing up,” she said. “That can’t be right.” Ortiz and nine other people run Order Heroes, which has since rescued around 10 couriers as of this writing. The page began from a viral photo of a GrabFood courier crying at the gate of his customer’s house, forced to eat the food he had paid for. That courier, “Kuya Yenyen,” struck a chord with Ortiz. Thankfully, several people managed to trace and help him a day before Order Heroes was formed. Yenyen became a symbol for the group. Not all canceled orders were deliberate, Ortiz pointed out. Some were caused by an app glitch that disconnected the courier from the customer; others by a wrong pin. But far too many were simply no-shows. Ortiz and the other moderators’ main job is to vet whether a courier’s cry for help is legitimate. And there are ways to check that independently, she said. For one, the receipt on the app should show either Grab or the name of the customer itself as the intended recipient of the order. If it’s the courier’s name that appears on the invoice, she said, “then that’s automatically a red flag.” Another is whether the exchanges between the supposed customer was via GrabChat (the internal messaging application on Grab) or text messages. That was how they were able to catch one courier asking for help from the group on April 1. He claimed to have been played a nasty April Fools’ joke by a customer, who supposedly texted him, “Bahala ka diyan, kainin mo yang inorder mo! (It’s yours. Eat it yourself!)” It was a particularly cruel exchange, Ortiz recalled, so they even boosted the signal of that courier’s call. But one of their moderators—an actual Grab courier—flagged him on two things: he had no receipt, and the messages were carried out via text, not GrabChat. That post had since been taken down. “We really acted fast. We even alerted everyone who commented on the post,” Ortiz said. “We blocked every possible means of that [courier] profiting off Order Heroes.” Overall, however, the group has done spectacularly well in linking couriers with willing customers. This even prompted Grab and FoodPanda to issue separate statements thanking the group indirectly for “rescuing” their couriers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); On Grab’s part, it assured its couriers of a reimbursement option in case of no-show customers. “Rest assured that there are corresponding penalties for [these] customers as well,” Grab said. For Ortiz, the goal is not to keep saving couriers from their misery but to prompt delivery apps to protect their own, “by changing the system into something where their [couriers] are not compromised.” “Until there is no significant move or change from the apps themselves, I think we’ll keep this group up and running,” she said. “We want to make a difference for the welfare of [these couriers].”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/286827/grabfood-launches-its-first-shared-kitchen-in-singapore","title":"GrabFood launches its first shared kitchen in Singapore","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SINGAPORE — GrabFood has become the latest food delivery operator to launch a kitchen space housing multiple restaurant brands, turning the heat up on competition among Singapore’s three major food delivery services.","body":"SINGAPORE — GrabFood has become the latest food delivery operator to launch a kitchen space housing multiple restaurant brands, turning the heat up on competition among Singapore’s three major food delivery services. Residents in the Upper Bukit Timah, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak areas can now order food items from more than 10 brands, including Wolf Burgers and PlayMade, in a single order through the app. Orders can also be made for pick-up or consumption in the kitchen’s dine-in area in Hillview.  Deliveroo and Foodpanda already operate their own shared kitchen spaces, also known as ghost or cloud kitchens, in Singapore. The concept has been catching fire as demand for food delivery grows and eateries use it as a way to expand or create new brands without the costs of setting up a dine-in establishment. Former Grab Singapore head Lim Kell Jay, who now heads GrabFood’s regional operations, said at a media briefing on Wednesday (Jan 8) that the GrabKitchen launch in Singapore brings its network of cloud kitchens to 50 across five countries in the Southeast Asian region.  There are plans to open more kitchens in the coming year, he said, but did not disclose how many are in the pipeline. More services for merchants, such as a bulk procurement platform for kitchen supplies and ingredients, will also be rolled out this year.  GrabFood, which is in seven countries, saw more than five times’ growth in gross merchandise value and a 173 percent increase in active users last year, Mr Lim said. The launch of the first GrabKitchen here comes amid an ongoing investigation by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) into the online food delivery and virtual kitchen sectors. The investigation, announced in October last year, was prompted by a shared kitchen operator’s complaint that it had been shut out by Deliveroo and GrabFood. Smart City Kitchens (SCK), which is linked to ousted Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, opened a 13,000 sq ft facility in Tampines in June, touting itself as the first operator here to be unaffiliated to a delivery service. Tenants said the two delivery services had blocked them from listing on their platforms. GrabFood Singapore head Dilip Roussenaly said on Wednesday that while GrabFood is contributing to the investigation process, it is not the subject of the investigation.  “We started not too long ago to work with some of the merchants out of SCK in the East. The main reason is we want to support merchants regardless of where they are,” said Mr Roussenaly. GrabFood did not comment on the cost of the 6,000 sq ft kitchen space or its commercial arrangements with businesses renting the space, but said that it does not enforce exclusivity agreements and tenants are free to work with competitors. Mr Ian Lin, who operates three restaurant brands out of a 17 sq m kitchen unit in the industrial building, said he took the opportunity to create his first delivery-only brand, Lady Boss Mala, to cater to demand in the area. His other two eateries – Thai Dynasty and Bowl and Grill – have units in foodcourts here. “Signage in a foodcourt alone can cost $3,000, and manpower is another big point of savings,” Mr Lin said of his decision to join GrabKitchen. “The bulk procurement platform would be a useful option too because it’s no secret that in food and beverage, the margins are thin, so anything that can help to reduce operational costs is good.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/293913/spending-slows-purchases-more-on-food-health-items","title":"Spending slows; purchases more on food, health items","date":"05:16 AM April 02, 2020","snippet":"The lockdown of Luzon amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to take a heavy toll on the consumer and retail sectors, but higher food, beve­rage and health spending can help shore up overall household spending for the full year, think tank Fitch Solutions said.","body":"The lockdown of Luzon amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to take a heavy toll on the consumer and retail sectors, but higher food, beve­rage and health spending can help shore up overall household spending for the full year, think tank Fitch Solutions said. In a research note dated March 31, Fitch Solutions said it was expecting consumer spending in the Philippines to grow at a slower pace of 6.7 percent this year, down from 9.8 percent last year and the original growth forecast for the year of 7 percent set prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.  “As we have seen in China and South Korea, as well as our predictions for consumer spen­ding outlooks in UK, Italy and Malaysia, we believe that consumers will increase their purchases of food and drink from groceries and supermarkets as the lockdown forces them to cook at home,” Fitch Solutions said. This can be in the form of purchases from supermarkets like SM Supermarkets, Robin­sons, Metro, All Day Supermarket—which are allowed to remain open, as part of essential services—or from online delivery platforms that deliver mostly grocery products, such as MetroMart, Lazmart, The Green Grocer, PushKart, the research said.  Consumer purchases can also be via delivery platforms that deliver specific goods like Pacific Bay (seafood), The Ve­gan Grocer (vegan food), Ge­rald (baked goods) and Boozy (alcohol), it added. Fitch also expects more over-the-counter medication sales, with consumers seeking medicine and health-related purchases during the pandemic.  On the other hand, Fitch Solutions has a grim outlook on the following consumer cate­gories: clothing and footwear, furnishing, transport, recreation and culture and restaurant and hotels. “[Metro] Manila has ordered that restaurants stop serving dine in customers, and hotels have not been allowed to accept new bookings for foreigners since March 17, it is therefore not surprising that we expect spending in these categories to decline. How­ever, we note that there may be some possible cushioning to this outlook for restaurants and hotels as restaurants are still able to serve takeout or food delivery customers,” the research said. The research noted that there were at least 50 restaurants and restaurant chains, such as Dominoes, The Sandwich Guy, Bonchon, Saboten—mostly in the urban metropolitan areas—still actively advertising takeout or food delivery services. It no­ted that fast-food giant Jollibee had even gone one step further, offering to deliver ready-to-cook items. Hotels, on the other hand, are now seen to cater to Filipinos returning from overseas who are required to spend a period of time in quarantine. “Given the monthlong lockdown on nonessential busines­ses, retail shops (such as clo­thing, home, electronics) will suffer, as they lose out on an entire month’s worth of sales revenue. However, some retai­lers may be still able to generate some amount of sales if they can get onto grocery delivery platforms. Items from Toy Kingdom and National Bookstore, for example, are able to be delivered together with Metro Mart purchases,” the research said.  The research noted that Luzon was home to over 50 percent of the country’s population and was responsible for 73 percent of the country’s total economic output. “The lockdowns are currently scheduled to remain in place until April 12, but could be extended, given initial difficulties implementing the measures and confusion over what restrictions were in place. However, in their current state, the lockdowns have been quite drastic, with strict quarantine, suspension of public transport, school closures, bans on foreign tourists, and shuttering of nonessential businesses (any business not provi­ding basic necessities like food, medicine, power, credit, water and telecommunications),” according to the research."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/313424/cebuana-creates-fb-group-to-help-stood-up-food-delivery-drivers","title":"Cebuana creates FB group to help ‘stood up’ food-delivery drivers","date":"May 27,2020 - 10:36 AM","snippet":"","body":"MOALBOAL, Cebu — A netizen from Lapu-Lapu City came up with an initiative to help food-delivery drivers who experienced being stood up by their customers.

The launch of this new business format is part of the P7-billion global business restructuring mapped out by Jollibee to cope with what could be a prolonged fallout from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  Situated in Chicago’s bustling River North neighborhood, Jollibee Chicago River North Cloud Kitchen is a fully equipped kitchen focused exclusively on fulfilling delivery and pick-up orders launched at this time that many consumers around the world are forced to stay at home. The new format allows the brand to reach consumers in high-density metro areas quickly and efficiently during its 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily operating hours.  The River North cloud kitchen, which opened on June 18, added to Jollibee’s existing footprint in the Chicago area, where it also operates stores in Skokie and on Elston Avenue. It is seen to make Jollibee more accessible to consumers from major Metro Chicago neighborhoods, including River North, Lincoln Park, The Loop and Chinatown. “We are very excited for the milestone launch of Jollibee’s first-ever cloud kitchen in a prime Chicago location,” Maribeth Dela Cruz, president of JFC North America-Philippine brands, said in a recent statement.  “Thanks to the unique cloud kitchen format of this new location, we are able to adapt to the current difficult environment of the pandemic while still growing our delivery capability and our off-premise business in a key market. Now, Metro Chicagoans will be able to experience the joy of our signature offerings from the comfort and safety of their own homes,” she said. This new outlet will operate out of the Kitchen United outpost in River North, located at 831 N Sedgwick St., Chicago, IL, 60610. Kitchen United is a leading innovator in the cloud kitchen space in cities throughout the United States, providing space to help restaurants like Jollibee grow revenues by entering new markets and offering offsite services without heavy capital outlays. Earlier, Jollibee launched its food delivery business in the United States and Canada via tech platform DoorDash. As Asia’s most valuable restaurant chain braces for poor earnings performance this 2020, it intends to streamline nonperforming stores and beef up delivery, take-out and drive-through services across its businesses around the world, most importantly in its largest markets—the Philippines, China and North America. The expense provision for this transformation—which assumes that the world will not quickly revert to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period—is being set up in the second quarter of 2020 and will be incurred mostly within the year.  The planned changes will include the rationalization of the number of restaurants within certain geography or area, rationalization of resources deployed in the restaurants, implementation of safety and social distancing protocol in the dining area, investment in digital commerce and technology, increase in the capacity for delivery-to-home and office, take out and drive through, installation of mobile applications to facilitate food ordering and payment, the establishment of cloud kitchens and the rationalization of production and distribution facilities. As of end-April, JFC had a global network of 5,945 stores, of which 3,317 were in the Philippines. INQ"}]}
