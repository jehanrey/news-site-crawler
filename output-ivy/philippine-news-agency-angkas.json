Umpisahan muna natin sa mga kawani ng gobyerno at kami dito sa DILG ay sinubukan na namin yung mag register sa StaySafe. Yung PNP (Philippine National Police) rin ay nag-rollout na rin sila kahapon (By next month, we will roll out this in the entire country. We will start with government employees and we in the DILG already tried to register to StaySafe. The PNP has started its rollout among personnel yesterday (Wednesday), ” saidUndersecretary Bernardo Florece, DILG Officer in Charge, in a virtual Palace briefing. Florece said the app is an effective tool for contact tracing nationwide to ensure consistent and unified contact tracing reporting. He said utilizing the StaySafe.Ph app will make it easier for government authorities and medical experts to keep track of the cases all over the country and carry out decisive actions to stem the rapid transmission of coronavirus. “The importance of this is for you to be notified, for instance, when you are close to somebody who tested positive for Covid-19 upon entering a restaurant. Once the QR (quick response) code is scanned and you are registered, you will be notified because StaySafe is linked to the Covid-19 repository system of the DOH and it contains information on Covid-19 cases, as well as those who have symptoms or asymptomatic,” he explained. The DILG aims to reach at least 50 million users and connect all 1,634 local government units (LGUs) across the country. It also assured the public that the StaySafe app will not be used for surveillance because it does not use a global positioning system. Instead, it uses bluetooth technology through the Google Apple Exposure Notification System( GAENS). Designed to aid in the management of Covid-19 cases by reminding people to maintain physical distance, as well as recording and monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, StaySafe.PH was developed by Multisys Technologies Corporation in collaboration with PLDT-Smart Group and PLDT Enterprise and the Interagency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) and the National Task Force on Covid-19. Among the LGUs now using this app are Caloocan, Muntinlupa, and other local governments in Metro Manila. It is also being used now by top companies like SM Supermalls, McDonald's, Jollibee Foods Corporation, Alliance Global which includes Megaworld Corporation, Union Bank, Yuchengco Group of Companies including RCBC Bank, Filinvest, JG Summit which handles Robinsons Malls, Metrobank, Resto.ph, and Angkas. In April 2020, the National Task Force on Covid-19 signed a memorandum of agreement with Multisys Technologies Corporation adopting StaySafe.Ph app as the country’s official contact tracing, health condition reporting, and social distancing system. Contact tracers Meanwhile, Florece said the hiring of an additional 4,754 contact tracers will help boost Metro Manila's current pool of 10,097 contact tracers. He, however, said this is still short of the ideal number of contact tracers which is 17,000, following the ideal ratio of one contact tracer for every 800 population. He said the government is accepting new applicants for contact tracers to boost the country’s contact tracing efforts. Under the new set-up, the DILG official noted that from the previous college graduate or at least second-year college-level requirement, even high school graduates can now apply as contact tracers with the informal sector workers in Manila being targeted as beneficiaries. “But of course, we prefer (applicants) with relevant experience. Yung marunong man lang mag-interview at naging ahente (those who know how to conduct interviews and were sales personnel (in previous jobs),’’ he added. The DILG official disclosed that contact tracing applicants should submit their letter of applications (letter of intent), personal data sheet (PDS), and barangay resident certificate. Contact tracer applicants must be residents in the areas where they filed their applications. The contact tracers will be hired through the Department of Labor and Employment's Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD) program.

In a statement, Angkas urged its passengers to bring their own helmet and passenger shield when booking a ride. It also said that its riders now accept cashless payments such as e-cash, credit, and debit, among others. In December 2020, the Metro Cebu Motorcycle-Taxi Technical Working Group (TWG) Inspection Team for the Visayas checked on the facilities of Angkas to look into its compliance with the rules of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. After the inspection, the TWG forwarded its report to its central office for review. Angkas noted its services are back after rigorous testing and consultation with the government and the UP College of Public Health. The firm has ensured that its bikers are trained to be extra careful in handling passengers during these times, following the government protocol for backriding. “To minimize the spread of Covid-19, Angkas will not be allowed to provide passengers with helmets. You will be required to bring your own helmet that complies with the guidelines below,” it said. Angkas said its bikers are regularly tested for Covid-19. “In partnership with the IATF, our bikers are tested before they’re allowed to ferry passengers again. Our app also requires them to submit daily temperature and sanitation checks before the start of the work day,” it said.

The PRC started conducting Covid-19 swab tests in April 2020, processing an average of 9,000 samples per day nationwide. The organization hit the 1-million mark six months later in October 2020. The 2-million milestone by 13 PRC molecular laboratories nationwide accounts for 24 percent of the country’s output, and for about 37 percent of testing in National Capital Region. In the first two months of 2021 alone, the PRC has also started rolling out the cheaper, non-invasive, but accurate saliva RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests in their laboratories, and in drive-thru collection sites in malls all over the country. Soon, home collection of saliva samples will also be available through Angkas bikers so that more people can avail of the tests while staying safe in their homes. “The Philippine Red Cross remains committed to saving lives and alleviating human suffering. I thank all the researchers, medical technologists, staff, and volunteers who continue to hold our first line of defense against our unseen yet unforgiving enemy,” Gordon said. But the PRC Chair also stressed that this should not be a cause for celebration, but “a reminder that we still have to be aggressive in testing, tracing, and treating the virus.” “We need to detect the virus and keep its spread at bay early on, so we can safely return to work, go back to school, and restart our lives,” he added. Public health specialist Dr. Susan Mercado also emphasized the importance of testing, stating that: “Testing is always going to be a pillar or foundation of disease control.” Both swab and saliva RT-PCR tests are available for booking at the PRC official website, https://book.redcross.org.ph/. The PRC Helpline 1158 is also operational 24/7 to address concerns related to Covid-19.

Every minute matters in life-saving and having quick access through the use of motorcycles and a network of trained volunteers will make a great difference,” PRC chairman and Senator Richard Gordon said in a press release Wednesday. A ceremonial signing of the memorandum of agreement will be held at the PRC Logistics and Multipurpose Center (PLMC) on Feb. 24, 2021. The event will be attended by Gordon, Secretary-General Elizabeth Zavalla, Assistant Secretary-General for Programs and Services Christie Nalupta, and representatives from Angkas, chief transport advocate and co-founder George Royeca, and the head of operations David Medrana. “We are greatly honored about our new partnership with the Philippine Red Cross (PRC), which will enable us to contribute even more to our country’s nation-building in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is congruent with our commitment to always be of support to the country and to be of service to the Filipinos,” Royeca said. The partnership includes the PRC membership program enrolment of all Angkas riders, employees, and family members. In line with this, Angkas riders will also become volunteers under the Red Cross 143 program. The Angkas riders will receive first aid and CPR training, which will enable them to respond to road accidents and give immediate help, becoming emergency responders on the road even during disasters. As PRC expands its sample collection sites in different malls, Angkas riders will be trained to do home service for saliva testing, making Covid-19 testing faster, more convenient, and accessible to those who are unable to leave their homes. “This development underscores the importance that we put in safeguarding the health, welfare, and safety of our partner bikers and the riding public. We are proud to partner with the premier global humanitarian organization that is the PRC for their proven quality life-saving services that protect the wellbeing, life, and dignity of every person, most especially in times of national disasters and medical emergencies such as this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” Royeca said.

Angkas and Joyride, the two other companies included in the pilot program, were each given their certificate of compliance last Monday. On November 24, both Angkas and Joyride were each issued a provisional authority to resume operation several months after the operation of MC taxis were suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On November 9, the IATF-EID released the guidelines for the operation of MC taxis which include the implementation of cashless payments, requiring passengers to bring their own helmet with a visor in lieu of a face shield, among others.

Aminoden Guro, LTFRB-10 regional director, said a technical working group (TWG) created to look into Angkas’ application has recommended that the firm should seek approval from the local government before it is allowed to return to the streets. The TWG is composed of LTFRB-10, Land Transportation Office-10, Cagayan de Oro City Police Office, Traffic Management Group, Highway Patrol Group, and Roads and Traffic Administration. Guro said the TWG has discussed how Angkas could resume operations in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has earlier green-lighted Angkas to resume its operation, upon the recommendation from the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) in November. The agency has allowed Angkas and other motorcycle-hailing firms MoveIt and Joyride to operate in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and in this city. In this city, each player is permitted to operate a maximum of 3,000 units or a total of 9,000 motorcycles. So far, only Angkas has applied for a permit to operate here with at least 804 units, as of February this year. Angkas was supposed to officially start ferrying passengers early this year here but it did not push through after President Rodrigo Duterte declared a nationwide health emergency following the increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the country in March. Guro said among the factors that the TWG is studying is the use of a protective barrier between the driver and his pillion, and the requirement of passengers to use their own helmets. He said this is to keep in mind the threat of the coronavirus which could be transmitted from person to person. Meanwhile, city councilor Romeo Calizo, chairman of public order and safety, and roads and traffic management said the city government must discuss Angkas’ application with experts so aspects such as traffic congestion and pollution could be given consideration. “We must also consider the restrictions set by the DILG so we will know which provisions of the local IATF we need to comply,” he said. Calizo said his committee is concerned with the safety of both riders and passengers as he noted that most road accidents involve motorcycles. City councilor George Goking, chair of the trade and commerce committee, said he welcomes the operation of Angkas and other groups to give the riding public cheaper option. “We want to have a cheaper mode of transportation for our people, so they will have a better choice,” Goking said. Jerome Angcolo, Angkas city manager for Cagayan de Oro, said they are targeting to go back on the road within the month. He said their application’s status is “pending since there are documents and processes we need to comply first before we can resume our operation here in Cagayan de Oro.” When pressed further, Angcolo did not elaborate, although he said they are hopeful they can operate again. In previous interviews, Angeline Tham, Angkas chief executive officer, has assured that the company has complied with all the requirements set by the DOTr.

Roque earlier said motorcycle taxi service providers like Angkas will need to acquire a resolution from Congress before they can resume operations.

Libiran said the TWG would release an update for the return of motorcycle taxis by “early next week”. “We will be ready to implement the IATF-EID decision anytime we receive the minimum health standards/guidelines from the National Task Force for Covid-19,” Libiran said.

One may be on top today but at the bottom tomorrow. Who would have thought that wheels could lead people to a journey leading to better lives despite a crisis?  For Mark Pamuti, making ends meet is barely possible until he became a member of the Active Riders Passenger Group (ARPG), \"Dati, kung saan saan lang kami nakikikain ng anak ko, pero ngayon napapakain ko na ng masarap ang anak ko (Before, my son and I don't know where we would get something to eat. But now, I am able to feed him something delicious),\" he told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in an interview over the weekend.ARPG was initially established in 2018, with the main purpose of conducting charity rides, and for people to meet new friends with common interests during long rides. Jane Tomon, ARPG Cavite chapter head, created a Facebook page for this group, with about 30 members.  More meaningful journeys began at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Tomon renamed the page to \"Angkas at Padala 24/7 (Cavite)\", where the community could tap the riders' services to do errands for them. \"The group suddenly reached more than 5,000 members during the pandemic because many got laid off. When we had a total lockdown and were placed under the enhanced community quarantine, people had no choice but to find strategies (to earn a living),\" Tomon told PNA. As of writing, the page has 129,246 members consisting of riders and customers.As delivery and errand services boomed during the health crisis, the ARPG was able to help the riders, as well as save small restaurants from closing, she added.Tomon shared that while some riders were able to go back to work, many are still jobless since many companies have either closed down or downsized their manpower.  Pamuti, who raises his 11-year-old son alone, was unemployed and had taken side jobs in order to get by.His life changed when he joined ARPG. It was also via its Facebook page that he met his current partner, whom he said was his former customer. He had catered to many customers during the pandemic and was able to save money that he also used to pay for his motorcycle. \"I am thankful to Ma'am Jane Tomon. Because of the ARPG 24/7 page, I am now able to feed delicious food to my son, as well as buy the things he wants like PS4, pay for his studies,\" Pamuti said.  Crossroads  There was a point when Joseph Peñaranda saw his life as a mess. It came to a point when he only had PHP2,500, weighing the pros and cons of risking PHP2,000 so he could offer services via the said Facebook page. Riders need money as an advance payment for the items that customers would ask them to purchase. That would also mean they are taking the risk of encountering bogus customers. \"I prayed to God and left PHP500 to my wife. I told her that if I lose, at least we still have PHP500,\" Peñaranda said. Everything went well, and Peñaranda was able to shoulder his wife's monthly check-up and childbirth. Now, he is grateful and considers himself blessed. Because of this, Peñaranda tries to give back by giving some groceries and rice to the needy.  \"Covid-19 is just testing us, to make us realize that we could do good and make others smile,\" he said.   Ariel Lagda, an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) for nine years, came home with his OFW wife in March, but they were not able to go back abroad. \"We came home from Dubai, but there was a lockdown (here) and we were not able to go back. A friend suggested me to join the ARPG to have an income,\" he said. Joining the ARPG has helped him a lot financially, saying that this has been an avenue for him to pay for his bills and daily expenses.\"My wife who was an OFW for 18 years, and I, have no source of income during the lockdown,\" Lagda recalled. Among the struggles he faced were the weather condition in the Philippines, as well as some nasty customers.  \"The rains, and sometimes too much warm weather conditions, were challenging. There were customers who have canceled their orders when I was already in their location,\" he said. Like Lagda, Nhie Ortiz also had to deal with bogus buyers, but would like to tell his fellow riders to persevere, as there is God who continuously guide them. Ortiz said he was a former supervisor at a Chinese KTV in Makati, and now earns about PHP500 a day through the ARPG services. Arnold Samalea lost his job at the store where he previously worked as a kitchen staff. Joining the ARPG enabled Samalea to help his family and to get by since this is also where he gets the money for his daily expenses.  A former sales associate, John Patrick Camacho found himself earning at least PHP500 daily from legitimate customers.  \"It helps me to earn a living, without having to pay for anything,\" he said. Camacho wanted his fellow riders to strive harder amid the pandemic.\"Have dedication and think of those who will benefit from your earnings,\" he said. A father of two, Ian Jancel Paquiran is another grateful former employee, who now gets his daily income from being a rider.\"Be fair and be polite at all times,\" he tells fellow riders.  Safety first To ensure customers' safety, valid IDs, barangay clearance, and NBI clearance are required to become an ARPG member. \"Just like in the services apps, we do not tolerate if (the riders) committed mistakes or if there are customer complaints. We investigate and take the necessary actions,\" Tomon said. Interested individuals also need to attend a seminar to become a member. “They don't have to pay for anything. Everyone is welcome to join, and we endorse them to ARPG chapters near them,\" Tomon shared, adding that the ARPG has 23 chapters nationwide.  Aside from offering errand services, the group also holds various charity activities, all by using the members' own money, according to Tomon.      She does not get any monetary amount from organizing the group and the Facebook page.\"Many of the members are my friends, and our interests are mainly in charity rides and long rides,\" shared Tomon, who's into tax services. Thousands have already benefited from the page -- from asking riders to buy medicines, milk and diapers late at night, do the groceries for them, have their products and documents reach other destinations, to ordering their meals and cravings. What seemed quite impossible to avail of during a community quarantine became so reachable because of the riders' help.

National Policy against Covid-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Thursday said members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) and the National Task Force on Covid-19 met with President Rodrigo Duterte to discuss the increase in the operation of public utility vehicles and allow ride-hailing motorcycle companies to resume ride-booking services. \"The recommendation [was] to ensure adequate mass transportation for health workers and general workers as we open up more economy and to empower citizens to regain their livelihood and sustainable incomes,\" Galvez said during the virtual launching of the \"Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat\" campaign. Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque also mentioned that the IATF has already endorsed the resumption of the Angkas' operation. \"We also welcome the further contributions on how to improve the transportation sector,\" Roque said, as he cited various assistance offered by the private sector to the government in order to respond to the pandemic. \"I think that would be something that can be agreed upon on the basis of consensus in the upcoming full Cabinet meeting,\" Roque said, referring to the government's plan to improve public transportation amid the pandemic. Public-private partnership On the other hand, Galvez vowed that the government will continue supporting the businesses as the country gradually shifts to the new normal. Galvez said the private sector and various businesses have helped the government deal with the unprecedented challenges posed by the health crisis. He also cited the huge contribution of the private sector to the government's efforts to ramp up the country's testing capacity and treating capability, including the PHP2 million worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) sets donation, which he said helped secure the safety of medical professionals and other healthcare workers. \"As we enter the third phase of the national action plan against Covid-19, the government will be banking again (on) the continued support (of) the business community -- as we shift towards the full opening of our economy -- as we have emphasized from time to time, we cannot afford to let our guard down at this crucial stage,\" Galvez said. The chief implementer said the launching of the Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat campaign is \"timely and very crucial\" in the country's battle against the dreaded virus. \"This initiative will enable us to harness the bayanihan spirit between public and private sector in rebuilding our economy,\" Galvez said. \"It is very important for the national government, private sector, and the local government units to work together as a team, as we revive our economy by being mindful of health safety.\" Galvez assured that the government will work double-time to implement all necessary strategies in order to bring down the number of Covid-19 active and new cases on the ground. \"This is to ensure and allow our economy to fully recover 100 percent,\" he said. Further, Galvez reiterated that the public should not be complacent. \"Although there are very good signs that the Covid-19 curve is flattening and the cases are steadily declining, particularly in the NCR [National Capital Region], we cannot afford to let our guard down, we cannot be complacent at this crucial time,\" he said. \"We really need the support of the private sector to educate our people.\" The “Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat” campaign is a collective initiative by some of the biggest corporations and brands across various industries in the country. It was also established to encourage various businesses to prioritize health and safety while expanding their operations.

The launch, which was done in the city of Manila, received commitment from the private sector to partner with the national government in its response against the pandemic. Some 11 companies, including SM Supermalls, McDonalds, Jollibee Foods Corporation, Alliance Global which includes Megaworld Corporation, Union Bank, Yuchengo Group of Companies including RCBC Bank, Filinvest, JG Summit which handles Robinsons Malls, Metrobank, Resto.ph, and Angkas expressed support in collaborating with the government. Citing that the application will effectively trace Covid-19 close contacts and warn the public on “nearby danger”, they hope that this will also help the country push economic reopening. Through the app, Steven Tan of SM Supermalls said everyone will now have the power to help one another stay safe. He said they did not hesitate to answer the call for support as soon as they heard of the initiative. Tan said it is “our civic duty to our country in this challenging times. It is also part of our ongoing responsibility to help our people, our tenants and the customers stay safe even as we help gradually restart the economy”. Prioritizing safety of their food and the public as well, McDonalds Philippines President and CEO Kenneth Yang said the company pledges full support to the national government and the use of this new contact tracing app. “At McDonalds, we have established the M safe campaign and our priority is to keep our employee safe because if we keep our employee safe, we know we can keep our customers safe,” he said. Currently, Yang said restaurants ask customers to fill out handwritten health declaration forms which are tedious and not really effective, believing that the new app will be a better contact tracing tool for everyone. Jollibee Foods Corporation also expressed excitement to join and support the government, according to its group president, Pepot Minana. “Our top priority is the safety of our customers and our employees and so it actually says exactly what we want, that everybody should stay safe,” he said. The companies said that through the public and the private sector collaboration, the country will be able to better fight Covid-19. They added that the launch sends an important message of speaking one language and having a unified effort in becoming more effective in stemming the transmission of the disease. Heads of these big companies also expressed appreciation to the national government, including the people behind the staysafe.ph application, for inviting them to participate in the initiative. The national government, meanwhile, recognized that fighting the pandemic cannot be done by the government alone, and that the public and the private companies' commitment to help is a big factor in containing and delaying the spread of Covid-19.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said members of NTF Covid-19 met on Tuesday night and agreed to consider the recommendations of Metro Manila’s local chief executives to impose a stricter form of GCQ that was initially implemented in June. “There was an NTF meeting and we considered the recommendations of the mayors to actually impose stricter GCQ because when we consulted the mayors, they were in agreement that it should be GCQ but it should be of a strict type similar to what was imposed in June when we imposed GCQ,” Roque said in an interview with CNN Philippines’ The Source. The latest move means that the newest guidelines on the implementation of nationwide community quarantine issued in July have been effectively tweaked. Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Nueva Ecija, and Batangas have been placed under GCQ until August 31. Also under GCQ are the cities of Iloilo, Cebu, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, and Talisay, as well as the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu province. Roque said the implementation of “localized and granular” lockdowns in areas under GCQ would be “aggressively” pursued. “While we have imposed GCQ, we will follow strict, localized, or granular lockdown,” he said. Roque said the NTF Covid-19 has also agreed that mass gatherings, including religious services, in GCQ zones must be strictly limited to “only 10 persons.” “That means it is no longer the case that religious gathering is allowed up to 10 or 10 percent of the capacity. It is now only 10 people strictly,” he said. Roque also said the operations of gyms, internet cafes, review and tutorial centers would be suspended amid the implementation of GCQ. Restaurants and salons located in areas where GCQ is imposed can operate but the capacity of their customers would be determined by local government units (LGUs), Roque said. “We leave it now to the LGUs to determine the capacity of dine-in, as well as the salon because that’s what the mayors asked — to have more discretion in opening sensitive industries and businesses,” he said. Roque added that back ride is allowed in places under GCQ, so long as the driver and the passenger share the same address. “They’re not required to wear the barriers. However, they are still required to wear a helmet, face mask, and face shield. If they are of different addresses, then they will have the angkas-side barrier. But in any case, only private motorcycles are allowed,” Roque said. Roque also noted that the “unified” curfew hours in areas under GCQ is now back from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. LGUs can also issue quarantine passes in places put under GCQ, he said. “Needless to say, in areas that are covered by localized or granular lockdowns, quarantine passes are a must,” Roque said.

Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, said on Wednesday. Eleazar made the announcement after the National Task Force (NTF) on the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) approved the transition protocol on motorcycle back riding that would be implemented starting August 19. “But they have to show proof, either identification card, certification from the barangay, or any document showing that both the rider and the back rider have the same address to avoid being apprehended and cited for violation of the rules on pillion riding,” he said in a statement sent to reporters. Under the protocol, riders not living in the same house must have a barrier similar to the one designed by the ride-hailing firm Angkas and the back rider must be an authorized person outside residence (APOR). The driver may or may not be an APOR and the motorcycle must be privately owned and not for hire. Eleazar clarified that motorcycle barriers would remain as a requirement for drivers and back riders who are not living in the same house, even if they are relatives. Based on health protocols, both riders should wear face masks and full-face helmets \"that must be worn all the time while back riding.\" Meanwhile, in areas under modified GCQ, local government units have the sole authority to implement the guidelines based on their situation. The lifting of some restrictions on motorcycle pillion riding is proof that the NTF has been heeding the concerns and suggestions of the public, he said. “As what Secretary of the Interior and Local Government Eduardo Año repeatedly said in the past, we will try to normalize the motorcycle pillion riding but this should be done gradually to prevent abuses by some hard-headed riders,” Eleazar said. Based on data from JTF Covid Shield, a total of 57,973 motorcycle riders were warned and cited for violation of the rules on pillion riding since motorcycle back riding was allowed from July 10 until August 18. Aside from Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan, he said the same rules on motorcycle pillion riding would apply in other areas under GCQ, among them Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Quezon, Iloilo City, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City, Mandaue City, Talisay City, and the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu province. Eleazar said those who have already bought the motorcycle barriers have the option to use them even if they back ride with their spouses, partners, and other family members who live in the same house. “Although it is no longer required, the use of the prescribed barrier is still advised because what we are preventing here is mass infection within the family. Once one family member is infected, it is usually certain that the rest of the family members would suffer. So we advise motorcycle riders to still take precautionary measures,” he added.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and task force chief, Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar received the motorcycle barriers from Angkas head transport advocate George Royeca in a simple ceremony in Camp Crame, Quezon City “This benevolent act of the Angkas Group led by Mr. George Royeca is a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic,” Eleazar said. In coordination with Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, Eleazar said the motorcycle barriers will be given to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified motorcycle drivers. He added that they will give priority to motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives and friends who work as medical front-liners. “With this initiative, we are honored of this opportunity for your JTF Covid Shield to effectively shield both motorcycle drivers and their back-riders from possible coronavirus infection because this is who we are, this is what we are mandated to do, and this is the frontline that we must hold and defend to eventually protect as many Filipino people from the coronavirus disease 2019,” he added. Meanwhile, based on the agreement between the JTF Covid Shield and Angkas, 1,000 Angkas riders would be deployed near hospitals identified by the Department of Health to provide free rides to health workers attending to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, particularly the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; the East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and the Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Some Angkas riders will also be placed on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City; and, Ospital ng Maynila as well as Fabella Hospital in Manila. Medical workers who are on their way home could approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of free rides on their way back to their respective places of residence. “This endeavor will ensure that our medical front-liners can perform their tasks and not be hampered by lack of transportations on their way for work, and back home,” Eleazar added. Meanwhile, Año defended anew the government's motorcycle barrier policy. He said those who continue to criticize have nothing better to suggest, adding that waiving the requirement could result in the greater number of people being infected by Covid-19. While admitting that some of them might be experts in motorcycle riding or operations, Año said they should study first pandemics before protesting. The barrier requirement drew flak from motorcycle groups who cited the aspect of aerodynamics, with some calling the idea “stupid”, alleging that it can cause more harm to the rider and its passengers. However, Año said the measure has a scientific basis, noting the requirement is also being used by Indonesia as part of their anti-Covid-19 prevention measures. Last month, the National Task Force Against Covid-19 allowed pillion riding with the use of barriers only for married couples and live-in partners who are living in the same residence. However, pillion riding was allowed for front-liners and Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APOR) in areas placed under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) such as Metro Manila and the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna and Cavite, provided that it follows the barriers requirement and that no fees are involved.

Glenn Anthony Soco, Cebu’s 6th District representative to the Provincial Board, said he recognized the intention of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) in imposing a certain degree of restrictions to motorcycles during quarantine, in order to combat the spread of the infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). On Monday, the Provincial Board passed a resolution authored by Soco urging the IATF-EID to reconsider its policy requiring the installation of a pre-approved design of motorcycle pillion divider or shield. In his resolution, he said a solution to the Covid-19 crisis “must be practical, affordable and effective” and suggested that the “more functional and sensible (for) the pillion-rider/back rider (is) simply (to require them to) wear a full-faced, front-covered helmet, with overalls or jackets and gloves”. “The observance of basic health protocols like wearing masks, frequent washing of hands, or use of disinfectants must likewise be maintained. A structured physical barrier is not necessary,” the resolution read. Soco said motorcycles have become an everyday means of transport that gained popularity over the years. In the 2018 statistics, there were 6,174,300 registered motorcycles in the Philippines, approximately 59 percent of the total number of registered vehicles. In Cebu alone, one out of 23 Cebuanos owns a motorcycle. Soco also said that “Filipinos see motorcycles as cost-efficient for both personal and business needs” as well as the “perfect alternative vehicle for fast mobility”. The perennial problem on traffic congestion pushes demand for motorcycle ownership especially in urban areas like the Province of Cebu, he said. The genuine intention to promote and maintain strict compliance with strict health protocols must be weighed along with the imposition of policy to install barrier which, he said, may pose more harm than good. He cited the opinions of engineers and experts that barriers in two prototypes are “violative of the principles of aerodynamics and maneuverability for motorcycle riders”. The two approved prototypes are the steel frame design with plexiglass or plastic soldered in the center of the motorcycle (Bohol prototype) or a backpack-like contraption to be worn by the driver (Angkas prototype). “With this plight, most motorcycle owners who cannot afford to comply with the prototypes will then have to improvise and make use of substandard and cheaper alternatives. This will add to the greater risk and hazard of accidents and road mishaps,” Soco said. Considering that only couples are allowed to ride together on motorcycles, “the issue on physical distancing must be seriously revisited since these individuals are principally sharing bed and board”, he added.

Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, JTF Covid shield commander, said the 7,091 violators recorded as of July 18 showed government’s resolve to implement the two rules for back riding -- that there must be installed barriers that pass the safety standard of the National Task Force (NTF) for Covid-19 and the riders must be married or living-in couples. “For a long time, motorcycle riders had repeatedly requested the government to allow at least their partners to back-ride with them due to limited public transportation.

He said success in the compliance of the rules on pillion riding “could serve as the basis for our policymakers to expand and allow more people for back-riding.” Last Saturday, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año reminded the couples riding motorcycles to bring with them documents proving that they are married or common-law partners. He said mandatory installation of safety barriers has been extended until July 26 to give riders enough time to comply. Beginning July 27, Año said authorities will start issuing citation tickets to violators amid the government’s imposition of quarantine measures to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak. Motorists earlier asked for an extension to ensure that their compliance conforms with the safety standards set by the NTF for Covid-19. “We hope that the two-week grace period is more than enough for motorists to conform to the safety standards of the two approved designs to ensure the safety of both the driver and the riders,” Eleazar said. While waiting for the full implementation of the motorcycle barrier policy, Eleazar said they will continue to apprehend motorists for other violations including non wearing of helmets.

In a press statement Tuesday, Joint Task Force Covid Shield commander, Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said riders may choose between the prototype designed by the Bohol provincial government and the design submitted by ride-hailing firm Angkas, which were approved by the National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19. Eleazar said he had already coordinated with the Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa to task those supervising and manning the quarantine control points to disseminate the information about the grace period for riders and the full implementation of the policy on July 20. Eleazar said the grace period aims to give motorcycle riders enough time to comply with the policy, which was also agreed upon during his consultation with PNP Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG) director, Brig. Gen. Eliseo Cruz, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) general manager Jojo Garcia and Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca. “As per Secretary of the Interior and Local Government and NTF against Covid-19 Vice Chairman Eduardo Año, we will continue monitoring and warning those without barrier while citing or apprehending those with other violations,” Eleazar said. The Angkas model is worn by the motorcycle drivers and weighs approximately one kilo while Bohol's design is attached to the motorcycle. Royeca said the barrier is \"rigid but flexible upon impact\" and the thin durable plastic sheet can survive massive force without shattering and shaking. “The set of rules for motorcycle back-riding is a balance between safety and the necessity of transportation. Our motorists have long requested for this and now that it was finally granted, please do not abuse it,” said Eleazar. The government allowed motorcycle back-riding for couples starting July 10 over public clamor due to limited public transportation. Aside from installing physical barriers and wearing of face masks and helmets, motorcycle riders are also required to present proof that they are married or live-in partners. Married couples should have the same last name while common-law partners must have the same address in their IDs to be presented to law enforcers.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said that since more transport options will be made available in the second phase of the resumption of public transport, there may no longer be a need for traditional PUJs. He, however, explained that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is still reviewing whether or not to allow traditional jeepneys from plying the roads. “Tingin ko po. Kung sapat. Pero ina-asses nga po ng LTFRB kung magiging sapat alisin ang mga traditional jeepneys (I think so. If there is enough public transport, but the LTFRB is still assessing if there will be enough transport if we remove traditional jeepneys),” he said in a virtual presser. For areas under general community quarantine (GCQ), such as Metro Manila, Roque said transport modes with higher passenger capacity will be prioritized such as trains, buses, and modern public utility vehicles (PUVs) as long as as minimum health standards are observed. He said that since PUJs and UV Express vans are at the bottom of the transport hierarchy, which means they can service fewer passengers, they will only be allowed once the existing transport modes continue to be insufficient. “Ang number one prayoridad ng gobyerno yung mananakay. Kung kulang po ang mga pampublikong sasakyan, pursuant to the hierarchy of bus, modern PUVs, papayagan naman po ang jeepneys at UV Express (The number one priority of the government are the commuters. If there is a lack of public transport, pursuant to the hierarchy of bus, modern PUVs, we may allow jeepneys and UV Express),” he said. To date, Roque said the LTFRB and Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) are closely studying the possibility of allowing provincial buses to resume operations. The LTFRB has allowed at least 308 modern PUJs to operate in Metro Manila while UV Express vans are expected to resume operations within the month, he added. Roque also questioned the claim of the Ibon Foundation that traditional jeepneys with natural ventilation were much safer than modern PUJs which are enclosed and could further spread coronavirus. “Ang ordinaryong mamamayan po alam naman po na kapag harapan ang upuan ay talagang mas mataas yung tyantsa na magkahawaan kesa kung lahat ay nakaharap sa isang direksyon lamang (Ordinary citizens know that if you face each other, there is a higher chance of contamination compared to if you face only one direction),” he said. Meanwhile, Roque urged the public to continue to observe safe physical distancing and accomplish personal health forms for contract tracing during their commute. Only private back-riding allowed After announcing that the IATF has approved back-riding on motorcycles “in principle”, Roque clarified that this only refers to private back-riding and not motorcycle-hailing services such as Singaporean-owned Angkas. Roque said the IATF-EID has ordered the departments of Transportation, Science and Technology, and Health; the Metro Manila Development Authority; and the Bureau of Philippine Standards to look for the “safest and effective” manner to ensure the safe back-riding amid the outbreak. “IATF is studying back-riding of private motorcycles only, subject to health and safety protocols. Kaya po walang Angkas at ibang motorcycle taxi service dahil wala po silang prangkisa (That’s why Angkas and other motorcycle taxi services are not allowed because they don’t have a franchise),” he said. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said that motorcycle-hailing services will be deemed illegal unless Congress crafts a law that would allow them as a mode of public transport. Earlier, DOTr allowed Angkas to operate motorcycle taxis from June 2019 on a pilot study basis. The public should also consider adding innovations or contraptions such as the proposal of Bohol Governor Arthur Yap to install a hard plastic shield between the motorcycle driver and the passenger to make back-riding safer, Roque said.

Garcia issued Executive Order No. 19 on Wednesday regulating the use of motorcycles and specifically permitting “private owners to transport a passenger or back rider” as an answer to the lack of public transportation in towns and cities in the province during the general community quarantine. However, Garcia’s order provides that there should be only one passenger allowed per trip and no fee should be charged. This means that ride-hailing app Angkas and “habal-habal” as modes of transportation for a fee are not allowed in the province while under general community quarantine and succeeding quarantine classifications. The order said that both the driver and passenger must wear Department Trade and Industry (DTI)-approved helmets under R.A. 10054, the Motorcycle Helmet Act of 2009. “Both driver and passenger must wear closed shoes” and observe “applicable mandatory health standards” concerning the effort to prevent the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Garcia directed all the mayors in 44 municipalities and six component cities to issue their own executive orders adopting the provisions of EO 19. The Provincial Board will convene on Friday to pass an ordinance allowing motorcycle back riding, as the EO said it will only take effect upon effectivity of the said measure. The mayors who attended the meeting with Garcia, along with the regional officials of the Land Transportation Office and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, praised the governor’s decision. Mayor Christina Garcia Frasco of Liloan town in the north of Cebu and president of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP)-Cebu Chapter said that the mayors “are very happy with this development because this will really benefit hundreds of thousands of people. Frasco said that “in fact, more than a million people depend on the motorcycle as a way of transportation.” “I think this is a comprise that will suit well in the majority of our population,” the LMP-Cebu president said in a video message she posted on her social media page. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) banned motorcycle back riding to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 following the implementation of community quarantine protocols nationwide. In back riding, the DOTr said both the driver and the passenger are physically close to each other, thus, the high possibility of virus transmission.

In an advisory, DILG Secretary Eduardo M. Año directed provincial governors, city and municipal mayors to coordinate with neighboring LGUs to connect bicycle lanes and establish a bicycle road network. “Because of limited mass transportation, most people will resort to biking as a means of going to and from work. LGUs, therefore, have to be ready with the bike lanes in their areas to ensure the safety of the cyclists,” he said. Año said local governments must also ensure that all bicycle lanes are free from any obstruction to prevent any untoward road accidents. “Siguraduhin po nating walang nakahambalang sa mga dadaanan ng bisikleta sa inyong lugar para iwas-disgrasya at para maging mabilis ang biyahe ng mga siklista (Make sure bike lanes have no any obstruction to prevent accident and it will not hamper the cyclists),” he said. He said bicycles as a mode of transportation is encouraged by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). “As per the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine issued by the IATF, the use of bicycles and other non-motorized forms of transportation is strongly encouraged,” he said. “In this new normal, we want to enjoin everyone to use bikes. Good for the health ang bike, at tsaka, matipid pa. Hindi mo na kailangang bumili ng gasoline (Bikes are good for the health, economical, and you don’t need to buy gasoline),” Año said. He said LGUs must also enact ordinances to impose reasonable penalties on violations in the use of the bike lanes to ensure that both motorists and cyclists follow the regulations along the said lanes. According to him, LGUs should follow the Department of Transportation (DOTr’s) design approach of putting up plastic bollards, stencil markings and signage in the designated bike lanes for the safety of the bicycling public especially in major thoroughfares where fast-moving buses and other huge vehicles are passing through the same road. He also reminded LGUs to strictly implement health and safety protocols including the mandatory wearing of face masks of the persons using said lanes and in all public areas. “SOP na dapat ang pagsusuot ng mask at physical distancing sa mga pampublikong lugar. Masanay na tayo sa ganitong sitwasyon habang wala pang gamot at vaccine laban sa Covid-19 (Wearing of mask and physical distancing in public places should be standard operating procedure. We will get used to it while waiting for vaccine against Covid-19),” he said. Motor taxis still prohibited Meanwhile, DILG Undersecretary and Spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said motor taxis hailed through motorcycle ride-sharing apps such as Angkas are still not allowed during GCQ and modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) under current IATF guidelines. “Alam po namin na marami pong umaasa sa Angkas at iba pang motor taxis para makarating sa kanilang trabaho at destinasyon ngunit dahil sa patuloy na banta ng Covid-19, hindi pa rin pinahihintulutan ng gobyerno ang ganitong mode of transportation dahil sa violation ng physical distancing,” said Malaya. The DILG, through Memorandum Circular 2020-083, directed all LGUs to strictly prohibit the operation of motor taxis as part of the regulatory measures in public transportation in areas under the MECQ and GCQ. Malaya also said motorcycle back ride is prohibited even for married couples as part of the physical distancing measures as this allows prolonged close contact between two people and will lead to possible transmission of Covid-19. “While we understand the request of many of our kababayan (countrymen), back ride is a clear violation of physical distancing and it will be impossible for the police and our traffic enforcers to check each and every motorcycle if these are married couples. If we grant one exemption, it will open the floodgates to violations by those who are not allowed. The health risks outweigh the benefits,” he said. Among the alternative modes of transportation suggested by the DOTr during the post-pandemic period are the use of bikes and modernized PUVs (public utility vehicles) as these have less contact with other people and lessens the risk of spreading the virus among passengers.

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda filed House Bill 6765, which seeks to establish a fiscal regime for the digital economy. “No new taxes here, we just want them to pay their fair share. Assuming you’re a company that sets up in the Philippines, and you do video-streaming or music-streaming services, you will definitely pay taxes. But companies like Netflix and Spotify don’t. That’s obviously not fair,\" he said. When you’re a network in the Philippines, advertising services paid to you will be subject to VAT [value added tax]. But Google and Facebook are not subject to VAT for advertising. Ang laki po ng kinikita nila sa mga Pilipino, pero ni isang kusing ng VAT, wala,” he added. Salceda said the bill responds to the increased urgency of finding new sources of revenue to fund the country’s efforts to recover from the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and anticipates the increasing digitization of the country’s economy. He said that this tax administration proposal aims to fairly capture the value created into the tax system, which will lead to five key changes to the way the digital economy is currently taxed. The bill seeks to make “network orchestrators” like Grab, Angkas, and other similar services as withholding agents for income taxes, to ease their partners of the burden of having to pay their own taxes, while also encouraging tax compliance. It shall clarify that services rendered electronically in the course of trade or business are liable to VAT. It would also clarify that digital advertising by internet giants such as Google and Facebook and subscription-based services such as those of Netflix and Spotify are subject to VAT. Network orchestrators for lease services such as Airbnb and electronic commerce platforms such as Lazada and Shopee shall be made withholding agents for VAT. The bill requires those who render digital services to do so through a resident agent or a representative office in the Philippines. This seeks to address the issue of companies having a significant presence in the country without having a physical establishment in the Philippines not being liable for tax and regulatory purposes. Salceda noted that the bill ensures consumer protection, as most of these companies are considered “runaway services”. “Kapag may reklamo ka, paano mo sisingilin, wala namang opisina sa bansa, kaya wala naman kaming pwede panagutin (If you have a complaint, how would you hold them responsible, if there is no physical office in the country? There is no means of accountability),’ he said. Salceda also added that his tax proposal will not affect social media users who do not advertise on these platforms. “If anything, these social media platforms need you, the user, to keep using, so that they could earn from digital advertising, the same way TV networks need viewers so they could get advertising contracts. So, the usual social media channels will definitely remain free,” he said. “The whole idea that somehow, this bill will make social media networks charge users who don’t advertise, that’s a bad reading of the proposal,” he added.

Passenger motorcycles or “angkas\" are now prohibited under the ordinance, in compliance with the physical distancing policy. The World Health Organization (WHO), in a press conference on March 20, said \"physical distancing” is a more appropriate term than “social distancing” as the former implies that people should remain “physically separated but socially connected.” The WHO recommends staying more than one meter away from the nearest person. Under the ordinance, violators will be fined PHP500 for the first offense; PHP1,000 for the second offense; and PHP3,000 for the third offense. The ordinance stipulates that it is the duty of public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers/operators and persons in charge of the government and private offices, workplaces, business operations, events, and activities, to ensure that physical distancing is applied under their supervision. They are tasked to post signage in their establishments, offices, and vehicles notifying the public of the physical distancing policy and the penalties for violations specified in the ordinance.

He said the time is of the essence, especially with many Filipinos have been sidelined due to the enhanced community quarantine to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) As chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee that oversees the implementation of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, Go said there should be no politics involved in the distribution of aid and that the funds must be allocated fairly and distributed equitably, especially among the poorest of the poor. “Ang mga ahensya tulad ng DSWD dapat mamahala sa pagbibigay ng tulong. Ang mga pulitiko hindi dapat makialam. Huwag niyo po haluan ng pulitika dahil mas humahaba pa ang proseso. Huwag na natin pahirapan pa ang mga tao, pabilisin na natin ang pagbigay ng tulong sa kanila,” Go said. (Government agencies such as the DSWD, should supervise the distribution of relief assistance. Politicians must not interfere. Don't let politics get in the way because the processing becomes longer. Let us not burden our people, let us speed up the distribution of assistance to them.) Go said the priority now is to be able to provide immediate healthcare needs to solve the health problem and defeat the virus and, at the same time, to provide cash and food assistance to those who are affected the most by the crisis. “With the passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the bulk of government spending is now allocated to DOH (Department of Health) for immediate healthcare needs, DSWD for social assistance especially for affected vulnerable sectors, and DOLE for assistance to displaced workers,” Go said. The Senator noted that the law has already given the necessary authority and flexibility to the government to use the funds as deemed necessary to respond and address the growing threats of Covid-19, and the economic impact that comes with it. As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee, Go said he assures that the funds are properly used, prodding those concerned government agencies to provide the needs of those affected by the pandemic. “Alalayan rin natin ang mga displaced at informal economy workers – mga vendors at Public Utility Vehicle drivers, tulad ng mga namamasada ng taxi, tricycle, bus, jeep at iba pa. Pati na rin po ang mga trisikad, pedikab, habal-habal at mga nagtatrabaho sa Transportation Network Vehicle Services o TNVS, katulad ng Grab, Angkas, Joyride.

(We would also support our displaced informal workers-- the vendors and public utility vehicle drivers like those who drive taxi, tricycle, bus, and jeep and the like. Those who worked in the transportation network services or TNVS like Grab, Angkas, Joyride, especially those who are in 'no work, no pay' scheme, the daily wage earners who have to stop working to contain the spread of this disease.) Citing the burden placed on Filipinos as they go through the enhanced quarantine measures, Go said it is the responsibility of the government to secure and sustain their needs as their lives grind to a halt. “Responsibilidad natin na alagaan ang ating mga kababayan na pinilit nating hindi lumabas ng kanilang mga bahay. Nag-impose tayo ng strict measures para maprotektahan ang kalusugan nila pero hindi dapat doon nagtatapos ang responsibilidad natin sa pag-aalaga sa kanila,” he said. (It is our responsibility to take care of our countrymen that we force not to go out of their homes. We impose strict measures to protect their health but our responsibility to them does not stop there.) Meanwhile, the Department of Budget and Management has requested for the release of a budget amounting to PHP2.84 billion for the benefit of displaced workers through DOLE. The funds for DOLE are intended “to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 among affected the private sector employees who have no or insufficient leave credits and are required to undergo community quarantine, among others.” Go said as the country continues to fight to contain the Covid-19 transmission, the government must take care of poor Filipinos who are becoming hungry and restless. Over 85 percent of the requested fund of DBM that will be given to DOLE will be allotted for the Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers and Government Internship Program (TUPAD-GIP). TUPAD is a community-based package of assistance in the municipality or barangay level that provides emergency employment for displaced workers, underemployed, and seasonal workers, for a minimum period of ten days but not to exceed 30 days, depending on the nature of the work to be performed. On the other hand, GIP provides opportunities for young workers to serve the general public in government agencies or entities’ projects and programs at the national and local levels.

In a press conference on Thursday, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) General Manager Arturo “Jojo” Garcia said that as part of the Motorcycle Taxi Pilot Study Technical Working Group (TWG), he will recommend the ban to lawmakers which would include Metro Manila’s major roads such as circumferential, radial, and national roads. “Circumferential road, R1 to R10, national roads, bawal dapat ang motorcyle taxis, kasi nga may pasahero yan eh. Tricycle nga hindi natin pinapayagan, mas safe pa yan (motorcycle taxis should be banned from these because it has a passenger. Even tricycles are not allowed and those are safer),” Garcia said. He said even if riders and passengers are required to wear safety gear such as helmets, knee pads, and others, accidents that could occur at high speed and busy roads would result in tragedy for motorcycle taxis. To address further safety issues with motorcycle taxis, TWG chair Antonio Gardiola Jr. said a new safety requirement being eyed by the study was the inclusion of more passenger grips on motorcycle taxis aside from “grip belts” worn by riders. He said the new grips to be installed on the motorcycles themselves would be more stable than grip belts and would also benefit those who are uncomfortable with holding onto riders. Registered riders Meanwhile, Gardiola said the registration of riders in the pilot study officially ended on Wednesday, with a final count of 51,925 registered riders from the 63,000-rider cap. In Metro Manila, he said Angkas has registered 20,000 riders, followed by JoyRide with 15,000, and Move It with 6,836 -- totaling 41,836 riders, under the 45,000-rider cap for Metro Manila. In Metro Cebu, Angkas has registered 4,500 riders, JoyRide with 4,488, and Move It with none -- just shy of 12 from the 9,000-rider cap in the metropolis. Meanwhile, in Cagayan de Oro City, Angkas still has the most riders with 925, followed by JoyRide with 176, and Move It with none -- still short of 7,899 riders to reach the 9,000-rider cap in the city. Following the deadline for the registration of riders, Gardiola said the remaining 11,075-unused rider cap will be redistributed among the three motorcycle taxi transport network companies (TNC). “Starting today, unused cap -- the difference there can be taken advantage of other TNCs,” Gardiola said. During the event, Garcia announced a government crackdown against “habal-habal terminals,” or terminals of illegal motorcycle taxis operating offline, and motorcycle taxis operating while unregistered in the TWG’s master list.

In Metro Cebu, Angkas has registered 4,500 riders while both JoyRide and Move It have so far failed to register any riders—with both companies previously allocating 3,000 riders each. In Cagayan de Oro City, which the TWG earlier said was included to broaden the study’s coverage to all three major island groups of the country, only Angkas was able to register 804 riders, out of the 3,000 rider allocations given to each of the three TNCs. “This will, therefore, set the record straight in so far as compliance to the documentary and regulatory requirements under the revised guidelines of the TWG, most especially on the need to fully register and declare the names and number of contracted riders by the participant TNCs,” the TWG said.

He said Angkas got a 20,000 rider cap after Move It agreed to give 5,000 of its 15,000 allotted riders while JoyRide kept a 15,000 rider limit in Metro Manila. The remaining 18,000 allotted riders will be divided equally by Metro Cebu and in Cagayan de Oro City. Each of the participating service providers is allotted 3,000 riders in Cebu and 3,000 riders in Cagayan de Oro. Gardiola said Cagayan de Oro has been included in an effort to include Mindanao in the pilot study for motorcycle taxis. The new division of riders, he said, was made possible by a redistribution provision present in the revised guidelines submitted last December. “Ang ibig sabihin po ng redistribution provision, is that, kung hindi kaya ng isang player to come up with that number of rider, ibibigay po 'yun sa company na ready (What the redistribution provision means, is that, if one player can’t come up with that number of riders, it will be given to a company that is ready),” Gardiola said.

In response, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said they have agreed to drop all charges against the revised guidelines of the TWG and collaborate for the success of the pilot study. “The case was to show a grievance on one of the provisions.

Stella Quimbo said the initial move of the TWG to terminate the motorcycle taxis’ pilot run would create barriers that prevent transport alternatives to enter in the market. “At this point, the reason why Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It can operate is precisely because they are the subjects of the pilot study. Hence, LTFRB’s (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) move to withdraw the study is tantamount to putting up what competition authorities call a “barrier to entry,” Quimbo said. “Specifically, LTFRB would put up a barrier to entry in the market for on-demand and platform-based private transport, which includes Grab. Because Angkas and other operators potentially compete against Grab, this barrier to entry would provide the latter an undue advantage,” she added. She said while consumer safety is “paramount”, such objectives must also be balanced with competition principles. “The purpose of the pilot study is to determine the appropriate regulatory intervention to ensure passenger safety. In the process, it should not kill jobs, narrow consumer choice, or eradicate market options that have the potential to effectively compete with transportation options such as Grab.” Quimbo said. “Kung ang tunay na kakampi ng LTFRB ay ang riding public, tatapusin nila ang pag-aaral na may layunin na maghanap ng agarang solusyon sa problema ng kakulangan at nagmamahal na public transportation (If LTFRB is indeed an ally of the riding public, it would complete the pilot study with the end goal of finding a prompt solution to the challenges faced by the Philippine public transportation system),” she added.

The revised guidelines issued in December last year limited the maximum number of riders in Metro Manila to 30,000 and in Metro Cebu to 9,000 -- divided equally between the three approved companies Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It. Angkas claimed the new rider cap would result in the loss of jobs for 17,000 of its riders -- with Angkas claiming to have a total of 27,000 riders -- resulting in a conflict between the company and the TWG.

Several organizations and foreign countries have sent sympathies and aid to the most affected population, with humanitarian workers in the frontline working round-the-clock. While it is true that disasters spare no one, it is more heartwarming and inspiring to see how people from all walks of life respond to the call for help and give donations in their little ways. Hundreds of bikers in blue-- all Angkas riders-- traveled to Sto. Tomas town to help those who have evacuated to safer grounds. One of them was Hermie Garsota, a part of the Angkas rider volunteers and the 20-plus-member Motor Xtreme South, specifically.  Hermie Garsota \"Iba't ibang grupo po kami pero iisa lang na sa Angkas. Ang layunin namin dito, magbibigay ng mga relief goods, pagkain, damit sa mga nasalanta. Iba't ibang batch kami, sa kahapon mayroon din, ngayon iba din, pati bukas at 'yong sa Linggo (We are different groups here but all are part of Angkas. Our goal here is to give relief goods, food, and clothes. We're a different batch from those who went here yesterday, and those coming tomorrow and on Sunday),\" he told the Philippine News Agency on Friday. From his group alone, Motor Xtreme South, Garsota said they brought at least 50 boxes of goods containing noodles, canned goods, and water—all intended for communities and families who are sheltering the displaced. \"Nag-start na ito noong Monday pa. Sa sobrang dami ng grupo, iba't ibang barangay ang pupuntahan namin, hindi lang isang lugar (It already started on Monday. With the huge number of groups, we'll be going to different barangays, not only one specific area,\" he said.  For volunteer Lito Melano, the donation drive shows how Filipinos are ready to respond and help others however small their resources are. \"Ganito sa amin. Isang group kami na nagtitipon-tipon, nagsasama-sama para makatulong sa mga naapektuhan ng pagsabog ng Taal Volcano (We are like this in our group, we gathered to help the victims of the Taal Volcano eruption),\" he said. \"Kung kinakailangan na ulitin namin ito, 'di kami magdadalawang isip na ulitin. Personal namin ito sa group, nag-ambag-ambag kami, nagkusang loob kami na maglikom ng halaga para ibili ng mga pangangailangan para maitulong sa mga kababayan natin (If we need to do this again, we won't hesitate to do so. We did this voluntarily and chipped in to save an amount that will be used to buy relief goods for our fellow Filipinos),\" he added. Aside from these motorcycle riders, there were also some small groups and prominent organizations handing out donations around the mostly ash-laden Batangas province, particularly the nearby communities where people sought refuge after their towns were placed on lockdown. In the Old Tanauan City Hall, one of the structures that serve as an evacuation center, donations and assistance are pouring in as hundreds of individuals take temporary shelter. 'Threat remains' In the usually bustling towns of Taal and San Nicolas, abandoned houses covered in ash as well as few men and dozens of dogs, cats, and goats were the only ones left. From the lakefront in San Nicolas, one of the nearest areas from the crater, the Taal Volcano which had been photographed with massive ash plume and lightning streaks looked calm. But its threat remains-- Taal Volcano is still under alert level 4, meaning a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours or days. As of Saturday, the government said there are a total of 96,061 people from Batangas, Laguna, and Quezon affected by the volcano's eruption on January 12, of which at least 70,413 are taking temporary shelter in 300 evacuation centers in the region. The effect was also felt by the education sector as some 30,000 students have been displaced. In a briefing with public school officials in Batangas City on Friday, the Department of Education said at least 78 public and 13 private schools were abandoned after residents were forced to evacuate. The agency, however, said it will take put in measures to make sure that education continues for those affected.

In an order dated January 10 released Wednesday, Regional Trial Court Branch 212 Judge Rizalina Capco-Umali dismissed the petition filed by the motorcycle ride-hailing firm against the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for lack of merit. The court said the decision to dismiss the petition was made to “avoid issuing writ which would effectively dispose of the main case without trial and/or due process.” It added that if the court would grant the injunctive writ, it would mean that the court would have “prejudged the main case and reversed the rule on the burden of proof.” The court also ruled that the DOTr and LTFRB have in their favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, which Angkas failed to rebut. “The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence or irregularity or failure to perform a duty. The presumption, however, prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,” the order read. The TWG’s Revised General Guidelines for the Pilot Implementation of Motorcycles indicated that motorcycle taxi riders shall be limited to 30,000 in Metro Manila and 9,000 in Metro Cebu -- divided equally between the three qualified TNCs -- Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It. The new limit effectively slashed the accredited riders of Angkas from 27,000 to 10,000 -- which the company did not accept lightly by responding with a petition for a 72-hour TRO against the revised guidelines, which it obtained on January 6. Following an apology from Angkas for its alleged bullying tactics and defiance of government guidelines, the DOTr and the TWG on Friday called out the company for its “two-faced” position on the pilot run. This came after Angkas filed a petition before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court for a TRO against the new rider cap and apprehension of “excess riders”.

In a petition dated January 6 filed before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 223, Angkas asked for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the new rider cap, apprehension of “excess riders”, and to exclude its two competitors in the pilot program. In a statement, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran noted that Angkas was “telling a lie” when it said it was open to competition and would no longer object to guidelines imposed in the program by the TWG. “Dito natin makikita na doble-kara ang Angkas. Noong isang araw, nag-sorry sila sa harap ng media. Nangako na susundin nila ang guidelines at makikipag-usap sa gobyerno. Ngayon, nagpunta sila sa korte para i-challenge ang gobyerno (Here is where we see the two faces of Angkas. The other day, they apologized in front of the media. They promised to follow the guidelines and have a dialogue with the government. Now, they went to court to challenge the government),” Libiran said. She said the attempt to exclude its two competitors from the program showed Angkas was “not ready to release its monopolistic hold on the motorcycle ride-hailing service sector.” \"Gusto nila, sila lang. Hindi ba pagkontra din ito sa dati nilang statement na wala silang problema sa kompetisyon? Ano yon, kasinungalingan lang? (They want a monopoly. Doesn’t this contradict their earlier statement that they don’t mind competition? What was that? A lie?),” Libiran said. On Wednesday, George Royeca, head of Angkas’ regulatory and public affairs, apologized for the company’s previous actions and assured its cooperation for the success of the pilot program. The DOTr said Angkas previously assured that it would no longer object to Section 10 or the imposition of a cap on riders of the revised guidelines of the pilot run of the TWG and was open to competition from other transport groups. Royeca’s apology came after TWG officials issued a warning against Angkas after the company was found to have made violations that could result in it being \"blacklisted\" when the TWG submits its findings and recommendations to Congress for the legalization of motorcycles as taxis. These violations include the illicit operation of Angkas riders in Cagayan de Oro City and the alleged “99.9 percent” ownership of Angkas by Singaporean national Angeline Tham. Ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines on Wednesday said the recent activities of a “prospective TNC” was disruptive and selfish and enjoined other players in the ride-hailing market to abide by rules set by government regulators.

In a radio interview, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Party-list Rep. Jericho Nograles said since the operation of Angkas is just a pilot stage and is not covered by any government franchise like other public conveyances, the LTFRB can take any action they see fit to protect the public interest. Nograles noted that the LTFRB can impose a PHP6,000-fine per motorcycle per day against Angkas for operating without any franchise. He also cited documents showing that Angkas is 98 percent foreign-owned, which could be another basis to shut down its operation as it violates a constitutional provision requiring that all public utility companies should be 60 percent Filipino-owned. “Ang legal status ng motorcyle-for-hire ay wala pa talaga silang totoong prangkisa at sila ay naka-test mode. Ang tanong may legal basis ba ang gobyerno na bawasan ang test vehicles? Ang sagot diyan ay yes (The legal status of motorcycles-for-hire is that they still don’t have any franchise and they are still on test mode. The question is, does the government have a legal basis to reduce the number of test vehicles. The answer is yes),” Nograles said. “May legal basis ang gobyerno dahil wala pang karapatan na mag operate ang motorcycle-for -hire ang mga Angkas, Joyride etcetera at kailangan nilang sumunod sa patakaran (The government has legal basis for this because motorcycles-for-hire such as Angkas and Joyride have no right yet to operate [under existing laws] and must follow the [government’s] directives),” he added. The lawmaker said the absence of a law governing the operation of these ride-hailing services such as Grab and Angkas is largely responsible for the confusion in relation to their existence, noting that the passage of measures setting the parameters on the nature of their operation must be expedited \"Ang kailangan gawin dito ay ang Committee on Transportation ng Kongreso ay dinggin na nila at magdebate na kung pahintulutan ba natin na ang motorsiklo ay gawing for hire (The House Committee on Transportation must hear and deliberate on allowing motorcycles to be classified as for hire),” he said. “Pangalawa, sino ang magbibigay ng prangkisa o kung kelangan pa ng prangkisa at ang pangatlo ay ang issue sa ownership (Second, [the panel should discuss] who would grant the franchise or if such franchise is needed and third, the issue of ownership) \" he added.

Royeca also expressed his hope for the riders' cap imposed on the firm to be lifted so that everyone can proceed with the extended pilot run smoothly and without any hitches. “But on the same breath, we ask for fairness, in consideration of all the hard work we have done to comply with government regulators since last year,” he noted. Royeca also clarified that they are not picking a fight with government regulators. “Pasensya na po sa naging (We apologize for being) back and forth. Please don't mistake what we did as defiance. Right from start, we worked hard to be compliant with everything the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the (Department of Transportation's) TWG (technical working group) had set in the first motorcycle taxi test run. For six whole months last year, there was never any problem,” Royeca explained. “It must be noted that we complied with everything that the TWG asked us to do in the initial test run. We did a re-training of all our riders. We gave our riders safety vests based on the recommendation of the TWG. We are continuously complying to the best of our abilities with the new pilot guidelines,” he revealed. Royeca also reported that in the three years since Angkas started, the Angkas app was downloaded three million times. In the course of the pilot run, they have recorded millions of rides. In terms of the service’s safety record, Angkas riders had only .003 percent accidents with zero fatalities. Angkas also has in place an Emergency Response Team and Medical Accident Network with six Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)-trained full-time employees, 42 EMR-trained biker respondents, 12 on-call doctors, and eight affiliated hospitals. During the initial pilot run, the average response time recorded was 30 minutes. Royeca also reported that Angkas has set aside an accident emergency fund to cover expenses above and beyond what’s provided by the private insurance. The company also ensures proper financial controls and standard operating procedures for quick fund disbursement for immediate patient assistance. “It took us three years and dozens of safety training sessions and hundreds of hours of training to come up with a fleet of 27,000 competent bikers. You cannot build a competent and safe biker network overnight,” Royeca shared. “We have invested so much in continuous training -- our trainors have been trained by a US firm that trains the US Marines and conducts motorcycle rider licensing and accreditation for the California and Pennsylvania State Department of Motor Vehicles. They have also undergone training with the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group, and we are continuously working on updating and improving further our trainings,” he noted. “Moreover, I believe a support system for our bikers is necessary after they’ve passed our screening in order for them to continuously provide excellent service to our customers,” Royeca added, stating that their system averages doing assistance to 360 riders per day. In terms of training, Royeca reported that they have retrained over 20,000 bikers for the initial pilot run. They had a total of 50 field retraining activities with riders getting retrained practically every week. For six months from July to December of 2019, the safety record of Angkas was reported as 99.997 percent. “We tried our utmost best to maintain a high safety record for the benefit of all our passengers. We are proud to say that our high service standards were maintained in the test run,” he stressed. When asked about their pricing scheme, Royeca said this is for them to be able to encourage more bikers on the road to meet the demand. \"But because it is not allowed in the pilot, we will comply. We just want to give a heads up that this may result in bikers going back to habal-habal and that there'd be substantially fewer Angkas bikers on the road.” Royeca also noted that he is not against competition in the motorcycle taxi industry. \"I would like to emphasize that even back then, I knew there will be new players as soon as motorcycle taxis become the subject of legislation and regulated. I have never aspired to establish a monopoly,” he stressed. When word got out that the LTFRB will be extending the run with new players, Royeca was interviewed in the media and was reported to have said that he was totally fine with the inclusion of new players in the test run extension. “This means that people have begun to realize the importance of motorcycle taxis in helping our commuters beat the daily traffic,” he noted. In a presentation he showed during the briefing, Royeca reported that a total of 117,166 bikers have applied with Angkas. Of that number, 36,797 bikers were onboard. However, only 26,478 were retrained and activated for the first pilot run and 10,378 were deactivated. On Monday, a Mandaluyong court handed down a 72-hour temporary restraining order against the LTFRB's order, which limits the number of riders for Angkas. In a three-page order, acting Executive Judge Ofelia L. Calo of Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court (RTC) said there is “urgency” in the issuance of the TRO against LTFRB’s move to limit Angkas’ riders to 10,000 in Manila and 3,000 in Cebu. Angkas was likewise ordered to post a PHP300,000 bond by the court. Last December 19, the LTFRB, in its own guidelines, set its cap of 30,000 riders for Metro Manila and 9,000 riders for Metro Cebu to part of the pilot implementation. Two days later, the LTFRB said hailing apps Move It and Joy Ride will be included in the revised guidelines and that the 30,000 riders limit will now be divided among the two new ride providers and Angkas or 10,000 each. Angkas then filed the suit claiming that the guidelines are \"arbitrary and unilateral\". The LTFRB has yet to respond for comment on the issue. The DOTr's TWG earlier said Angkas may be blacklisted from the country's motorcycle taxi industry after it found out that it is illegally operating in Cagayan de Oro City and that it is 99 percent owned by a certain Singaporean national Angeline Tham.

Gen. Debold Sinas told reporters in a press briefing. Sinas said the measure aims to stop crimes, particularly shooting that could be perpetrated by riding-in-tandem criminals. Aside from checkpoints, Sinas said roaming patrols will also be deployed. “Whenever our police personnel in roaming patrols see riding in tandem passengers, they can be flagged. This is the only way we can think of, aside from random checkpoints. If they are apprehended and they have shown necessary permits, there's no problem. This is for us to prevent shooting incidents.

Eleazar said he would particularly bring up the proposal with PNP Officer-In-Charge, Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, and chief of operations, Lt. Gen. Camilo Cascolan. \"Ikokonsulta po natin yan at pati po sa pamunuan ng PNP [We will consult it to the PNP leadership],\" Eleazar said in a radio interview. Under the proposed policy, commanders will be immediately sacked from the service for failing to fight crimes orchestrated by riding-in-tandem suspects. Eleazar tagged the proposal as a \"great suggestion\". The advantage of such idea, Eleazar said, was that commanders would exert effort to prevent the attacks by assailants riding motorcycles to happen. \"Kung ito ay para sa riding in tandem, siguro magdo-double time din itong ating mga commander para maiwasan ang occurrence ng incidents involving riding in tandem suspects [If this is for the riding in tandem incidents, our commanders would have double time to prevent the occurrence of incidents involving riding-in-tandem suspects],\" he pointed out. Eleazar compared the said policy to the case of indiscriminate firing wherein chiefs and commanders of police could employ barangay officials to help run after those who fired shots within 24 hours. \"Para makapag-imbestiga at magkaroon ng resolution para huwag siya ma-relieve [To investigate and to have a resolution so that he could not be relieved],\" he said.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the LTFRB said it has called the attention of TNCs, such as Grab Philippines and Angkas regarding the matter. “According to commuters, some ride-hailing applications have started to charge higher fares since the Christmas season began, particularly this month,” the post read. “The LTFRB, in cooperation with accredited TNCs, are looking to settle this matter within the week,” it added. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the issues will be dealt with by the LTFRB. “The agency is at the forefront of ensuring public transportation remains safe, convenient, and also affordable. We will look into this,” Delgra said. The LTFRB said these ride-hailing applications have a standard rate of PHP40 as base fare, in addition to a PHP10-15 per kilometer and PHP2 per-minute charges. During rush hour or heavy traffic, the LTFRB said TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per-minute charges through surge-pricing. Arvin Lopez, a public relations officer of Grab Philippines, said they have yet to receive an official invitation from the LTFRB but has guaranteed the company's presence should the meeting occur. “We have yet to receive the official invitation from the LTFRB on this subject, but we will definitely comply and attend to this discussion,” Lopez said in a message to reporters. In November, the LTFRB announced a review of the fare setting of Grab Philippines following a recent fine imposed on the company for overcharging. Imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the LTFRB said the fine was due to Grab’s failure to follow through with a voluntary commitment it made with the antitrust body and had nothing to do with the policies set by the agency.

In a bulletin on Tuesday, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said the extension of the MTPI, which was originally supposed to end on December 26, would allow for the participation of new players in the study to further explore the viability of motorcycles as a safe mode of public transportation. It added that the TWG had submitted its recommendation and a decision on the proposed extension is set to be released soon. LTFRB Board Member, retired Police Maj. Gen. Antonio Gardiola Jr. said the extension of the study and inclusion of new motorcycle taxi providers was in the interest of “giving the riding public a wider choice, and thus push the multiple providers to ensure a higher standard of service.” “We also want to determine whether or not motorcycles are really a safe and viable form of public transportation. That is always our priority -- the safety, security, and comfort of the riding public,\" Gardiola said. The LTFRB said the extension would provide the TWG more time to widen the scope of the study on appropriate standards and capacities for motorcycles to be considered safe, convenient, and eligible for franchise. On Nov. 20, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) received proposals from six different motorcycle taxi providers -- Citimuber, JoyRide, MoveIt, EsetGo, Sakay, and VroomGo -- to participate in the pilot study. In June, the initial six-month pilot run was approved in aid of legislation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate to evaluate pending legislation pushing for the legalization of motorcycles as public utility vehicles, as well as the amendment of existing laws such as Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. The TWG, led by Gardiola, is composed of representatives from the LTFRB, the Department of Transportation, the Land Transportation Office, and the Inter-Agency Council for Traffic.

Angara filed Senate Bill 1025, which seeks to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, to allow motorcycles to be registered with the Land Transportation Office as “for hire” and may be used as a commercial vehicle to transport passengers and goods. In a statement on Thursday, he said the worsening traffic problem in Metro Manila and the frequently bogged-down mass transit systems highlight the need to provide commuters with an alternative mode of transportation, such as motorcycles-for-hire or \"habal-habal\". He, however, noted that the “increasingly-popular mode of transport” is still considered illegal under the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which covers the registration and operation of all motor vehicles in the country. He cited the case of motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas, which was allowed to operate for six months starting last June 8 as part of a pilot-run of \"motorcycle taxis\". “Commuting in Metro Manila has become very challenging. A typical commuter has to allocate at least two hours to get to work or school and that is if their regular modes of transport are available. What if the MRT breaks down? Kulang pa ang dalawang oras mo sa byahe (Two hours would not be enough for the commute),” Angara said. “Tulad nitong nangyari sa LRT-2 na nasunog. Libo-libong Pilipino ang naperwisyo nito at karamihan sa kanila ay habal na ang sinasakyan para mas mabilis makarating sa destinasyon nila at mas mura din ito kumpara sa Grab (Just like the fire incident in LRT-2, thousands of Filipinos were inconvenienced and most of them resorted to the use of the habal-habal as a mode of transportation to reach their destination because it’s cheaper compared to Grab),” he added. Republic Act 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, only allows the registration of motorcycles for either private or government use and prohibit its listing as a vehicle for hire. “However, individuals and even unaccredited transport groups, continue to utilize motorcycles for public transport despite (the) explicit prohibition of such operation under the same law,” Angara said. Under the bill, a motorcycle must have a minimum engine displacement of 125 cubic cm. and a backbone-type built to be registered for transporting passengers. The Land Transportation Office (LTO) will be tasked to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycles-for-hire before they are registered. To further ensure their safety, no modifications on the motorcycles would be allowed, except for the installation, based on safe engineering design specifications, of motorcycle luggage carriers, saddlebags, step boards or footpegs, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring device.

The “City of Smiles”, which first won during the inaugural search in 2017, reclaimed the champion’s trophy after losing to Davao City in 2018. Bacolod also received the special awards Business-Friendly/High Returns and Retirement Haven. Mayor Evelio Leonardia, who received the awards in rites held at the New World Manila Bay Hotel on Wednesday afternoon, gave credit to the “team effort” of the city officials and the people of Bacolod as he wished that the recognition would reverberate to other cities. “We hope to see the day that the standards The Manila Times has established for Bacolod and the rest of us, will become the standards of model cities in the Philippines because once we have model cities, we will also have a model country,” Leonardia said in a statement on Thursday. General Trias City led by Mayor Antonio Ferrer was named first runner-up while Ormoc City headed by Mayor Richard Gomez was declared second runner-up. The Top Philippine Model Municipalities were Liloan (Cebu), champion; Guiguinto (Bulacan), first runner-up; and Pulilan (Bulacan), second runner-up. Looking back, Leonardia said the city’s first award in 2017 became a source of inspiration for Bacolod following his return to the City Hall after serving as a congressman for one term. “The award then became our guidance and standard and became an inspiration for us to dream bigger dreams,” he said, citing the other recognitions received by Bacolod, such as for being business-friendly from the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and “Most Competitive City in the Visayas” as declared by the National Competitiveness Council. “In giving us this award, The Manila Times has played a vital role in Bacolod’s march to progress and development,” said Leonardia, who is the national president of the League of Cities of the Philippines.

The eight-kilometer elevated four-lane expressway connects the NLEX and SLEX through Segment 10 -- C3 Road in Caloocan City to Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Sta. Mesa, Manila -- and Skyway Stage 3. The project is expected to be traversed by those going through Metro Manila from the north to the south and vice versa, which would effectively relocate a significant portion of vehicular traffic on Edsa. Another big-impact project, she said, was increasing the number of trains running in the MRT-3, which is yet to be fully realized. “We’ve been promised many times that the trains that were imported from Dalian will be working soon, but out of the 16 trains, only two or three are working after five years,” Poe said. An PHP18-billion comprehensive rehabilitation of the MRT-3 is currently ongoing, which the Department of Transportation hopes would increase the ridership of the MRT-3 from the daily average of 320,000 to 650,000 by its expected completion on July 2021. Sumitomo-MHI TESP, the contractor and maintenance provider of the MRT-3 project, will also overhaul all light rail vehicles of the rail transit, replace mainline tracks to increase its operating speeds, rehabilitate power and overhead catenary systems, among other upgrades. Walkways, innovative transport systems Aside from motorized mass transportation, the senator also highlighted conventional walkways as an effective solution to congestion in the metro. “If the government would mandate that, if you build certain buildings in a financial center or a business center, you should already have elevated walkways to connect to other buildings,” Poe said. She emphasized that these mass transport systems would be more effective than regulations on innovative transport systems such as transport network companies (TNC) like Grab and Angkas. “Yet the initial reaction of some people, such as the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board), was to treat the TNCs like taxi operators and regulate their supply and price,” Poe said. The senator said passenger rights and innovations must be carefully balanced because “nothing chokes an enterprise more than excessive regulation.” She added that the Philippines’ mass transportation is not yet fully available, thus, “the state is obligated to explore new modes of transportation for the sake of our commuters.” During the summit, experts from both the government and private sectors tackled the fourth industrial revolution brought by such innovative technologies as learning robots through artificial intelligence, Internet of things, 3D-printing, among others.

Before it was deleted, the tweet read, “Angkas is like sex. It’s scary the first time pero masarap na ulit-ulitin (but feels good to repeat over and over).”  The tweet went viral after the PNP’s reply saying Angkas is scaring its own users and does not promote safety in public transport.

In a press conference at the Ilustrado Restaurant in Intramuros here, Ariel Inton, lawyer for Commuter Safety and Protection said they are initially planning to pursue an injunction against the ban to temporarily allow sub-400cc motorcycles back in the disputed area. “Legal action is always open. And what are those? One, of course, is the case for an injunction. The prayer for the temporary restraining order against the ban,” Inton said. Angkas and motorcycle groups cried foul over the enforcement of a ban on sub-400cc motorcycles on Osmeña Highway/SLEX from Magallanes in Makati to Sales interchange in Taguig City. Angkas said the ban may be a form of discrimination against the poor since the price range of a common 100cc motorcycle is merely a fraction of the price of a 400cc motorcycle. Inton said they are also planning to file a civil suit against Skyway O&M Corporation (SOMCO) and some of its executives. “We are open, na syempre marami na naabala diyan, maraming naperwisyo (but many have already been bothered and have suffered because of this), civil case for damages against the corporation and on their corporate officers. Pwedeng i-include sila in this civil suit (They could be included in this civil suit),” Inton said. Once SOMCO lifts the ban and agrees to a dialogue on the issue, Inton said they may still pursue legal action to prevent such a ban from happening again. “Open pa rin 'yung option namin for legal action. Kasi kahit naman may consultation, tapos wala rin 'di ba? (We’re still open to legal action. Because even if there’s a consultation, what if nothing comes of it?),” Inton said. He said SOMCO went beyond its jurisdiction when it enforced the ban without coordinating with the national or local government bodies. “Malinaw na ang SOMCO sumobra sa kanilang discretion. Ano ba ang power ng SOMCO para mag-ban ng sasakyan? Kung ito ay palalampasin natin, baka pagdating ng panahon hindi lang motorsiklo ang i-ban niyan (It is clear SOMCO went beyond their discretion. What is the power of SOMCO to ban vehicles? If we allow this to happen, we may see them banning other types of vehicles in the future),” Inton said. In a phone interview with Toll Regulatory Body (TRB) spokesperson Alberto Suansing, he said SOMCO had not coordinated with his office on the enforcement of the ban. However, Suansing said the tollways corporation is allowed to enforce such a ban as it is within their jurisdiction. “As far as coordination is concerned, with our office, TRB, wala silang ginawa.

TRB spokesperson Alberto Suansing made the statement in response to the negative reactions from motorcycle-ride service provider Angkas and private individuals regarding the ban. Suansing said Angkas' interpretation, as well as other motorcycle riders' groups, on which roads are considered tollways is incorrect. “Ang sabi nga namin, i-verify mo sa Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) kung saan magmula ang boundary ng South Luzon Expressway (SLEX)', which is maliwanag ‘yun na ang boundary ng SLEX is from Magallanes, southward (What we said, verify with the DPWH where the SLEX begins, which is clear.

In a press conference at the Ilustrado Restaurant in Intramuros, Jobert Bolanos, chairman of the Motorcycle Rights Organization (MRO), said they are questioning whether the road from Magallanes toward Sales Bridge is really a tollway since it is already beyond the Nichols Toll Plaza. “Ang pinag-uusapan natin dito (What we’re talking about here) is beyond Nichols Toll Plaza which is Sales Bridge all the way to Magallanes. Yes, it is still part of SLEX, however, is it still part of the Limited Access Tollway?” Bolanos said. George Royeca, Angkas head of regulatory and public affairs, claimed that research made by the company into the ban of sub-400cc motorcycles in SLEX is not backed by past laws, directives or orders from governing bodies. “Wala pa po kaming nakikitang deriktiba or official order from the TRB, also from the other agencies that’s concerned (We have not seen any directives or official orders from the TRB, also from other agencies concerned),” Royeca said. He added that SOMCO may be liable for going beyond its authority for enforcing a ban on motorcycles without coordinating with national agencies and local government units (LGUs). “All we know is that Skyway made that order. Is that true? Can a private corporation dictate the use of public roads?” Royeca said. Bolanos added that SOMCO added confusion into the mix by putting up road signs that could be misunderstood by motorists. “All of a sudden, nagkaroon ng paglalagay ng mga signages. Nagkaroon ng signages na kung babasahin mo, it spans from at grade. Meaning, yung level ng SLEX, taas at baba, all the way to Manila. People began to think na buong Osmeña bawal na kasi kung all the way to Manila yan, e di Quirino Highway na ‘yon (they put up signages. Signages popped up that if you read it, it spans from at grade. Which means both upper and lower levels of SLEX, all the way to Manila. People began to think the whole Osmeña enforces the ban because if it’s all the way to Manila, that’s already Quirino Highway),” Bolanos said. However, Suansing said SOMCO is free to enforce the ban on sub-400cc motorcycles and to put up signs with information on the ban as long as they do it within the roads in their jurisdiction. “Even without informing us, they can do that because it’s just a reiteration of the ban,” Suansing said. Proper coordination Royeca, meanwhile, said they want an audience with different governing bodies, private partners and other stakeholders so that the confusion and hassle for commuters and motorists alike can be avoided in the future. “Angkas from the very beginning, we’ve always been advocates of coordination with the proper stakeholders, government and otherwise, NGOs [non-government organizations], even people that are against us. Let’s do proper coordination before we create policies like this that would be the detriment of commuters,” he said. On July 22, the SOMCO began enforcing a ban on sub-400cc motorcycles on the SLEX/Osmeña highway from Magallanes, Makati City up to Sales Interchange in Taguig. The stretch of SLEX used to allow sub-400cc motorcycles for several years, which meant that countless riders, unaware of the recent ban, were apprehended.

HPG chief, Brig. Gen. Roberto Fajardo said their mandate is to ensure the safety of the metro’s highways for the benefit of commuters and motorists alike and part of that mandate is to help ensure the smooth and safe flow of traffic in our streets. “We support Angkas, as well as all the transport operators legally franchised by the LTFRB, because it is a service that helps the commuters in safely going to and from their destinations. The HPG and Angkas have the same objective and therefore we need to support each other,” Fajardo told reporters during the press briefing for the turnover of Angkas’ donation of 50 brand-new, high-quality helmets to the HPG, which was held at the HPG office in Camp Crame, Quezon City. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) recently gave the green light to implement the pilot run of Angkas in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu for six months starting this June. Prior to this, the DOTr organized a Technical Working Group to discuss and conduct studies of Angkas’ operations, particularly its safety training program for their motorcycle rider-partners. The pilot run aims to assess the safety level of motorcycle taxis and was recommended by a technical working group created by DOTr to study the issue of legalizing motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Fajardo said that Angkas bikers have also been participating in the HPG’s own Motorcycle Riders Safety training program. “In their own little way, and in line with Angkas’ social responsibility, they send their own riders to join our safety training,” Fajardo noted. He also commended Angkas’ own safety training program. “Maganda nga ang may training dahil magiging katuwang natin sila, magiging example of a disciplined motorcycle rider,” Fajardo stressed. Fajardo also described the HPG’s partnership with Angkas as a joint effort to work for the benefit of the commuters and the motorists. “We work hand in hand for the safety, security and discipline of the motorists,” he stressed. Fajardo also said that the donated helmets will be part of the HPG riders’ new uniform and will be the perfect tandem for the new BMW motorcycles that the HPG riders will soon be driving. Angkas founder and CEO Angeline Tham talked about their partnership with HPG, saying, “HPG is out every day protecting our streets and since safety is also paramount to Angkas, we join them in their effort to make the street safer for the general public.” According to Angkas Regulatory and Public Affairs head George Royeca, the donation is part of their safety advocacy. “Have always been vocal about the company’s advocacy for the safety of both the bikers and the passengers. Our donation to the HPG is in line with that advocacy, and which we hope will, in some way, contribute to the safety of our friends from the HPG as they patrol our highways and make them safe,” Royeca said. “This is just the start of a partnership with HPG which we hope will expand to cover other areas that promote and improve road safety,” he added. Angkas will retrain its 27,000 accredited biker-partners through rigorous riding skills assessments, written tests, and extensive safety training to ensure they meet very high safety standards in preparation for the pilot operation. It intends to train 2,000 drivers a day. “Currently, we have retrained 12,000 drivers so we still need to train additional 15,000 more to fully train the 27,000 before we can launch the pilot,” said Angkas operations head David Medrana. The company will provide special reflectorized vests with side straps to help bikers become more visible at night and aid passengers in holding on to the biker’s waist. Each vest has the biker’s unique ID number ensuring that only officially-registered bikers can take ride bookings. All Angkas biker-partners and their passengers are also insured for every ride. A feedback mechanism is also installed on its mobile app to closely monitor the performance of drivers and quickly address passenger concerns. Royeca hopes that Congress will be able to pass a law that will legalize motorcycle taxis after the six-month pilot run. “I think even before the six months are over, we hope to refile the bill in Congress and in Senate. We hope to have a very healthy dialogue with the committee on public services in Senate and the committee on transportation in Congress so that we can update them on a regular basis on the operations of the pilot program,” Royeca said. The motorcycle ridesharing firm assured passengers that it will not impose fare increases amid the implementation of its safety features. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometers, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila based on the guidelines set by the DOTr. The initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers in Metro Cebu. Angkas will also not add motorcycle taxis during the pilot operation. Motorcycles are currently prohibited from operating as public transport services under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation Code.

Gen. Roberto Fajardo said on Monday. Fajardo said the measures to be implemented in response to President Rodrigo Duterte’s promise to reduce Cubao-Makati travel time from over an hour to five minutes include closing down of all bus terminals along Edsa, transfer of all bus barriers and transfer of motorcycle lane. He said PNP-HPG has been conducting regular meeting with Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Department of Transportation (DOTr), Land Transportation Office (LTO), and Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to discuss the implementation of the measures. “Yung (The) five minutes, this is the order of the President. Sabi ko nga (As I’ve said) we are regularly meeting with DOTr, LTFRB, LTO, MMDA,” Fajardo said in a media interview during the turnover of 50 pieces of motorcycle crash helmets donated by Angkas Philippines to HPG at Camp Crame in Quezon City. “Yan ang utos ni Presidente (That’s the order of the President), we will do our best. Actually, yun ang challenge sa amin. Kapag sinabi ni Presidente, we will do it, ganun lang kasimple sa amin (that’s the challenge for us. What the President has ordered, we will do it. That’s how simple to us),” he added. Fajardo said intensified implementation of traffic rules is another solution to the traffic congestion in Metro Manila, particularly along Edsa. He said at least 50 HPG personnel deputized by the LTO to issue violation tickets will be deployed along Edsa. “Kasama na ang disiplina ng motorist, dineputize kami ng LTO kaya wala kaming gagawin kundi maniket lang ng maniket sa mga magba-violate ng traffic rules (Discipline among motorists is part of it. Since we were deputized by LTO, we will strictly enforce traffic rules by issuing tickets against violators),” Fajardo said. He said the five-minute travel time is possible as they tried it during wee hour simulation for both north and southbound between Makati and Cubao. “Tinira namin, madaling araw nga lang, mga ala-una ng madaling araw walang (we tried it around 1a.m., there is no) traffic from Guadalupe to Cubao both north and southbound,” Fajardo said. Duterte earlier said traffic from Cubao to Makati will improve before the end of the year. The President has been requesting the Congress to grant him emergency powers to solve Metro Manila’s traffic woes. However, the Senate has been hesitant to pass the measure amid corruption concerns.

So if there are safety guidelines that are needed to be tweaked in the middle of the operation of the pilot, we will be tweaking it,” he added. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has approved last May the pilot implementation of motorcycle taxi operations for six months in Metro Manila and Cebu. The pilot run aims to assess the safety level of motorcycle taxis and was recommended by a technical working group created by DOTr to study the issue of legalizing motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Angkas will retrain its 27,000 accredited biker-partners through rigorous riding skills assessments, written tests, and extensive safety training to ensure they meet very high safety standards in preparation for the pilot operation. It intends to train 2,000 drivers a day. “Currently, we have retrained 12,000 drivers so we still need to train additional 15,000 more to fully train the 27,000 before we can launch the pilot,” said Angkas operations head David Medrana. The company will provide special reflectorized vests with side straps to help bikers become more visible at night and aid passengers in holding on to the biker’s waist. Each vest has the biker’s unique ID number ensuring that only officially-registered bikers can take ride bookings. All Angkas biker-partners and their passengers are also insured for every ride. A feedback mechanism is also installed on its mobile app to closely monitor the performance of drivers and quickly address passenger concerns. Royeca hopes that Congress will be able to pass a law that will legalize motorcycle taxis after the six-month pilot run. “I think even before the six months are over, we hope to refile the bill in Congress and in Senate. We hope to have a very healthy dialogue with the Committee on Public Services in Senate and the Committee on Transportation in Congress so that we can update them on a regular basis on the operations of the pilot program,” Royeca said. The motorcycle ridesharing firm assured passengers that it will not impose fare increases amid the implementation of its safety features. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometers, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila based on the guidelines set by the DOTr. The initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers in Metro Cebu. Angkas will also not add motorcycle taxis during the pilot operation. Motorcycles are currently prohibited from operating as public transport services under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation Code.

As of posting, the “Ride! Ride! Ride! to End Communist Insurgency” movement was gathering volunteers along the way via their eight-stop route from the Quezon City Memorial Circle (QCMC) to Edsa Monumento in Caloocan, C4, C3, Roxas Blvd., Mall of Asia, the Eastern Police District area back to QCMC. One of the riders, Ryan Favor, said at least 50 from his group, the Angkas Riders Quezon City chapter, decided to join the motorcade believing this could raise \"awareness\" of the need to end the local communist conflict. Favor said this movement could also help distinguish groups allegedly linked to the communist rebels seeking elective government posts. \"Ngayon lang namin nalaman na 'yong ibang party-list pala kahanay ng CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines - New People's Army). Hindi ko alam kung anong party-lists ang may mga (koneksyon sa) CPP-NPA. Ngayon, at least may idea na kami (We just knew that some party-lists are linked to the CPP-NPA. I didn't know what party-lists are connected with them, but at least know we have an idea),\" he said in an interview. \"Kami sa grupo mag-uusap-usap kami na wala dapat 'yong mga kaanib sa CPP-NPA ang iboboto (After this, we'll discuss the list of party-lists who are tagged as part of the CPP-NPA),\" he added. Jessie Beronila, a 37-year-old biker, shared similar sentiments, saying it is high-time the public take part in the movement against members of the CPP-NPA. \"Para sa amin, ang NPA, number one nating iisipin, kalaban ng gobyerno. Kaya dapat naman talagang putulin 'yan. Kaya dapat makiisa tayo sa ganitong mga advocacy (For us, the NPA, number one, is the enemy of the government. That's why we have to stop it. This is why we should participate in advocacies like this),\" he said. Beronila said about 20 from his group volunteered to ride around Metro Manila bearing the banner \"Save our country! No to CPP-NPA-NDF party-list\". The day-long affair was organized by the Bantay Bayan group, founded by Dr. Ben Caralde. The government has repeatedly committed to continue its crusade against groups linked to the CPP-NPA to denounce the atrocities committed by these organizations. In December last year, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order 70, creating the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), which mandates the government bureaucracy to take a \"whole-of-nation approach\" in defeating communist insurgency. Following its establishment, the Department of the Interior and Local Government rallied the country’s 81 provinces “to do their share in bringing local insurgency to its conclusion.\" The CPP-NPA is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

In a statement Friday, Secretary Arthur Tugade has approved the guidelines for the pilot implementation of motorcycle ride-hailing services such as Angkas following its recommendation by a technical working group (TWG) which was created by the department to review the issue of allowing motorcycles as a form of public transportation. The TWG consisting of the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools. “Our approval of the pilot implementation of the motorcycle taxi operations is proof that the government is listening to and addresses the woes, concerns and suggestions of our riding public,” Tugade said. The DOTr created the TWG last December which crafted the general guidelines for the implementation of the pilot run. The transportation chief reminded motorcycle ride-hailing firms to strictly adhere to safety requirements on their operations. Among these requirements are the required wearing of safety gears like helmet, reflectorized vest and vest-based strap or belt; compliance to speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour; proper maintenance of their motorcycle and wearing the appropriate driver’s uniform. Riders must render a maximum of 10 hours of service per day and accident insurance should be provided in an amount which is the same or higher than the Passenger Personal Accident Insurance Program for public utility vehicles. Motorcycle taxis shall have a fare of PHP50 for the first two kilometers, an additional PHP10 per kilometer until seven kilometers, additional PHP15 for succeeding kilometer, and a surge rate cap of 1.5x in Metro Manila. For Metro Cebu, the initial charge will be PHP20 for the first kilometer, an additional PHP20 per kilometer up to eight kilometers, and PHP20 per kilometer for destinations beyond eight kilometers. Motorcycle taxis must only operate through their ride-hailing app platform. A comprehensive data should likewise be submitted to the DOTr to include all incidents of road crash, passenger complaints, trip details and fares collected. The transportation department has also set key performance indicators which include accident threshold, reporting of traffic violations and feedback from regular passengers. “If the total number of major or minor accidents for the duration of the pilot run reaches 5 percent, we will call for an emergency TWG, which will be followed up by an investigation and an appropriate action which may or may not include the suspension of the pilot implementation,” the DOTr statement read. The implementation of the pilot run will serve as the basis for Senator JV Ejercito’s Senate Bill No. 2180 which will allow the use of motorcycles as public utility vehicles. Meanwhile, Angkas said it welcomes the decision of the DOTr to approve the pilot run of the motorcycle taxis and urged legislators to pass a measure allowing motorcycles to operate as a mode of public transportation. “The pilot seeks to aid Congress in its efforts to legislate a proper motorcycle taxi bill, which is now undergoing revisions in the Senate. We hope that the Angkas pilot will serve to show legislators and regulators the viability of this mode of transport so we can fully pass it into a law,” said Angkas Chief Executive Officer Angeline Tham in a separate statement. Motorcycles are currently prohibited to operate as public transport services under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation Code. In December 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) issued a temporary restraining order in favor of the DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) seeking to stop the operations of Angkas run by DBDOYC Inc. The High Court's order voided a September 2018 ruling issued by the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court in favor of Angkas.

This, as the DOTr reiterated that amendments to Republic Act (RA) No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code are needed to allow motorcycles to operate as public transport. The law prohibits motorcycles from operating as public transportation services. “The DOTr has maintained that the best recourse for conversion of motorcycle taxis to public transport is amendment of the law. In fact, this lack of an enabling law is best reiterated by the various proposed bills in the House (of Representatives) and the Senate seeking to allow motorcycle taxis to operate as a public transport mode,” the department said in a statement on Saturday. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to review the issue of allowing motorcycles for public transportation. The TWG was mandated to conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of motorcycles and drivers for public transport service, which include determining the types of motorcycle that can be awarded a franchise, the minimum cubic centimeter (CC) capacity, travel speed, franchise routes, seat and helmet requirements, and training requirements for motorcycle bikers looking to register as a public utility vehicle driver. “Much as it understands the perspective of some lawmakers on the issue of motorcycle taxis operating as public transport, the DOTr also seeks public understanding as its TWG threshes out the numerous concerns involved in the proposal, foremost of which is commuter safety,” the DOTr said. Various lawmakers have called on the DOTr to issue a department order (DO) that would allow motorcycle ride-hailing firms to provide public transport to passengers. They have noted that the transportation department has issued an order in 2015, which introduced the category of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) that allowed private vehicles under transportation network companies to operate as public transportation. The DOTr said issuing a DO to legalize motorcycles-for-hire should be based on existing laws. “According to Republic Act 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code), passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (‘for hire’), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification. On the other hand, RA 4136 clearly does not allow motorcycles to be classified as ‘for hire’ or for public utility,” the department’s statement read. The DOTr said that issuance of a DO will violate the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court against motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas to halt its operations last December, which might lead to filing of contempt charges against transportation officials. “The DOTr wishes to reiterate that it does not intend to antagonize Angkas. In fact, the DOTr has welcomed motorcycle groups in TWG discussions to thresh out the requirements and other contingent issues. These issues are ultimately directed at regulation for passenger safety and nothing else,” it said. The TWG, consisting of the DOTr, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools, has started its deliberations last January 18. The group will submit a report on its deliberations to Congress as inputs for lawmakers to decide on the proposed amendments to RA 4136. The House has approved on second reading a bill that will allow motorcycles to provide public transport earlier this week. House Bill No. 8959 or the Motorcycles for Hire Act will authorize the LTFRB to legalize the operation of motorcycles as public utility vehicles.

The DOTr respects the legislative process this bill will undergo, as government policies are anchored on the power of the law,” the DOTr statement said. While RA 4136 prohibits motorcycles from operating as public transport services, various stakeholders in the transportation sector are pushing for the amendment of the law to enable motorcycles to provide public transport to commuters. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade ordered last December the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to review the issue of making motorcycles as a mode of public transport.

Among other concerns are: whether the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) or local government units will issue the franchises for motorcycles; whether motorcycles may traverse municipal borders; registration of e-bikes or e-motorcycles as motorcycle taxis and safety issues particularly responsibilities and accountabilities in cases of accidents. “It is easy to say that motorcycle taxis are convenient and speedy as they can weave through traffic. However, when accidents involving passengers pile up and no accountabilities are made for the victims’ funeral and hospitalization expenses, should the motorcycle driver or owner be allowed to simply walk away without any measure of responsibility? For the DOTr, passenger safety and security are paramount,” the DOTr’s statement read. “We will listen to all parties, and determine if legalizing motorcycle taxis is what’s best for the riding public,” it added. The TWG, consisting of the DOTr, LTFRB, Land Transportation Office, Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority, and representatives from the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations and law schools, will start deliberations on Friday. The TWG will submit a report on its deliberations to Congress as inputs for lawmakers to decide on the proposed amendments to the Land Transportation Code. The House Committee on Metro Manila Development, on the other hand, urged the DOTr to come up with a department order to regulate motorcycle ride-sharing services like Angkas, while waiting for the amendment of the law defining vehicles suitable for public transport. Lawmakers said there is a need for motorcycle taxis such as Angkas to operate as public transport services amid growing passenger demand. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order last December 5 against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers.

Two Chief Justices in less than a year This year, President Rodrigo Duterte appointed two top magistrates of the High Court following a tumultuous upheaval over its decision last June on questions clouding the leadership of Maria Lourdes Sereno.  Meeting the press for the first time last November, Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin, the SC's 25th top magistrate, vowed to do his best to institute long-standing reforms in the judiciary even as his term will last for only a year. He will reach the mandatory retirement age next year days apart on the same month as Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio. Bersamin, in his public appearances, has echoed calls for dedication in public service by those in the judiciary and urged subordinates to forgo even checking their social media accounts during office hours which he insists are minutes in work which had been paid for by taxpayers. Speaking at a recent event for children in conflict with the law, Bersamin consoled the minors who had run afoul with the law pointing out that rehabilitation and reform is a fresh chance and reminded them not to let it define the rest of their lives. Bersamin is the most senior justice in the judiciary in terms of length of service, at the time of his appointment. He succeeded another veteran, Chief Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro.  De Castro, who served as chief magistrate for less than two months, implemented key programs and projects. These include increasing the monthly salary of first-level court judges all over the country; increasing the cost of living allowance for justices, judges and court personnel for the month of August chargeable to the 80 percent judiciary development fund (JDF) as well as additional grant of rice subsidy allowance for the first and second quarters of this year. She also worked for the creation of technical working groups on planning, budgeting, data reconciliation and evidence management system. De Castro was an associate justice at the high court for 10 years and eight months prior to her appointment as top magistrate. The Sereno debacle and new faces The appointment of Chief Justice de Castro brought to a somber conclusion one of the dramatic turn of events in the high court's history involving its Chief Justice.  What would have been an 18-year term from her appointment by President Benigno Aquino III abruptly ended for Sereno after the Court en banc on May 11, 2018, voted 8-6 , to grant a the petition for quo warranto filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to declare her appointment as void from the beginning for her failure to comply with the mandatory legal requirements for her appointment in 2012. The Court also ruled Sereno was disqualified for the Chief Justice post when she failed to submit her Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) from 2002 to 2011. This year, President Duterte appointed three new members of the SC following the retirement of Chief Justice De Castro, Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr., and the appointment of Associate Justice Samuel Martires as Ombudsman.  These are Court of Appeals Associate Justices Jose Reyes Jr., Ramon Paul Hernando and Rosmari Carandang. Big rulings Earlier in December, the High Court ruled that government agencies can regulate the motorcycle transport-for-hire mobile phone application. In a two-page order dated Dec. 5, the SC's Second Division ruled in favor of a petition filed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) seeking to stop the operations of Angkas run by DBDOYC Inc. This reversed the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court's order dated Aug. 20, 2018 against the LTFRB and in favor of Angkas. In October, the SC upheld the constitutionality of two laws -- Republic Act 10533 (K to 12 Law) and Republic Act 10157 (Kindergarten Education Act, which overhaul the country's basic education system and expanding basic education from 10 to 12 years. The SC denied the consolidated petitions questioning them. RA 10157, or the Kindergarten Education Act insitutionalized kindergarten education, which is one year of preparatory education for children at least five years old, as part of basic education and is made mandatory and compulsory before entering Grade 1. The law was passed in fulfillment of the country's commitments to improve education standards in the country during the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, where 164 governments, including the Philippines, pledged \"Education for All\" goals. Likewise, to adjust to international standards, the K to 12 Law was enacted. Prior to this, the Philippines, along with Djibouti and Angola, were the only countries in the world with a 10-year basic education system. In November, the tribunal upheld the legality of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) memorandum excluding Filipino, Panitikan, and Philippine Constitution among the core subjects in the general education curriculum in college. It held that Section 6, Article XIV of the Constitution on the use of the Filipino language as medium of instruction is not “self-executory.” The SC ruled that the assailed CHED memorandum does not violate any existing laws such as Republic Act 7104 or the Commission on the Filipino Language Act, RA No. 7356 or the Law Creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, and the Education Act of 1982. In criminal law, the Court declared that the “good faith” doctrine it laid down in its previous ruling cannot be used as an absolute defense to escape criminal prosecution for graft. The Court made the clarification in a ruling which affirmed the decision of the Sandiganbayan finding three officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) guilty of several counts of violation of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act involving anomalous transactions for the implementation of the PHP615 million regional and provincial infrastructure projects for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Court had ruled that its earlier ruling that heads of offices may, in good faith, rely to a certain extent on the acts of their subordinates \"who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations\" does not exempt a public official to inquire more closely into transactions he processes when there are circumstances that should have prompted a closer look. In a separate case this year, the SC also allowed the Quezon City government to implement an ordinance increasing the existing fair market values (FMVs) of land, buildings, and other structures in the city from 100 percent to as much as 500 percent. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the petitioner in the case, the Alliance of Quezon City Homeowners' Association, Inc. (AQCHI) has not legal standing to file the suit. In February, the High Court also upheld the legality of the extension of Martial Law in Mindanao until the end of 2018. Voting 10-5, the SC dismissed the four petitions filed by congressmen led by Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman et al; another group led by Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate and Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao, et al; former Commission on Human Rights chair Etta Rosales; and a group led by Christian Monsod, one of the framers of the Constitution seeking to declare the martial law extension in Mindanao as unconstitutional. The Court pointed out that Congress had discretionary authority to formulate, adopt and promulgate its own rules. It also rejected the argument of petitioners that the extension should have only been limited to 60 days, saying the Constitution did not fix a period of duration for such extension and was also actually silent as to how many times the Congress could extend martial law declaration by the President. Even the alleged undue haste in granting the request for extension, according to the Court, cannot be a ground to nullify the extension However, the SC noted that it can only intervene when there is a clear showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of the power such as would constitute a “denial of due process.” The Court explained that it can only step in once there is clear showing of arbitrary and improvident use of such power by Congress under Article VII, Section 18 of the 1987 Constitution, which it said is lacking in this case.

This, as the department urged the firm to have a dialogue to discuss issues related to its operations as a public transportation service. “The DOTr, LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board), and LTO (Land Transportation Office) respectfully complied with the order of the lower court. Angkas, on the other hand, continues to brazenly defy the order of the Supreme Court. Let’s thresh it out,” the DOTr said in its statement on Thursday. “The issue is not about the perpetual prohibition of motorcycles from serving as public transport. This is not about depriving the commuting public of an alternative mode of transportation. Instead, this is a matter of following the order of the Supreme Court, the same kind of obedience demonstrated by the government to the preliminary injunction of the lower court even if that order was not favorable to it,” it added. The Supreme Court has issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) earlier this month against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers, who are lawfully engaging in their trade or profession, based on its mobile application and from performing any act that will impede or obstruct the petitioner’s pursuit of its lawful business or trade as owner and operator of the Angkas mobile application. “If Angkas wants to be heard, it should also learn to listen. Nothing good comes out of defying the law because the law, while existing and unamended, must be respected and followed. As we comply with the law, let us work together to improve legislation in the country, we are willing to talk. We are willing to listen,” the statement read. The DOTr explained that some of the issues that needed to be resolved are: the types of motorcycles to be permitted; acceptable travel speed of motorcycles for hire; whether to allow the motorcycles on all roads or be limited only to secondary roads or areas not serviced by large vehicles such as buses or trucks, among others. “Another integral aspect is safety. How do we ensure the safety of passengers? In the unfortunate instance of an accident involving a passenger, who will shoulder all the expenses? If the driver is injured or dies, what will be the motorcycle owner’s accountability? These details should all be thoroughly studied, and as such, the matter will not be resolved with Angkas’ continued flagrant defiance of the high court’s order,” the statement read. DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered the LTFRB to apprehend Angkas bikers, who deliberately defy the order of the Supreme Court. Angkas bikers and operators proven to have continued their service will be meted a PHP6,000 fine and three-month vehicle impound, and will be blacklisted from securing a franchise with the LTFRB. For its part, Angkas said in an earlier statement that the TRO of the SC will put to risk the livelihood of around 25,000 biker partners that depend on its operations for the daily needs of their families. It also claimed that it has a safety record of 99.997 percent, which may be considered as “a potential model for responsible traffic safety nationwide.” The motorcycle ridesharing firm said it will exert efforts to serve commuters in a safe and efficient manner and legitimize their riders. Motorcycles are not allowed to operate as public transport services under Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.

City administrator Abeth Cuizon said in an interview Thursday that the city government has coordinated with the National Food Authority (NFA) for the said purchase. The money to be used in the purchase will be taken from the PHP15-million budget, which the city council approved last Monday, as emergency assistance to the affected drivers. “We have already talked with the NFA regarding our intention to buy 10,000 sacks of rice. But the problem is, the NFA could not just sell us 10,000 sacks outright,” Cuizon said in Cebuano. She said they learned that there is a process to be followed when it comes to buying a large volume of rice from the NFA. “We still need to ask permission and seek approval from the NFA Central Office to buy the 10,000 units or sacks of rice,” Cuizon said. The city government decided to buy 10,000 sacks of rice as there are approximately more than 6,500 habal-habal and ride-hailing application “Angkas” drivers in the city. Cuizon, however, said they have yet to determine the exact number of affected drivers in the city’s 80 barangays. She said they are now in the process of formulating the procedure and guidelines as to who among the drivers can avail of the assistance.

In a comment filed before the High Court Thursday, DBDOYC Inc., Angkas' mother firm urged the SC to lift the restraining order (TRO) issued by its second division last December 5. The TRO had been granted upon the request of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The LTFRB stopped the operations of Angkas in November last year due to lack of necessary franchise to operate and ruled that the operator should secure franchise from Congress to operate as a public utility vehicle under the Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. The company also sought the dismissal of the petition of LTFRB and Department of Transportation challenging the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court (RTC) last August which stopped the government's apprehension of Angkas riders. It asked the SC to instead affirm the injunction order of the lower court that prohibited the government's transport agencies \"from interfering, whether directly or indirectly\" with Angkas' operations. The Mandaluyong RTC order prevented authorities \"from apprehending Angkas bikers who are in lawful pursuit of their trade or occupation based on petitioner's Angkas mobile application; and from performing any act or acts that will impede, obstruct, frustrate, or defeat [the] petitioner's pursuit of its lawful business or trade as owner and operator of the Angkas mobile application.\" (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1056589","title":"LTFRB to run after Angkas in Cebu","date":" December 13, 2018, 8:29 pm","snippet":"CEBU CITY – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) 7 (Central Visayas) will start apprehending Angkas riders, who will take passengers despite the Supreme Court (SC) ruling restraining a lower court order blocking authorities from apprehending the app-based ride-hailing motorcycles.","body":"CEBU CITY – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) 7 (Central Visayas) will start apprehending Angkas riders, who will take passengers despite the Supreme Court (SC) ruling restraining a lower court order blocking authorities from apprehending the app-based ride-hailing motorcycles. This, as Mayor Tomas Osmeña said Thursday the SC ruling against Angkas is detrimental to the people here where there is no alternative mode of transportation that can serve them, except for motorcycles locally called as “habal-habal.” LTFRB-7 chief Eduardo Montealto Jr. said they will include in their operation the apprehension of “habal-habals” operating in various mountain barangays in Cebu. “From the beginning, the practice of taking passengers using a motorcycle for a fee has been illegal,” he said. Montealto said \"habal-habals\" in the mountain barangays, and even the urban-version Angkas, have no franchise from the government. Under the law, any vehicle that takes passengers for a fee without a permit is illegal and referred to as “colorum”. The lives of passengers taking Angkas are at risk, the LTFRB-7 chief said. Montealto said it is the mandate of the LTFRB to arrest colorum vehicles, including \"habal-habal\" and Angkas. Land Transportation Office-7 chief Victor Caindec told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that they are waiting for a directive from their central office in Manila, following the high tribunal’s decision against Angkas. He, however, said his office is willing to assist LTFRB-7 in apprehending \"habal-habals\" and Angkas operating in the region, particulary in Cebu City where their illegal operation is tolerated by the local government unit. On his social media post, however, Osmeña said “habal-habals, especially in the mountain barangays, are simply a fact of life because no alternative means of transportation exists.” He said even in the urban areas, “there is a shortage of public rides.” \"Habal-habals are used because for many, they are simply the most practical way to get around. What Angkas did is take the shortcomings of habal habals and improve upon them,” the mayor’s post read. According to the mayor, Angkas made the passengers “safer by making drivers identifiable and requiring drivers to provide clean helmets to passengers and install speed limiters in their bikes.” Osmeña also reacted to the issue on overpricing of fare rate being collected by Angkas riders. “They reduced overpricing. They even helped with the traffic by allowing direct pickups instead of having all the bikes wait by the street,\" he added. \"Without 'habal-habals', the majority living in Cebu City’s two dozen mountain barangays will have no means of transportation,” he said. “We are also exploring the legality of an LGU producing it’s own Angkas-like program to make up for the loss of Angkas. We will do everything we can to benefit the public good.” On Wednesday, the high court issued a temporary restraining order against a decision of the Regional Trial Court Branch 213 in Mandaluyong that barred authorities from apprehending drivers operating under Angkas. Department of Transportation (DOTr) Communications Director Goddes Liberan said in a report that the department has welcomed the high tribunal’s decision, saying “it is in line with our efforts to prioritize the safety and security of the riding public through proper implementation of the law.” (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1056609","title":"LTFRB starts crackdown vs. Angkas bikers ","date":" December 13, 2018, 7:40 pm","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday began apprehending bikers of the motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, following the decision of Supreme Court to suspend its operations.","body":"MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday began apprehending bikers of the motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, following the decision of Supreme Court to suspend its operations.

Cesar Sarmiento also attended the meeting. “We explained the limitations of enforcement and regulatory bodies, the reason angkas and other habal-habal cannot be legalized yet. We also provided the angkas management an opportunity to present their business design. We want their business design to be compliant with the law,” Lizada said in a text message to reporters. The LTFRB official added the House Transportation Committee is considering conducting a dialogue with the habal-habal drivers early next year. The Board is leaving the decision up to Congress to craft a law that will legalize ridesharing on motorcycles. “It is Congress who can change the law because we are only enforcing what the law currently states,” Lizada said.

Angkas apologized to the riding public for any inconveniences that the suspension of operations may cause. “Allow me to sincerely apologize to both the Board and the public for this unfortunate situation but hope that this can be the beginning of progressive and open discussions with the government for the benefit of our riding public,” Angeline Tham and David Medrana of Angkas wrote in a letter to the LTFRB. Angkas said it intends to provide “a professional and safer way to ride motorcycles as a taxi service”. It said the company provides its bikers safety and customer service training and requires them to pass background checks, skills assessment exams and hold professional drivers license. Its rides are also covered by personal accident insurance for driver and passenger. “We fear that habal-habal will only persist and without proper regulation, this would prove to be more dangerous to the commuting public. Only through cooperation with government can we achieve a truly safer solution to the Filipino people,” Angkas said. “We humbly seek an audience to share more about Angkas, to understand more of LTFRB’s plans for modernization and regulation, and to discuss with how a willing company such as ours can hopefully continue to contribute to the betterment and modernization of transportation, not only in Metro Manila but in other cities in the country as well,” it added. Angkas urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to consider amending Department Order 2015-011 to allow two-wheeled vehicles under the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) category. The department order lumps group sedans, Asian utility vehicles, sports utility vehicles, vans, or other similar vehicles in the TNVS category. Last November 9, the Makati City local government has closed down the operations of Angkas’ office in the city after it has been found to be operating without a business permit following its joint inspection with the LTFRB. The LTFRB likewise apprehended 19 Angkas motorcycle riders in a joint anti-colorum operations with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the PNP Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG). (PNA)"}]}
