Lockdowns have increased online consumer activity, similar to the SARS episode in 2003, which was a turning point for China’s e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com,” Maybank Kim Eng analysts Lee Ju Ye and Chua Hak Bin said in an April 20 report titled “Consumer Behavior During a Pandemic.”  Citing Google’s COVID-19 community mobility reports, usage of retail and recreation facilities such as restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas plunged 82 percent in the Philippines from Feb. 29 to April 11, compared to the baseline period covering Jan. 3 to Feb. 6. Also, Filipinos frequented groceries and pharmacies less often, as mobility dropped to 60 percent during the same period.  Mobility to workplaces declined 67 percent; via transit stations and public transport hubs such as bus and train stations, down 86 percent; and in parks and beaches, 59 percent. “Based on data compiled by Google’s COVID-19 community mobile reports, the Philippines and Malaysia—among the first countries to impose lockdowns—are showing the steepest declines in people movements,” Maybank said.  Maybank noted that food delivery services had a low penetration rate in Asean—for instance, only 5.5 percent in the Philippines last year, but “with the ban on dine-in services, more food merchants are signing up with delivery platforms such as GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.” The Philippine government had allowed these food delivery services to continue amid the enhanced community quarantine imposed in Luzon and other parts of the country, which started in mid-March and would end by April 30. The newfound habit of ordering food online or through mobile apps was expected to spill over to a wider array of goods and services offered on the internet, Maybank said. “Asean’s e-commerce penetration is relatively low, but will likely rise significantly due to COVID-19. Online sales account for 4 percent in Indonesia and the Philippines, 4.4 percent in Thailand, 4.7 percent in Malaysia and 9 percent in Singapore, based on data from Euromonitor. This is well below the 30-percent rate in South Korea and China, and 13 percent in the US,” it said. On the flip side, Maybank said that “the ‘sharing economy’ tech players, after enjoying several years of generous venture capital funding, will be the worst hit.”  “Bookings on Airbnb have plunged by over 90 percent in some markets, and online searches for ‘Airbnb,’ ‘Booking.com’ and ‘AirAsia’ have fallen to record lows across Asean. Co-working space is another major casualty, as tenants halt payments and break leases. Ride hailing platforms face a plunge in ridership, but drivers are shifting to other types of work such as food delivery and logistics. Grab and Gojek are burning cash to provide financial support to drivers in order to maintain their fleet for the ensuing recovery,” it noted. On a lighter note, while most Filipinos stayed at home during the ongoing lockdown, consumers mostly searched for food and entertainment as well as details of the government’s social amelioration program on Google. From March 18 to April 16, the top Google searches in the Philippines included “Dalgona coffee,” “SAC (social amelioration card) form,” “Dalgona Milo,” “Netflix mobile plan,” “Vindale research” (paid surveys at home), “grocery store,” “Goldilocks Bakeshop,” “Minecraft,” and “recipe,” Maybank noted. Searches for “masks” and “thermometers” also climbed across Asean since the pandemic started during the last week of January.

However, they struggle to establish a stronghold in terms of actual selling activity as international players are still the preferred choice for most Filipinos.  It comes as a surprise that only a few international players dominate the country’s e-marketplace traffic activity. Based on Kuala Lumpur-based iPrice Group’s Map of eCommerce in the Philippines during the second quarter of 2018, there were more local active players.  However, international players fueled market activity. In fact, the share of foreign players in the overall traffic accounted for 93 percent of the overall e-marketplace activity. Local players, on the other hand, only led in social media activity as they accounted for 75 percent of e-commerce activity from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter platforms. Foreign players  There were only eight foreign players engaged in e-commerce traffic in the Philippines: Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, eBay, Sephora, Sophie Paris, My Sale and Melissa Philippines. Of these eight players, Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and eBay were the top four most visited e-marketplaces in the country. Of the four, Lazada had a dominant 68-percent market share, at least triple the size of its closest competitor, Shopee. This trend is unique to the Philippine market because in its regional counterparts Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, foreign players have less than half of the overall e-marketplace traffic activity with 45, 20 and 47 percent, respectively. For Indonesia and Singapore, local players Tokopedia and Qoo10 were the most visited e-marketplaces.  The reason behind the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was traced to the Filipinos’ online shopping preference that is mainly based on brand familiarity. In fact, according to a Kantar Worldpanel survey, 84 percent of Filipinos (out of 3,000 household surveyed) preferred to buy from established companies despite the alternatives available in the market. This specific Filipino consumer behavior affected the local e-commerce players as majority of them have just started operating in the e-marketplace. Another factor that influenced the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was that majority of big local brick-and-mortar companies such as SM and Ayala malls were amplifying their online presence with e-marketplace partnerships with the more established players such as Lazada and Zalora instead of creating their own e-marketplaces. Meanwhile, the government’s project—road map of e-commerce—is mostly tied with international e-marketplaces wherein local brick-and-mortal companies and brands as well as MSMEs are encouraged to sell. More pressure While this will result in more customers and more jobs especially for MSMEs, it is putting pressure on the local players. The most visited local e-marketplace in the country is BeautyMNL, placing fifth overall with less than a million traffic. Meanwhile, Kimstore, a tech marketplace, placed ninth. The general e-marketplaces—Galleon, O Shopping and Takatack (which were previously in Q1 2018’s top e-commerce) all fell a notch, placing seventh, eighth and 11th, respectively. The only local e-commerce that accelerated in terms of ranking was Argomall as it jumped two notches to sixth in the overall e-commerce ranking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Interestingly, the majority of local players experienced inconsistency in traffic as there were occasions of leaps and slips. The e-marketplaces that saw increased traffic were Seek the Unique, Apartment 8 Clothing, Zeus, Straight Forward Clothing, Great Value Plus, Bayan Mall, TV Shop, Mall Hallo Hallo and CesaPH, which on the average rose in ranking by about seven notches. E-marketplaces that slipped in traffic were Adobomall, Watch Portal, Goods, Mommy Mundo, Bigmk, Abubot, which on the average declined in ranking by about eight notches. Despite the low market penetration and inconsistency in traffic of local players, the majority of local players found their market in social media. Overall, the local players dominated Instagram and Twitter as they attracted 70 and 51 percent, respectively, of the e-marketplace social media followers. Local marketplace The local fashion and beauty e-marketplaces: Apartment 8 Clothing, Sunnies Studios, BeautyMNL, Kimstore and CesaPH topped Instagram placing first, second, fifth, seventh and ninth, respectively. Meanwhile, social media activity for Facebook was taken over by international players as their share of social media followers in this platform accounted for 77 percent. Filipino consumers are among the most active on social media, spending an average of four hours a day. As such, Filipino consumers are highly exposed to brands leveraging their products in social media. Clearly, the popularity of social media is a huge opportunity marketplace for e-commerce and independent merchants alike.—CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/302382/govt-eyes-support-for-e-commerce-boom","title":"Gov’t eyes support for e-commerce boom","date":"05:00 AM July 11, 2020","snippet":"The country’s economic planners are pushing reforms in the e-commerce sector amid the boom in digital services but the government warned that increased transactions on the internet may also result in an increase in cybercrimes.","body":"The country’s economic planners are pushing reforms in the e-commerce sector amid the boom in digital services but the government warned that increased transactions on the internet may also result in an increase in cybercrimes. But first, the Philippines has to catch up with neighboring countries in terms of broadband penetration and digital adoption because it still has one of the slowest internet speeds in Southeast Asia although it has the most expensive pricing.  Undersecretary Rosemarie G. Edillon of the National Economic Development Authority (Neda) said these reforms can be done by opening the telco sector through amendments in the foreign investment and public service laws as well as the pending open access in data transmission bill. Edillon said the reforms would “reduce the digital divide by lowering barriers to market entry and increase available spectrum for internet connectivity” as well as “streamline permit requirements for network deployment to reduce cost.”  Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua stressed that “digital technology can significantly increase efficiency in business operations and public service delivery.” “Online transactions will now become the new standard for engaging with clients, buyers, and suppliers, therefore, both public and private sectors need to invest in digital technology,” he told journalists in an online briefing on Friday.  “We need to maximize the benefits of greater use of technology in supporting the agriculture value chain through projects such as the Department of Agriculture’s eKADIWA, an online marketing platform that directly links producers and agri-entrepreneurs to consumers, as well as the Supply Chain Analytics (SCAn) Dashboard and the SCAn Reporter,” Chua added. But Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III warned consumers that the current e-commerce boom may also result in increased crimes on the internet “With more commercial transactions going through cyberspace, expect a spike in cybercrime,” Dominguez said. “The Philippine National Police and the Department of Justice have been alerted and have assured me that they have upgraded their capacity to detect, investigate and prosecute cybercriminals,” Dominguez he added. In a July 9 report titled “Cyber risk rises as coronavirus drives increased digital banking and remote work,” debt watcher Moody’s Investors Service said “large-scale shift to digital banking and remote work has accelerated the technology cycle and increased banks’ vulnerability to cyberattacks.”"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/109107/ecommerce-pioneers-establish-integrative-online-pharmacy-and-health-platform-mediclick","title":"ECommerce pioneers establish integrative online pharmacy and health platform","date":"06:15 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"A handful of the country’s top eCommerce executives recently consolidated to establish Mediclick PH, a new online-only pharmacy and health platform that aims to make the shift to online medicine as comprehensive and convenient as possible.","body":"A handful of the country’s top eCommerce executives recently consolidated to establish Mediclick PH, a new online-only pharmacy and health platform that aims to make the shift to online medicine as comprehensive and convenient as possible.  “The current pandemic has dramatically changed the way we go about our daily business. Some of the most affected are those who need medicine, whether for maintenance, serious conditions, or general wellness,” noted Tina Sabarre, founder and CEO of Mediclick PH. “While other local pharmacies offer online retail services, there are still apparent customer adversities when it comes to fulfilling pharmaceutical needs remotely and efficiently,” she added. At present, the Philippine pharmaceutical retail sector is dominated by large drugstore chains that have physical stores across the country. Accordingly, over 99% of consumer sales are off-line, in-store transactions.   Mediclick PH hopes to encourage more customers, especially those who are unable to go out due to quarantine restrictions, to purchase their supplements and medicine through online means. “We are confident that our vast experience and expertise in eCommerce will provide our  customers with the most seamless online pharmacy experience,” Sabarre emphasized. Sabarre is the former country manager of Luxasia, and former country retail director of Johnson & Johnson. She is backed by angel investors and e-commerce luminaries such as Paulo Campos, eCommerce pioneer and founder of Zalora Philippines; Constantin Robertz, co-founder of Locad and former Zalora managing director, formerly Entrego and Rocket Internet; and JM Aujero, former VP of MYNT and Chief Sales Officer of BPI Direct BanKo. Also backing Mediclick PH is IP-Biotech Inc., a thought-leader in the local pharmaceutical and biological sector. IP-Biotech recently helped to bring in much needed COVID19 vaccines into the Philippines, including Coronavac (Sinovac), with more pharmaceutical solutions in the pipeline. “We see the convergence of first principles with Mediclick,” said IP-Biotech Chairman Enrique Gonzalez. “Mediclick is led by a strong team with both e-commerce and pharmaceutical experience, perfect timing in solving a major pain point for consumers, and innovation in the regulatory environment allowing online pharma. We believe Mediclick has the potential to become one of leading eCommerce players in the country,” he added.” Currently, Mediclick PH provides online shopping and delivery of medicines, but according to Sabarre, their vision for the platform extends beyond this service. “Our ability to get data and build analytics around it will allow us to move towards a more customized service for the patients and consumers,” Sabarre explained. “We are looking at a future where our platform can integrate seamlessly with the telehealth revolution and collaborate with other health tech companies that can provide more specialized healthcare solutions for the patient. Mediclick will then close the loop and fulfill the prescriptions or health protocols that the patient may need,” she concluded.

The launch of Trunc.ph on Nov. 6 forms part of SSI’s goal to scale up retail sales from digital channels to 15-20 percent of its total business in three years, SSI president Anton Huang said at a briefing on Tuesday.  E-commerce sales accounted for 5 percent of SSI’s total sales in the first nine months of this year as online sales surged by 300 percent. In the third quarter alone, the share of online sales rose to 8 percent of SSI’s total turnover. Trunc.ph is seen to bring in big-ticket sales from brands that cater to affluent consumers such as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Loewe, Burberry, Ferragamo, Jimmy Choo, Tory Burch, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Muji, Lush, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein Jeans and Lacoste.  “The way we see retail in the future is that e-commerce and physical retail are one and the same. It’s part of the chain, part of the cycle, part of the inventory … We’re giving our consumers options in terms of the way they want to shop in our stores and for our merchandise, be it physi­cally, digitally or a combination of both,” Huang said. With the shutdown of its stores from March 15 to end of May this year—as the government put Metro Manila and other key regions under quarantine—SSI’s sales fell by about 50 percent. Since the reopening of the economy, however, it has reported a steady sales growth week by week.  For some brands, sales for the month of October have even exceeded their sales from year-ago levels, Huang said. “We’re seeing a nice uptick in sales and hoping that this continues as the economy opens up,” he said. As far as market segments are concerned, the pandemic has gnawed more on the mass-based brands as the current economic recession translated to record-high job losses and reduction in consumers’ purchasing power. However, Huang said the upper-middle to the upscale brands have driven the steady recovery of sales. This year, the lockdowns took off a big chunk of SSI’s seasonal sales in the second and third quarters. During normal teams, retail sales would usually surge during the period due to the summer vacation, followed by the back-to-school season. At the very least, Huang said “we’re seeing some light a the end of the tunnel.” To date, SSI has reopened 99 percent of its nationwide store network while the rest will reopen within this month. The retailer counts on its over 1.7 million customers to support Trunc.ph.  Pricing of merchandise goods sold through this new platform will track the pricing structure at the physical stores. Delivery to customers is expected within three to 15 days. This multibrand marketplace is seen to complement SSI’s 10 existing brand-specific sites."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316807/dti-roadmap-aims-to-double-e-commerce-contribution-to-economy","title":"DTI roadmap aims to double e-commerce contribution to economy","date":"04:04 AM February 01, 2021","snippet":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) seeks to double the contribution of e-commerce to the economy to P1.2 trillion by 2022, from nearly P600 billion in 2020.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez announced this target as he unveiled last Friday the latest roadmap for the e-commerce sector, which played a critical role during the pandemic.","body":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) seeks to double the contribution of e-commerce to the economy to P1.2 trillion by 2022, from nearly P600 billion in 2020.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez announced this target as he unveiled last Friday the latest roadmap for the e-commerce sector, which played a critical role during the pandemic. “From a baseline of P599 billion that e-commerce contributed to our economy in 2020—equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP (gross domestic product)—our target is to increase this to P850 billion by 2021 or 4.3 percent of GDP and P1.2 trillion or 5.5 percent of GDP by 2022,” Lopez said in an online event. The DTI, however, could not say how much e-commerce grew last year compared to previous years’ levels.  In the earlier roadmap, the DTI said e-commerce contributed 10 percent of the GDP in 2015, which it was hoping to raise to 25 percent by 2020, a copy of the publicly available document showed. DTI’s latest roadmap, however, showed the sector’s share to 2020 GDP at only 3.4 precent of GDP—smaller than in 2015—despite the boom in e-commerce during the pandemic. When asked to reconcile the difference between the two, Lopez did not give a clear answer. In a viber message, he was asked if this meant the share of e-commerce to GDP shrunk last year. To this he answered:  “No. The difference is in the definition. [In 2016], the team that did the first run [made]very few references and methodologies for measuring the contribution of e-commerce to GDP. Now there are a lot of cooperation and efforts in measuring e-commerce,” he said. “We believe we now have a more precise way of measuring the contribution [of e-commerce to the economy] and make projections accordingly,” he added. In a press conference, Lopez was again asked how the numbers should be put in context. He answered, “what’s important is not the number, but the actions that would be undertaken.” INQ"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/295234/ph-e-commerce-gains-during-covid-19-lockdown","title":"PH e-commerce gains during COVID-19 lockdown","date":"11:44 AM April 21, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The COVID-19 global pandemic and the resulting lockdowns to contain the disease, including in the Philippines, so far inflicted a “brutal blow” on the growing “sharing economy,” but benefitted the industry of e-commerce in Asean, Malaysian financial giant Maybank said.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The COVID-19 global pandemic and the resulting lockdowns to contain the disease, including in the Philippines, so far inflicted a “brutal blow” on the growing “sharing economy,” but benefitted the industry of e-commerce in Asean, Malaysian financial giant Maybank said. “Lockdowns and quarantines have reduced people mobility, with traffic plunging by as much as 80 percent in Malaysia and the Philippines, and 60 percent in Singapore and Vietnam.

However, they struggle to establish a stronghold in terms of actual selling activity as international players are still the preferred choice for most Filipinos.  It comes as a surprise that only a few international players dominate the country’s e-marketplace traffic activity. Based on Kuala Lumpur-based iPrice Group’s Map of eCommerce in the Philippines during the second quarter of 2018, there were more local active players.  However, international players fueled market activity. In fact, the share of foreign players in the overall traffic accounted for 93 percent of the overall e-marketplace activity. Local players, on the other hand, only led in social media activity as they accounted for 75 percent of e-commerce activity from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter platforms. Foreign players  There were only eight foreign players engaged in e-commerce traffic in the Philippines: Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, eBay, Sephora, Sophie Paris, My Sale and Melissa Philippines. Of these eight players, Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and eBay were the top four most visited e-marketplaces in the country. Of the four, Lazada had a dominant 68-percent market share, at least triple the size of its closest competitor, Shopee. This trend is unique to the Philippine market because in its regional counterparts Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, foreign players have less than half of the overall e-marketplace traffic activity with 45, 20 and 47 percent, respectively. For Indonesia and Singapore, local players Tokopedia and Qoo10 were the most visited e-marketplaces.  The reason behind the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was traced to the Filipinos’ online shopping preference that is mainly based on brand familiarity. In fact, according to a Kantar Worldpanel survey, 84 percent of Filipinos (out of 3,000 household surveyed) preferred to buy from established companies despite the alternatives available in the market. This specific Filipino consumer behavior affected the local e-commerce players as majority of them have just started operating in the e-marketplace. Another factor that influenced the dominance of international players in the Philippine e-marketplace was that majority of big local brick-and-mortar companies such as SM and Ayala malls were amplifying their online presence with e-marketplace partnerships with the more established players such as Lazada and Zalora instead of creating their own e-marketplaces. Meanwhile, the government’s project—road map of e-commerce—is mostly tied with international e-marketplaces wherein local brick-and-mortal companies and brands as well as MSMEs are encouraged to sell. More pressure While this will result in more customers and more jobs especially for MSMEs, it is putting pressure on the local players. The most visited local e-marketplace in the country is BeautyMNL, placing fifth overall with less than a million traffic. Meanwhile, Kimstore, a tech marketplace, placed ninth. The general e-marketplaces—Galleon, O Shopping and Takatack (which were previously in Q1 2018’s top e-commerce) all fell a notch, placing seventh, eighth and 11th, respectively. The only local e-commerce that accelerated in terms of ranking was Argomall as it jumped two notches to sixth in the overall e-commerce ranking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Interestingly, the majority of local players experienced inconsistency in traffic as there were occasions of leaps and slips. The e-marketplaces that saw increased traffic were Seek the Unique, Apartment 8 Clothing, Zeus, Straight Forward Clothing, Great Value Plus, Bayan Mall, TV Shop, Mall Hallo Hallo and CesaPH, which on the average rose in ranking by about seven notches. E-marketplaces that slipped in traffic were Adobomall, Watch Portal, Goods, Mommy Mundo, Bigmk, Abubot, which on the average declined in ranking by about eight notches. Despite the low market penetration and inconsistency in traffic of local players, the majority of local players found their market in social media. Overall, the local players dominated Instagram and Twitter as they attracted 70 and 51 percent, respectively, of the e-marketplace social media followers. Local marketplace The local fashion and beauty e-marketplaces: Apartment 8 Clothing, Sunnies Studios, BeautyMNL, Kimstore and CesaPH topped Instagram placing first, second, fifth, seventh and ninth, respectively. Meanwhile, social media activity for Facebook was taken over by international players as their share of social media followers in this platform accounted for 77 percent. Filipino consumers are among the most active on social media, spending an average of four hours a day. As such, Filipino consumers are highly exposed to brands leveraging their products in social media. Clearly, the popularity of social media is a huge opportunity marketplace for e-commerce and independent merchants alike.—CONTRIBUTED"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/302382/govt-eyes-support-for-e-commerce-boom","title":"Gov’t eyes support for e-commerce boom","date":"05:00 AM July 11, 2020","snippet":"The country’s economic planners are pushing reforms in the e-commerce sector amid the boom in digital services but the government warned that increased transactions on the internet may also result in an increase in cybercrimes.","body":"The country’s economic planners are pushing reforms in the e-commerce sector amid the boom in digital services but the government warned that increased transactions on the internet may also result in an increase in cybercrimes. But first, the Philippines has to catch up with neighboring countries in terms of broadband penetration and digital adoption because it still has one of the slowest internet speeds in Southeast Asia although it has the most expensive pricing.  Undersecretary Rosemarie G. Edillon of the National Economic Development Authority (Neda) said these reforms can be done by opening the telco sector through amendments in the foreign investment and public service laws as well as the pending open access in data transmission bill. Edillon said the reforms would “reduce the digital divide by lowering barriers to market entry and increase available spectrum for internet connectivity” as well as “streamline permit requirements for network deployment to reduce cost.”  Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua stressed that “digital technology can significantly increase efficiency in business operations and public service delivery.” “Online transactions will now become the new standard for engaging with clients, buyers, and suppliers, therefore, both public and private sectors need to invest in digital technology,” he told journalists in an online briefing on Friday.  “We need to maximize the benefits of greater use of technology in supporting the agriculture value chain through projects such as the Department of Agriculture’s eKADIWA, an online marketing platform that directly links producers and agri-entrepreneurs to consumers, as well as the Supply Chain Analytics (SCAn) Dashboard and the SCAn Reporter,” Chua added. But Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III warned consumers that the current e-commerce boom may also result in increased crimes on the internet “With more commercial transactions going through cyberspace, expect a spike in cybercrime,” Dominguez said. “The Philippine National Police and the Department of Justice have been alerted and have assured me that they have upgraded their capacity to detect, investigate and prosecute cybercriminals,” Dominguez he added. In a July 9 report titled “Cyber risk rises as coronavirus drives increased digital banking and remote work,” debt watcher Moody’s Investors Service said “large-scale shift to digital banking and remote work has accelerated the technology cycle and increased banks’ vulnerability to cyberattacks.”"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/109107/ecommerce-pioneers-establish-integrative-online-pharmacy-and-health-platform-mediclick","title":"ECommerce pioneers establish integrative online pharmacy and health platform","date":"06:15 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"A handful of the country’s top eCommerce executives recently consolidated to establish Mediclick PH, a new online-only pharmacy and health platform that aims to make the shift to online medicine as comprehensive and convenient as possible.","body":"A handful of the country’s top eCommerce executives recently consolidated to establish Mediclick PH, a new online-only pharmacy and health platform that aims to make the shift to online medicine as comprehensive and convenient as possible.  “The current pandemic has dramatically changed the way we go about our daily business. Some of the most affected are those who need medicine, whether for maintenance, serious conditions, or general wellness,” noted Tina Sabarre, founder and CEO of Mediclick PH. “While other local pharmacies offer online retail services, there are still apparent customer adversities when it comes to fulfilling pharmaceutical needs remotely and efficiently,” she added. At present, the Philippine pharmaceutical retail sector is dominated by large drugstore chains that have physical stores across the country. Accordingly, over 99% of consumer sales are off-line, in-store transactions.   Mediclick PH hopes to encourage more customers, especially those who are unable to go out due to quarantine restrictions, to purchase their supplements and medicine through online means. “We are confident that our vast experience and expertise in eCommerce will provide our  customers with the most seamless online pharmacy experience,” Sabarre emphasized. Sabarre is the former country manager of Luxasia, and former country retail director of Johnson & Johnson. She is backed by angel investors and e-commerce luminaries such as Paulo Campos, eCommerce pioneer and founder of Zalora Philippines; Constantin Robertz, co-founder of Locad and former Zalora managing director, formerly Entrego and Rocket Internet; and JM Aujero, former VP of MYNT and Chief Sales Officer of BPI Direct BanKo. Also backing Mediclick PH is IP-Biotech Inc., a thought-leader in the local pharmaceutical and biological sector. IP-Biotech recently helped to bring in much needed COVID19 vaccines into the Philippines, including Coronavac (Sinovac), with more pharmaceutical solutions in the pipeline. “We see the convergence of first principles with Mediclick,” said IP-Biotech Chairman Enrique Gonzalez. “Mediclick is led by a strong team with both e-commerce and pharmaceutical experience, perfect timing in solving a major pain point for consumers, and innovation in the regulatory environment allowing online pharma. We believe Mediclick has the potential to become one of leading eCommerce players in the country,” he added.” Currently, Mediclick PH provides online shopping and delivery of medicines, but according to Sabarre, their vision for the platform extends beyond this service. “Our ability to get data and build analytics around it will allow us to move towards a more customized service for the patients and consumers,” Sabarre explained. “We are looking at a future where our platform can integrate seamlessly with the telehealth revolution and collaborate with other health tech companies that can provide more specialized healthcare solutions for the patient. Mediclick will then close the loop and fulfill the prescriptions or health protocols that the patient may need,” she concluded.

The launch of Trunc.ph on Nov. 6 forms part of SSI’s goal to scale up retail sales from digital channels to 15-20 percent of its total business in three years, SSI president Anton Huang said at a briefing on Tuesday.  E-commerce sales accounted for 5 percent of SSI’s total sales in the first nine months of this year as online sales surged by 300 percent. In the third quarter alone, the share of online sales rose to 8 percent of SSI’s total turnover. Trunc.ph is seen to bring in big-ticket sales from brands that cater to affluent consumers such as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Loewe, Burberry, Ferragamo, Jimmy Choo, Tory Burch, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Muji, Lush, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein Jeans and Lacoste.  “The way we see retail in the future is that e-commerce and physical retail are one and the same. It’s part of the chain, part of the cycle, part of the inventory … We’re giving our consumers options in terms of the way they want to shop in our stores and for our merchandise, be it physi­cally, digitally or a combination of both,” Huang said. With the shutdown of its stores from March 15 to end of May this year—as the government put Metro Manila and other key regions under quarantine—SSI’s sales fell by about 50 percent. Since the reopening of the economy, however, it has reported a steady sales growth week by week.  For some brands, sales for the month of October have even exceeded their sales from year-ago levels, Huang said. “We’re seeing a nice uptick in sales and hoping that this continues as the economy opens up,” he said. As far as market segments are concerned, the pandemic has gnawed more on the mass-based brands as the current economic recession translated to record-high job losses and reduction in consumers’ purchasing power. However, Huang said the upper-middle to the upscale brands have driven the steady recovery of sales. This year, the lockdowns took off a big chunk of SSI’s seasonal sales in the second and third quarters. During normal teams, retail sales would usually surge during the period due to the summer vacation, followed by the back-to-school season. At the very least, Huang said “we’re seeing some light a the end of the tunnel.” To date, SSI has reopened 99 percent of its nationwide store network while the rest will reopen within this month. The retailer counts on its over 1.7 million customers to support Trunc.ph.  Pricing of merchandise goods sold through this new platform will track the pricing structure at the physical stores. Delivery to customers is expected within three to 15 days. This multibrand marketplace is seen to complement SSI’s 10 existing brand-specific sites."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316807/dti-roadmap-aims-to-double-e-commerce-contribution-to-economy","title":"DTI roadmap aims to double e-commerce contribution to economy","date":"04:04 AM February 01, 2021","snippet":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) seeks to double the contribution of e-commerce to the economy to P1.2 trillion by 2022, from nearly P600 billion in 2020.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez announced this target as he unveiled last Friday the latest roadmap for the e-commerce sector, which played a critical role during the pandemic.","body":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) seeks to double the contribution of e-commerce to the economy to P1.2 trillion by 2022, from nearly P600 billion in 2020.Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez announced this target as he unveiled last Friday the latest roadmap for the e-commerce sector, which played a critical role during the pandemic. “From a baseline of P599 billion that e-commerce contributed to our economy in 2020—equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP (gross domestic product)—our target is to increase this to P850 billion by 2021 or 4.3 percent of GDP and P1.2 trillion or 5.5 percent of GDP by 2022,” Lopez said in an online event. The DTI, however, could not say how much e-commerce grew last year compared to previous years’ levels.  In the earlier roadmap, the DTI said e-commerce contributed 10 percent of the GDP in 2015, which it was hoping to raise to 25 percent by 2020, a copy of the publicly available document showed. DTI’s latest roadmap, however, showed the sector’s share to 2020 GDP at only 3.4 precent of GDP—smaller than in 2015—despite the boom in e-commerce during the pandemic. When asked to reconcile the difference between the two, Lopez did not give a clear answer. In a viber message, he was asked if this meant the share of e-commerce to GDP shrunk last year. To this he answered:  “No. The difference is in the definition. [In 2016], the team that did the first run [made]very few references and methodologies for measuring the contribution of e-commerce to GDP. Now there are a lot of cooperation and efforts in measuring e-commerce,” he said. “We believe we now have a more precise way of measuring the contribution [of e-commerce to the economy] and make projections accordingly,” he added. In a press conference, Lopez was again asked how the numbers should be put in context. He answered, “what’s important is not the number, but the actions that would be undertaken.” INQ"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/183539/sm-retail-launches-e-commerce-platform","title":"SM Retail launches e-commerce platform","date":"05:01 AM December 15, 2014","snippet":"The country’s biggest retailer SM has unveiled an e-commerce platform to capture a burgeoning interest in online shopping in the digital age especially among younger consumers.","body":"The country’s biggest retailer SM has unveiled an e-commerce platform to capture a burgeoning interest in online shopping in the digital age especially among younger consumers.

The new online shopping site showcases men’s, women’s and children’s accessories, apparel, bags and shoes as well as luggage and gift ideas. The SM Store offers door-to-door deliveries to most parts of the Philippines through its logistics partners.  Another option for shoppers is to pick up their purchases at SM North Edsa 24 hours after they have placed their orders online. The SM Store is further enhancing this option in due course through possible pick-up points in all Metro Manila and Luzon SM stores after two working days. In Visayas and Mindanao, the SM Store will eventually extend the pick-up arrangements in their branches in Mandurriao, Bacolod, Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro and General Santos.

The participants at the conference, held in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, said African countries should partner and draw lessons from China to navigate the current IT infrastructure challenges to develop a digital economy.  According to the World Economic Forum, more than 40 per cent of the world’s e-commerce transactions currently take place in China, compared with a mere 1 per cent a decade ago. The country’s dominance is attributed to the explosion in use of mobile payments, which soared from 25 percent of mobile internet users in 2013 to 68 percent in 2016. Africa on the other hand, recorded 21 million online shoppers in 2017, which is less than 2 percent of the world total, according to Africa eCommerce Week’s Nairobi manifesto. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that the B2C e-commerce market in Africa was $5.7 billion in 2017, which corresponds to less than 0.5 percent of GDP, far below the world average of over 4 percent.  The manifesto states that only 10 percent of the population in some of the African countries have access to the internet, while a large portion of the population still unserved. Nevertheless, more and more micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are recognizing the importance of digitalization in efforts to participate in domestic and international value chains. Cavince Adhere, Senior Deputy Corporate Communications Officer at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, said the fact that over 40 percent of the world’s commerce is taking place in China, makes it clear that the country is a model worth learning from.  He said African countries like Kenya, which have experienced a revolution in mobile money services, have an advantage in terms of harnessing the potential of e-commerce, especially in the wake of increased mobile phone penetration and internet access. “High mobile phone penetration, ease of internet access, specialized e-commerce zones, and increasingly avid users of the internet and mobile platforms for transactions are the key factors that aided e-commerce expansion in China. African countries can borrow from that,” Adhere said. He said African countries should surmount a number of challenges relating to technological innovation, e-commerce value chains and a negative attitude toward paperless transactions. Anna Ekeledo, executive director of AfriLabs, a Pan-African network of over 80 innovation centers across 27 African countries, said there are many opportunities for African countries to work with China on building e-commerce and the digital economy generally. “The ongoing collaboration between China and Africa is quite interesting and one aspect that should be looked at is finding out how to promote the transfer of knowledge, technology, capacity building and digital entrepreneurship,” she said.  Ekeledo said African countries should borrow from China’s initiative of easing the movement of goods and people across all its cities as well as ensuring affordable internet connectivity for everyone. “If African countries implement all the incentives resulting from the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, we will be on our way to exceeding any other continent in terms of e-commerce,” she said. Ekeledo added, there is need for increased online payment connectivity among Africans, IT infrastructure development, and the establishment of policies that promote cross-border trade in order to boost e-commerce on the continent. Dylan Piatti, chairman of e-commerce Forum Africa, said African countries should learn from Alibaba’s growth path of targeting rural economies. He said for e-commerce to make a real and sustained contribution to development, it must benefit all segments of society: producers as well as consumers; entrepreneurs and MSMEs as well as established firms. It should also benefit those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. “We can learn from China on how it solved the payment and delivery challenges. At the same time, we should recognize that the challenges on the continent are uniquely African. “We don’t need to reinvent or create the wheel but we can take the best practices and the learning that they have gone through and link them to what we are doing here,” he said. Piatti commended the initiatives by Jack Ma, the co-founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate, to empower African young entrepreneurs on e-commerce. In 2017, Alibaba Group in partnership with UNCTAD launched eFounders Fellowship, a program that seeks to train 1,000 entrepreneurs from developing countries, 200 of which will come from Africa. The program is designed to help bridge the digital divide faced by young entrepreneurs in developing countries as well as help them to grasp the opportunities of an inclusive e-commerce ecosystem. It consists of sharing firsthand experiences on the transformative impact of e-commerce and technology and follow-up on lessons learned, including a two-week stay at the Alibaba Business School campus."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1359221/eco-groups-urge-e-commerce-sites-to-reduce-plastic-use-packaging-waste","title":"Eco-groups urge e-commerce sites to reduce plastic use, packaging waste","date":"02:38 PM November 11, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Public interest groups have urged top e-commerce sites such as Shoppee and Lazada to reduce their plastic use and packaging waste as they mount their respective 11.11 one-day super online sale.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Public interest groups have urged top e-commerce sites such as Shoppee and Lazada to reduce their plastic use and packaging waste as they mount their respective 11.11 one-day super online sale. Through an open letter on Wednesday, 150 diverse groups advocating for a zero waste and toxics-free society have urged online shopping sites to take steps to cut their packaging footprint as the country grapples with increasing plastic waste and pollution crisis.  “We make this appeal to all online shopping platforms to heed our plea for sustainable e-commerce that will not cause further harm to our ailing environment and climate, and endanger the health of humans and other living organisms,” EcoWaste Coalition Policy Advocacy Officer Patricia Nicdao said. “With the surge in e-shopping, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot help but be concerned about the huge amounts of plastic packaging produced, consumed and disposed of by the multi-billion peso online retail industry,” the groups wrote.  The groups lamented that much of these packaging wastes are going straight to garbage bins, buried in landfills, incinerated in cement kilns, clogged in drainage canals and river systems, or dumped into the world’s oceans harming marine life. “As two of the top e-commerce sites in the country, we appeal to Lazada and Shopee to set a good example in preventing and reducing the generation of packaging waste, particularly by diminishing plastic use, from online retail transactions,” the groups said.  They presented recommendations to the online shopping sites and others to cut down on their plastic use and packaging waste: 1.  Make public their plastic footprint (i.e., types and quantities of plastic packaging materials used annually); 2.  Adopt a plastic packaging waste prevention and reduction policy, including plastic-free packaging choice at checkout, returning used packages with reverse logistics and other schemes, and incentives for reduced packaging; 3.  Transition to ecological and safe options for delivering goods, including appropriate product packaging, to reduce disposable and unnecessary plastic and packaging waste; 4.  Implement time-targeted and measurable phase-out plans for plastic packaging materials;  5.  Communicate such phase-out plans to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers; and to 6.  Create a merchants’ section for those who sustainably package their products. The groups also called on e-commerce sites to offer, partner with, and provide incentives to developers, makers, distributors, dealers and customers of alternatives to single-use plastic bags, sachets, cups, cutlery, beverage and water bottles, straws and even diapers, panty liners and sanitary pads. Aside from providing customers with a plastic-free shopping experience, the groups further urged online shopping platforms to purge their sites of products that pose health and safety risks This includes non-compliant toys and childcare articles, contraband cosmetics containing lead, mercury and other contaminants, banned mercury-containing medical devices, proscribed or recalled products, etc."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/293997/lazada-shopee-zalora-top-list-of-most-visited-online-stores-in-ph","title":"Lazada, Shopee, ZALORA top list of most visited online stores in PH","date":"05:01 AM April 03, 2020","snippet":"As people turn toward online stores and marketplaces to buy what they need during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brands could take into consideration which platforms are most visited by consumers to ensure that they still reach their target markets—and here in the Philippines, these are Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and BeautyMNL, says the “Year-end Report on Southeast Asia’s Map of E-commerce.”","body":"As people turn toward online stores and marketplaces to buy what they need during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brands could take into consideration which platforms are most visited by consumers to ensure that they still reach their target markets—and here in the Philippines, these are Lazada, Shopee, Zalora and BeautyMNL, says the “Year-end Report on Southeast Asia’s Map of E-commerce.” According to the report, put together by price comparison website and online catalogue iPrice Group in collaboration with mobile data and analytics platform App Annie and web analytics services company Similarweb, in the Philippines, Lazada’s market share is at 59 percent, with over 34 million visits in a month. The marketplace is followed by Shopee, with over 19 million monthly visits (33-percent market share) and Zalora, with almost two million visitors.  BeautyMNL comes in fourth place with almost 830,000 visits, and in fifth is Ebay with almost 770,000 visits. In sixth to tenth place are: argomall (484,000 visits per month), O Shopping (almost 255,000), galleon (245,000), ubuy (almost 194,000) and Sephora (145,000). As for the mobile e-commerce apps, Lazada, Shopee and Zalora are also Filipinos’ top favorites, in that order, based on monthly active users (according to the report, an active user is defined as “a device having one or more sessions with an app in the time period,” meaning a single person could represent more than one active monthly user if he or she actively uses these apps on multiple devices).   SimilarWeb provided all data on total visits on desktop and mobile websites in the study, which were taken from the sites’ global traffic figures as of January 2020. The study, however, doesn’t include the following industries: e-ticketing, financial services, rental services, insurance, delivery service, food and beverage, meta-search, couponing, cashback websites, as well as e-commerce that solely provides classified ads/peer-to-peer service. App Annie, on the other hand, was responsible for collection of mobile usage data. Aside from the Philippines, the report analyzed five other Southeast Asian markets: Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. The study reveals that across the region, Shopee and Lazada also dominate the e-commerce industry, with the former slightly overtaking the latter when it comes to traffic performance.  The report also looks at how much time consumers spend on e-commerce platforms, and shows that the Philippines ranks third among the six markets in terms of average duration of visit (10 minutes, two seconds). Topping the list is Thailand (12 minutes, 11 seconds), followed by Indonesia (11 minutes, 23 seconds). The year-end report also states that brand strength is highly important in relation to traffic acquisition, as, across Southeast Asia, 48 percent of web visits are done directly (meaning consumers type the website URL directly into their browsers). Organic searches are another main acquisition channel for e-commerce players, indicating the importance, too, of search engine optimization for these companies. As for product categories, the ones most patronized by Southeast Asians are: electronics (40 percent, with consumers spending an average of P1,869 a day), fashion (25 percent; average spend is at P1,112) and home and living (15 percent; average spend, P1,162). The figures are roughly the same for the Philippine market, states the report. Finally, the report highlights the vital role of “shoppertainment” in the e-commerce business. Events such as Lazada’s quiz game, “Guess It!” on its app, and Shopee’s Live Festival, which was held in six countries, don’t just drive traffic—they encourage loyalty, too, among customers.

According to a few local digital entrepreneurs, these are just some of e-commerce trends to watch out for in the Philippines, since social distancing will likely become the norm even after lockdown restrictions are eased, given that there is no end yet in sight for the COVID-19 pandemic.  “I’d say that this pandemic would really be the inflection point for e-commerce here in the Philippines,” said Steve Sy, CEO of e-commerce solutions company Great Deals, who spoke on April 30 as one of the experts at the online forum “Stay at Home E-conomy.” The event, streamed live on Facebook and moderated by Inquirer Prime content editor and Inquirer Business section writing editor Dax Lucas, is the first of a series of online discussions, titled “OnLive: Digital Economy Essentials.” “The impact of COVID-19 on us was [to force us] to go digital; cashless payments are on an all-time high because people want [contactless transactions]. I think this has created the opportunity for many companies to realize that e-commerce has arrived,” Sy said.  Another speaker, Lazada Philippines business development head Petrus Paolo Carbonell, confirmed Sy’s observation. “E-commerce in general has currently been seeing significant growth, but the focus, mostly, especially during the first few weeks of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), was essential goods,” Carbonell said. “The trend that we’re seeing here are first-time buyers are on the platform—and they are growing every day.”  He added that because of this new consumer behavior, now would be a good time for “offline” retailers to migrate to online platforms—and an effective way to market their products, continued another resource speaker, and the forum’s host Hiyasmin Neri-Soyao, would be to do live-streaming videos. “You have your promos for certain new products, and live-streaming is a way for you to amplify that,” said Soyao, who is also CEO of live-streaming platform Shoppertainment Live. She also listed the five elements necessary for an effective live stream: the presenter, the product, the promo, the demo and frequency. “Live-streaming can actually help you sell more and engage more with your customers. When they have questions about your products, it’s easier to engage them,” Soyao said. And if you need more help in the sales department, why not try having an influencer promote your products? “At Shoppertainment Live, we actually have an ‘army’ of influencers whom we’ve trademarked as Influensales hosts, or influencers who also know how to sell,” Soyao said. “They understand the product, the brand and the message of what they are selling, and can entertain people as well. So if you can do that, you can be an Influensales.”  That’s one way e-commerce players can stay ahead of competition: Aside from products, offer an array of content in your online store, Carbonell said. Lazada, for one, has also been hosting live-streaming sessions on their platform. “People are starting to consume more content online,” Carbonell added. “And we see this trend extending even beyond the ECQ.” Sy identified another upcoming trend that would differentiate the more diligent e-commerce entrepreneurs from the rest of the pack: quick commerce. With more consumers turning to online stores, the brand that’s able to fulfill others in the quickest possible time—say, 30 minutes, just like with fast-food delivery—would have an edge over other merchants. This would also translate to demand for more motorcycle drivers as delivery personnel—another business opportunity—and for “micro” fulfillment centers. “We [in Great Deals] can see more of these micro fulfillment centers coming up, so [businesses] can deliver faster to people in their communities,” said Sy, whose company Great Deals provides brands both big and small the full suite of e-commerce-enabling services: from digital content, to web design, analytics and chat support, to warehousing and fulfillment. But any entrepreneur looking to pivot to e-commerce needs a crucial tool: digital software. The forum’s fourth speaker, Multisys Technologies Corporation CEO and founder David Almirol Jr., highlighted, especially, the need for seamless technology. “You don’t want a ‘Frankenstein’ system. You want to deal with the right tech partner,” Almirol said. “And that’s all about how fast integration can be done. Look for someone who can do it in a seamless way.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/209766/ph-ranked-89th-e-commerce-growth","title":"PH ranked 89th in e-commerce growth","date":"12:12 AM April 25, 2016","snippet":"THE PHILIPPINES ranked 89th out of 137 countries and territories worldwide in terms of readiness to support online shopping and other business-to-consumer electronic commerce (or B2C e-commerce), according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).","body":"THE PHILIPPINES ranked 89th out of 137 countries and territories worldwide in terms of readiness to support online shopping and other business-to-consumer electronic commerce (or B2C e-commerce), according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Among emerging economies in Asia and Oceania, the Philippines ranked 9th in the Unctad’s B2C E-commerce Index 2016. In comparison, neighboring Malaysia ranked 4th among developing economies in the region and 10th among such economies worldwide.  Unctad said an increasing number of countries were designing national policies and strategies to harness the full potential of e-commerce for economic development. The New York-based consultancy forecasts global e-commerce retail revenue to reach $1.2 trillion in 2016, up 16 percent from $994 billion in 2015.  According to the UN agency, the index—which came out for the first time since its debut in 2014—can help policy makers assess up to what extent their economies are ready for e-commerce and what areas are in greatest need for improvement. In the maiden edition, no ranking is available for the Philippines. The updated index is composed of four indicators: Internet-use penetration, secure servers per one million inhabitants, credit-card penetration and a postal reliability score.  “The straightforwardness and transparency of the index allow countries to compare how they perform in different areas,” the Unctad said. The index showed Internet penetration in the Philippines at 40 percent.  Among adult consumers, only 3 percent have credit cards. There are only 52 secure servers, very important for purchasing online, per million people. Also, the Philippines was rated 48 percent in terms of the reliability of postal services based on data from the Universal Postal Union. Overall, these four factors reflect an index value of 35.7 points. Luxembourg, which retained its position at the top of the index, enjoyed 89.7 points. In this country, 95 percent of the population has access to the Internet and 69 percent of consumers 15 years and older have credit cards."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1271818/fwd-da-e-commerce-new-normal-positive-effect-of-covid-19-pandemic","title":"E-commerce for agri product ‘new normal, positive’ effect of COVID-19 pandemic","date":"12:11 PM May 08, 2020","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines — E-commerce in agricultural marketing and trading has become the “new normal” and one “positive” effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the Department of Agriculture (DA) said Friday.  “This is now the one positive aspect that has been brought about by COVID-19 pandemic. Ito na yung isang new normal. E-commerce or e-Kadiwa in agriculture and fisheries will be a new mechanism with which marketing or trading of agricultural produce will happen,” DA Secretary William Dar said during the Laging Handa briefing. The agency recently launched e-Kadiwa, a website allowing members of the private sector to sell their produce to ordinary consumers and local government units (LGUs).  Since its launch, Dar said about 54 merchants have signified interest to join the platform. “There are 300 inquiries as to how to join and a set of 54 vendors are applying to be a part of this platform of e-Kadiwa,” Dar said.  Earlier, Dar said this project will give local producers a stable market amid the lockdowns imposed in several parts of the country. This way, LGUs would also be encouraged to distribute healthier food, instead of canned goods which are the usual staple for relief packages. “By buying fresh produce, hindi lang yung mas mataas ng income ang makukuha ng farmers, mas highly nutritious fruits and vegetables ang ipamahagi nila sa mga constituents para mas mataas po ang immune defense system,” Dar said.

Developed by ecommerce and logistics company Anchanto, SelluSeller offers online sellers, both small companies and big brands, a more convenient way to manage their business across a variety of e-marketplaces across different countries in Asia.  So instead of, say, opening an account with different online stores, merchants can just log on to SelluSeller to manage a common inventory, centralize orders, and reconcile payments using a single platform. “Our objective is to make an e-commerce ecosystem on SelluSeller,” said Vaibhav Dabhade, CEO and cofounder of Anchanto, at the product’s recent launch during the first Asia E-commerce Dialogue in Singapore. The forum, also hosted by Anchanto, gathered key stakeholders in the e-commerce and logistics industry who shared their respective insights on how to improve such industries globally.  The online marketplaces already with SelluSeller include Lazada, Zalora, MetroDeal, Amazon, Flipkart, Qoo10, Magento, Matahari, Redmart, Shopclues, Shopify and Snapdeal. Over 50 brands and distributors have also signed up as customers, including Bluebell Group and JayGee Melwani Group, which represent and market some of the world’s leading luxury and lifestyle brands. “Over the last five years, we have seen a rapid growth in online marketplaces, each portraying its individual strengths appealing to different segments of sellers across markets and product categories. We realized a critical factor which held an opportunity for us to provide a solution to these sellers to seamlessly list products and manage inventory across all channels with the ease of one single platform,” said Dabhade. “SelluSeller is designed and built for cross-border listing and shipping from day one.”  With its expertise in e-commerce logistics and warehouse management, Anchanto has also integrated into SelluSeller its global network fulfillment system, providing merchants access to the company’s warehouses spread across the region. Here in the Philippines, the Basic plan for a SelluSeller account costs around P300 per month, which is ideal for sellers who manage 30 to 40 orders every day. Anchanto also offers an Enterprise plan, which is more suited for larger merchants managing over a thousand orders per month. “The response from the industry within the first month of limited launch has been encouraging. We are confident that SelluSeller will bridge the gap perfectly for enterprises, brands and retailers who want to be on e-marketplaces, merchants who want to expand geographies and make the whole process of selling online a fulfilling experience,” Dabhade said. With the launch of SelluSeller, Anchanto hopes to establish itself as a leading player in the e-commerce logistics SaaS (software as a solution) industry, Dabhade added. —ANNELLE TAYAO-JUEGO"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/276277/dti-sees-more-msmes-to-start-doing-e-commerce","title":"DTI sees more MSMEs to start doing e-commerce","date":"05:03 AM August 07, 2019","snippet":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) targets to have 500,000 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in e-commerce by 2022, five times the projected figure for next year.","body":"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) targets to have 500,000 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in e-commerce by 2022, five times the projected figure for next year.

He announced these figures ahead of the release of an updated road map for e-commerce in the Philippines. The current road map for the sector outlined targets for 2016 to 2020. By the end of the period covered, 100,000 MSMEs should already be doing e-commerce, while the sector should already be contributing 25 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, up from 10 percent in 2015.  “I’ll be more optimistic. Maybe it shouldn’t just be 25 percent. It can go up to 40 [percent], even 50 percent,” he said, pointing to the projection for 2022.

It is part of our goal to harness the digital ecosystem’s potential to provide opportunities for every Filipino—from aspiring entrepreneurs, ordinary families, and the impoverished. ” Helping MSMEs revive their livelihood and embrace digitalization With unemployment rates reaching an all-time high, Filipinos turned to online selling as a source of income. To help these entrepreneurs enter the online market, Shopee partnered with LGUs and government institutions to launch various initiatives and strengthened its ecosystem to support sellers.  Through collaborations with the Quezon City and Cavite LGUs and USAID, Shopee has onboarded over 1,000 sellers this 2020 and provided digital marketing training to 500 female entrepreneurs. Shopee also partnered with the Department of Trade and Industry to assist in onboarding sellers from Regions III, IV, and XII. In addition, Shopee’s carefully designed ecosystem allows sellers to succeed in the e-commerce landscape: Unlocking the potential of e-commerce for the community Shopee also uses its platform to provide opportunities for local communities. Shopee Bayanihan is Shopee’s CSR initiative to uplift sectors in need of help. For its first project under Shopee Bayanihan, Shopee partnered with 39 organizations to raise funds for Filipinos in need during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. Shopee also launched Shopee Bayanihan: Frontliner Package, which provided frontliners with Shopee vouchers, Unilever vouchers, and mobile load from Smart. More recently, Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata raised funds for 12 local foundations focused on increasing awareness for children’s needs. Proceeds from GMA Kapuso Foundation, Inc.; Save the Children; and World Vision through Shopee Bayanihan: Pamaskong Pambata also provided relief for children and families affected by the Typhoons Rolly and Ulysses.

In a statement released Saturday, Gatchalian said that there have been reports of consumer products containing hazardous chemicals that are still getting sold on online platforms.  “We have to accept the reality that online shopping is the new normal. And while online transactions continue to thrive along with the proliferation of unscrupulous sellers, we cannot just sit back and wait until a proper mechanism is in place,” said Gatchalian. The EcoWaste Coalition reported that third party dealers still sell mercury-laden products through e-commerce marketplaces and that they had notified lead regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  Mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers are used to measure body temperature and blood pressure, respectively, but the government phased out said products in September 2010 following an administrative order from the Department of Health. The Internet Transactions Act (Senate Bill No. 1591), a legislation Gatchalian authored, seeks to make online transactions more consumer-friendly and strengthen the country’s digital economy but it also proposed strict regulations to protect customers from unethical and unscrupulous business practices.  Under the bill, e-commerce platforms shall share liability with an online merchant. Covered in this provision are instances when the online platform fails to ascertain that the products pose risks to the life and health of consumers and if the online merchant is not duly registered with the appropriate regulatory agencies. “These online marketplaces should not only be responsible but also conscientious on what they are offering to the public,” said Gatchalian, Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs. During deliberations for the bill, Gatchalian raised concerns on counterfeit items getting more accessible through the use of online merchants. “We should not allow these e-commerce marketplaces to rake in profits from illegal business practices. Consumers should be mindful of the quality of the items that they purchase online and they need to be assured that the products being offered to them are not harmful,” said Gatchalian."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1314859/solon-12-vat-on-e-commerce-sites-could-hurt-small-businesses-consumers","title":"Solon: 12% VAT on e-commerce sites could hurt small businesses, consumers","date":"12:33 PM July 31, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The proposed 12 percent value-added tax (VAT) to be imposed on e-commerce sites may ultimately hurt consumers and small businesses in the long run, a lawmaker warned on Friday.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The proposed 12 percent value-added tax (VAT) to be imposed on e-commerce sites may ultimately hurt consumers and small businesses in the long run, a lawmaker warned on Friday.

She added that small-time businesses that operate on e-commerce sites such as Lazada and Shopee will also be affected.  “Many of our kababayans have lost their jobs due to the pandemic had to resort to selling products and services online just to make ends meet,” she said. However, she said she “fully supports” the proposed VAT to be imposed on subscriptions to Netflix, as well as other video and music streaming sites, which, according to Herrera-Dy, is “a market currently worth about P5 billion.”  This comes after the House committee on ways and means approved a bill which will impose additional taxes on streaming services and e-commerce sites.

The collaboration also offers Citi card holders rebates and free shipping in a number of consumer markets.  Starting this month, Citi credit cardholders in Thailand who shop at Amazon.com will be able to use Citi’s global credit card rewards to pay for purchases at checkout. Cardholders in the Philippines can avail of the same program within the first half of 2017, along with Singapore and Australia. The plan is to roll out the shop-with-points program across Asia during 2017.  “At Citi, we are focused on making banking easier for our customers by leveraging digitization, mobile technology and innovation which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how people shop and we are delighted that Citi cardholders in Asia Pacific can now shop with points on Amazon,” said Anand Selva, Citi’s head of Asia Pacific consumer banking. With this new offering, Citi credit card customers can enjoy complimentary shipping on qualified purchases and get an additional 10 percent rebate up to certain amounts across a number of markets with a minimum spend.  Rebates and qualified free shipping will be offered across the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong at various promotion periods within first quarter of 2017. “We expect this partnership to be well-received by our clients, just as they have embraced our earlier digital initiatives,” said Bea Tan, head of consumer banking for Citi in the Philippines.  “Over the years, the Citi ‘Thank You’ rewards points have become a powerful currency.  Clients use it to shop at their favorite physical stores, or redeem anything from air miles to gasoline to rides around town.  We are excited that our loyalty points will soon be available also at Amazon.com.” The announcement marks another key digital relationship that reinforces Citi’s goal to be increasingly relevant in key digital ecosystems where the banks’ clients are more active. Citi’s consumer banking business in Asia Pacific – that spans 12 of 19 global consumer markets -shifted last year into a model that is simpler, dramatically faster, more scalable and far more digital, the bank said. Citi announced a new digital innovation or partnership fortnightly on average in 2016. At present, more than half of the its consumer bank clients use digital channels, with mobile being the fastest growing channel with 35 percent growth year-on-year.  One out of every four new credit card accounts acquired by Citi now comes from digital sources and over 50 percent of the bank’s clients are actively using digital banking channels, up from 30 percent three years ago. Last year, Citi also announced strategic partnerships in leading digital ecosystems across the region. Some of these included Alipay and WeChat in China and Line in Thailand and Taiwan. The bank also formed digital credit card partnerships with the likes of Amazon, Airbnb, Grab, Uber, Lazada and Air Asia in various countries across Asia."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/316537/learn-emerging-online-selling-trends-in-lazucon-the-biggest-e-commerce-convention-series-from-lazada","title":"Learn emerging Online Selling trends in LazUCon—the biggest e-commerce convention series from Lazada","date":"03:43 PM January 27, 2021","snippet":"Level up your business as Lazada University and Certified Digital Marketer (CDM) bring you the first-ever LazUCon 2021, happening on February 3 and 4, at the Lazada University Livestream channel.","body":"Level up your business as Lazada University and Certified Digital Marketer (CDM) bring you the first-ever LazUCon 2021, happening on February 3 and 4, at the Lazada University Livestream channel.

He said iTrueMart, a trailblazing e-tailer in Thailand, is set to to expand its operations next year to Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Myanmar, and Cambodia.  Through its partnership with cloud services giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), iTrueMart claims itself as one of the fastest-growing e-commerce websites in Thailand. From only 400 orders per day in January, iTrueMart is now averaging 8,000 orders per day. At its peak, orders can reach 17,000.  iTrueMart describes itself as an e-commerce leader in Thailand. It also aims to be a retail destination for quality brands of different products, including electronics, household appliances, personal care and health and beauty products."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/303336/india-e-commerce-to-grow-27-reliance-to-capture-half-of-online-grocery-sales-goldman","title":"India e-commerce to grow 27%; Reliance to capture half of online grocery sales—Goldman","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"NEW DELHI — India’s e-commerce business is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 percent to reach USD 99 billion by 2024, Goldman Sachs said projecting that Reliance Industries would capture half of the online grocery sales through its Facebook.","body":"NEW DELHI — India’s e-commerce business is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 percent to reach USD 99 billion by 2024, Goldman Sachs said projecting that Reliance Industries would capture half of the online grocery sales through its Facebook. In a report titled ‘Global Internet: e-commerce’s steepening curve’, Goldman Sachs said the COVID-19 pandemic has driven a doubling of penetration of e-commerce globally with categories such as consumer packaged goods driving as much as three years of penetration growth in three months.  “We forecast India e-commerce will reach USD 99 billion by 2024, growing at a 27 percent CAGR over 2019-24, with grocery and fashion/apparel likely to be the key drivers of incremental growth in our view,” it said. “The biggest near term theme in India internet, in our view, is the foray of Reliance Industries (India’s largest market-cap company with presence across sectors such as energy, telecom, and retail) into e-commerce, and the company’s tie-up with WhatsApp for online grocery,” it said.  Facebook has picked up a 9.99 per cent stake in Jio Platforms, the subsidiary of RIL that houses the country’s youngest but biggest telecom company as well as an array of apps. RIL’s e-commerce venture, JioMart plans to use Facebook’s WhatsApp to connect local grocery stores with customers. Goldman Sachs said Bigbasket and Grofers accounted for more than 80 per cent of the market in 2019 in online grocery.  Online grocery has been growing at over 50 per cent year-on-year for the last couple of years, but with the outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in a shift to online, and the recent entry of RIL, the growth will accelerate to 81 per cent CAGR during 2019-24, it said. “We believe RIL’s partnership with Facebook could result in the company becoming a market leader in the online grocery space, with more than 50 per cent share by 2024,” it said. “Having said that, we do see grocery as a large category for two or more players to co-exist over time.” Growth in India’s e-commerce, the brokerage said, is likely to come from better penetration into categories such as grocery/FMCG, improving payment ecosystem and ease of shopping through WhatsApp etc. “We expect non-grocery e-commerce penetration to see a sharp increase of 500 basis points over the next two years to reach 16.1 per cent by 2021,” Goldman Sachs said adding the last 500 basis points of the increase took four years. While online penetration in categories such as consumer electronics is fairly high at about 40 per cent as of 2019, there exists significant growth in categories like apparel, appliances, health and personal care, where online penetration in India remains materially lower when compared with peers such as China.  “As far as incremental growth in e-commerce is concerned, we expect grocery to be the biggest driver with 40 percent contribution to incremental e-commerce GMV (gross merchandise volume) between 2019 and 2024,” it said. Grocery in India is a USD 380 billion category as of 2019, making up for 60 percent of the total retail market. “However, online penetration currently stands at less than 0.5 percent (absolute size USD 2 billion), one of the least among categories,” it said projecting the online grocery market in India to grow 20x over the next 5 years, to reach USD 29 billion in value (5.1 per cent penetration) by 2024. It saw a higher acceptance of online purchases among Indian consumers, especially since COVID-19, as one of the key drivers. Other drivers include RIL’s foray into the space leveraging its large offline distribution capabilities and ability to order groceries through WhatsApp – a platform with more than 400 million users in India. “Overall, we forecast online grocery orders to grow from 300,000 per day in 2019, to more than 5 million per day by 2024,” it said. Goldman Sachs said the coronavirus pandemic has driven an acceleration in the adoption of countless technologies and consumer behaviors, chief among them being e-commerce. “What started at first with panic buying, hoarding and nest feathering out of necessity have turned into an array of adaptations that have driven e-commerce penetration from 16 percent of retail spending in the US in 1Q19 to over 40 percent in May driven by year-over-year growth of nearly 70 percent,” it said. Globally, e-commerce would grow 24 percent, it added.

At the same time, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said Wednesday that firms covered by the new National Payment System Act (NPSA) — whether financial institutions or non-bank entities, like merchants — will have “streamlined” documentary requirements to “to promote efficiency and ease of doing business”.  The new rules were contained in a draft circular providing for the implementing rules and regulations of the NPSA which aims to promote the maintenance of a safe, efficient, and reliable payment system.   “As the first comprehensive legal and regulatory framework governing the payment systems in the Philippines, the NPSA can well support the twin objectives of maintaining a payment system that is necessary to control systemic risk and providing an environment conducive to the sustainable growth of the economy,” BSP said in a statement.   “Through a safe, efficient, and reliable payment system through which funds are transferred among banks and other institutions to discharge payment obligations arising from economic and financial transactions across the entire economy, the cost of exchanging goods and services is reduced,” it added. It is, likewise, an essential tool for the effective implementation of monetary policy, and the smooth functioning of money and capital markets.  Since the use of payment systems is not limited to banks and nonbank financial institutions, the scope of the regulatory powers of the BSP are likewise expanded under the NPSA to cover non-financial institutions such as operators, their service providers, among others.   The draft circular is part of the first phase of the phased-in implementation of the NPSA, which prioritizes the creation of a baseline inventory of all operators of payment systems (OPS). This is required under Section 10 of the NPSA which provides that all OPS shall register with the central bank.  This inventory will also be used as inputs to the specific criteria for designating payment systems, as well as the oversight rules to be applied to such systems and the participants.  To ensure the smooth transition of the OPS existing at the time of the NPSA’s effectivity, the draft circular provides a transitory provision that allows said OPS to register with the central bank within a reasonable period."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/175412/why-online-retail-is-the-next-big-thing-in-e-commerce","title":"Why online retail is the next big thing in e-Commerce","date":"02:34 PM July 26, 2014","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines – Over the next 10 years, online retail will gain even more importance – not just in developed countries, but also in emerging markets.

Logistics will play a key role: it provides companies important competitive advantages, such as deliveries within a few hours on the day of ordering, flexible receiving and return times as well as resilient logistics and value-added concepts in emerging countries. This is one of the key findings of the “Global E-Tailing 2025” study, initiated by Deutsche Post DHL with participation of the trend research institutions Z_punkt and See More as well as numerous international experts from retail, logistics and academia. It is the first global scenario study on cross-border online commerce and its implications for the logistics industry.  In four scenarios the study shows what the electronic world of shopping around the globe could look like for consumers and businesses in the near future. The different future projections are based on a detailed analysis of the most influential factors – from energy and raw material prices to technological, political and social factors to retail and consumption patterns. The scenarios also outline possible effects of changes to society’s value system by 2025. The research examined selected developed and emerging markets around the world. Trend scouts also studied purchasing and logistics trends in 12 international metropolises – among them New York, Moscow, Bangalore, Jakarta and Lagos. These consumer insights anchor the scenarios in today’s world and increase their plausibility. Today e-commerce makes up eight percent of the overall trading volume in Europe.  Depending on the scenario, this share could rise up to 40 percent in developed countries and up to 30 percent in today’s emerging markets. Jürgen Gerdes, CEO Post — eCommerce — Parcel at Deutsche Post DHL: “In the future, logistics will take over the role as an enabler for online retailers even more than today. We as a logistics company have a good overview on companies in various industries in almost all countries of the world. That’s why we increasingly become an advisor and partner for success.” From a highly developed digital culture to Do-It-YourselfIn the first scenario, today’s emerging markets will be the engine of growth 11 years from now. A strong global economy and a stable middle class will have established a true “Everywhere Commerce”. Consumers will receive their purchases much faster than today, with Express shipments being delivered in less than 24 hours and measured in minutes. In a different scenario a highly developed digital culture has evolved, in which almost all products will be sold online and consumers will receive support by avatars. To protect manufacturers from counterfeit, logistics companies will offer protected supply chains.  However, the study not just portrays positive future projections of worldwide e-tailing, but also possible crisis scenarios. Scenario four outlines how the worldwide consumption patterns develop after the global economy will have suffered another financial crisis and energy and raw material prices have risen considerably. Under these circumstances, people could adopt a Do-It-Yourself mentality instead and sharing models instead of the “all new” approach. Changed consumer behavior influences retail sector The scenario analysis is supplemented by multiple essays from renowned logistics experts: Professor Dr. Dirk Moschett of Fribourg University in Switzerland underpins the necessity for all of society to bundle supply flows more efficiently. Professor Geritt Heinemann, of the University of the Lower Rhine elaborates in his “E-Pace” contribution on the importance of timing for the success of online retail. Professor Shashi Matta of Ohio State University analyses how changes in consumer behavior, e.g. trends such as sustainability or crowd-shaping, affect online retail. Best practice solutions, which Deutsche Post DHL already implemented for electronic retail, showcase the range of solutions and service in logistics. All scenarios and contributions have in common that the competition in electronic retail, whether on global, national or regional level, will become more intense. Jürgen Gerdes: “We don’t know for certain what the world will look like in 2025, but the study’s various scenarios show how rapid the global retail sector – online and offline – is changing and that logistics will be a focal point of these change processes.” Deutsche Post DHL’s strategy 2020 including the pillars Focus, Connect and Grow shows that the Group is in an excellent position for these developments. A part of this strategy is to expand the group’s leading position in e-commerce related logistics – in Germany, Europe, and beyond. An essential pillar of this expansion is the division Post — eCommerce — Parcel. “As the most international company in the logistics industry, we’re destined to establish our successful e-commerce related B2C business in non-European markets. We see huge potential to become the world’s leading provider for e-commerce logistics in a few years”, emphasizes Jürgen Gerdes."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/276904/dost-strengthening-e-commerce-platform","title":"DOST strengthening e-commerce platform","date":"05:22 AM August 16, 2019","snippet":"The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) tapped PayMaya’s digital payments service for its OneSTore.ph e-commerce platform.","body":"The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) tapped PayMaya’s digital payments service for its OneSTore.ph e-commerce platform.

In a report by Khaleej Times, the CEO of Hashtag Digital FZ LLC said that the company aims to fulfill the demands of digital marketing within the United Arab Emirates.  “There is an unprecedented growth of digital marketing in the region, but there are only few professionals who can claim expertise in the wide spectrum of digital commerce,” Pabalan says of the market. In the UAE, accounts include children’s toy company Step2 Arabia, hotels and resorts such as Hawthorn Suites, Ramada Downtown Dubai, Emirates Grand Hotel, Oceanic Khorfakkan, and nail polish brand Morgan Taylor Gellish.  Pabalan ventured into e-commerce with AyosDito.ph, where he was general manager from 2008 to 2011. The site made buying and selling online widely available to Filipinos. Another local classified ads site Sulit, which rebranded as OLX in 2014, later merged with AyosDito, redirecting AyosDito users to OLX. He went into digital marketing while working for another e-commerce site, Lazada.  In 2012, he founded Hashtag Digital which serves clients locally and abroad. Expanding overseas is more than a business decision. “I have seen so many Filipinos in the UAE, but only a few of us own businesses. The thought of exporting a Filipino company, and not just sending talent abroad, challenged me,” explains Pabalan in the report. He stressed, “With this in mind, I thought of championing the cause and inspiring OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) to become entrepreneurs too.” Niña V.

In April 2016, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba sealed a $1-billion deal with Lazada and bought $500 million in new shares as part of its expansion plain in Southeast Asia, its biggest overseas investment yet to date. Another milestone that Lazada marked last year was its integration with Singapore-based grocery e-commerce RedMart.  READ: E-commerce as great equalizer “[Our partnership with Alibaba] is going great. We are learning a significant lot of things from Alibaba. It is as if we are a child in a primary school and we are learning every day and we are applying those learnings in our business at the strategic level,” Balci said at Lazada’s fifth anniversary event in Makati on Tuesday.  “What we are doing at the moment, this is one of the learnings that we got from Alibaba, is we focus on our core business and we are creating an ecosystem among ourselves,” he added. Balci said Lazada sent five of its merchants last month to the Alibaba Campus in China “so that they could get the best training from Alibaba sellers, merchants, and trainers.”  Lazada, a one-stop online retailer based in Singapore, was launched in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in 2012 and in Singapore in 2014. Today, with over 2,000 employees, Balci said the company occupies a 91-percent share in the Philippines’ e-commerce category in just five years of existence, selling about 6.3 million items and more than 14,000 brands. “This is also my fifth year in the Philippines and we love doing our job in the Philippines. We started from nothing, and we are trying to bring the e-commerce of the Philippines to the next level,” Balci said. “We have been working really hard in the past five years and the question always is, how is Lazada doing? Our vision for the next five years is to become a technology-driven platform empowering our sellers and brands for our customers. We identify ourselves five pillars of growth: assortment, empowering sellers and brands, customer experience, seller and product transparency, and ecosystem,” he added. Balci reiterated Lazada’s commitment to make the Philippines the next top e-commerce hub in the region and in the world by encouraging more people to sell and shop online. E-commerce, he said, is the “biggest entrepreneurial opportunity” in the Philippines in this day and age as it reaches more consumers without having to invest millions. “Why should someone sell in Lazada? One of the most frequent questions I get is if we are competing with shopping malls. The obvious thing is Lazada does not compete with any of the offline stores. What we do is we offer an additional sales channel to all the businesses in the Philippines so they can reach out anyone in the Philippines,” he said.  “This is the reason why I’m saying that Lazada is the biggest entrepreneurial opportunity. There is no bigger entrepreneurial opportunity in the Philippines other than Lazada. Why? Because you don’t need any investment in order to reach millions of pesos. You don’t even need a laptop. You only need an Android phone to start selling on Lazada… And at the same time Lazada is a level playing field. Even if you are the smallest merchant, even if you are the largest corporation in the Philippines, you get the same rates,” Banci added. By yearend, Lazada is eyeing to expand its innovation by utilizing its brand assets and increase, partnerships by maximizing co-marketing efforts with additional 60 local and international brands, and attracting more brands that see it as a disruptive sales channel. “We want people to buy things easy, affordable without spending a lot of time. And I think e-commerce is the best thing that can provide this to customers in the Philippines and again our birthday wish is a great economy for the Philippines and a larger e-commerce landscape,” Banci said. “I think Lazada is one of the biggest contributors in e-commerce in the Philippines. We have been investing heavily in different parts of the Philippines starting with logistics to marketing, for it to be one of the top e-commerce countries in the world,” he added. As part of its 5th anniversary, Lazada is holding a big sale from March 21to 23 with discounts of up to 90 percent, time-based flash sales, exclusive offers from popular brands, and raffle prizes like tour packages.

JG Summit is among the institutional investors that participated in Sea’s new round of funding that generated a total of $550 million in fresh capital, Sea announced in a press statement late Monday.  “We look forward to working closely with Sea to deepen its presence in the Philippines and to nurture the growth of our country’s exports and e-commerce ecosystems,” said Lance Gokongwei, president and chief operating officer of JG Summit Holdings. JG Summit’s property arm Robinsons Land Corp. is among the country’s leading shopping mall developers, with 44 operating malls across the country to date. Another company led by the Gokongweis, multiplatform retailer Robinsons Retail Holdings Inc., is one of the biggest players in domestic retailing.  The bulk of the new capital raised by Sea will be invested in the growth of its e-commerce platform Shopee, with a focus on key markets such as Indonesia, the most populous country in Southeast Asia. Shopee has more than doubled in size in the past nine months and now has an annualized gross merchandise value exceeding $3 billion, the statement reported.  Founded in 2009 as Garena Interactive Holding Ltd., Sea is the company’s new brand at the corporate holding company level to reflect its leadership across multiple platforms. “Garena is a brand that is beloved across our game ecosystem, our Shopee brand has become synonymous with e-commerce in our region, and AirPay is quickly becoming a leader in digital financial services,” said Sea founder, chair and group chief executive officer Forrest Li. “We cherish these three brands, and are now embracing an overall identity for our entire company.” “Our new name draws inspiration from the acronym for our region, symbolizing our strong ‘home court advantage.’ In addition, the sea connects every one of our markets, symbolizing our corporate motto of ‘connecting the dots.’ Finally, Sea is a humble, authentic word that evokes the pioneering spirit of exploration—a wonderful symbol of our corporate values,” added Li. The statement did not say how much exactly JG Summit had invested in Sea or how big the stake was relative to total outstanding shares.

There are 57 million Facebook accounts—why shouldn’t the same thing apply to e-commerce?” says Inanc Balci, cofounder and CEO of Lazada Philippines. “So we’re now on a mission to make Philippines a dominant player in the world when it comes to e-commerce penetration.”  Balci cited Taiwan as having the highest percentage of online retail sales at 18 percent; the Philippines, on the other, hand, is only at 1 to 2 percent. “Buying online is as easy as getting an account on Facebook; sometimes easier, because you don’t need an e-mail account for some websites. The Philippines can have a much higher [percentage of e-commerce] penetration than that of Taiwan,” Balci says. Other factors also come into play when it comes to the Philippines’ strong potential in e-commerce, adds Balci. “The middle class is growing very fast; the economy is doing really well among other nations in Asia; there is a very young population; smartphone penetration is higher than any other country in Southeast Asia.”  As a treat to its customers, Lazada held a birthday sale last March 21-23. These kinds of events, says Balci, are also a form of investment for the company when it comes to addressing one of the three main challenges in the local ecommerce industry: general market size. Promos and special deals allow Lazada to attract new customers and further grow the business, says Balci. The other two issues, he adds, are payments and logistics. To address the latter, the company formed its own logistics arm called Lazada Express. “That has, today, 70 percent coverage nationwide, and we are continuing to push it even more,” says Balci. “We are also looking toward improving the payments landscape. There is only about 5 percent credit-card penetration which makes it difficult to transact online, so Lazada was the first to launch nationwide cash on delivery. Not a lot of companies are doing this because it’s a costly way of doing business, but for us to grow, we need to invest.”  Lazada was initially established in the Philippines as an online retailer selling electronic goods. The company then “pivoted” its business strategy in 2014, says Balci, shifting its model to an online marketplace, which was “one of the biggest accelerators” of its growth. “Now our business model is a cross of retail marketplace and cross-border marketplace, which is similar to a local marketplace but the merchants are from other countries in the region,” Balci explains. As Lazada and the country’s e-commerce industry continue to grow, so does competition—something which Balci welcomes with open arms. “It’s always better for the market to have competition to keep you on your toes. We believe that for the market to grow much faster, we need better, healthier competition,” he says."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/313536/ph-firms-speeding-up-digital-shift","title":"PH firms speeding up digital shift","date":"04:02 AM December 09, 2020","snippet":"Philippine organizations are speeding up their shift to digital during the COVID-19 pandemic but the pace of innovation is still slower than their peers in the region, a new study from Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific showed.","body":"Philippine organizations are speeding up their shift to digital during the COVID-19 pandemic but the pace of innovation is still slower than their peers in the region, a new study from Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific showed. The speed by which organizations can adapt also has implications for future prospects in business and growth, the study noted.  According to Microsoft-IDC, 82 percent of organizations in the country were “speeding up digitalization to adapt to the new reality.” This includes launching digital products, using e-payments, ecommerce and automation.  The country’s rate of adopting a so-called culture of innovation has increased by 4 percent. In comparison, organizations in Asia-Pacific saw an 11-percent growth in culture of innovation maturity. The study defines this culture as the combination of technology, processes, data and people that ultimately allows organizations to sustain innovation.  “Innovation is no longer an option, but a necessity. We’ve seen how the recent crisis spurred transformation across the region and organizations will have to integrate the ability to innovate into their core to recover,” Microsoft Philippines country general manager Andres Ortola said in a statement. Daniel-Zoe Jimenez, associate vice president and head of digital transformation of IDC-Asia Pacific, noted that Philippine organizations have nevertheless found innovation to be “easier” than before the pandemic. “Organizations in the Philippines have realized how much their ability to innovate fuels their performance and business resilience during the crisis,” he said. According to Microsoft-IDC, 44 percent of Philippine organizations found it difficult to innovate versus 77 percent before COVID-19 arrived. With Asia-Pacific organizations seeing a faster growth in innovation maturity versus the Philippines, the study noted that they were also expecting larger businesses growth.  “Demonstrating their stronger propensity for resilience and adaptability, 2.7 times more leaders in Asia-Pacific, as compared with organizations in the Philippines, expect an increase in their revenue and one in three of them expect to increase their market share despite the crisis,” Microsoft-IDC said.

The SEC warned the public against investing in OnlineBiz/OnlineBiz ECommerce, Accelerare Car Main Ph/Accelerare Ph/Accelerare/ Accelerare Car Trading/ Accelerare Forex Trading, and Legit Payout/Legit Pay Out.  None of these entities is registered as a corporation or partnership or has secured the requisite licenses to solicit investments from the public as required under Republic Act No. 8799, or The Securities Regulation Code. As it continues to weed out scammers, the SEC reiterated its advice for the public to exercise caution when dealing with individuals or groups promising ridiculous rates of return on investment with little or no risks. Such investment offers could turn out to be Ponzi schemes, where money from new investors are used to pay earlier investors, the SEC noted in a statement issued Friday night.  OnlineBiz is soliciting a minimum of P19,000 worth of investment in exchange for P5,000 to 50,000 weekly earnings, plus insurance plan and free travels. In its advisory dated April 23, the SEC noted the similarity of OnlineBiz’s investment scheme with that of Elite Entrep Blue Print. The Facebook page of OnlineBiz also bears the logo of Elite Entrep Blue Print, another scammer earlier exposed by the SEC.  Accelerare, which is based in Don Bosco, Parañaque City, asks investors to lend to its ventures in car trading and foreign exchange, while promising interest income as well as bonuses and commissions. A minimum of P1,000 is required in the car trading business, with the promise of 20-percent interest after 28 days or 150 percent after 90 days. In the forex trading business, Accelerate is asking for a minimum investment of P10,000, with the promise of earning 30 percent daily, weekly or monthly, depending on the trade. The group is founded by one Harlou Angelo Crampatanta Bolima. Legit Pay Out likewise entices the public to invest by promising a high return in a short period. Under the scheme, one needs to pay P1,000 to secure a slot. In two weeks, the amount invested for every slot would supposedly grow by 60 percent to P1,600. Legit Pay Out is operated by a certain Wilme Joe Vergara, also known as Joe de Vergara, the SEC said. —Doris Dumlao-Abadilla INQ"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1329371/from-illegal-horse-betting-to-e-commerce-scams-157-detained-in-week-long-anti-crime-crackdown-in-singapore","title":"From illegal horse-betting to e-commerce scams, 157 detained in week-long anti-crime crackdown in Singapore","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SINGAPORE — In a week-long blitz, 157 people were detained for various crimes, from illegal bookmaking to e-commerce offense.","body":"SINGAPORE — In a week-long blitz, 157 people were detained for various crimes, from illegal bookmaking to e-commerce offense. The multi-agency anti-crime operation conducted from Aug 23 to 30 led to the arrests of some of the 128 men and 29 women. The suspects are aged between 16 and 81.  The operation covered various locations in Jurong West, Tuas, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok, and was led by the Jurong Police Division. It was supported by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau, Land Transport Authority and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.  In addition to those detained, 310 persons were also checked by the Singapore Police Force during the crackdown. The Straits Times was present at a police bust on illegal horse-betting taking place at a Jurong West coffee shop on Aug 23 at around 2.30pm.  At the coffee shop, 13 men and one woman between the ages of 53 and 72 were detained, with police seizing $4,421. ST noted that the illegal activity took place in broad daylight and in full view of other coffee shop patrons and stallholders. At the scene, the police seized bags of evidence, including what looked to be numbered betting slips, newspapers containing details of horse races, and fat stacks of cash. Assistant Commissioner of Police Devrajan Bala, commander of Jurong Police Division, said: “This joint operation led by Jurong Police Division is an ongoing enforcement effort to clamp down on criminal activities.” “The police will continue to work closely with other law enforcement agencies to take tough enforcement action against those who are involved in criminal activities.”  The authorities gave a breakdown of those picked up and the offenses involved. In separate busts, 21 men and six women aged between 18 and 81 were detained in connection with public gaming, vice-related activities, being suspected members of secret societies, as well as for traffic and vehicle-related offenses. Meanwhile, 28 men and one woman aged between 49 and 79 were taken in for illegal bookmaking activities, and are currently being investigated for offenses under the Betting Act. Cash amounting to more than $8,000 and betting-related paraphernalia were seized. Another 53 men and 14 women, aged between 16 and 70, are under investigation for assisting in loansharking activities and loan scams. During the operation, 19 men and seven women, aged between 17 and 63, were detained for e-commerce scams and commercial crime-related offenses. Preliminary investigations by the authorities revealed that they were allegedly involved in 39 cases reported islandwide involving more than $592,000. Separately, seven men and one woman aged between 24 and 55 were detained by the police for suspected drug and customs-related offenses. The police seized 45 pills, suspected to be controlled drugs, as well as 10 cartons and 24 sticks of assorted brands of duty-unpaid cigarettes.

Raised in London, Balci attended Purdue University in the United States and has degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics.  He then worked on mergers and acquisitions for an investment bank in London. It was while he was working for the investment bank that Balci saw the potential of e-commerce, prompting him to join Rocket Internet, co-found Lazada in Southeast Asia and then become CEO of Lazada Philippines two years ago.  At his headquarters in Makati City, Balci heads a pool of more than 300 employees, with home he works closely. An integral part of their job is to think up ways to make online shopping more fun, more convenient, and more risk-free than ever before.  “Once a traditional shopper buys online and has a good experience, there’s no stopping [him or her from going online again],” Balci said in a recent briefing to introduce 12.12. Part of Lazada’s latest efforts to woo shoppers is what it claims to be the biggest sale of the year—the Lazada 12.12 Online Revolution. Coming from the 11.11 online sales promotion in November to usher in the holiday season in the country, Lazada’s 12.12 has Midnight Voucher offers being given away starting 12 a.m. until 7:59 a.m. on Dec. 12. Hourly flash sales will take place from 8 a.m. until 11:59 p.m., with hot deals available per product category. Exclusive offers  Exclusive partner offers will be available, too. Also, Redmi bundles and Mi 3 will be on sale on 12.12. Customers who will purchase a Mi 3 or Redmi bundle will get a chance to win a Mi 4 or Redmi Note. But getting traditional shoppers to go online takes more than just offering great deals. In a country where shopping malls are practically part of the fabric of society, online shopping is something quite a number of Filipinos are unaccustomed to. Preventing more Filipinos from fully embracing e-commerce is the perennial trust issue on using credit cards, surprise surcharges, and unfortunately, the unfortunate experience of products not arriving at all. Malls in the Philippines, on the other hand, have positioned themselves to be more than shopping destinations. Malls offer recreation and dining options, for instance, and the air-conditioned facilities are a welcome break from the raging tropical weather outdoors. Balci and his co-founders had to resolve nagging issues related to e-commerce. Thus Lazada, he said, has made shopping quick, effortless, and risk-free to Southeast Asia and in the Philippines. Lazada, for example, accommodates online shoppers without credit cards via its cash-on-delivery payment mode. This is essential since not everyone has a credit card or is comfortable sharing financial details online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “This makes online shopping practically risk-free because they can check the items or try them on—if these are clothes or shoes —while our delivery person waits. If they do not want to buy them, for any reason, they can give them back and not have to pay. It’s all in the comfort of their own home,” Balci said. Accessibility issues Being an archipelago of 7,100 islands, accessibility is always an issue—a significant portion of consumers do not have the time to visit malls or might not have physical access to them. But with a P1,000 purchase, Lazada offers free nationwide delivery to customers anywhere in the Philippines, even as far as Tawi-Tawi. Lazada also offers the flexibility of having the customers return the products within 30 days risk free—provided that the products are in mint condition. In his two years in the Philippines, Balci has steered Lazada to further heights. Lazada says it has more than 40,000 products, reaches 90 percent of the online population of the Philippines, and ranks as the fourth top Facebook brand in the country with a direct audience of close to 2 million. Since March 2012, Lazada has been working hard to revolutionize the meaning of online shopping in a country where shopping in malls is part of the core lifestyle. With the largest online assortment of products ranging from mobiles and laptops to consumer electronics to books and media, health and beauty, home appliances, fashion and accessories, Lazada Philippines offers its wide customer base what they need in one place. Nested in its head office in Makati City with its 12,000-square-meter warehouse in Muntinlupa City, Lazada Philippines has a workforce of more than 300 employees. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Through its own courier service and its wide assortment of goods, Lazada Philippines seeks to provide customers a unique shopping experience. It may thus be only a matter of time before online shopping becomes more of the rule—rather than the exception —in the country’s vibrant retail scene."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/59908/someone-please-fix-the-internet","title":"‘Someone, please, fix the Internet’","date":"June 16,2015 - 10:36 AM","snippet":"","body":"Slow speed hinders online shopping sites THE slow Internet speed in the country is the biggest challenge faced by online shopping sites. “(Internet) speed is the biggest restraint. Someone, please, fix the Internet,” Clarissa Briones, chief executive officer of Pinoy Great Deals, said during a panel discussion as part of the recently concluded Cebu ICT/BPM Conference. The Philippines has been identified by Akamai’s State of the Internet report as one of the countries with the slowest Internet connection speeds in the Asia-Pacific region. Online shopping, one of the most popular electronic commerce (eCommerce) services, allows people to shop for merchandise in the comfort of their homes at any time they like, without having to navigate through road traffic and deal with congested malls, Briones said. She hoped telecommunications companies Globe Telecom and Smart Communications could address the Internet connectivity issue. Robert Gantuangco, director and co-founder of DCOM.ph, said eCommerce continues to thrive in the Philippines despite the connectivity problems. He said he expects this to be the only mode of trading, buying and selling products and services in the future. “Everyone is online today,” he said. Recent data showed that around 24 percent of the population uses the Internet to do their shopping. Gantuangco said he expects this to increase in the next few years. He noted that Internet penetration is even faster than television penetration. While it took television around 40 years to reach a 50 percent penetration, it took only 11 years for the Internet to reach 41 percent penetration. He said, however, that local online shopping platforms “must step up its game” to be able to compete with international shopping sites. Gantuangco said three things must be done to make the industry more competitive: earn the trust and loyalty of the consumers as well as learn their habits; expand the selection of commodities available online; and provide faster, better, cheaper and more convenient connectivity. eCommerce used to be done through social networks and messaging devices such as Viber, We-chat and FB Messenger. Gantuangco said there now seems to be an increasing shift to mobile-friendly websites and mobile applications. “eCommerce is the new rising tide.

Here’s a somewhat under-appreciated China story: the rest of the globalised, digitalised world can’t have enough of locally made goods, thanks to the planet-wide reach of cross-border e-commerce platforms, including those based in the country.  This story is not exactly a sequel to the one about China having been the world’s leading factory for manufactured goods over the last few decades. It is not about leading Chinese tech brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Haier that are well known outside the country either.  Instead, this story is about little-known but globally successful Chinese brands and companies such as Ecovacs. This story is also about virtual Silk Road, a digital highway that enabled China-based cross-border e-commerce platforms in multiple languages to export Chinese goods worth 903.5 billion yuan ($140 billion) in 2017 to more than 200 countries and regions, serving more than 100 million consumers.  It is about ambitious business targets: A single e-commerce platform expects to serve 1 billion overseas consumers and 1 billion domestic buyers by 2025. Welcome to the amazing, efficient, logistically-wondrous world of Chinese cross-border e-commerce. In this world, local brands may not boast glamour, but command reach and sales that could stoke both envy and awe in marketing giants. Ecovacs illustrates the point nicely. The company makes robot vacuum cleaners. It is reaping handsome gains from overseas markets. It receives orders from US consumers via Amazon, a global e-commerce titan. On Nov 24 last year, during the Black Friday shopping carnival, hourly sales reached a staggering 1,000 units. That record earned Ecovacs fourth rank among overall household product sales.  David Qian, president of Ecovacs’ international business department, said: “We’re building our own brand and investing 10 percent of our annual revenue in research and development. We have over 1,000 patents both at home and abroad.” Qian said Amazon offered Ecovacs helpful guidance on consumer demand analysis based on accurate data. It also imparted professional training in operations and taught market expansion strategy. Like Ecovacs, tens of thousands of China-based vendors now sell their products globally through Amazon Global Selling, a mechanism that leverages the online marketplace’s branches in 10 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan and Australia. This helps build visibility for their brands globally. A virtuous cycle ensues: brighter brands generate higher sales; next, greater consumer expectation prompts the brands to invest in R&amp;D and improve the quality of their products; this, in turn, encourages firms such as Amazon to launch plans like “service+”, a program to impart Chinese sellers lessons in the art and science of cross-border e-commerce. Thanks to e-commerce, small and medium-sized Chinese firms now receive consulting services for enterprise development strategy and operating model, as well as tailor-made solutions for business expansion at different stages. “China’s cross-border e-commerce is thriving, which brings about huge opportunities for Chinese enterprises. But, it also brings about new issues and challenges. By leveraging Amazon’s global network and resources, we could provide customised solutions to meet the needs of Chinese sellers and cultivate cross-border e-commerce talent in China,” Dai Jingfei, vice-president of Amazon China, said. In 2017, sales revenue from third-party sellers on Amazon’s online marketplace accounted for 50 percent of global sales, among which the SMEs accounted for over 25 percent of Amazon’s overall third-party businesses. More than 15 percent of Chinese consumers made purchases worth $85.76 billion from cross-border e-commerce platforms in 2016, according to consultancy eMarketer. By 2020, a quarter of the Chinese population, or more than half of all digital buyers, will be shopping either directly on foreign-based websites or through third parties. Meanwhile, China-made smartphones, PCs, electronic accessories and household supplies are proving to be the most favourite products among overseas buyers, industry reports showed. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For instance, Chinese earphone maker Bluedio sells its products worldwide via AliExpress, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s business-to-customer or B2C website that serves foreign users. “The sales on Singles Day (on Nov 11 last year) surged about 120 percent compared to the previous fest. AliExpress is a good starting point,” said Li Jiacheng, marketing head of Bluedio. He said the company set up a 30-member taskforce to pursue R&amp;D for critical technologies. At present, AliExpress serves 224 countries and regions around the world with more than 100 million overseas buyers. Its content is available in 18 languages, including Russian, Spanish and French. “In the past, Chinese merchants were serving intermediates, and had no say in pricing power, but now they can participate in international competition under a transparent and fair environment created by cross-border e-commerce platforms,” said Shen Difan, general manager of AliExpress. By 2025, Alibaba expects to serve 2 billion consumers worldwide, among whom 1 billion would be overseas users, according to Shen. The top three countries ranked by total spending on AliExpress are Russia, the US and Spain. AliExpress hopes to foster 1,000 merchants whose monthly sales in cross-border deals surpass $500,000 each. Meanwhile, Cainiao Network Technology Co Ltd, Alibaba’s logistics arm, is reshaping the logistics landscape in Russia, through its first international air freight service from Hangzhou to Moscow, which was launched in March. Cainiao is on course to help reduce delivery time worldwide to 72 hours within the next five years. JD, another e-commerce behemoth, rolled out its cross-border B2C platform in 2015, with Spanish, English and Russian versions. The platform aims at helping Chinese companies’ quality products and well-known brands to reach international markets. JD opened its Spanish website in April to target Spain and Latin America, serving 400 million Spanish-speaking people. JD said it will enter the markets through investments in logistics, goods and services, and by integrating its capabilities in China’s commodity supply chain, to provide quality products to Spanish customers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); JD will offer 100,000 popular items in partnership with 1,000 partners, including smartphone maker Nubia, electronics manufacturer Rappo, robotic vacuum cleaner maker iLife to expand in the Spanish-speaking markets, said Liu Qiangdong, chairman and CEO of the company. It also promised a two-to three-day delivery timeframe for premium packages and seven-to 20-day delivery for economy packages in Spain, with a plan to set up local warehouses within this year. “However, domestic cross-border e-commerce platforms may face some difficulties in logistics, delivery, local laws and regulation restrictions when exporting products,” said Wang Xiaoxing, an analyst with the Beijing-based internet-driven consultancy Analysys. Zhang Zhouping, senior analyst with the China E-commerce Research Centre, said: “China’s strong support for cross-border e-commerce comprehensive experimental zones, and the gradual improvement of taxation and regulatory policies greatly boost the growth of the industry.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/274927/indonesia-prepares-cross-border-e-commerce-regulation","title":"Indonesia prepares cross border e-commerce regulation","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"JAKARTA — To prevent an excess of imported goods from inundating the domestic market, the Indonesian government is preparing a regulation on cross-border trade through e-commerce platforms.","body":"JAKARTA — To prevent an excess of imported goods from inundating the domestic market, the Indonesian government is preparing a regulation on cross-border trade through e-commerce platforms.

The data showed that there had been fewer goods imported through e-commerce platforms than those brought into the country through conventional means, he said, adding that the government had also observed a rising trend in goods imported through online marketplaces.  Darmin went on to say that the government had been drafting a government regulation (PP) that would rule cross-border e-commerce. The government expected the policy to establish a discernible mechanism and bureaucratic filter regarding e-commerce imports, he said.  Darmin said the government had studied similar regulations implemented in neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Thailand in drafting the new policy. “We’d like to make sure that we’re not lax but also not overly strict compared to other countries,” he said.

According to the latest report released recently by price comparison platform iPrice Group, Tiki, Sendo, Thegioididong, Dienmayxanh and FPT Shop ranked sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth, respectively, by average monthly web traffic.  The five others in the top ten were Shopee (first) and Lazada (second), which were also conducting business in Viet Nam, and three unicorns from Indonesia – Tokopedia, Bukalapak and Blibli. The five Vietnamese e-commerce companies’ inclusion was concrete evidence of the size and potential of e-commerce in Viet Nam, which was forecast to surge 43 per cent by 2025 – the highest growth rate – by Google last year.  According to the iPrice report, monthly web traffic of Tiki surged by 69 per cent within a year from nearly 20 million to 33.7 million, helping it gain the sixth position in the top ten list. The impressive achievements came after Tiki received US$4 million of investment from JD.com in a round of series C funding in January 2018, which made JD become one of the largest shareholders in Tiki.  Ngo Hoang Gia Khanh, Tiki’s finance and development manager, told the media in May this year that Tiki targeted $50-100 million from strategic investment funds or groups of financial investors. Meanwhile, Sendo has posted strong development, especially in the second quarter of 2019 when its web traffic rose by 10 per cent to more than 28 million while other large sites, including Tiki, Lazada Vietnam and Shopee Vietnam, saw a decline. The report of iPrice Group also indicated that web traffic to the top ten e-commerce websites in Viet Nam in the first half of this year increased by 11 per cent compared to the same period last year. This data showed websites play an important role for e-commerce in Viet Nam, despite the significant competition from social networking platforms and mobile applications, the report noted. Viet Nam was also one of the two countries, along with Indonesia, that has seen an increase in e-commerce traffic, while the remaining four countries – Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines – showed a sharp decline.  Representatives of iPrice Group attributed the rise to the high competition in Viet Nam’s e-commerce market. They explained that Viet Nam has many e-commerce companies with strong financial potential in the top ten list and the rankings of the companies are not too far from each other. This competitiveness motivates the companies to continue to maintain multi-channel activities, including website channels, to reach customers continuously. Meanwhile, in countries like Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia, the competition is almost only between Lazada and Shopee, the representatives said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/297293/ph-firms-pin-survival-hopes-on-e-commerce","title":"PH firms pin survival hopes on e-commerce","date":"05:02 AM May 15, 2020","snippet":"Last Mother’s Day, media specialist Kimberly Jane Tan was alone in her Manila condominium, like many others in the capital who were unable to visit family because of the lockdown.

Entrepreneur Sara Stefan Moreno was in a similar boat—missing her mom, especially on such an occasion. But distance is a small thing when technology now makes it easy to stay connected, and send gifts, to loved ones. Tan was able to have a complete Mother’s Day lunch delivered to her family living just five kilometers away via an app-based transport service; in Moreno’s case, it was a cake, delivered to her mother and sister from Makati to Antipolo.  With physical distancing vital to containing the spread of the new coronavirus disease, enhancing one’s e-commerce system, which should include efficient delivery services, could be the key to a business’ survival. Steve Sy, CEO of local e-commerce solutions company Great Deals, says that while 70 percent of their portfolio of online stores were closed because they were classified as “nonessential,” the remaining 30 percent tagged as “essential,” such as food and grocery items, saw an increase in sales by almost 250 percent right after the Holy Week celebration last month.  “We’re hitting [sales] campaign numbers, without having campaigns,” Sy tells the Inquirer. A similar trend was observed by Lazada in the first week of May. “With everyone staying indoors, we have seen that people are becoming more creative in showing their appreciation and celebrating special occasions like Mother’s Day. As such, we weren’t surprised to see an increase in orders for cooking and baking items, fitness and wellness products, as well as personal care and beauty items in the early days of May,” Lazada says. Shopee’s public relations head Erin Tagudin says this trend will likely continue in the near future, since more consumers are now aware of how e-commerce can ease their shopping experience.  “More and more Filipinos are turning to online platforms to purchase their daily essentials such as groceries, household and personal care items. We foresee that this trend will continue and extend for nonessentials goods as Filipinos continue to practice social distancing,” Tagudin says. “Online shopping undoubtedly provides shoppers convenient access to their everyday needs, and we are committed to ensuring that we continue to meet the needs of our buyers and provide a safe shopping experience for all.” The restaurant industry, of course, also benefits from having online ordering and delivery. The Bistro Group, expecting dine-in sales to grow only “gradually” because of necessary health precautions being taken by customers, is focusing on strengthening both takeaway and delivery services by creating special menus for such services. The group has also partnered with Grab for delivery. The same goes for hotel-based restaurants. According to Patrick Chan, managing director of The Bellevue Manila, their servicing the community with takeout and delivery services will be continued, and like The Bistro Group, customized menus for anniversaries, birthdays and other occasions “that’ll go perfectly with intimate celebrations at home” are available. But given that government guidelines are still constantly changing as the country continues to deal with the spread of COVID-19, the best way forward for the food industry—or any other business sector, for that matter—is to just adapt, while keeping people’s safety in mind, says The Manila Hotel president Joey Lina. “As the proverb goes, we will be pliant like the bamboo. We will not go against the strong winds, but instead bend gracefully with it,” Lina says. “It goes on to say that when the wind gets tired of blowing, the bamboo remains standing in all its grace and beauty. We will adapt, and find ways to accommodate our guests with utmost assurance of their safety, and that of our own staff.”"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/98771/e-commerce-as-great-equalizer","title":"E-commerce as great equalizer","date":"01:17 AM October 28, 2016","snippet":"Once upon a time, you had to be big to export.

With limited reach, there wasn’t much scope for growth in a domestic market hampered by relatively low purchasing power. As such, you were likely to remain small, and stories of small enterprises transforming into medium ones, and medium ones expanding into large ones, were extremely rare. The internet has changed all that. Now, one person with online access can do business from her bedroom and sell to buyers across the world. I’ve seen my daughter sell clothes she had gotten tired of almost as fast as she could post photos of them on social media. The same gadget she took photos of the items with is the same gadget with which she reached buyers. She would send them out via an accessible logistics provider, and the items would be with the buyer within days.  For those who want to go into serious business, it doesn’t take much more than that. For a small manufacturer or trader, electronic commerce platforms—including familiar ones like Alibaba, Amazon, e-Bay, Lazada, and home-grown Sulit.com—now make it even easier to reach buyers, practically anywhere in the world. Many a retail business now needs no physical store space. Shopping malls are dying in some countries because many people no longer do legwork to shop. Total retail sales are projected to top $22 trillion this year worldwide. Of this, online retail sales of products and services ordered via the internet using any device will reach nearly $2 trillion, or close to one-tenth. Online sales are projected to grow nearly four times faster (23.7 percent) this year than overall retail growth (6 percent), and are forecast to double to over $4 trillion by 2020, or in just four years. The Asia-Pacific, now acknowledged as the fulcrum of the global economy, has become the world’s largest retail e-commerce market, with sales projected to top $1 trillion this year, and to nearly triple to $2.7 trillion by 2020. China accounts for the bulk ($899 billion this year). But in Southeast Asia—now the world’s seventh-largest economy as a regional bloc, and projected to be fourth largest by 2020—e-commerce still represents only a small fraction of total retail sales. The Asean-6 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) account for under one percent of global online retail, even as they account for 3-4 percent of global GDP and around 8 percent of world population. Partly behind this is that internet usage in Asean, at 44 percent of total population, is still lower than the global average of 49 percent, ranging from as low as 2.5 percent in Myanmar to as high as 82.5 percent in Singapore (the Philippines has 43.5 percent). Other impediments are inadequate infrastructure and legal framework for digital payments, and a weak logistics system. Asean still has much homework to do on e-commerce, and as chair and host of Asean next year, we can make the needed push.  E-commerce is indeed a potent tool for empowering micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Apart from widening access to worldwide markets, it also widens their sourcing options for inputs. No longer need they be confined to local (and often more costly) sources of raw materials and other inputs, if e-commerce makes it as easy to bring them in from abroad, especially as free trade agreements allow them in duty-free. Trade facilitation plays a key role here as well. The increase in de minimis level (shipment value below which customs duties need not apply) from P10 to P10,000 under the new Customs Modernization and Tariff Act is a key shot-in-the-arm for MSMEs, for example. With the right policy, legal and institutional support, e-commerce could help MSMEs boost their overall contribution to the economy in terms of output, exports and employment. It could well be the great equalizer among enterprises, big or small.  cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/215827/telstra-invests-in-pinoy-e-commerce-firm","title":"Telstra invests in Pinoy e-commerce firm","date":"01:12 AM October 01, 2016","snippet":"The venture capital arm of Australian giant Telstra Corp. is investing in C88 Financial Technologies Pte Ltd., which owns and operates the largest consumer financial websites in Indonesia and the Philippines.","body":"The venture capital arm of Australian giant Telstra Corp. is investing in C88 Financial Technologies Pte Ltd., which owns and operates the largest consumer financial websites in Indonesia and the Philippines. The undisclosed investment, coursed through Telstra Ventures, was aimed at helping one of the world’s leading telecommunications and information services companies into increasing its presence in the region’s technology ecosystem.  C88 owns CekAja.com in Indonesia and eCompareMo.com in the Philippines. The firm claims these are the largest financial sites in their respective markets, connecting banks and insurers with consumers across a number of products, including loans, mortgages and insurance. “This investment round provides us with the funding necessary to scale-up our market leadership in Indonesia and the Philippines. We aim at pushing into mass market branding as we continue to employ our significant scale and focus to help customers save time and money, help our partners cost-competitively on-board new customers at scale, and help our key regulatory partners continue to shape an equitable financial services technology sector rooted in transparency and inclusion,” said J.P. Ellis, co-founder and group CEO of C88.  In partnering with C88, Telstra Ventures managing director Matthew Koertge said in a statement C88 combines across its platforms “a personalized data-driven experience for consumers with easy-to-use web and mobile experiences, as well as back-office infrastructure including call centers and sales distribution networks to complete transactions.” He said C88 was well ahead in the e-commerce sector. “They offer e-commerce ‘apply now’ functionality to consumers that is directly linked to the issuing bank or insurer, which means it is easy to use and creates a new customer onboarding channel for financial institutions.”  C88 recently completed its Series-B financing round, which included participation from existing investors Monk Hill Ventures and Kejora Ventures. Altitude Partners, Captii Ventures, Jasrag Investments and several other international investment groups and high net-worth individuals from Indonesia and Malaysia also participated in the round. “We are happy to have Telstra leading this funding round given their significant presence as an enterprise service provider and their growing reputation as an active participant in the region’s technology ecosystem,” Ellis added.

PayMaya is ending the year with more than 28 million customers across its platforms who can conveniently pay, add money, cash out, or remit in over 200,000 touchpoints nationwide. As the country’s only end-to-end digital payments platform provider, its platforms are used by consumers, businesses, communities, and government agencies. On top of its popular PayMaya app and wallet, it also powers all kinds of enterprises for eCommerce and everyday transactions. It has likewise expanded its Smart Padala network to over 33,000 agent touchpoints nationwide, allowing even those in the farthest reaches of the country to conduct transactions such as remittances, bills payments, mobile prepaid loading, and even QR payments.  As a result of this inclusive ecosystem approach, total digital payment transactions processed by PayMaya has tremendously grown as more sectors of society adopt cashless payments, making it the default for transactions. “No other fintech company has built this inclusive ecosystem of products, services, and touchpoints that reach a vast majority of Filipinos nationwide. We have made it so easy for ordinary consumers to get a financial account and for merchants to accept a wide range of cashless payments, including PayMaya,” said Shailesh Baidwan, PayMaya President. “This radical shift to cashless for the Philippines will only continue accelerating in 2021 as we offer more services and forge more enterprise partnerships that are relevant for many consumers,” he added. These initiatives are also in support of the goals of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to increase the share of digital payments to 50% of all retail transactions and expand financial inclusion to 70 percent of Filipino adults by 2023, as part of its recently released Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap 2020-2023. E-Wallets take center stage With the whole country combatting the spread of COVID-19, Filipinos have turned to the PayMaya e-wallet for safer and more convenient everyday transactions, making cashless payments increasingly the preferred mode over cash. According to the latest e-Conomy SEA 2020 report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company, the average number of cash transactions by consumers declined from 48% pre-COVID-19 to 37% post-COVID-19. On the other hand, the frequency of e-Wallets transactions rose from an average of 18% pre-COVID-19 to 25% post-COVID-19, the study said. Cashless transactions made by Filipinos through the PayMaya app, in fact, have consistently registered triple-digit growth rates throughout 2020, peaking sometime around May at the height of the enhanced community quarantine to register over 1000% year-on-year growth compared with the same month in 2019. The top use cases among PayMaya users in 2020 were sending money to friends and family, paying bills, and purchasing mobile prepaid load, all of which have formed part of their everyday financial transactions. Enabling digital government services In the same vein, the government has also tapped PayMaya to help disburse financial aid through the various COVID-19 mitigating programs of the government, with over P4.5 billion in aid disbursed to PayMaya accounts of hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries nationwide. These measures include the Social Amelioration Program under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act through the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Small Business Wage Subsidy Program of the Social Security System (SSS), as well as loan programs launched by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Agriculture. At the start of the quarantine in March, the cities of Manila and Caloocan have also begun disbursing allowances and aid to their respective constituents to aid those affected by the lockdowns. Since then, the cities of Mandaluyong, Quezon City, Las Pinas, and Pasig have followed suit and disbursed proceeds of their various aid programs to PayMaya accounts of residents. “Now that many Filipinos have their own PayMaya accounts, cashless payment technologies have become an essential part of the government’s arsenal toward economic recovery and building the better normal in the next few years,” Baidwan said. Aside from receiving government aid via their accounts, consumers can also safely and seamlessly transact with the government by paying their fees and dues to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, SSS, PAG-IBIG Fund, Philippine Statistics Authority, Department of Foreign Affairs, Land Transportation Office, Professional Regulation Commission, Bureau of Customs, and Department of Trade and Industry, among others, using their PayMaya app. To date, over 60 government units both in the national and local levels have tapped PayMaya as their partner of choice in offering cashless payments via their online and branch channels. The growth of PayMaya’s volume related to government payment acceptance is projected to reach by 1,200% growth by year-end as compared to 2019.  Merchants, businesses accelerate pivot to digital and cashless Businesses of all shapes and sizes can also settle their permits, social security contributions, and tax dues as agencies such as the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Social Security System (SSS), and PAG-IBIG Fund are now offering cashless payment options via card and PayMaya through their respective online and branch channels. To recover from the effects of the pandemic to the economy, many merchants have also shifted their focus to delivering products and services online by utilizing chat apps, social media, or even their own dedicated online store. Because of this, the number of new merchants onboarded and using various PayMaya digital payment acceptance solutions have increased by over 1,500% year-on-year in November, signifying an exponential shift in the way merchants are conducting their business amid the pandemic. Apps such as PayMaya Negosyo and tools such as Payment Links, Digital QR, as well as the PayMaya Checkout payment gateway allow these businesses—many of them Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs)—to quickly offer cashless payment acceptance and even generate new income streams from services such as bills payment and mobile prepaid reloading. Meanwhile, large enterprises in the restaurant, groceries, pharmacy, transportation, and petroleum industries, among others, have accelerated their adoption of cashless payments acceptance using PayMaya QR and the PayMaya One terminal in support of the “Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat” campaign to inspire consumer confidence amid moves to safely re-open the economy. “Our broadest range of relevant digital payment solutions for businesses of all sizes, coupled with fast and seamless onboarding, means it’s easier than ever for businesses to accept cashless payments within minutes,” Baidwan added. PayMaya is the only end-to-end digital payments ecosystem enabler in the Philippines with platforms and services that cut across consumers, merchants, communities, and government. Through its enterprise business, it is the largest digital payments processor for key industries in the country including “everyday” merchants such as the largest retail, food, gas, and eCommerce merchants as well as government agencies and units. Through its app and wallet, PayMaya provides over 28 million Filipinos with access to financial services. Customers can conveniently pay, add money, cash out or remit through its over 200,000 digital touchpoints nationwide. Its Smart Padala by PayMaya network of over 33,000 partner agent touchpoints nationwide serves as last mile digital financial hubs in communities, providing the unbanked and underserved with access to digital services.

Dubbed as “eKadiwa,” it is the government’s response to the evolving landscape of buying and selling perishable goods. The project was created to ease the transport and delivery of commodities and encourage LGUs to distribute nutritious food and minimize reliance on canned goods and instant noodles—the usual staple for any relief package.  At the same time, this will give the country’s local food producers a stable market even with lockdowns imposed in parts of the country to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic. Agriculture Secretary William Dar said this was one of the Duterte administration’s efforts to provide the general public access to quality and affordable food as the country continues to address the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Oftentimes, with only the hubby and myself at home, the more efficient and indeed delicious option come mealtimes has been to have food delivered, if not from the outlets themselves, then through food delivery services accessed through apps on our phones. Having food delivered through these e-couriers gives us the added advantage of choosing from a broad range of nearby restaurants, including stand-alone establishments. At times, especially during the hectic Christmas season, we also do our shopping through courier services. This saves us from the hassle of having to troop to crowded malls, and with the COD option, we even have the chance to pay only for items that meet our approval. A friend has a son who has now begun an innovative service contracting with public market vendors around the metropolis to have fresh produce delivered to customers. We haven’t tried this option yet, but it does sound tempting.  More recently, our household help has also discovered shopping by phone. Since courier services have refused or find it difficult to deliver items to their informal settlements, they have the items delivered to our doorstep, and while we really don’t mind hosting their courier shopping, we do draw the line at having to pay for the items when these arrive on their days off. This is just the experience of one household. Indeed, according to CNN, citing figures from Statista, the local e-commerce market revenue grew to $844 million or P44 billion in 2018, up from $688 million or about P36 billion in 2017.  Indeed, this signals not just the robust growth of internet and technology-based trade, but also creates new risks for the consuming public and government alike. These arise from unscrupulous traders and bogus firms or, worse, the use of couriers to transport contraband. Regulation of courier and freight forwarding services is supposed to be carried out by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), for accreditation and regulation of domestic and international sea freight forwarding; the Department of Information and Communications Technology, specifically the Postal Regulations Division, for courier services; and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for both domestic and international air freight forwarders.  At present, only 354 air freight forwarders carry a Certificate of Authority to Operate issued by CAB, while 769 sea freight forwarders are accredited by the Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau of the DTI. A total of 113 couriers are accredited by the DICT-PRD. But outside of these “official” numbers, unlicensed couriers also abound, some of them quite well-known and patronized, which could put their customers at risk of being hoodwinked, cheated or even endangered. An added risk for customers is that even after discovering an anomaly, buyers don’t know who to run after, with no clear line of responsibility or liability. Some operators claim their drivers are simply independent contractors, making the firms simply facilitators of the trade. Who takes responsibility, for instance, in case of food poisoning arising from a food delivery by a courier service? Even more alarming is that aside from small-time players, big-time firms have also joined the logistics field, some with no license to operate. One well-known firm named for stealth fighters is actually based in Singapore, skirting the constitutional provision on 60-40 ownership in favor of Filipinos by buying a local company while still maintaining its foreign name and structure. Another “express” company has secured a license as a forwarder from the DTI and the CAB, but it reportedly still has no license as a courier from the DICT-PRD. A “black” company, for its part, has a license to operate only within the National Capital Region but is said to be maintaining warehouses in Mandaue City and Tacloban City. While these companies have been operating here for years, the responsible government agencies have seemingly turned a blind eye to them. With the DICT now under the helm of former senator Gringo Honasan, can his agency be more serious in monitoring and even controlling the logistics service industry, totally eliminating the so-called colorum couriers and forwarders?  When will the relevant departments and legislators act firmly and aggressively to protect local consumers? rdavid@inquirer.com.ph"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/113827/entrepreneurs-urged-embrace-e-commerce","title":"Entrepreneurs urged: Embrace e-commerce","date":"November 27,2016 - 08:28 PM","snippet":"","body":" Entrepreneurs are encouraged to take advantage of the country’s growing internet population and put up online platforms of their operations to scale up their businesses. Ma. Elena Arbon, Cebu provincial director of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), said they are slowly introducing micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) to electronic commerce or e-commerce to help them remain competitive amid a globalized business environment. “We hope our MSMEs that are ready for it would really go into it. One example is our exporters. E-commerce is the way of the world,” she told Cebu Daily News. Arbon defined e-commerce as an extension of one’s business online, where buying and selling and all other interactions are done on the web.She likened this to setting up a “store” or a “marketing channel” which allowed entrepreneurs to reach a wider market. Instead of establishing a physical shop for goods and services, Arbon said they may opt to build their presence online. Rentals on spaces inside malls usually cost at least P200,000 every month while developing one’s own e-commerce site will only entail around P20,000. Foot traffic inside malls average 100,000 to 200,000 every week, while e-commerce sites have the potential to reach millions of internet users not only in Cebu or the Philippines, but in the whole world. Businesses are more likely to scale up their operations when they have online presence, said Arbon. Philippine internet penetration has grown from 37 percent in 2013, translating to 36.1 million internet users, to 43.5 percent or 44 million internet users in 2016. In 2013, the Philippines registered $1.5 billion in e-commerce sales and DTI’s Philippine E-Commerce Outlook 2018 projects this figure to grow by 101.4 percent in two years. Last week, DTI Cebu launched an e-commerce and digital marketing workshop that will run until January next year. Arbon said 20 MSMEs  involved in various sectors such as food, furniture, and home accessories, among others, are participating with e-commerce advocate Janette Toral leading the workshop. Toral has been pushing for the growth of e-commerce in the Philippines since 1997 and has helped the DTI come up with the Philippine E-Commerce Roadmap 2016-2020. Among the topics covered in the workshop are website creation, product photography, web payments, social media presence, and search engine optimization. “MSMEs in Cebu, which are more traditional, thrive in a different world. But they are the ones ready for e-commerce. It’s not something they can ignore,” said Arbon. The trade official said their aim is to make more MSMEs understand the benefits of e-commerce so they can have substantial presence in that scene in the future."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/15271/multiply-com-to-stop-social-network-services","title":"Multiply.com to stop social network services","date":"05:19 PM August 11, 2012","snippet":"","body":" MANILA, Philippines—Multiply.com users take note: less than four months from now, there’ll be no more photos, videos, blogs, social messaging, etc.  Multiply, which boasts of 11 million users, is halting its social networking and content sharing services as  it shifts its focus to ecommerce. “From December first, we will unfortunately no longer be able to support Multiply in its current form – notably we will be removing the social networking and content sharing part of Multiply (photos, videos, blogs, social messaging, etc.),” said CEO Stefan Magdalinski.  “We have decided to discontinue providing and hosting these services, as we have concluded that other Internet sites who are committed to social networking services will do a better job serving you than we can,” Magdalinski said.

For these struggling banks, one of the most effective solutions is to compete against giant e-commerce sites head-on. To do so, they have moved into the e-commerce sector, blurring the traditional business boundaries. In Singapore, the banking sector’s regulatory body has also allowed banks to enter into the e-commerce sector, on condition their e-commerce operations are low-risk. Thailand is likely to follow suit, with central banking authorities now weighing the pros and cons of permitting commercial banks to climb onto the e-commerce bandwagon.  E-commerce – mobile commerce, in other words – is set to grow exponentially in coming years due to the ubiquity of smartphones, which already outnumber the entire Thai population. Unless banks have more flexibility in pursuing new forms of business, they are likely to see eroding competitiveness in the digital age, since giant e-commerce sites, as well as more nimble tech-oriented start-ups, are preparing to disrupt traditional banking and related businesses. According to Thai banks, the age of “machine commerce” is dawning, on top of mobile commerce, as each of the major banks now has millions of customers using their mobile-banking applications. The combined value of transactions amounts to hundreds of billions of baht. From this huge mobile market base, the top banks aim to serve as the new digital middlemen via their own e-commerce platforms, which will automatically match customers’ needs with numerous vendors of goods and services.  The selling point is that the Thai SMEs will have lower costs and a more efficient platform to market their products when adopting bank-operated e-commerce platforms that use sophisticated machine-learning models and predictive analytics to do the matching for transactions.For the banking regulator, the top concern is probably the risks associated with banks diversifying into non-banking businesses. But the plus side is that banks will have plenty of data to make better judgements on lending to small business operators based on the transactions they conduct on the platforms.Customers should also be happier, due to more convenient shopping, e-payment and delivery services, all done with a few taps and swipes on their mobile phones."},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/50993/hoarding-clothes-let-go-of-them-with-these-e-commerce-apps","title":"Hoarding Clothes?

But also think about how these clothes will find more uses if you donate or sell them to someone else. This is where e-commerce sites for pre-loved clothes come in. You just need to sign up and put up photos of your items with your preferred price. There are already several online shops out there who sell stuff on Facebook and Instagram, but downloading these apps will be more convenient for many.  Carousell brands itself as a “community marketplace that lets you buy and sell everything.” All you need to do is to list the clothes you’re selling and add keywords so they’ll be easier to find. This will allow both local and foreign buyers to see your listing. There’s also a chat feature which will make it easier for you to contact the buyer.  As we’ve shown before with Lauren Young and JC Santos, Shopee is a one-stop website for a lot of things from clothes to home accessories. Aside from finding items at low affordable prices, you can also start selling your pre-loved stuff here.  Shedd’s sleek design makes it more fun to curate the clothing photos you want to put up in the app. What’s great about this is that you don’t need to write long descriptions about your clothes. Just add hashtags and people will easily find them as they browse.  The name of this app is enough to convince you to sell your clothes. Letgo’s algorithm automatically tags your item with its recognition software. That somehow cuts your hassle in half once you’ve posted your items.  For those who don’t want to travel far to deliver items to buyers, Village is designed to find them within close proximity from your location. This allows people to pick up your pre-loved clothes within minutes after they’ve bought them. https://www.instagram.com/p/BVt0An0h_tj/?taken-by=depop&hl=en Depop looks like a millennial’s hub for fashion finds. Feel free to post your old streetwear clothes and other cute stuff on this site. Once you’ve sold your items, you can also browse the pages bloggers like Aimee Song to see what they’re selling.

Ma. Elena Arbon, Department of Trade and Industry Cebu provincial director, said they are pushing for e-commerce among MSMEs because businesses in the Philippines are lagging behind other Asian counterparts in terms of business innovation. “We just can’t continue to produce the usual items. In terms of value, products that involve technology are better,” she told Cebu Daily News in a phone interview on Wednesday. The move to include e-commerce-related services in Negosyo Centers, she added, is a step to linking MSMEs to innovation. She said that with this, they hope to develop more high-end, high-value MSMEs using creativity, knowledge, talent, and skills. Negosyo Center A Negosyo Center offers DTI services aimed at helping businesses such as business name registration (BNR), loan and investment assistance, and even training opportunities for MSME entrepreneurs. Areas where Negosyo Centers are present include the towns of Sta. Fe, San Remigio, Daanbantayan, Dalaguete, Consolacion, and Tuburan, as well as the cities of Lapu-Lapu, Carcar, and Cebu (DTI provincial office and the University of the Philippines Cebu). Last month, DTI Cebu launched an e-commerce and digital marketing workshop where 14 MSMEs involved in various sectors such as food, furniture, and home accessories, among others, participated. “The fourth industrial revolution is happening. We are far behind, but there is an opportunity for us. There are a lot of talented entrepreneurs out there, but nobody is guiding or supporting them,” said Arbon. Arbon also said that the DTI is trying to address this issue by helping entrepreneurs  grow their business presence online. Series of trainings She was referring to the series of trainings for business counselors and personnel of entrepreneurs designed for this purpose. Arbon said the series of training in 2017 that they would launch would equip agency staff to be able to “get a handle” or a “handhold” for their MSMEs in e-commerce. “It will be part of the services offered at our Negosyo Centers across the province. If business owners want to go into e-commerce, then we will be able to help them develop their enterprises,” she said. Advocacy for startups Meanwhile, DTI Cebu will also carry its advocacy for startups into 2017 as it holds a planning workshop to localize targets within the national Startup Ecosystem Development plan on January 7. Arbon said this will determine the direction of the startup community in Cebu so DTI and other stakeholders will know each of their roles in supporting the growing ecosystem here.DTI’s Launchpad program is the agency’s initiative to help start-ups become full-fledged enterprises in the future through mentorship. This year, five startups were given the opportunity to learn with the Philippine Software Industry Association’s (PSIA) Spring.ph. While the DTI is primed to support businesses embrace digital practices, Arbon said 90 percent of the agency’s efforts is still meant for traditional enterprises. The agency will launch 16 more Negosyo Centers in the province next year, bringing the total number of business centers to 27 by end-2017, according to Elias Tecson, DTI Cebu business development chief. Tecson said the new centers will be opened in Argao, Moalboal, Danao City, Balamban, and SM City Cebu. He said there will also be centers specifically tailored to the needs of Yolanda-ravaged areas in northern Cebu such as Bantayan, Madridejos, Medellin, Sogod, Borbon, Tabogon, Tabuelan, San Francisco, Poro, Tudela, and Pilar. By end-2018, Tecson said all cities and municipalities in Cebu would already have its own Negosyo Center."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/135854/global-race-for-logistics-automation","title":"Global race for logistics automation","date":"05:10 AM December 04, 2020","snippet":"Lockdowns and movement restrictions that were implemented across the region because of the pandemic have put a sudden halt on traditional retail consumption and have forced shopping to become digital. Many retail stores in the region had to close, leading to consumers being forced to move their consumption habits online—with some adopting online shopping for the first time.","body":"Lockdowns and movement restrictions that were implemented across the region because of the pandemic have put a sudden halt on traditional retail consumption and have forced shopping to become digital. Many retail stores in the region had to close, leading to consumers being forced to move their consumption habits online—with some adopting online shopping for the first time. As a result, e-commerce sales in the region have skyrocketed. To illustrate, Singapore is expected to see its sales in e-commerce increase to a staggering $10 billion this year; Malaysia saw a 149 percent surge in online sales in the first few months of 2020; while Indonesia’s e-commerce sector is expected to witness a 50 percent year-on-year growth to reach $35 billion in 2020.  Even prior to COVID-19, retail has been moving from a “shopper to goods” model toward a “goods to shopper” model. This has fostered an age of immediacy among consumers and their “need it right this second” mentality. Automation as a solution. In turn, organizations are now forced to prioritize high-speed operations through automation, as it enables low-cost fulfillment of orders in a short time frame through increased operational efficiencies, higher storage density, and greater ability to deal with spikes in demand.  In short, many companies are looking at automating operations to create high-speed, low-cost, and efficient operations. For more developed economies in the region like Singapore, the push to automate is also compounded by the scarcity of labor. The labor market in manufacturing and logistics is tightening due to the “4Ds”—dull, difficult, dirty, and dangerous work. The next-generation workforce is moving away from this type of work.  To remain competitive in the fast-changing e-commerce landscape, companies operating in countries like this will then have to turn to automation to meet demand. This massive shift to e-commerce and the rush for organizations to reconfigure their supply chain and fulfillment strategies to keep up with the demand will make the move to automate even more pressing. And with demand for logistics automation already strong prior to COVID-19, this upcoming onslaught of demand will lead to a global race for logistics automation. This means that those looking to automate will need to act fast, especially in this market where there is a scarcity of suppliers and expertise in this space. Many automation suppliers around the world are at capacity. Driven by the exponential growth of e-commerce, as well as the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies such as robotics and driverless vehicles, the warehouse automation sector is also rapidly growing. Market research company Reports and Data last year reported that the global logistics automation market will reach $120 billion by 2026. This region, in particular, has seen a strong growth in the logistics automation market in recent years. Boosting this growth is the need to provide e-commerce customers with improved service efficiency and meet their expectations of getting deliveries on time.  However, while there are many automation suppliers across Europe, North America, and Asia, the range of suppliers is not endless. The specialized expertise required to design, cost, execute, and integrate automation systems means that the major automation suppliers around the world have been incredibly busy for the last five years. In fact, before COVID-19 hit, many major automation suppliers were already at capacity; some suppliers do not even have the capacity to respond to a tender process and design a solution. This has thus often resulted in multi-year lead times for automation implementation. The need to act fast. With major automation suppliers already at capacity and the upcoming onslaught of logistics automation demand, companies looking to adopt automation need to act fast. The planning and implementation of automated solutions can take a substantial amount of time, and the process needs to consider the capacity and timelines of automation suppliers. Southeast Asia organizations also need to consider that there will be an incredible volume of automation demand in North America and Europe, which means they will need to start planning now and get ahead of the demand curve, or risk losing the opportunity to transform their operations. Slow adopters of automation will not be able to secure automation or labor that will enable them to meet consumer expectations, leaving them at immense risk of an inefficient and expensive operation. * * * Holger Schaurig is executive vice president, Supply Chain, of TM Insight Asia.

Currently there are 37.75 million eCommerce users in the Philippines, with an additional 18.02 million users expected to be shopping online by 2022. Four years from now, these 45.77 million eCommerce users will spend an average of $48.72 online. With this phenomenal growth of digital-savvy Filipinos doing their shopping online, another sector is also expecting a brisk growth: logistics industry, more specifically the delivery trucks that will bring the goods or services ordered online.  Delivery trucks “When it comes to e-commerce, essentially these are the trucks employed for deliveries. We’re focusing on that. So I think our task is really to come in and help with the effectivity and efficiency, and protecting the engines of these trucks,” says Shell Lubricants Marketing Manager Anthony Wee during last week’s PhilBus Truck Expo held at the SMX convention in Pasay City. Pilipinas Shell expects a “double-digit” growth in the lubricants segment as it launches a new product called “Shell Rimula Light Duty Range” that caters mostly to commercial light duty vehicles that serve as the backbone of booming e-commerce industry in the country. The Shell Rimula Light Duty Range, which becomes available next month, was designed to address the needs of the light duty truck drivers who have different sets of driving style. “Since they are driving around the city, they have the ‘start and stop’ type of driving style (resulting to sludge to build up and cause more wear on engine parts), as they deliver from one place to another, causing them to constantly turn the engine on and off,” says Wee. Shell Rimula Brand Manager Recca Menchavez explains light duty trucks normally carry variable loads because these type of vehicles want to maximize and make sure that their space is fully equipped with the different products so that each trip is fully efficient. Three ways Powered by Dynamic Protection Plus Technology, the Shell Rimula Light Duty Range helps protect light duty trucks in three ways:It offers a 60-percent better wear protection against constant stopping and starting. Whenever the engine idles during traffic, this Shell technology protects against engine wear and tear.It has anti-oxidation components that prolong oil life.It also features dispersants in the additive package that help break down soot and deposit buildup, common in vehicles carrying variable loads. Shell’s Dynamic Protection Plus Technology improves engine cleanliness, emitting 46 percent less carbon deposits. “We are positive that these products will shed a whole new outlook to the business of logistics. But more important, we want this to be our driver’s partner in crime. Because of this, the new range of products will come at an affordable price point,” promises Wee."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/71838/walmart-rakuten-unveil-alliance-e-books-groceries","title":"Walmart, Rakuten unveil alliance on e-books, groceries","date":"05:21 PM January 29, 2018","snippet":"US retail giant Walmart and Japanese internet titan Rakuten unveiled a strategic partnership which will include collaboration on digital books in the United States and grocery delivery in Japan.","body":"US retail giant Walmart and Japanese internet titan Rakuten unveiled a strategic partnership which will include collaboration on digital books in the United States and grocery delivery in Japan. The two firms will launch a new online grocery delivery service in Japan later this year, and have agreed to a retail alliance making Walmart a key partner on e-books and audiobooks using the Rakuten format Kobo, according to a statement late Thursday.  The deal comes amid a growing international presence by US online giant Amazon, which offers an array of services in different countries including video, e-books and grocery delivery. “Rakuten is a strong e-commerce business and we’re excited to collaborate with the top online shopping destination in Japan,” said Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon, who met Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani in Tokyo to sign the agreement.  “We look forward to expanding our grocery footprint in Japan and launching a new offering of e-books and audiobooks for our customers in the US.” Mikitani said, “As global leaders in e-commerce and offline shopping, Rakuten and Walmart are uniquely positioned to empower our customers around the world with innovative services.”  The companies said a joint venture would be established between Japan online grocery delivery service Rakuten and Seiyu GK, a subsidiary of Walmart. The service “Rakuten Seiyu Netsuper” is planned for the latter half of 2018. The new service will be powered by Rakuten technology, using artificial intelligence “to offer a more personalized merchandise offering,” according to the statement. Additionally, Walmart will be the exclusive mass retail partner for the Kobo brand in the US, which includes e-readers and digital applications similar to those of Amazon’s Kindle. Kobo was created in Canada and acquired in 2011 by Rakuten.

Michael Hong, Mini Depato Corp. president, the master franchisee of MINISO stores in the Philippines, gave this advice when asked to comment about the future of retail amid an evolving digital landscape in the country. “Online selling is something we can use as retailers to reach out to more customers,” Hong told reporters last Friday on the sidelines of the opening of Japanese designer brand MINISO’s first store in Cebu City, its 36th outlet in the Philippines. Located on the second level of SM City Cebu, MINISO’s 36th store in the country boasts of a 560-square meter floor area, big enough to showcase products across nine different categories — life essentials, creative home necessities, health and beauty, jewelry, stylistic gifts, seasonal products, boutique package decoration, digital accessories, as well as food and drink. Hong shared that they plan to open 300 to 500 stores in the Philippines in the next five years, with no focus on any particular region. Among the factors they consider when opening a new store are the population of an area and the availability of prime spaces there. “As long as there are crowds in the malls, we will go there. We don’t care about buying power because the products we offer are very affordable,” he said. Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, MINISO was jointly founded by chief designer Miyake Jyunya and Chinese entrepreneur Ye Guofu in 2011. Since then, it has opened more than 1,000 stores all over the world with over 80 percent of the brand’s product designs originating from Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, China, and other countries. Hong said that with more people gaining access to the internet and the growing preference of consumers to make their purchases online, the company is also looking into using the digital platform for sales. He said that in the Philippines, for example, they can partner with online buy-and-sell platforms such as Lazada. Hong said that MINISO has not entered into a formal agreement with these platforms yet and that products from the brand currently sold online are being distributed illegally. Nonetheless, he said that collaborating with these online marketplaces is something they are seriously considering, although they have not set a timeline for it yet. “It will all depend on the development of online selling here in the Philippines,” said Hong. The growing global e-commerce industry has hurt traditional retail stores that have not caught up with the trend, of online shopping platforms such as Amazon, which now have the lion’s share of the market in the US. China’s Alibaba is also trailing behind as one of the most-used online shopping platform in the world. According to market research firm Euromonitor International, new digital services are seen to propel digital commerce growth. Key trends regarding the digital consumer should remain top priority for businesses worldwide."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/61818/ramar-foods-launches-new-e-commerce-site-crave-filipino","title":"Ramar Foods launches new e-commerce site Crave Filipino","date":"11:10 AM January 12, 2021","snippet":"","body":" PITTSBURG, California — Ramar Foods officially launched its own Filipino food e-commerce site, Crave Filipino, which provides home delivery of premium frozen Filipino food.  Known for its premium brands such as Magnolia, Orientex, Manila Gold, Frescano, and Primo Sorbetero, Ramar Foods invested in market research over the last three years, learning more about Filipino Americans’ shopping habits, leading to the launching of Crave Filipino.   According to several focus groups, the majority of Filipino consumers don’t have close proximity to an Asian grocery store where they can find Filipino frozen products. Most households in the Midwest and the East Coast are about an hour’s commute to a grocery store that meets their Filipino food cravings. “Crave Filipino is the solution to the fact that there are areas in the US where Filipino food isn’t easily accessible,” said Isabelle Laski, Sales Specialist–New Business at Ramar Foods. “Also, we recognized a few years ago that the CPG business was changing as e-commerce started growing on the grocery business side. We found that as an opportunity to become an e-commerce frozen Filipino food vendor.”  With ube and calamansi being one of the rarest finds for Filipino Americans, Crave Filipino aims to solve the issue of accessibility. Crave Filipino gives its consumers a chance to receive high-quality Filipino favorites safely and efficiently to their doors. Crave Filipino’s website will enable consumers to order their favorite Filipino frozen products online. The team will also launch a Facebook and an Instagram account for consumers to see promos, new releases/launches, and other content related to Crave Filipino.

In a statement to the Singapore Exchange, SingPost said a letter and a T-shirt in a parcel were transported by drone from Lorong Halus to Pulau Ubin—a distance of about 2 km, and taking about five minutes.  IDA worked on the drone so it could be used by SingPost. Ms Jacqueline Poh, IDA managing director, said: “The successful conclusion of this trial shows how SingPost is thinking out of the box and its willingness to expand its traditional mail delivery model in innovative ways.  “Although it will be a while before it is viable for drone mail delivery to take off in Singapore, taking into consideration commercial and safety factors, this first step by SingPost and IDA demonstrates what Singapore is trying out with our Smart Nation vision—to have the various parts of our ecosystem collaborate, experiment with new ways of doing things, and in the process, literally aim for the sky with new technology.” SingPost said the drone is equipped with enhanced safety features and is complemented with a prototype app designed with security and verification features that ensures the mail reaches its intended recipient. It has the capacity to carry a payload of up to half a kilogram, fly at a height of up to 45 m and travel a distance of 2.3 km. The focus of the flight was to test the drone technology and safety boundaries. Dr Wolfgang Baier, SingPost group chief executive, said: “SingPost is pioneering eCommerce logistics across Asia-Pacific and building ecosystems to facilitate eCommerce for businesses as well as end consumers. “We are seeing success in our digital transformation which did not happen overnight. Our success is made possible through collaborations with industry experts and our business partners.

As of Tuesday, the NBI Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) said it had received at least 20 complaints for fraud against Cleverbuy, mostly in connection with tour packages that one of its “business partners”—J2 Travel and Tours Co.—failed to deliver on.  According to the complainants, Cleverbuy offered to reimburse their money after the travel agency suddenly closed shop last month. However, the online buying site also shut down its office at Marvin Plaza Building on Don Chino Roces Avenue in Makati City last month, leaving the complainants with no hope of ever getting their money back.  One of the complainants, a female medical representative from Quezon City who asked not to be named, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that she bought a tour package to Coron, Palawan province, from J2 Travel on the Cleverbuy website for P70,000 in October. On May 18, she went to the travel agency’s office at V.M. Condominium on Amorsolo Street in Makati City and found it closed.  A man in the building told her to go to the Cleverbuy office instead, but she said she waited until she received a text message advising her to go back to the travel agency on June 1, 4 and 5 to get a reimbursement. “I figured that since the J2 Travel office was already closed, I should proceed to Cleverbuy since I was told that all problems with J2 would be settled by Cleverbuy. But when I got to their office on May 29, the office was already closed. Cleverbuy had a seventh floor office that had also closed down,” she told the Inquirer. Another complainant, a 30-year-old housewife from Marikina City, told the Inquirer that she was lured into buying a Boracay tour package for P34,000—a price that was advertised as 70 percent lower than the original. She added that when she went to the J2 Travel office to make her bookings, she found it closed so she went to the Cleverbuy office on May 21 where a staff member  asked her to write down the names of her traveling companions. “I asked the staff member if Cleverbuy would be making the [travel] arrangements and would be confirming the flight, and the employee said yes,” she said. She was also given the customer hotline number and another number to call for updates.  However, when she tried calling the two numbers later, no one answered her calls. Another Cleverbuy customer told the NBI that he paid P110,000 for a package tour to Palawan from J2 Travel on the Cleverbuy website. The Inquirer tried to call the J2 Travel office through the numbers listed on its website but the phones just kept on ringing. There was also no response when the Inquirer dialed the contact number listed on the Cleverbuy website. As of Tuesday, the website was still up although there were only two deals being advertised—one from YJC Beauty and Slim Center offering treatment for stretch marks and the other, a facial pampering package from Californian Bloom Aesthetic Institute & Medical Spa. The Inquirer called Californian Bloom’s Quezon City branch where it learned from a staffer that the company had stopped honoring deals brought from Cleverbuy since last week. Asked why, the staffer said that they had yet to receive payment from the online buying site for the services they rendered to customers. However, Dr. Mei Ying Ho, owner of YJC Beauty, said that they would continue to honor packages bought from Cleverbuy  although she acknowledged that this would mean losses for her clinic. “We will serve them although we have no way of knowing whether we will be able to collect payment from Cleverbuy. Kawawa naman ang mga customers,” she told the Inquirer. According to her, the online buying site owes her more than P100,000. “We have a good relationship with Cleverbuy so I did not collect payment from them [for previous packages]. I guess I trusted them too much,” she said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Ho said she learned about Cleverbuy’s financial problems only two days ago. “I had no reaction because I didn’t know how to react,” she added. NBI-CCU head Migdonio Congzon Jr., meanwhile, told the Inquirer that they were collating all complaints against the company. “We have yet to validate the incorporators of the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But we discovered that the company was registered only in December last year although it has been operating even before that,” he said. Congzon told the Inquirer that it was the first time the NBI had received complaints about an online buying site. Those who want to file a complaint against Cleverbuy can contact the NBI Anti-Fraud and Action Division at 5238231 to 38 locals 3491 or 3456, or the Computer Crimes Division at locals 3454 or 3455."}]}
