Called ‘cloud franchise’, one can start a Binalot business at home.  “All we require you to have is your kitchen and a dedicated refrigerator and freezer for the Binalot stocks,” Binalot operations manager Judee Morente said in a statement Tuesday.  He said Binalot will also provide training for operations, food handling, marketing, and human resources.  The company will also set up a delivery system so that the franchisee will have convenient food delivery service.  “Truly, this pandemic has affected the food industry worldwide, and Binalot was not spared. Sales decreased to less than half as people stayed home, they stayed away from the malls and office spaces and factories became vacant. Thus, most of our current sales are in the form of delivery sales,” Morente added.  Binalot chief executive officer Rommel Juan said the company now shifts to community-based franchise as more people work from home and food deliveries in residential areas have increased.  “At Binalot, we try to see the opportunity in every crisis. Problems are seen as challenges that need to be addressed. There is a need and we provide an opportunity to fill this need. So now we want to give this opportunity to offer Binalot to cloud franchisees to serve their own residential areas and have a profitable business for themselves,” Juan said.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this reminder after a video of a GrabFood rider being barred from delivering lugaw (hot rice porridge) went viral. “A video, which has been circulating online, has come to our attention. Lugaw, or any food item for that matter, is considered an essential good,” Roque said in a statement. Roque on March 27 said delivery and courier services transporting essential goods will be allowed during the ECQ. “Delivery of food items must remain unhampered 24/7. Huwag natin harangin sa checkpoints (Let’s not stop them at checkpoints),” he added. In a Facebook live video early Wednesday morning, rider Marvin Ignacio was apparently scolded by a female personnel from San Jose del Monte City government in Bulacan at a quarantine checkpoint, saying the lugaw is a non-essential item. \"Essential po ba si Lugaw? Hindi. Kasi mabubuhay ang tao ng walang lugaw,\" she was videoed as saying. She cited the curfew in areas under ECQ from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. by showing the rider a copy of guidelines issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). However, she seemed to have forgotten that Authorized Persons Outside Residence (APORs), workers, cargo vehicles, and public transportation exempted by the said curfew. She said the rider should explain the IATF guidelines to the company he works for. “Sabihin niyo dun sa Grab niyo. Paano po ‘yan pinapa-implement namin (Tell that to Grab.

Early morning Monday, Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso signed Executive Order (EO) No. 07 “declaring certain barangays or portions of the city as critical zones per zoning containment strategy in order to provide rapid response operation to contain the resurgence and spread of Covid-19.” “I have signed 6 a.m. this morning a new Executive Order declaring the following barangays: 185 Zone 16 in Tondo, 374 Zone 38 in Sta.

EO No. 07 states that the lockdown will give way to the conduct of disease surveillance, massive contact tracing, and verification or testing, and rapid risk assessment. Data from the Manila Health Department (MHD) data showed that Barangay 185 has 11 active cases, Barangay 374 has 628, Barangay 847 has 10, Barangay 521 has 12, and Barangay 675 has 22. Moreno earlier said that a village or building with at least 10 cases will be automatically locked down, with recommendation from the MHD. All residents of affected villages will not be allowed to go out of their homes, except for the following: health workers, military personnel, service workers (pharmacies, drug stores, and funeral homes), utility workers (energy, cable, internet, telecommunication companies, water, sanitation, and critical transport facilities including port operation), essential workers (goods delivery, food delivery, banking and money services), barangay officials (chairpersons, secretary, treasurers, kagawad, and executive officers), and media practitioners accredited by the Presidential Communications Operations Office and the Inter-Agency Task Force. \"Station Commanders of Police Stations covering the said barangays are hereby directed to employ and deploy officers and personnel in strategic locations and areas necessary for the effective implementation of the ECQ,\" the EO read.

In a news release, DILG spokesperson Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said declaring unified curfew hours is urgently needed after the Department of Health and other health professionals declared an urgent need to regulate the movement of people because of the spike in cases, which has reached more than 4,000 daily. \"With the imposition of the common curfew hours plus the other policies currently being implemented in Metro LGUs, such as localized/granular lockdowns and the crackdown (on) violators of minimum public health standards, we hope to see a decline of coronavirus cases in the following weeks,\" Malaya said, urging the public to cooperate. DILG Officer-in-Charge Bernardo Florece Jr. recently ordered the Philippine National Police to implement a crackdown on quarantine violators, impose the curfew rules, and intensify the enforcement of minimum public health standards in all villages. Apart from setting common curfew hours, the MMDA resolution likewise imposes granular lockdown, strict implementation of health protocols and standards, and intensified testing, contact tracing, and isolation. Workers returning from or going to work are exempted from the unified curfew if they present their company identification or other proof to the police or barangay authorities/checkpoints, Malaya explained. Operators, and/or employees of medical/health care/emergency service, public utility vehicles, food delivery, convenience stores, restaurants, business process outsourcing, wholesale markets and delivery, and other similar or related essential personnel and services are also exempted. The LGUs will determine who would be exempted from the uniform curfew in Metro Manila, especially the sanctions to be imposed on violators. “We will have a Metro-wide uniform curfew hours but as to those who will be exempted, we leave it to the LGUs and how they will sanction violators,” he added. Malaya cited Mandaluyong City, which has been implementing the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew hours since June 2020, but exempted the delivery of necessities, such as food and medicine; workers assigned on night shifts; and peace and order personnel both in the city and barangay levels from the order. Quezon City likewise committed to impose more stringent curfew hours “with exemptions for individuals who are still out for purposes of work, or on the way home from work; those dealing with emergencies; or for purposes of air/sea travel as shown by pre-booked tickets.” On a case-to-case basis, villages may request the city government for authority to impose a longer curfew.

In a virtual presser on Thursday, Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chair Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos said the MMC agreed on implementing uniform curfew hours from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for two weeks in the NCR. “A resolution is being drafted and will be signed by all mayors. This will only be for two weeks. Kung ito ay may improvement, maaaring tanggalin na po ito (if there will be improvement, we may remove this),” Abalos said. He said essential workers, such as those working for restaurant or food delivery services, will still be allowed outside during curfew hours but must present their work identification card or certificate. “Even with the curfew, establishments like food deliveries can operate 24 hours, yung mga (those) essential services,” Abalos said. The decision, he said, was made after health experts from the Department of Health (DOH) and the University of the Philippines (UP) OCTA Research team warned the MMC of the “alarming” number of new Covid-19 cases. “We had a meeting with the UP OCTA Research team. And from February 4 to 10, new cases per day is at 360. From March 4 to 10—from 360—it reached 1,411 in the NCR. And according to their figures, from 8 percent of new cases, it reached 60 percent from March 4 to 10. The numbers are quite alarming as far as NCR mayors are concerned,” Abalos said. Contact tracing Aside from implementing the curfew, he said the MMC will intensify testing for Covid-19, contact tracing, and quarantine efforts. Abalos said Covid-19 testing czar, Secretary Vince Dizon, with the help of the Philippine Red Cross, donated 25,000 testing kits. “Ito ho ay initial pa lang at marami pa hong pupunta at dire-diretso po ito (This is just the beginning, more will come and this will continue),” Abalos said. To help increase contact tracing efforts, he said the MMDA will send 300 contact tracers to local government units (LGU) in NCR, aside from the 360 contact tracers from the Philippine National Police (PNP). He said the MMC also sought the help of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to provide experienced contact tracers. “All of the mayors of Metro Manila have their own contact tracers and they can afford to hire more contact tracers. Pero dahil kailangan natin ng experienced contact tracers, kumakatok po tayo sa DILG (But because we need experienced contact tracers, we’re knocking on the door of the DILG),” Abalos said. Granular lockdowns To avoid further spread of Covid-19, he said the MMC will focus on “granular lockdowns” or implementing lockdowns in small areas such as streets or barangays with high number of infections. “Iigtingan din ng mga alkalde ang granular lockdown. Kung may clustering—bawat bahay, bawat kalye—maaari po itong isarado ng mga alkalde (Our mayors will intensify granular lockdowns. If there are clustering—every home, every street—these may be closed by our mayors),” Abalos said. He said barangay officials and the police will be ordered to strictly enforce minimum health standards such as wearing face masks and face shields and proper physical distancing, noting that the spike in Covid-19 cases may be caused by the “lax” observance of these policies aside from the spread of the more infectious UK and South African variants. While LGUs NCR opted to impose unform curfew hours, Abalos said sanctions on violators may vary depending on the ordinance of each LGU. “Ang iniiwasan po natin ay mga nagka-cluster na mga tao sa mga kalye, talagang maghihigpit po tayo diyan (What we’re trying to avoid is clustering in public, we’re really going to be strict on that),” Abalos said. He urged the public to comply with the curfew and other health policies, noting that individual discipline is key to avoiding further spread of Covid-19. “Tandaan natin, ibang klase itong nangyayari ngayon. At the end of the day, importante ang disiplina ng bawat isa (We must remember, what’s happening is very different. At the end of the day, what’s important is individual discipline),” Abalos added.

In filing House Resolution No. 1626 on Mar. 3, Herrera cited an increasing number of complaints from senior citizens who could not avail of the 20-percent discount mandated by law for food deliveries using applications like Food Panda and Grab, among others.  Section 3(g) of Republic Act (RA) 9944, or the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, provides that “for delivery orders, the 20 percent discount shall likewise apply subject to certain conditions, i.e. senior citizen ID card number must be given while making the order over the telephone.”  It also provides that the senior citizen ID card must be presented upon delivery to verify the identity of the senior citizen entitled to the discount.  Herrera said the law covers food deliveries made through Food Panda, Grab, and other similar applications.  However, she said senior citizens are presently unable to avail of the benefit when ordering through food delivery apps.  Herrera proposed that food delivery service providers incorporate the appropriate discounts into the account holder’s profile to allow senior citizens to avail of their discount.  She underscored the need to extend assistance to senior citizens by providing discounts to this sector given their limited income due to restrictions in movement.  “The money equivalent to the 20 percent discount of the senior citizens may be utilized for the medicine and other maintenance expenses as well as other necessities,” she said in her resolution.

Residents are advised to observe proper wearing of face mask and face shield, as well as to maintain physical distancing at all times to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the holidays. \"Caroling is still banned in Metro Manila because as we know, singing spreads a lot of aerosol particles in the air which then spreads the virus—as much as possible, we would like to avoid any activities which could cause and hasten the spread of the virus,” Zamora said. Zamora said the city government is considering to allow 75-percent capacity of malls, restaurants, and other commercial establishments in San Juan.

James Kodrowski, managing director of Foodie.ph, told reporters here on Thursday that the company is “aggressively looking for more partner restaurants in Metro Cebu”. The company has over a hundred vendors in Metro Manila, he said. The delivery firm recently expanded to the Cebu market, where demand for food delivery has seen an unprecedented growth driven by consumers buying food online during the quarantine period. “The pandemic has brought challenges in sourcing event requirements. Foodie.ph can fix any corporate food requirements and effectively fill this gap between the corporate customers and the restaurants,” Kodrowski said. Cebu’s corporate customers who need bulk food, whether for meetings, conferences, or catering, now have more delivery options. Existing food delivery companies such as Grab Food and Foodpanda have also been seeing this strong demand since the start of the lockdowns early this year. Foodie.ph in particular is seeing a growing demand for food group delivery. “We are an enterprise-level platform that allows corporate clients to efficiently order online. Customers do not need to worry about quarantine restrictions when ordering for group food,” he said. Cebu's expanding delivery industry has been boosted by growing consumer demand amid the Covid-19-induced social distancing and stay-at-home protocols. The firm has a dedicated in-house call center and logistics team that gather quotations, contact restaurants, track and deliver the orders with a guaranteed on-time delivery service.

Frank Carbon, chief executive officer of Metro Bacolod Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MBCCI), on Tuesday said the resumption of passenger and cargo ferry service between the cities of Bacolod and Iloilo is encouraging.  “Western Visayas is now open for business with the unhampered movement of people and goods,” said Carbon, operator of fastcraft service Weesam Express.  On Oct. 31, fastcraft services from Bacolod to Iloilo and vice versa have already resumed.  He said traders in the region have committed to restart their trading activities considering that inter-province trading actually contributes 20 to 30 percent to the local economy.  Carbon said hotels in Bacolod are now ready to accept guests, and Sipalay City, one of the major tourism destinations in Negros Occidental, is also reopening to tourists this week.  More than 20 LGUs in Negros Occidental have allowed the reopening of their leisure destinations for tourists under strict health protocols.  In Bacolod, the food delivery service sector is thriving, Carbon said.  He said with the decreasing Covid-19 cases in the city, Bacolod is ready to open for business.  “The National Inter-Agency Task Force is encouraging local government units to start stirring up the local economy,” he added.

This, after moving around the province of Negros Oriental and within his hometown for the past several months since March, when quarantine restrictions were first imposed, as he attended to many locally-stranded individuals (LSIs) and returning overseas Filipinos (OFWs). “Baling agwanta namo nga mag-suot ug PPE, usahay magutman, dili maka adto sa banyo kung magsuot ug hazmat suit, kulang ug tulog, kapoy, ug karon, mao ni ang nahitabo sa amoa (we have endured wearing PPE or personal protective equipment, sometimes we go hungry, cannot go to the bathroom when wearing hazardous materials suits, are deprived of sleep, exhausted, and now this happened to us)”, he said, asking anonymity for safety reasons. Julian said he and a few other front-liners, while on a trip up north last week, came in close contact with their female friend who was later traced to be a direct contact of yet another allied health worker who tested positive for the coronavirus. And since they are considered second-generation contacts, they are now under quarantine while waiting for their own test results. “Ang among barkada wala pa naabot ang iyang swab result pero gi-warningan na mi daan kay ang iyang mama nag manifest man ug symptoms (our friend is still awaiting her swab result but she already warned us because her mother had manifested symptoms already,” he said. “We were exposed unknowingly to the direct contact of a positive case.” What concerns Julian is that the source of infection among this particular group has not yet been determined and that many people are now being monitored for symptoms. Julian is just among the many hundreds of quarantined individuals in Negros Oriental for being a contact, regardless of what level, to a Covid-19 positive patient as cases surged in the province in recent weeks. Now, he is joining the bandwagon of netizens, residents, and other sectors calling for people to stay home. While there is still no official pronouncement from health authorities here of community transmission, local transmissions of the novel coronavirus have already been reported in some towns and cities, and even at the barangay level. A group of doctors belonging to the Negros Oriental Medical Society in a press briefing on Thursday urged the public to do a self-imposed quarantine to help stem the spread of the virus. According to the physicians, the situation here is “alarming”. While acknowledging the need to strike a balance between allowing the local economy to recover and protecting the health and safety of the people, the doctors are appealing to people to do away with non-essential trips outside of their homes, as well as avoiding mass gatherings. “Let us not think of ourselves but tanan sa Negros Oriental (all residents of Negros Oriental),” Dr. Dehuel Cuyacot, a pulmonologist said. Cuyacot said that for every person afflicted with the virus, he or she can contaminate up to seven or eight people, and the same number will multiply further. Dr. Bryan Calinawan, for his part, said that the real situation here is still uncertain as hundreds of test results have yet to be released while pointing out that many people are going about their daily routines as if there is nothing to worry about. “Wala pa kita nahuman aning problemaha (we are not done yet with this problem)”, he said. The doctors are calling for stricter measures to stem the spread of the virus, amid growing fears of rising cases widely linked to authorized persons outside of residence (APORs) who returned early this month from a trip to Metro Manila. Dr. Caesar Antonio O. Ligo, another pulmonologist, in an interview said that “our medical group is advocating self-ECQ (enhanced community quarantine) for the next two to three weeks since it is not economically feasible for the government to implement and sustain it.” “We have a super spreader in our midst and aside from the usual health protocols, limiting movement, assemblies, and gatherings should significantly slow down the virus spread,” he added. He was referring to an APOR whose timeline showed that he had visited so many places and had come into contact with many people days before he was tested positive for the coronavirus. That person’s movements alone had led to the temporary shutdown of several institutions that he visited for disinfection, while his companions who were also infected with the virus had their own individual timelines that showed more contacts in places here and outside of this capital. Asked if the province and the capital city (where the majority of the bigger hospitals are located) are ready for widespread infections, he said “we do not have enough rooms” for Covid-19 patients. Dr. Candace Catacutan, also a pulmonologist, in a Facebook post that was shared by her colleagues, said that “we are seeing a sudden increase in cases daily now. Each positive patient will have their own set of contacts who got infected and so on and so forth.” “The virus will not wait for our protocols (and so) we need to limit the movement of people ASAP,” she added. The doctors are pushing for work-from-home arrangements, going out only for essential errands, no dining out and opting for food delivery, avoiding large gatherings, as well as the usual observance and practice of health protocols. Julian’s call for honesty by those who have been exposed to infected patients or even up to the Nth degree of contacts is widely shared by many residents who are fearful that the cases in Negros Oriental might just blow out of proportion if strict regulations are not put in place. He said it is better to be honest and subjected to quarantine while “riding out the storm”, regardless of the test results, than unnecessarily exposing more people to the deadly coronavirus. “It is a sacrifice that will benefit the entire population of Negros Oriental, and I’m praying I will turn up negative of the virus. Until then, we will have to find ways to entertain ourselves in the quarantine facility, and once we’re ready, we will be going back to doing what we have been doing as front-liners,” he added. “Please stay at home and heed the call of the doctors and other authorities. And always observe proper health and safety protocols,” Julian said. (PNA) "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1119381","title":"DOLE to roll out 'free bikes project' for informal workers","date":" October 22, 2020, 2:54 pm","snippet":"MANILA – Around 900 informal sector workers who were displaced due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic are set to benefit from the initial rollout of the “free bicycles project” of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).","body":"MANILA – Around 900 informal sector workers who were displaced due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic are set to benefit from the initial rollout of the “free bicycles project” of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). “We will be giving free bicycles, which is called ‘free bisikleta (bicycles) project’ since many of us are patronizing online delivery services.

At the onset of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, the government has implemented quarantine measures. Many businesses were forced to close, dine in restaurants and fast food chains were prohibited during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), making delivery services apps more useful during the lockdown period. But how is it for areas, particularly provinces, where these apps are not available? This was when Edmond Ramos from Malolos, Bulacan converted their small neighborhood online group on Facebook into an online food selling platform that eventually offers food delivery services now called Food Malolos Group. Ramos, an active administrator of the Food Malolos Group, recalled that his friend created the Facebook group in 2019 to promote and sell home-made Japanese food cooked by his father. Initially, members of the Facebook group were only family and friends in their neighborhood until they invited more people in the private group and reached more than 1,000 members by the end of 2019, Ramos said. When the pandemic hit the country, however, they added online food sellers and buyers mostly from Malolos and neighboring municipalities in Bulacan like Guiguinto and Calumpit. According to Ramos, Food Malolos Group now has over 20,000 members with some members are based in Metro Manila. Of the total members, around 70 percent are online food and food-related sellers – 10 percent of which had their physical stores before the pandemic, and the rest are new online entrepreneurs. From sideline to livelihood Kris Villanueva, an online seller in Food Malolos Group, has resigned from her work as a teacher and guidance counselor in a private school and decided to focus on her business. Villanueva said cooking and online selling were not new to her as she loves to cook and was selling her specialty ‘relyenong bangus’ (stuffed milkfish) as a sideline before the Covid-19 pandemic. She and her partner decided to expand their food business as they now also cook and sell other Filipino food.  “In terms of income, I proudly say that it’s better in business. You will learn how to budget, limit your expenses, and save from your earnings. Eventually, your business will grow as long as you know how to handle your money. Plus, you don't have bosses! You have all your time. And no more paperwork, but more on accounting,” she added. Villanueva said they are planning to open their physical store once the Covid-19 health crisis is over. “For now, we will continue what we've started, selling food online since we're known already and we’re having customers from different areas in Bulacan,” she said. Villanueva is still doing teaching jobs but only for tutorials as she focuses on her online food venture. Source of income for displaced workers Food Malolos Group also provided a new source of income for people who lost their jobs but have motorcycles. Ramos said they have seen the need to also include riders to cater to delivery services for food sellers and their customers. Since the group’s system is not as sophisticated as delivery apps, he said Food Malolos Group’s administrators manually assign delivery men to online food sellers. Food Malolos Group, which maintains standard delivery fees, also regulates its members by requiring them to indicate prices of products they are posting and to follow the standard delivery fees for riders. “Hindi kami naniningil sa riders ng membership fee gaya ng mga delivery apps. Nagbubutaw lang sila araw-araw ng PHP35 dahil required para sa business permit namin na kumikita kami (We don’t ask our riders for membership fee, unlike delivery app companies. They just give us PHP35 per day as dues because we have to earn so we can get business permit),” Ramos said. He said people behind Food Malolos Group earn an average of PHP30,000 a month from riders’ PHP35-per-day contributions. “Ayaw talaga sana naming maningil pero kailangang kumikita ka para mabigyan ka ng business permit (We really don’t want to charge fees but we need to so we can get business permit),” he added. He is also proud that Food Malolos Group is registered with the Department of Trade and Industry and now pays taxes to the government. “Gusto lang naming makatulong sa komunidad namin noong ECQ. Natutuwa naman kami na marami na rin pala kaming natulungan lalo na ‘yong mga nawalan ng trabaho (We just want to help to the community during the ECQ. We are happy that we have helped many especially those who lost their jobs)” he added.

Under the agreement, the two parties agreed to provide additional means for tricycle drivers to generate income by maximizing online food delivery services amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Mayor Rex Gatchalian said the pact will address the current situation of the tricycle drivers in Valenzuela City. \"Dagdag ito sa hanapbuhay ng mga driver natin na patuloy na naaapektuhan nitong krisis na ito (This is an additional livelihood for our drivers who are still hit by the prevailing crisis),\" Gatchalian said in a Facebook live video. He added the partnership is part of the city's efforts to embrace the new normal activities. \"This is an instruction of the new normal since it is not advisable anymore that we go to restaurants but rather to avail of the services of the restaurants. We bring it [food] to them [people]. We know that Food Panda’s partnership with different restaurants is of a large scale, this is a proof that we can help our Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises here in Valenzuela,\" Gatchalian said. The city government said that under the memorandum, the existing 'PasaBuy system'– the online food delivery service will be improved and open up more livelihood opportunities for Tricycle Operators and Drivers' Associations (TODAs) in the city. According to the city government, Foodpanda, one of the most popular online food delivery apps in the country–has initiated \"pandaTODA\"–a Corporate Social Advocacy (CSA), to support local communities ensuring that its partner restaurants are made more available and accessible to the people. It also seeks to provide alternative means of living to tricycle drivers who were adversely affected by the public transportation restrictions amid the imposition of the community quarantine. The agreement stated that the TODAs in the city will be part of the delivery system, Gatchalian said, assuring more options for the tricycle drivers to earn during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Leopoldo de Castro, Jr., FPPI finance director, said the company only aims to support the displaced TODA riders. \"At the same time, this program supports the community to lessen the foot traffic outside their homes,” de Castro added. “Our contribution is basically, we aim to deliver the food at the doorstep of each and every homeowner. So ‘yun ‘yung ating pangako sa ating komunidad and iyan ‘yung aming tulong sa panahon ng pandemiya (this is our promise and this is our assistance to the community during the time of the pandemic),” he said. The local government said the Ordinance No. 710, Series of 2020, or the \"Pasabuy sa TODA Ordinance\" also supports the agreement of the city with Foodpanda. The ordinance also aims to entice TODA drivers to temporarily engage in online delivery services outside their franchise coverage and to also assist them in the registration process to be an online delivery or \"pasabuy\" service. The tricycle operations in the city are still limited and are based on an odd-even number coding scheme following the minimum health standards set by the IATF. The city government said those tricycle drivers whose numbers are not allowed to ply the roads on a specific day, can operate as a pandaTODA rider. The city's Public Employment Service Office – Local Economic Investment Promotions Office (PESO-LEIPO) and the Public Order and Safety Group (POSG) of the City will identify and screen the qualified beneficiary drivers for the program.

In an interview Thursday, Lim said closing the borders of the province to non-essential travels, online registration for locally stranded individuals (LSIs) from outside the region, tracing asymptomatic patients through constant testing, wearing of face masks, among others, are important to contain the spread of the virus.  “We already expect this since the borders have opened especially to those from the National Capital Region (NCR). Most cases recorded were those who had a travel history to NCR (National Capital Region). There must be control over the travel of people from NCR to the province. One of the best ways to do it is to have online registration,” he said.  Lim said borders of the province should be closed to non-essential travels, except for essentials such as food delivery, among others, as businesses will continue within the province or region.  “We close the borders to non-essential travels from outside the province or region, then all local government units should trace, isolate, and treat the asymptomatic patients so that there will be no new cases who have traveled outside the province, and then reassess. If the local transmission is high, then closing the borders doesn’t matter anymore,” he added.  In Dagupan City, Lim said targeted mass testing for its vulnerable sector like the public utility vehicle drivers, market vendors, and front-liners, is regularly done.  “The expense of testing is smaller as compared to closing the economy due to the increased number of Covid-19 cases. To all LGUs, if the budget permits, keep on testing,” he said, adding the city will realign some of its funding for more tests.  Lim also advised the residents to always wear face masks to prevent further spread of the virus as he expressed support for the proposal to penalize violators.  “It should have been done earlier.

The order also states that “all other commercial, industrial, retail, institutional and other activities not mentioned in above exemptions in the said district shall be suspended within the specified period of ECQ\". Meanwhile, “station commanders of police stations in the said barangays are hereby directed to employ and deploy officers and personnel in strategic locations and areas necessary for the effective implementation of the ECQ”. Response efforts lauded The city government of Manila, meanwhile, was praised by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) for its response measures against Covid-19. In a Facebook post of the Manila Public Information Office on Tuesday, it stated that DILG director Rolynne Javier, in a meeting with Domagoso, lauded the city's efforts in containing COvid-19. \"Kahanga-hanga ang naging aksyon ng Pamahalaang Lungsod ng Maynila upang sugpuin ang coronavirus disease sa lungsod at tulungan ang mga Manileño habang ipinatutupad ang community quarantine (The actions made by the city government of Manila to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus in the city and the support given to its residents are impressive),” she said. Javier said the local government made sure that help was given to every family in the city during the time that many are unable to work. She also noted that Manila recorded a high number of recoveries from Covid-19. Javier also commended Domagoso for applying different measures to fight the spread of Covid-19, including the establishment of the Manila Infectious Disease Control Center (MIDCC) and the Digital Health Survey to promptly respond to the health needs of Manilenyos.

A copy of the bill was released to the media on Monday. The bill stated that violators will receive a penalty of prision mayor or at least 6 years of jail time, as well as a fine of PHP100,000 pesos. Violators shall likewise be required to reimburse the food and delivery service providers for the value of the food and grocery items advanced by the delivery riders and be made to pay an amount of money double the fee pertinent to the canceled transaction. It also covers instances wherein customers order food and grocery items for the purpose of prank, or those who have no “genuine intention” of availing of the service which causes damages and undue duress to the delivery riders and service providers. “Sa panahon ngayon, napakahalaga ng mga riders na nais nating proteksyonan.

It offers delivery service that allows residents to buy food without the need to leave their homes. The local tricycle drivers are the city’s partner delivery riders. SM City Baliwag mall manager Rodora Tolentino said the \"Bulacan 3 Wheels On-the-Go\" is one of their ways to support the community. “The program helps people to practice the new norm,” she said. Under the program, customers may call Baliwag Delivery Services hotlines by cluster, depending on their area. Each customer is assigned a partner delivery rider to purchase orders at their chosen stores in SM City Baliwag. Orders will be delivered right at their doorsteps. Payments are through cash on delivery (COD) scheme. Baliwag Delivery Services hotlines are: Cluster 1 (0977-246-5137), Cluster 2 (0977-246-5135), Cluster 3 (0977-246-5136). Delivery service is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and orders must be made one day before delivery date. Minimum purchase is PHP300 and maximum is PHP2,000.

Arrested were Jan Herbert Roxas, 43; Hersky Cabarlo, 43; Rudini Arabacan, 36; and Roseler Villalba, 39. The suspects were arrested in a drug buy-bust operation conducted by the operatives of Regional Drug Enforcement Unit 6 and Regional Intelligence Division 6 at Deca Homes Subdivision, Balabag village, Sta. Barbara, Iloilo. Lt. Col. Gilbert Gorero, concurrent spokesperson of PRO-6, told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) on Thursday that the four sourced their contraband from Capiz. “They deliver the supply to support the needs of those who use illegal drugs like in the city of Iloilo and Iloilo province. The four are all residents of Capiz. Sometimes, they are using Food Panda to deliver. That is according to the information we gathered,” he said. However, the police did not confirm whether the suspects are working as delivery riders. Gorero, likewise, cannot confirm whether the mode of operation has emerged only during the community quarantine period. The suspects fell after they conspired and helped each other in selling a piece of heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing suspected shabu for PHP2,000. Also recovered from their possession were a piece of transparent round plastic container with suspected shabu and 17 pieces of big heat-sealed plastic sachet also containing suspected shabu with an estimated street value of PHP2 million, and PHP2,000 buy-bust money, the police said. Gorero said they might be connected to drug operators in Capiz but deliver the contraband to Iloilo because of the demand and also to avoid detection from Capiz authorities. “They grabbed the opportunity that the selling of drugs might have slowed down but we see, our recent drug arrests were made in Roxas City or Capiz. They might have detected the police operations in Capiz that is why they went to Iloilo,” he said. Gorero said cases have already been filed against the suspects for violating Republic Act 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. They will also face charges of resisting arrest, he said. Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Rene Pamuspusan, PRO 6 regional director, lauded the successful operation conducted by the drug operatives despite the pandemic. “We will continue our relentless operation against illegal drugs amidst pandemic until we have arrested and jailed the last illegal drug dealer or pusher here in Western Visayas,\" Pamuspusan said.

The IATF-EID also permits the full operations of power, energy, water, and other utilities, agriculture, fishery and forestry industries; food manufacturing and food supply chain businesses; food preparation establishments; and food delivery services in areas where GCQ was enforced. Health-related establishments; the logistics sector; information technology and telecommunication firms; and media establishments are still authorized to operate at full capacity in GCQ zones. Mining and other manufacturing and electric commerce companies, as well as other delivery, repair and maintenance, and housing and office services, can also operate “between 50 percent up to full operational capacity” in areas put under GCQ, according to the guidelines. The IATF-EID also authorizes financial services; legal and accounting, and auditing services; professional, scientific, technical, and other non-leisure services; and other non-leisure wholesale and retail firms to operate at “50 percent work-on-site arrangement, and without prejudice to work-from-home and other alternative work arrangements in GCQ areas.

For many businesses and even the government service, Senator Sonny Angara sees the work from home arrangements continuing even after the lockdown is lifted or at least until a vaccine is found for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In some cases, businesses have also made adjustments to their operations because of the losses they have incurred over the lockdown period and this includes downsizing. “We are seeing the growth of the so-called gig economy in the country and with the extended period of the lockdown being implemented because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be even more activities on this front as businesses have to adjust to the new normal,” Angara said. “Workers affected by the lockdown will also be exploring new ways to make a living and with many businesses shutting down because they are unable to cope with their losses, people will start looking at alternative means of livelihood,” he added. To prepare Filipinos for the skills needed for the gig economy and to promote and strengthen digital careers, Angara has filed Senate Bill 1469 or the National Digital Careers Act. The gig economy refers to the practice of companies of hiring short-term, independent contractors or freelancers. Jobs available to these freelancers usually fall under the umbrella of digital careers and in most instances the work is done outside of the office and payment is made based on output and fulfilment of deliverables. There are also freelance jobs that have become staples in the Philippine setting such as those in Transportation Network Vehicle Service system, food delivery and courier services, and even home sharing. In 2019, Forbes ranked the Philippines sixth among the fastest growing markets for freelancers, with a 35 percent income growth from the previous year. Paypal, in its 2018 Global Freelancer Insights Report, analyzed 22 countries and noted that the Philippines has one of the highest number of freelancers per capita, at around 2 percent or roughly 1.5 to 2 million Filipinos. “Freelancers are usually paid very well. They get to work at home, at their own pace, and without their micromanaging bosses looming over them. It’s the perfect set up for people who qualify for these jobs,” Angara said. “On the part of the employers, hiring freelancers mean lower costs on their part and they get to tap a huge talent pool, all of which would make a positive impact on their bottom line,” he added. The bill seeks to establish a legal framework for the gig economy that will map out strategies to promote and strengthen digital careers and institutionalize employment standards for digital career workers. It also tasks the Department of Information and Communications Technology, the Department of Education, the Commission on Higher Education and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority to create, design and develop programs to ensure access to trainings, market and other forms of support or innovation strategies for digital careers. “But first we have to ensure that the infrastructure is in place, specifically to provide reliable, high-speed internet access in all areas of the country. A lot of our activities under the new normal will rely on internet connectivity — be it education or commerce, so this must be among our national priorities now,” Angara said. Under the bill, the DICT, together with the Department of Budget and Management, Department of Public Works and Highways and other relevant departments and agencies are tasked to ensure universal access to high-speed, quality and affordable internet by prioritizing and facilitating the development of connectivity infrastructures in the localities across the country. The development of digital careers is one of the thrusts of Tatak Pinoy, an initiative of Angara that is meant to spur innovation, address supply chain issues, and develop the skills of Filipinos so that they will be prepared to face the demands of the constantly changing marketplace. Some of the common lucrative digital jobs in the market today are the following: -- Web development and designing;-- Online teaching and tutoring;-- Content creation (writing and copywriting and others);-- Digital marketing (e-Commerce, sales and marketing);-- Creative design, graphic designing, 3D modelling and CAD, game development, logo design and illustration, and audio and video production;-- Mobile app development;-- Search engine optimization;-- Virtual assistance (administrative support or assistance);-- Branding and public relations, social media coordinator and community management;-- Web research, business intelligence and data analytics;-- Transcription and data entry jobs article and blog writing;-- Customer service and technical support;-- Human resource management and systems; and-- Architecture services and other professional services through the internet.

City Mayor Ronnel Rivera said Thursday they have partnered with online food delivery startup Foodpanda and grocery delivery service provider Ant Solutions for the rollout of its “Online Talipapa” program. Rivera said the two firms would provide online food market and delivery services that would mainly use local sources or suppliers, among them the public markets and “bagsakan” or trading posts. He and City Economic Management and Cooperative Development Office (Cemcdo) head Leonard Flores met with representatives of Foodpanda and Ant Solutions on Wednesday to arrange their partnership. Foodpanda will use Pandamart, an on-demand delivery service for consumer goods and other essential products, while Ant Solutions will tap its grocery service dubbed \"Ant Talipapa\" for the initiative. Ant Talipapa is expected to start its operations on Monday next week, with the city government shouldering the delivery fees in the first two weeks. It will accept online orders and deliveries for various products, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, and fish. Payments for the “door-to-door” service may be done via cash-on-delivery, credit card, or debit card options. Rivera said the initiative was part of the city government’s efforts to mainstream electronic or e-commerce under a “new normal” due to the Covid-19 threat. “We want to reduce travel and person-to-person contact, like going to the markets and other related establishments, as we continue to fight the spread of Covid-19,” he said in a statement. Flores said the “online talipapa” mainly levels up the city’s “Moving Talipapa” program, which was launched in March to give local farmers, cooperatives, as well as micro, small and medium enterprises another opportunity to earn continually during the pandemic. He said the initiative would provide another income option for tricycle drivers and give consumers an additional method of purchasing their needs. The city was the third locality in the country after Manila and Pasig to partner with Foodpanda, which expanded its operations in the area early this year, using tricycle drivers as “panda riders,” Flores said. He said the local government would continue to find more ways “to satisfy the different preferences of our consuming public.” “Given the current situation in the world, we are glad to see the increasing appreciation of people about e-commerce. And we are seriously buying into it. We believe this strategy will help the city effectively manage the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.

Samar Governor Reynolds Michael Tan issued on Tuesday Executive Order No. 22 extending the ECQ until the end of the month. This is a 15-day extension from the April 1 to 15 pre-emptive ECQ issued on March 30 this year. The extension is based on the recommendation of the provincial inter-agency task force to control the spread of Covid-19 in the province. “Policemen and army are hereby directed to continue implementing the existing mandatory measures and guidelines relative to the fight against Covid-19 during the period of extension, without prejudice to the grant of exemption in favor of certain sectors, as public health and food security considerations may warrant,” the order reads. Since the pandemic, Samar province has recorded three confirmed Covid-19 cases -- one from Calbayog City and two from Tarangnan, Samar. The patient from Calbayog was already discharged from the hospital after his last two swab samples tested negative for the disease. The other two patients are still confined at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center. In Catbalogan City, the provincial capital, Mayor Dexter Uy signed Executive Order 04-004 extending the enhanced community quarantine. Under the extension, people exempted from travel restrictions are police, military, health workers, government employees who are part of the skeletal force, emergency responders, Philippine Red Cross staff, hospital workers, private caregivers, and other medical professionals and their employees. Also exempted are workers in banks, money transfer services, supermarkets, groceries, pharmacies, food chains, restaurants, food delivery services, food traders, telecommunication, water and power utility workers, garbage collectors, cable television operators, and journalists. Exempted individuals must always present their identification cards in checkpoints. Those who are not medical professionals must have a certificate of employment with the stated duty hours, area of assignment and specific duties. Private caregivers are asked to secure a special pass from the City Mayor’s Office. The city government also provided schedules on what day selected residents from nearby places can enter the city. “We also sought the help of the military to secure and conduct patrolling in its borders, including coastal villages,” Uy said. Meanwhile, in Calbayog City, Mayor Ronald Aquino issued a directive as early as April 8 extending the ECQ to April 30. The original ECQ was supposed to end on April 15. The city government made this step a week after a 63-year-old male resident was found positive of Covid-19. The second patient has a recent travel history to Metro Manila where he contracted the virus before returning to his hometown. He managed to recover from the disease and was released from the hospital on Sunday (April 12). The two other patients from nearby Tarangnan had close contacts with him. The city government continues to limit the number of people from villages outside the city and nearby towns in entering the city’s commercial district by giving them a schedule. “We urge everyone to observe physical distancing especially those who are going to markets, fish ports, and groceries,” Aquino said in a statement on Tuesday. He added they will be strict in enforcing the wearing of face mask outdoor policy by penalizing those failing to comply, especially in public places. The city also enforces the no back ride policy. There is also a 24-hour curfew for children and elderly until April 30, while regular curfew is still from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., the city mayor added. The city mayor asks the support of village officials to strictly implement the provisions of the executive order to make the city safe from Covid-19.

Mayor Ronnel Rivera, through Executive Order (EO) 24 issued on Friday afternoon, ordered the clustering of the city’s 26 barangays to ensure the strict implementation of the ban on non-essential travel within the city. He directed the segregation of the barangays and communities into 12 clusters, with some comprising up to three sections, based on their geographical location. Starting Saturday midnight, the mayor said residents will no longer be allowed to leave their respective clusters except for medical reasons, bank transactions, and other emergencies. He said they will be allowed to leave their homes to buy food, medicine, and other essential supplies upon presentation of their home quarantine passes but these should be done only within their respective clusters. Rivera ordered the city police office, traffic management unit and the barangay councils to set up strategic checkpoints and control points “to prevent the free movement of people from one cluster to another.” Media workers are exempted from these restrictions but should observe the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew, he said. “This is to compel people to just stay in their homes as we continue with our efforts to prevent the disease from entering our city,” he said in a press briefing. The clustering was among the fresh directives issued by the local government under EO 24, which amended and further strengthened its existing prevention and control measures against Covid-19. Included in the order was the implementation of a total lockdown and ban on the use of home quarantine passes every Sunday. Exempted from the lockdown were Covid-19 medical front-liners; pharmacy staff; police personnel and barangay tanods manning the control points and checkpoints; city social workers and members of the quick response team, inter-agency task force and the incident management team; essential workers like those involved in food production; priests/ pastors/imams, with a maximum of five assistants, who will conduct services, masses, and other activities via live streaming; and, those with medical and emergency reasons. “No residents of GenSan shall be allowed to leave their respective homes beginning 12 a.m. of Sundays,” the EO said. The local government will also implement starting Sunday a “number-coding” scheme for all public utility and private motor vehicles, including motorcycles, tricycles, trucks, and buses. Dubbed “Unified Vehicular Reduction System” or “Odd-Even Scheme,” motor vehicles with license plates ending in odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are only allowed to travel every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and those ending in even numbers 2, 4, 6, and 0 may be used every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Exempted from the scheme are government vehicles, food delivery or cargo trucks, medical and emergency response vehicles, and those used by public utilities, for funeral services, medical practitioners and other front-line health workers. The EO reiterated the closure of all establishments except government offices, banks, groceries and supermarkets, wet markets, call centers/business process outsourcing, savings and credit cooperatives, food commissaries and manufacturing, food delivery services, retail, and sari-sari stores, water refilling stations, funeral homes, courier services, pharmacies, medical laboratories, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas outlets, construction and hardware supply, and medical, dental and veterinary clinics. Rivera said although the city is still considered free from Covid-19, the need to impose stricter measures to properly respond and address the threats posed by the spread of the disease. As of 5 p.m. Friday, the City Health Office said at least eight patients under investigation (PUIs) have already tested negative for Covid-19, two were not recommended for testing and nine were still awaiting laboratory confirmation. Six PUIs remain admitted in various private hospitals and four were undergoing home quarantine. A total of 126 persons under monitoring were also on home quarantine.

Located at the Negros Food Terminal Market on North Capitol Road, the facility is a joint project of the Department of Agriculture (DA) 6 (Western Visayas), province of Negros Occidental, and Eco-Agri Development Foundation. Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson, who led the launch with Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA) chief Japhet Masculino, said the government needs to find ways to ensure the people’s access to food while the province is under a 14-day enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) due to the threat of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). “More than ever, we need to be able to send these produce to our constituents. The people’s movement is now being limited. Only one member of the household is allowed to go out,” he added. Jose Albert Barrogo, chief of the DA-6’s Regional Agricultural Engineering Division, said during this period of the ECQ, they came up with the idea of using food service delivery providers to bring agricultural goods to people’s homes. Using the mobile application of Grab, specifically the GrabExpress Pabili delivery option, users can order farm produce being sold at the Negrense: Kadiwa store. The delivery service is also available through other apps, such as the Maid in Bacolod, Juan Ride, Tinderoo, and Tapao.ph. The list and prices of rice, vegetables, and other farm produce can also be viewed on the Negrense-Kadiwa official Facebook page. Masculino said the partnership of the provincial government and the DA with Grab and other food delivery service providers is the first-of-its-kind in the country. “We hope this can be replicated in Bacolod and other local government units. With our current situation, our people need fresh food like vegetables,” he added. During the launch, Lacson also led the symbolic turnover of the food lane vehicle pass from the DA and identification card issued by the Capitol inter-agency task force to Grab rider Ramil Talavera. Lacson thanked the province’s food delivery service partners for their cooperation. “More important that even beyond ECQ, this will be a program that will become already normal to everybody – to use mobile app for food to be delivered. Let us do everything possible to make this successful,” he added. Home delivery is available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Meanwhile, walk-in customers can also visit the Negrense: Kadiwa store from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. (PNA) "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1098458","title":"Gradual lifting of community quarantine eyed","date":" April 1, 2020, 4:50 pm","body":"MANILA – Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said on Wednesday a gradual lifting of enhanced community quarantine will be recommended to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases to ensure that the new norm of social distancing will be observed.

He added companies should examine their employees who will return to work and ensure that they are not sick.  Lopez said even businesses are cautious about the total lifting of enhanced community that will end by mid-April.  Some economic activities like manufacturing of food, medicine and medical supplies, and hygiene products such as alcohol and disinfectants, export-oriented businesses, supermarkets and groceries, takeout and food delivery services, among others, maintain their operations during the Luzon-wide quarantine that started March 17.

In a report released on Tuesday, the OBG said the restrictions on the movement of people and business operations could lead to the wider use of e-payment for utilities, banking, insurance, and food delivery services.  “In days preceding this, many firms were actively promoting online payment to enable customers to avoid a late payment penalty, and suggesting they continue to do so going forwards,” it said.  The report added that Filipinos would be inclined to use e-payment methods to maintain social distancing and avoid spreading viruses and bacteria that can be transferred through bills and coins.  “As customers become more familiar with e-payment services, the prospect of their continuing use in a post-Covid-19 setting is strong,” it said.  However, some 29 million Filipinos do not have access to the Internet, while there are also ongoing issues in terms of affordability, availability, and speed of Internet services in the country.  The OBG cited the report of Akami Technologies in 2017, indicating that the Philippines ranked last out of 15 countries surveyed in the region, and 100th out of 149 nations worldwide in terms of average connection speed.  “Mobile Internet is an important route to get users online, but growth in this area is constrained somewhat by the cost and complexity of deploying supporting infrastructure across a vast archipelago like the Philippines,” it said.

Medical centers, health-care establishments, and pharmacies are exempted from the 8 p.m. closure of establishments as directed by the order. However, the implementing guideline stated that those in establishments exempted from the operational hour limit should maintain social distancing measures, while restaurant workers and other food vendors are directed to wear hairnets, mouth guards and gloves in handling food. “Restaurants, fast-food chains, pastry shops and cafes are instructed to encourage their customers to do take out or take away purchases and/or provide food delivery services,” the implementing guideline further read, adding that “all night markets in the city shall be closed”. The Carbon landing market is allowed to operate only from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. Apart from the thermal scanners and hand sanitizers to be readily available in all private establishments, the implementing guidelines also ordered social distancing measures and cleanliness in open establishments. The new EO allows essential work-related meetings and religious activities “as long as strict social distancing measures among those attending is maintained during the entirety of the event following the safety protocols prescribed by the Department of Health (DOH).” Under the new order, fourth quarterly examinations in all schools at all levels will no longer be administered and except on learner-related matters, “teachers are not required to report to schools” but are required to finish their tasks required of them. Using the internet, teachers are encouraged in the new order to explore online alternative learning delivery platforms identified by the Department of Education. The implementing guidelines allow graduation, moving up and recognition rites but only from April 13 to 17 and mandated to maintain social distancing measures. It also encouraged the adoption of flexible work arrangements like reduced work hours or workdays, rotation of workers and availment of leaves to cushion the effect of the loss of income to employees. It also encouraged telecommuting or work-from-home schemes to minimize the mobility of individuals. Although the city government declared all seaports closed, ships are allowed to leave the port of Cebu with passengers and cargoes but upon its return, only cargoes are allowed to enter the port and drivers from this city are the only ones allowed to pick them.

Romualdez said the latest directive is needed as part of the government’s containment and mitigation efforts “in our fight for survival as a nation.” “I enjoin our people to set aside politics in the meantime and unite for once as we seek long-lasting solutions to stop the spread of the dreaded virus in our communities. Our concern at the moment is how to keep our families safe at all costs,” Romualdez said. He assured the public that Congress is in close coordination with the executive branch to identify ways to minimize the economic and social costs of the lockdown scenario. House ways and means committee chair Joey Salceda said the enhanced quarantine would deny the coronavirus room to spread and would help ensure that the country’s health system is not overwhelmed by cases. “Obey the lockdown, it will save 1,565 lives. It could be yours or your loved ones. No lockdown, the mass transmission will kill 4.13 percent of GDP (gross domestic product). A lockdown will decrease GDP by only 2.95 percent. It saves lives and saves the economy,” Salceda said. “My office has done the numbers. The lockdown will prevent up to 26,500 more infections by May 4, when Congress’s session resumes. President Duterte’s decision will be game-changing and life-saving. By the decision, the President has protected thousands of lives and Filipino families,” he added. Salceda said Congress is prepared to assist in authorizing and operationalizing mitigating measures to help combat the disease. “I myself am proposing a PHP199 billion package of measures to assist Filipino families,” Salceda said, noting that he has filed the Filipino Families First Coronavirus Response Bill. Marikina City Rep. Stella Quimbo is also supportive of the enhanced community quarantine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “Napatunayan sa karanasan ng ibang bansa na ang ‘stay at home’ policy ang pinakamabisang hakbang sa pagsugpo ng virus. Tanggapin na natin na hindi magiging perpekto ang implementation nito. Pero imbis na reklamo, tumulong tayo sa solusyon (A ‘stay-at-home’ policy implemented in other countries has been proven an effective measure to combat the virus. Let’s accept the fact that its implementation will never be perfect. But instead of complaining, let’s all contribute to the solution),” Quimbo said. Quimbo noted that there are existing problems arising from the lockdown, such as the lack of available means of transportation for employees exempted from quarantine and the cash transfers for “no work, no pay” workers. She suggested that the government fund and utilize existing Point-to-Point buses to exclusively transport exempted employees including health workers, government workers in checkpoints, private workers in groceries, drugstores, food delivery establishments, banking institutions, and water and electric companies. As for the cash transfers, Quimbo said around PHP97 billion is needed to provide one-month financial assistance to about 7 million workers who are hired on a “no work, no pay” basis in Luzon. She urged the government to allot a huge allocation to fund the necessary social and economic protection measures amid the Covid-19 crisis. \"In Luzon, we have over 333 thousand health care workers. In addition to transportation, they need protection and proper compensation. This can cost PHP4.8 billion for one month,” she said. “If the government will deploy 10 percent of its entire workforce for its skeletal force, then these are about 195,000 workers. Again, they need transportation, protection, and compensation. This can cost PHP2 billion for one month,” she added. Implementing an “enhanced” community quarantine means all households need to observe “strict” home quarantine and their movement should be limited to accessing basic necessities, according to a Palace memorandum signed on Monday. An “enhanced” community quarantine also imposes regulation on the provision for food and essential health services, and orders heightened presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures. Mass public transportation is also suspended in Luzon. Soldiers, policemen, authorized government workers, health workers, and other individuals with other essential services are exempted from the imposition of an “enhanced” community quarantine.

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the public might not have been listening carefully which resulted in confusion over whether the proposed curfew will be implemented or not. He said the public misunderstood the announcement made by Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) General Manager Jose Arturo Garcia, Jr. that Metro Manila mayors have agreed to recommend, but not yet impose a curfew starting March 15 to April 12. “Hindi kayo nakikinig e. Yung MMDA sinabi nila rekomendasyon yung kanila. Wala naman silang sinabi na meron na e (You’re not listening properly. The MMDA said theirs in a recommendation. They did not say that there is already a curfew),” he said in an interview over dzIQ. He explained that Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar was not contradicting Garcia when he dismissed reports that the curfew was already being implemented as “fake news\" because it has yet to get the President's approval. “Ang sabi ni Secretary Martin, eh wala pa. Unang-una, wala pa ngang ordinansa. Pangalawa, kung walang ordinansa, walang approval ng Presidente (Secretary Martin said there’s no curfew yet. First, there’s no ordinance. Second, if there’s no ordinance, there’s no approval of the President). Where is the contradiction?,” he said. Meanwhile, he said it will not matter whether the proposed curfew would be an executive order or memorandum. “Whatever form doesn’t matter, what is important is kung aaprubahan niya yung rekomendasyon, pangalawa, kung magkakaroon ng ordinansa ang bawat siyudad na gusto (if the recommendation will be approved and second, if there will be ordinances in each cities that want to implement a curfew),” he said. To date, President Rodrigo Duterte has yet to act on the proposed region-wide curfew. On Saturday, MMDA bared that mayors in Metro Manila wanted to impose a daily curfew for one month as part of the government’s efforts to fight Covid-19. The plan is to place Metro Manila under curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. until the community quarantine ends to restrict movements in public spaces. The curfew, however, exempts doctors, health personnel, and food delivery personnel. Duterte earlier ordered a “general” community quarantine from March 15 to April 14 to limit people’s movement to “accessing basic necessities and work” and place uniformed personnel and quarantine personnel at border points. As of Saturday, there are 111 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country with eight fatalities.

Guillermo Eleazar, PNP deputy chief for operations, in a press briefing on the sidelines of the meeting of the Metro Manila Council (MMC) on community quarantine measures. Eleazar dismissed criticisms that the planned community quarantine and enforcement of curfew hours are against basic human rights. \"That’s why we request you to not try to circumvent this. We need your full cooperation. If you’re not working, if you’re not health or emergency workers, stay at home so that we can put an end to this,\" Eleazar said. The whole region will be on a month-long community quarantine as the government steps up its efforts to curb the spread of the dreaded disease.

He said that only people allowed to enter and exit the region are employees working in Metro Manila, health and emergency workers, among others. Non-essential entry and exits such as visiting their loved ones and other matters would not be allowed, Eleazar said. Eleazar said that checkpoints would also be implemented within Metro Manila. \"We will advise the local police to coordinate with the LGUs,\" he said. Consequently, Eleazar urged people to limit their movement and stay at home.

He asked for the public’s full cooperation as the national government-imposed community quarantined aimed at containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) takes effect Sunday. “We are in a different situation. We need coordination, cooperation,” Año said. In the meeting, all 17 mayors from the cities and municipalities comprising the National Capital Region (NCR), backed by the DILG and PNP, agreed to implement a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5.a.m from Sunday (March 15) until April 14. Anyone found loitering during curfew hours would be questioned and asked to go home. Those who would show resistance risk facing arrest. However, he said there will be exemptions to “essential movements” such as those whose residences are outside the region but work in Metro Manila, medical workers and first responders, food delivery personnel, and grocery/supermarket employees. “You’re exempted from the curfew if you’re coming from work if you need to buy medicines or food. Other than that, stay home,” he stressed.

The PCC wants both Uber and Grab to continue to operate as separate businesses so as not to prejudice the review on the transaction. “We will impose that the Uber and Grab apps will continue to operate beyond April 8 and that they will be operated independently,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo said during Thursday’s public hearing on the takeover. The PCC has formulated various interim measures that would ensure the credibility and integrity of its review on the merger of Uber and Grab for possible anti-competition concerns. Among these are maintaining the independence of their business operations; refraining from sharing confidential information, such as pricing and operations; and refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses. Both Uber and Grab were also asked to refrain from performing any practice that could lead to reduced viability of their businesses and prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies. Grab has earlier said that Uber’s Southeast Asia operations will continue only until April 8 after acquiring its ride-sharing and food delivery businesses last March 26. Uber expressed that it will no longer operate its businesses in the Southeast Asian region. “From a business standpoint, Uber has exited eight markets in Southeast Asia as of last Monday. Now I look after 10 markets instead of 18. Our funding is gone. Our people are gone. We don’t intend to come back to these markets,” Uber Asia Pacific chief business officer Brooks Entwistle said. For its part, Grab said it will continue to push through with the transaction as it believes that PCC’s proposed measures would hardly make an impact on its operations. “We will still continue to operate as we have. The interim measures will hardly affect the acquisition and migration of Uber drivers to Grab,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters. “We want to assure the public that we will operate responsibly as a ride-hailing company. We will work with regulators and adhere (to) what they will require,” he added. The PCC assured that it will continue its mandate to review the merger despite Uber’s move to no longer operate in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. “As the review progresses we might come forward with remedies. The PCC has the power to stop any transaction that might restrict competition,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said. “There are many ways to skin the cat. You do not know if what you heard is the only way and that is the focus of this hearing, to find what the other options are,” Balisacan added.

The NPC wants to ensure that Grab will uphold the data privacy rights of its drivers and riders as it emerges as the leading transportation network company (TNC) in the Philippines. “We have called on Grab to a meeting next week to enlighten the Commission on this ‘sale’ particularly its provision on the processing of Filipino drivers’ and users’ data and the measures they take in protecting these data,” NPC Commissioner Raymund Liboro said in a statement late Tuesday. “As the biggest TNV (transport network vehicle) provider in the Philippines after the exit of Uber, we want Grab to demonstrate that they could 'walk the talk' when it comes to protecting personal data and upholding the data privacy rights of its drivers and users,” he added. Grab, through its legal counsel, lawyer John Paul Nabua, assured the NPC that it will cooperate and comply with the data privacy and protection laws in the country. “Grab also declared to the Commission that there will be no sharing of any user data between Uber and Grab. Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,” Liboro said. Grab announced Monday that it has taken over Uber’s ride-sharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology platform. Uber will take 27.5 percent stake in Grab as part of the acquisition. Meanwhile, the NPC assured that the merger with Grab will not affect its investigation of the past data breaches of Uber involving Filipino users. “This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,” Liboro said. Uber has confirmed last November that the personal information of Filipinos had been exposed in a massive data breach involving 57 million users worldwide dating back to October 2016. The NPC warned Uber that it may face serious criminal and civil liabilities under the Data Privacy Act of 2012.

LTFRB will continue to conduct its consolidated hearing on the fare hike petitions filed by Uber and Grab on April 3, 2018. “Rest assured that LTFRB will continue to regulate the fare structure and monitor for the benefit of the riding public,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters late Monday. “As regards to trust issues, we have the PCC (Philippine Competition Commission) whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting the manifestation to be filed by Uber in due time to resolve issues pending before the LTFRB,” she added. LTFRB has earlier said that it is pushing for a unified fare structure for TNCs to further improve their services to passengers. The ridesharing companies currently use a dynamic pricing scheme on their fares, based on various factors, such as traffic, rider and driver profile, time of day and number of active drivers at a particular time. They also offer incentives and promos as a marketing and business strategy to attract more riders to avail of their services. Meanwhile, Grab announced Tuesday that it will absorb Uber’s employees that might be displaced due to the acquisition. “We understand it’s been an emotional and trying day for Uber’s employees in Southeast Asia. On the part of Grab, we are committed to try to find roles for over 500 Uber employees. In addition, we will find roles for their contract staff,” the company said in a statement. Grab will hold discussions with Uber employees on how they will be absorbed into its system. Uber’s drivers in the Philippines and Southeast Asia should migrate to Grab’s platform in two weeks as its operations in Southeast Asia will only continue until April 8. Grab announced Monday that it has taken over Uber’s ridesharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology platform. Uber will take 27.5 percent stake in Grab as part of the acquisition. Last February, the LTFRB has issued a memorandum setting the common supply base for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units at 66,750. The LTFRB welcomes companies that are willing to be accredited as new TNCs. “All franchises issued by government are generic. With the system in place now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they’re accredited by the LTFRB and that they submit the necessary documents for their respective accreditation,” Lizada said. There are 59,020 accredited TNVS units for both Uber and Grab whose Certificates of Public Convenience were not processed by the LTFRB due to the moratorium on applications last July 2017.
