DiDi’s entry in the Philippines—potentially the latest in its global expansion—will bring down prices and offer more options for commuters, said Ilocos Sur politician Luis “Chavit” Singson, who confirmed negotiations with DiDi.  “We want to break the monopoly of Grab,” Singson said of the Singapore-based ride-sharing giant in an interview last week. Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement. DiDi is one of the world’s largest mobile transport platforms. It offers a host of services from on-demand cars to e-bike sharing and food deliveries to more than 550 million users across Asia, Latin America and Australia, its website showed. “We think this will help Filipinos,” said Singson, a former governor and now mayor of Narvacan. He also chairs LCS Holdings and owns a range of businesses such as bus operator Partas, car dealerships and more recently, the construction of cell towers. Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017.

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691183/dotc-guidelines-on-ride-sharing-app-out","title":"DOTC guidelines on ride-sharing app out","date":"10:40 PM May 13, 2015","snippet":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services.","body":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services. The development finally gives legitimacy to global platforms like Uber, GrabCar, Easy Taxi and Tripda, which are present in the Philippines but would likely hurt the traditional taxi cab operators, with one organization saying they were mulling a lawsuit against the DOTC.  All the apps had been operating in the Philippines without the guidelines as the government implemented a general policy of holding off on arrests until the rules were finalized. The department order outlines the new classifications, including that for so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) that the smartphone rider-sharing applications will fall under. He said this will allow Transportation Network Companies (TNC) “to exist within our regulatory framework.”  With the department order’s release, regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board can begin working to finalize its memorandum circular, which would outline specific regulations and requirements for the platforms and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them [traditional taxi cabs] to modernize and compete,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a press conference this week. “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS [cars].”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” Abaya added. Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, disagreed with the government’s view and said this would ultimately hurt their business. Among the options, he said, would be to sue the DOTC and LTFRB as the entities did not take into consideration the impact of letting TNCs operate. “We are now relegated to a second choice,” Suntay said, noting unfair advantages of these transit application platforms since they have not been operating their own cars. He said services like Uber, which has been providing a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, have been benefiting from fares not regulated by government. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models.  The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans or other similar vehicles will be allowed. “A maximum age limit of seven years will be enforced,” the DOTC said. Operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details need to be ironed out with LTFRB. Chief among these is on the regulation of fares, which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102598/experiencing-traffic-book-a-ride-sharing-flight-to-your-destination","title":"Experiencing traffic?

Try booking a ride, or more appropriately a flight, in this newly launched ride-sharing platform to reach your destination in no time.  The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

Recto’s Senate Bill No. 2173 seeks to classify public utility motorcycles as those “with engines of at least 125 cc and can travel faster than 50 kilometers per hour.” The proposed law seeks to add a new section in the Republic Act No. 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  Earlier, the Supreme Court, Department of Transportation (DOTr), and motorcycle clubs have agreed on the need to amend RA 4136 before motorcycle ride-sharing services like Angkas could be legally accredited. The High Court earlier temporarily stopped the operations of motorcycle ride-sharing app Angkas and ordered DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to go after its drivers.  READ: SC temporarily stops Angkas operations Section 7(c) of R.A. 4136 states that “private motorcycles, scooters, or motor wheel attachments […] shall not be used for hire under any circumstances and shall not be used to solicit, accept, or be used to transport passengers or freight for pay.”  READ: Angkas riders call on lawmakers to amend R.A. 4136 “It is in response to the call for legislative action that I have filed the bill. Without this amendment, there is no way that authority to operate motorcycles as PUVs or TNVS (transport network vehicle service) such as Angkas can be granted administratively,” Recto explained in a statement on Friday. The senator noted that almost six in 10 motor vehicles in the country today are motorcycles and tricycles. From 3.48 million registered units in 2010, their number, based on the first half 2018 data, was projected to hit 7.5 million by end of December 2018, he added. The legislator argued that “public frustration over road traffic, lack of public transportation, affordable motorcycles, and rising household income” has led to the “motorcycle boom.” “When there is a shortage of PUVs and a surplus of motorbikes, the entrepreneurial spirit kicks in. This gives room for the Pinoy diskarte of making money on the side. Kung may demand, papasok ang supply. And this is the reality on the ground government can no longer ignore,” he said.  Under the bill, LTFRB and DOTr would prescribe rules on the operation of public utility motorcycles to regulate its operations and “protect both the driver and the riding public.” Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, had also sought an inquiry in aid of legislation into the possibility of allowing two-wheeled motorcycles for public transport. “It is undeniable that our countrymen need a cheaper, affordable and readily accessible alternative mode of transportation and it is the State’s duty to ensure effective regulation so as not to compromise the riding public’s safety,” she said in filing Senate Resolution No. 993. /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249121/ride-sharing-app-arcade-city-launched-ph","title":"Ride-sharing app Arcade City to be launched in PH","date":"03:50 PM April 13, 2018","snippet":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said.","body":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said. Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1071617/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-in-ride-sharing-protest-suicide","title":"Second South Korea taxi driver in ride-sharing protest suicide","date":"04:13 PM January 10, 2019","snippet":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.","body":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month. The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716594/colorum-taxi-under-ride-sharing-app-tripid-fined-p200k-impounded-for-3-months","title":"‘Colorum’ taxi under ride-sharing app Tripid fined P200K, impounded for 3 months","date":"08:57 PM August 26, 2015","snippet":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.","body":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691183/dotc-guidelines-on-ride-sharing-app-out","title":"DOTC guidelines on ride-sharing app out","date":"10:40 PM May 13, 2015","snippet":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services.","body":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services.

Try booking a ride, or more appropriately a flight, in this newly launched ride-sharing platform to reach your destination in no time.  The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

Recto’s Senate Bill No. 2173 seeks to classify public utility motorcycles as those “with engines of at least 125 cc and can travel faster than 50 kilometers per hour.” The proposed law seeks to add a new section in the Republic Act No. 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  Earlier, the Supreme Court, Department of Transportation (DOTr), and motorcycle clubs have agreed on the need to amend RA 4136 before motorcycle ride-sharing services like Angkas could be legally accredited. The High Court earlier temporarily stopped the operations of motorcycle ride-sharing app Angkas and ordered DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to go after its drivers.  READ: SC temporarily stops Angkas operations Section 7(c) of R.A. 4136 states that “private motorcycles, scooters, or motor wheel attachments […] shall not be used for hire under any circumstances and shall not be used to solicit, accept, or be used to transport passengers or freight for pay.”  READ: Angkas riders call on lawmakers to amend R.A. 4136 “It is in response to the call for legislative action that I have filed the bill. Without this amendment, there is no way that authority to operate motorcycles as PUVs or TNVS (transport network vehicle service) such as Angkas can be granted administratively,” Recto explained in a statement on Friday. The senator noted that almost six in 10 motor vehicles in the country today are motorcycles and tricycles. From 3.48 million registered units in 2010, their number, based on the first half 2018 data, was projected to hit 7.5 million by end of December 2018, he added. The legislator argued that “public frustration over road traffic, lack of public transportation, affordable motorcycles, and rising household income” has led to the “motorcycle boom.” “When there is a shortage of PUVs and a surplus of motorbikes, the entrepreneurial spirit kicks in. This gives room for the Pinoy diskarte of making money on the side. Kung may demand, papasok ang supply. And this is the reality on the ground government can no longer ignore,” he said.  Under the bill, LTFRB and DOTr would prescribe rules on the operation of public utility motorcycles to regulate its operations and “protect both the driver and the riding public.” Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, had also sought an inquiry in aid of legislation into the possibility of allowing two-wheeled motorcycles for public transport. “It is undeniable that our countrymen need a cheaper, affordable and readily accessible alternative mode of transportation and it is the State’s duty to ensure effective regulation so as not to compromise the riding public’s safety,” she said in filing Senate Resolution No. 993. /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249121/ride-sharing-app-arcade-city-launched-ph","title":"Ride-sharing app Arcade City to be launched in PH","date":"03:50 PM April 13, 2018","snippet":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said.","body":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said. Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1071617/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-in-ride-sharing-protest-suicide","title":"Second South Korea taxi driver in ride-sharing protest suicide","date":"04:13 PM January 10, 2019","snippet":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.","body":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month. The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716594/colorum-taxi-under-ride-sharing-app-tripid-fined-p200k-impounded-for-3-months","title":"‘Colorum’ taxi under ride-sharing app Tripid fined P200K, impounded for 3 months","date":"08:57 PM August 26, 2015","snippet":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.","body":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.

DiDi’s entry in the Philippines—potentially the latest in its global expansion—will bring down prices and offer more options for commuters, said Ilocos Sur politician Luis “Chavit” Singson, who confirmed negotiations with DiDi.  “We want to break the monopoly of Grab,” Singson said of the Singapore-based ride-sharing giant in an interview last week. Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement. DiDi is one of the world’s largest mobile transport platforms. It offers a host of services from on-demand cars to e-bike sharing and food deliveries to more than 550 million users across Asia, Latin America and Australia, its website showed. “We think this will help Filipinos,” said Singson, a former governor and now mayor of Narvacan. He also chairs LCS Holdings and owns a range of businesses such as bus operator Partas, car dealerships and more recently, the construction of cell towers. Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, owns stakes in Uber, Grab, DiDi and Ola, a ride-sharing service in India."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1418943/woman-raises-125000-for-safer-ride-sharing-service-amid-spike-of-anti-asian-american-attacks-in-us","title":"Woman raises $125,000 for safer ride-sharing service amid spike in anti-Asian American attacks in US","date":"04:36 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.","body":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.

It was a 30-minute commute and I realized every minute of that commute I was terrified,” she was quoted as saying. “I was scared that any moment in time someone might say a racial slur or attack me. Worst of all I thought that if something were to happen to me, nobody would stand up,” Park added.  Park, who admitted that while she could afford to take the taxi, many other Asian Americans cannot. So, she donated $2,000 of her own money to set up Cafe Maddy Cab on Instagram with her friends. Through the said initiative, Park and many other donors help out Asian American women, elderly persons, members of the LGBTQ+ community and low-income essential workers hail a cab for free.  To her surprise, her initiative inspired many others across the US to help the Asian American community during these dire times. “People who are donating are people from all across the nation, across all races, ethnicities and they just sent me messages saying, listen, we really want you guys to be safe too and we’re donating so that more people can take rides in the city,” Park was quoted as saying. “It really opened my eyes to how many people are actually supporting the Asian community in New York City,” Park added.   Park has raised $125,000 as of yesterday, April 13, nine days after she launched Cafe Maddy Cab. A total of 1,122 have so far been paid for by Cafe Maddy Cab.

Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102598/experiencing-traffic-book-a-ride-sharing-flight-to-your-destination","title":"Experiencing traffic?

Try booking a ride, or more appropriately a flight, in this newly launched ride-sharing platform to reach your destination in no time.  The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said. Passengers who wished to experience a chopper ride can book through the company’s website (https://ascent.flights/).

Recto’s Senate Bill No. 2173 seeks to classify public utility motorcycles as those “with engines of at least 125 cc and can travel faster than 50 kilometers per hour.” The proposed law seeks to add a new section in the Republic Act No. 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  Earlier, the Supreme Court, Department of Transportation (DOTr), and motorcycle clubs have agreed on the need to amend RA 4136 before motorcycle ride-sharing services like Angkas could be legally accredited. The High Court earlier temporarily stopped the operations of motorcycle ride-sharing app Angkas and ordered DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to go after its drivers.  READ: SC temporarily stops Angkas operations Section 7(c) of R.A. 4136 states that “private motorcycles, scooters, or motor wheel attachments […] shall not be used for hire under any circumstances and shall not be used to solicit, accept, or be used to transport passengers or freight for pay.”  READ: Angkas riders call on lawmakers to amend R.A. 4136 “It is in response to the call for legislative action that I have filed the bill. Without this amendment, there is no way that authority to operate motorcycles as PUVs or TNVS (transport network vehicle service) such as Angkas can be granted administratively,” Recto explained in a statement on Friday. The senator noted that almost six in 10 motor vehicles in the country today are motorcycles and tricycles. From 3.48 million registered units in 2010, their number, based on the first half 2018 data, was projected to hit 7.5 million by end of December 2018, he added. The legislator argued that “public frustration over road traffic, lack of public transportation, affordable motorcycles, and rising household income” has led to the “motorcycle boom.” “When there is a shortage of PUVs and a surplus of motorbikes, the entrepreneurial spirit kicks in. This gives room for the Pinoy diskarte of making money on the side. Kung may demand, papasok ang supply. And this is the reality on the ground government can no longer ignore,” he said.  Under the bill, LTFRB and DOTr would prescribe rules on the operation of public utility motorcycles to regulate its operations and “protect both the driver and the riding public.” Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, had also sought an inquiry in aid of legislation into the possibility of allowing two-wheeled motorcycles for public transport. “It is undeniable that our countrymen need a cheaper, affordable and readily accessible alternative mode of transportation and it is the State’s duty to ensure effective regulation so as not to compromise the riding public’s safety,” she said in filing Senate Resolution No. 993. /kga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249121/ride-sharing-app-arcade-city-launched-ph","title":"Ride-sharing app Arcade City to be launched in PH","date":"03:50 PM April 13, 2018","snippet":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said.","body":"Ride-sharing startup Arcade City would be launched in the Philippines on Monday in spite of a stop order from the government, a move aimed at filling the void of Uber’s exit, a top official said. Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1071617/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-in-ride-sharing-protest-suicide","title":"Second South Korea taxi driver in ride-sharing protest suicide","date":"04:13 PM January 10, 2019","snippet":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.","body":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month. The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716594/colorum-taxi-under-ride-sharing-app-tripid-fined-p200k-impounded-for-3-months","title":"‘Colorum’ taxi under ride-sharing app Tripid fined P200K, impounded for 3 months","date":"08:57 PM August 26, 2015","snippet":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.","body":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.

Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the  Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Ride-sharing services — typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis — are gaining popularity in Metro Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps — arguing they represent unfair competition.  But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse.  GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise license from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said.  “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCarPhilippines  said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the  Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar  Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorization. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The  Philippines  is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies.

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles and his brother Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Rep. Jericho Nograles have filed House Bill 6009  to end the disagreement between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and the LTFRB.  The dispute has led to a crackdown on Uber and Grab vehicles that do not have franchises to operate. READ: LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise  The House Bill 6009, or the Transport Network Service Act, seeks to institutionalize TNC as an alternative mode of public transport, and to regulate the operations of these services “to ensure that the paramount interest of the public is protected and conserved, while encouraging free enterprise and economic development.” According to House Bill 6009, the TNCs would only be allowed to operate if they are able to comply with all the requirements and secure a permit from the LTFRB.  The bill defines these companies and their drivers as “common carriers” for purposes of determining the liability and degree of diligence so that the presumption of negligence in case of breach of contract of carriage may apply to both. READ: Uber, Grab failed to inform drivers of LTFRB requirements The bill would require these ride-sharing and -hailing companies to secure a permit from the LTFRB and to oblige the TNCs to ensure that their drivers would comply with all the requirements and obligations set by law. The bill would require an Uber and Grab operator the following: The TNCs are also expected to strictly adopt a zero tolerance policy for drug or alcohol use among its drivers, and must ensure that the vehicles are safe and comfortable.  READ: LTFRB: Uber, Grab to blame for ‘mess’ TNC vehicles are also prohibited from exceeding the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity in its ride-sharing activities, the bill said. The Uber and Grab vehicles should also be not more than 10 years old, and must be road-worthy and compliant with vehicle emission standards, the bill added. In a statement, Davao City Rep. Nograles said the tiff between the TNCs and LTFRB is a “classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal,” especially because Uber and Grab remained a favored convenient form of public transportation. “Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” Nograles said. READ: ‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB PBA Rep. Nograles in the same statement said there is still a need to regulate Uber and Grab because these are relatively new modes of public transportation. He lamented that the operation of Grab and Uber would not have been an issue if the country had an efficient mass transport system in the Metro Rail and Light Rail Transits System. “The concept of Uber and Grab is new to us so therefore new regulations must be set to ensure that they are properly managed. Unfortunately, we don’t even need to go through this kind of trouble if only we have an efficient public transport system and an MRT that doesn’t break down too often,” he said The PBA Partylist earlier challenged LTFRB to first tackle “colorum” public vehicles instead of cracking down on ride-hailing companies like Grab and Uber.

FEF – an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms – said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) were doing the riding public a beneficial service that the regular public utility vehicles have been unable to provide. The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings as well as safety and peace of mind due to the thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and to the feedback and reviews of the riding public, FEF said in a press statement on Wednesday.  Thus, FEF said it’s “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services. “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anti-competitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis,” FEF said.  The group said these ride-sharing services had shown the way on how public transportation should be managed:  through the use of technology and the market. “The market gives the riding public the power of choice.  Technology gives the riding public information and matches demand,” FEF said. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. The group pointed out that surge prices during peak hours encourage drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. In the case of consumers, such surge in pricing are seen to encourage riders to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods.  “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel, and oversupply,” FEF said. The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” FEF chaired is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo. Its vice chair is Romy Bernardo while the president is Calixto Chikiamco. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister/Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.

Members of TopSpeed and Busypaps, two organizations comprising at least 250 Grab and Uber drivers, made the appeal as the LTFRB’s suspension order to temporarily stop receiving new TNVS applications was about to reach one year on July 21.  The new drivers who were prohibited to ply Metro Manila because of absence of a provisional authority (PA) from the LTFRB asked the regulatory body to lift the suspension order for them to be given permit and start earn a living. This development came after the LTFRB issued an order on July 21, 2016, suspending the acceptance of new applications for PA thus, prohibiting a number of drivers not to go out and pick up passengers for about a year now.  “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority (We are appealing to the good hearts of our LTFRB officials to heed our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues without provisional authority),” Bobby Coronel, founder of TopSpeed, said. According to Coronel, TNVS drivers have always wanted to fully comply with regulations but their applications were either not processed judiciously by the previous admin or did not make it to the cut off as a result of the suspension. Moreover, they cannot simply give up their livelihood, and LTFRB must understand their situation.  “Marami po sa amin, may binabayaran pa po na monthly amortization ng mga sasakyan (Many of us are still paying for the monthly amortization of cars),” TopSpeed lady driver Deseree Garcia said, while asking LTFRB to understand their situation. Meanwhile, other TNVS leaders also appealed to the LTFRB to act on the recently expired accreditation of transport network company, Grab. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3. In his Facebook post Monday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said it’s “business as usual” for the company and its partners. Cu added, they have submitted the requirements for the renewal of accreditation on time. But TNVS drivers said, they are still concerned with the current status of non-renewal of accreditation.

Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said in a statement that Tripda links up drivers who have empty car seats with commuters taking a similar route. The company said this would benefit both parties since they would split the fuel tab and bring down the transportation cost. The app only allows passengers to pay the drivers in cash.  Within five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and expand to other regions later on. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel, making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights.  In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets.

Last month, the arrest of an Uber driver for operating without the necessary franchise drew flak from netizens, prompting the Department of Transportation and Communications to consider a more accommodating approach.  LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez could not be immediately reached for comment on Tripda Thursday.

In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States.  Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year.

The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China’s Geely, to produce “tens of thousands” of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some “easy” trips may be made autonomously."},{"url":"https://preen.inquirer.net/51251/government-fined-ride-sharing-services-now","title":"The Government Fined Ride-Sharing Services, Now What?","date":"Posted on July 14, 2017July 14, 2017","snippet":"","body":" I get touchy on the subject of ride-sharing services. Every time the government imposes a threat to halt or affect its operations, I get a little mad. My sentiment is shared among my officemates, most of which rely on booking a car when they are in a late-night situation, in between work meetings and shoots, among other incidentals in the professional life. Sure, it’s a privilege to afford this in a country where you can get a 10-kilometer ride for around P20.  But I hate how we seem to forget that transportation is a necessity. Furthermore, it’s a necessity that should be provided or overseen by the government. It’s why we have the Land Transportation Office, the Department of Public Works and Highways, and the Department of Transportation, among many branches in the government that oversee how we get from one point to another.  The necessity isn’t met well obviously. Take one look at how the Buendia platform of the PNR is too short for the train that people have to jump into a crowded train like ’80s action stars. Think of how the line of the MRT North Avenue snakes almost all the way to the next station. It’s not a joke at times when people say a flight out to Hong Kong is faster than going around Metro Manila. We didn’t place fifth in the rankings of worst traffic in the world for nothing. The solution that the government is seeking, on the guise of doing its job of regulating transportation companies, is hitting the outlier. They’ve blamed these companies for the traffic and have always tried to find ways to undermine how this private sector fulfilled a public need. Traffic is never a problem caused by just one factor, mind you, a concept we need to accept if we want solutions fast. If our trains worked well and if it didn’t take three hours to get to my job via the usual routes, wasting time and energy, I’d happily give up booking a ride via my phone.  The existing means of transportation are improved too slowly to see progress. All I have seen is a better ticketing system at the LRT and MRT. Convenient, but not exactly the urgent change we seek. Before Uber and Grab, I remember hearing how criminals would terrorize cab passengers, if not the ones driving the vehicles themselves. The only time I heard less about those incidences is due to the ride-sharing companies. What did the government actually do? And was it strong enough to back up the local taxi industry? I hope the P5 million fine they imposed on Grab and Uber goes into more trains or making our roads better. Every time they propose to suspend these services, I think of the time I was victimized by a taxi scam in which the police didn’t even seem to take my report seriously because the criminals only took my money and not my life. That’s why it feels unnerving if I need to go back to the old way. It feels upsetting how EDSA is lined with people hoping for a bus ride home. For all of us, I can’t help but feel that we’re being robbed and blamed for it simply because we try to make it work even when the government fails us.

I tried booking a Grab going home but after five tries, I just decided to ride a bus instead of waiting out the traffic. Despite the fact that my laptop was heavy to lug around in a crowded vehicle, it actually felt great to commute from a far distance again—and pay a fare that’s less than P100. Back when ride-sharing apps didn’t exist yet, I was very patient with commuting. I don’t just mean within Makati, which is where I live. I would brave the heat, rain, traffic jams, and crowds just to get to various locations in Pasig, Quezon City, and Manila. This lasted until I started in my first job, and Grab was already operational then but I only used the app during emergency “I’m late!” cases. Many would ask me if it’s a hassle to commute from Makati to wherever. My answer would always be along the lines of “I don’t mind as long as it gets me to my destination safely.” Plus, let’s be real here, it’s cheaper than hailing a cab and booking a Grab or Uber. (RIP, Uber Philippines.) I also developed a decent sense of direction, as well street smarts, because I had to be aware of my surroundings. So, what changed my mind about commuting via public transportation in the past couple of years? A lot of things, and I’m not using time constraints or the stuff I carry as excuses. If you’ve seen the news, then you know that the MRT has been literally stopping in its tracks multiple times. So often that news outlets reported how many days the MRT had smooth operations until the next breakdown happens. Because of that, I avoided the train for fear that I might walk along the tracks, especially the elevated ones. The MRT was the fastest transport system I knew going to the north since it avoided EDSA traffic. If I wanted to ride a bus going the same route, I needed to leave early. The jeepney routes I know going to, let’s say, Quezon City may work despite it taking a bit longer. But these days, traffic jams happen even when it’s not rush hour. I also want to talk about safety precautions. I’ve elbowed a pervert in the face and caught petty thieves trying to steal from passengers in the jeep. I’ve also called out snatchers who tried to steal my phone. (Thank God for my fast stimuli.) Not to mention that I experienced jumping from the front seat of a moving jeep to escape an armed man. All of those happened years ago but when you’re given the option to book a car for yourself, you’ll take it, too. Even though it can get expensive. I still commute when I’m saving money or when I know I have enough time to get from point A to point B. But there really are days when I wished I wasn’t so dependent on ride-sharing services because when I can’t book a ride (my record is booking for three hours), I feel frustrated that I have to stay out until rush hour’s done. This needs to change. I realized that a huge chunk of my savings often goes to my personal Grab expenses. And if I wanted to go home ASAP, I might as well take the (not-so) scenic route. After all, it’s been a while since I dedicated my time to ride a bus or a train going to far distances. People might say “You won’t look fresh anymore if you commute.” But hey, that’s what makeup kits are for. It’ll get tiring too and that’s just part of the experience. I sincerely hope, though, that the government improves the public transport system in the country. Just imagine how life would be if the streets were easier to navigate, safer, less congested, and people weren’t as dependent on ride-sharing apps with insufficient number of cars. I know this isn’t going to happen overnight. So whatever mode of transportation you’re riding right now, I hope you’re having safe travels. (And that you won’t have to walk along the MRT railroad tracks.)  Art by Marian Hukom For the latest in culture, fashion, beauty, and celebrities, subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

The move came after rival Grab also sought to increase fare earlier this month.  Late last year, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed a new fare scheme for taxis, effectively increasing rates. Uber said on Thursday that it filed a petition in the LTFRB to increase fare per kilometer of uberX rides by 58 to 110 percent, depending on the time of the day.  Drivers’ costs In its petition, Uber sought to increase fare to P9 to P12 from the current P5.70 per kilometer. UberX base fare and time charge of P40 and P2 would not change, Uber said.  It said the petition for fare increase would help drivers recover part of their expenses. In a statement, Uber said aside from fuel price increases, drivers also have to bear the additional costs brought by new franchising guidelines and a requirement to improve safety and quality of service. The newly enacted Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act subjected gasoline to a higher excise tax of P7 per liter. Grab earlier this month sought LTFRB approval to increase fare per kilometer to P11 to P15. This was higher than the previous rates P10 to P14. It also sought an increase in per minute running charge from P2 to P2.10. Taxi fare hike  In October last year, the LTFRB approved a fare increase for the taxi industry. The new structure involved a flag down rate of P40 for taxis for the first 500 meters in Metro Manila and a per kilometer rate of P13.50. Taxis also charge P2 per minute of running time. The LTFRB, under the Duterte administration, launched a crackdown on the ride-sharing sector since it came to power in July 2016. More recently, it set a cap on the number of Uber and Grab cars to 45,000 vehicles from an estimated pool of 100,000 vehicles today."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/118208/angkas-and-the-business-of-sharing","title":"Angkas and the business of sharing","date":"05:10 AM December 16, 2018","snippet":"If the objection to Angkas, the motorcycle ride-sharing transport network whose operation has recently been ordered suspended, is that the service it offers is not safe and secure, then we may as well ban riding tandem itself, and revoke the licenses that had been given to other ride-sharing networks.","body":"If the objection to Angkas, the motorcycle ride-sharing transport network whose operation has recently been ordered suspended, is that the service it offers is not safe and secure, then we may as well ban riding tandem itself, and revoke the licenses that had been given to other ride-sharing networks. Let’s unpack these objections carefully. First, do two-wheel motor vehicles pose more danger to their riders and passengers than four-wheel vehicles? The answer may seem obvious: Two wheels don’t have the same stability as four wheels, and, therefore, are more dangerous. But, as a motorcycle rider myself, I have to disagree. I think a lot depends on driver experience, and on the inculcation in the general public of a road-sharing ethic.  Angkas riders who are trained to carry passengers on a regular basis are surely no less experienced than the average biker in negotiating Metro Manila’s crowded streets. Indeed, I imagine they would be safer drivers than the typical solo biker who might occasionally take a friend or family member as passenger. On the other hand, the objection regarding security (e.g., the danger of being held up or abducted) would equally apply to ride-sharing networks that use cars instead of motorbikes. In fact, such danger also lurks more or less equally in taxis, jeepneys, or buses. Come to think of it, it’s probably easier to jump off a motorcycle than from a taxi or a jeepney if one’s security is threatened.  Lastly, the law prohibiting the use of two-wheel vehicles as public utility vehicles may be there, but we have yet to hear of habal-habal drivers being arrested or prevented from plying their routes in remote upland areas where these modified motorbikes (that can take a dozen passengers) are the only means of public transport available. Here we go citing laws that were crafted long before the concept of a “sharing economy” entered the world of business. If we could reinterpret those laws to accommodate entities like Uber and Grab, which, strictly speaking, are not public transport companies that own and operate fleets of vehicles, why can’t the same adaptation be made to allow the local ride-sharing network Angkas to operate legally? I believe that what’s important, in the final analysis, is that someone can be held accountable when accidents happen. If they have the same driver and passenger insurance provisions as those found in the other transport networks, there should be no further reason to stop Angkas riders from offering their services to the commuting public.  That said, I believe it’s important to revisit the original idea that inspired the formation of the successful pioneering entities in the sharing economy — like Airbnb and Uber. This may help guide our legislators in designing new laws that would prevent the idea of sharing from being totally engulfed by the commercial twin with which it made its appearance in the market economy. The idea was simple enough. Some people have things that are in excess of what they personally need — living space, space in their vehicles, time on their hands, books and similar resources they have accumulated, etc. They may not be prepared to donate these to the government or any public entity, but, given the opportunity to do so, they might gladly share these with others, expecting almost nothing in return. Thus, we have carpooling, where neighbors take turns bringing and picking up their children to and from school, instead of each parent waking up every day to bring their child to school, or paying for school bus service. Outside the campus of every big university in the United States and Europe, one would often find the most marvelous secondhand bookshops. Rather than gather dust and use up precious space in cramped student apartments, these books are sold to booksellers for a pittance, and are in turn sold back to other students for just a little more.  That, too, is a form of sharing, but with a small difference — someone, in this case, the secondhand bookseller, manages the exchange. Airbnb and Uber take off basically from the same hybrid concept.  An entity is formed that manages the exchange of gifts among the participants and creates and maintains the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. For this, a small fee is collected. Ideally, there’s supposed to be no exchange of money among the participants in the sharing network. The fee that is collected should be just enough to compensate the employees of the network and take care of incidental expenses. Homeowners who let travelers use a spare room are content to collect a small fee for laundry and electricity and be rewarded by the friendship and gratitude they reap as hosts. Travelers get to enjoy virtually free accommodation with a dose of personal hospitality, instead of staying in impersonal high-priced hotels.  Regretfully, the spirit of sharing has been overshadowed by profit-making. Venture capitalists saw the potential of monetizing the spirit of gift-giving, and invested heavily in the new companies. This drove the sharing economy to become as grasping in its quest for returns as the conventional capitalism it sought to replace. The participants themselves soon dropped the veneer of sharing. Individual car owners were soon replaced by greedy entrepreneurs that bought fleets of vehicles intended for use in the Uber or Grab networks.  And, big landlords owning several houses began to edge out small homeowners who had initially networked with Airbnb. We must learn from these sad experiences as we search for new models of sharing in a world that seems bent on monetizing everything we value. public.lives@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248318/grab-buys-uber-pcc-sets-review","title":"Grab buys Uber; PCC sets review","date":"05:08 AM March 27, 2018","snippet":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network.","body":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network. Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/880232/uber-tightens-security-to-reduce-driver-fraud-improve-safety","title":"Uber tightens security to reduce driver fraud, improve safety","date":"03:51 PM March 13, 2017","snippet":"MANILA — Ride sharing service Uber launched on Monday a new security feature meant to reduce fraud, help drivers guard against “compromised accounts” as well as provide passengers with an additional measure of safety.","body":"MANILA — Ride sharing service Uber launched on Monday a new security feature meant to reduce fraud, help drivers guard against “compromised accounts” as well as provide passengers with an additional measure of safety. The improved security procedure involves requiring Uber drivers to periodically take profile pictures of themselves — or so-called “selfies” — to allow Uber to validate with its internal database whether the person driving the designated vehicle at any given time is the same one declared in the company’s records.  With the service called “Real-Time ID Check,” Uber said it would be able to reduce fraud, helping drivers protect their accounts from being compromised. This extra layer of protection can help ensure riders that the right person is behind the wheel. “We at Uber are constantly looking for ways to strengthen our technology-enabled security features,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a Taguig City on Monday. “We look into new solutions and test them to proactively use and maximize the capability of available technologies, and how these can be instrumental in our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and convenient rides.”  The new feature, which was launched initially in several countries where Uber operates, will require drivers to use a new feature on the company’s smartphone-based software that requires a selfie to be taken before they go online and accept rides. The photo taken by the driver is then compared to the one already on file with the account.  If the two photos don’t match, the account would be temporarily blocked while Uber representatives look into the situation, according to Cua. Following its initial release in the US last September 2016, Uber is rolling out the feature across 16 countries, namely South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, India, Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Cua said the number of complaints in the Philippines regarding situations where the identity of the driver does not match declared identity has been “extremely small,” most of which have been caused by previous drivers failing to log out of their Uber accounts before turning over the vehicle to another driver. Cua explained that the security feature would improve the peace of mind of Uber riders knowing that the identities of their drivers have been carefully monitored by the company.  SFM/rga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/252417/toyota-investing-1-billion-ride-hailing-company-grab/","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in ride-hailing company Grab","date":"01:11 PM June 13, 2018","snippet":"Tokyo — Japan’s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is investing $1 billion in Grab, the leading ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, the company said Wednesday.","body":"Tokyo — Japan’s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is investing $1 billion in Grab, the leading ride-hailing company in Southeast Asia, the company said Wednesday.

Starting on November 4, a fleet of self-driving Hyundai Kona Electric SUVs will provide a free ride-sharing service in Irvine, California. “The pilot introduces BotRide to several hundred Irvine residents, including college students. The goal is to study consumer behavior in an autonomous ride-sharing environment,” said Christopher Chang, head of business development, strategy and technology division at Hyundai Motor Co. “We are going to learn about ecosystems, where the vehicles travel and optimize the customer experience. BotRide, is another example of Hyundai’s ongoing efforts to actively build expertise in mobility technology as well as the company’s commitment to providing more user-friendly mobility services to customers.”  Hyundai partnered with Pony.ai to build the self-driving system and with Via to create the BotRide on-demand ridesharing technology and application. Using the BotRide app, riders can hail an autonomous Kona directly from their smartphone. Via’s advanced algorithms enable multiple riders to share the same vehicle, outfitted with Pony.ai autonomous vehicle technology. The app directs passengers to nearby stops for pick up and drop off, allowing for shared trips without lengthy detours, or inconvenient fixed routes and schedules. Integrated Hyundai and Pony.ai technologies enable the BotRide vehicles to navigate complex road scenarios safely, according to the carmaker. The vehicles are equipped with Pony.ai’s latest sensor hardware and proprietary software to identify the precise position of surrounding vehicles, handle pedestrian traffic in urban areas, accurately monitor its surroundings, predict the behavior of other road users, and precisely plan actions accordingly. In addition to self-driving capabilities, BotRide is validating its user experience in preparation for a fully driverless future. “Through BotRide, Hyundai is leveraging cutting-edge autonomous vehicle and mobility technologies to introduce a new, safe, and convenient form of transportation to the public,” said Daniel Han, manager, Advanced Product Strategy at Hyundai Motor America. “The BotRide pilot represents an important step in the deployment and eventual commercialization of a growing new mobility business. In addition to the technology partners powering BotRide, the broader city and community ecosystem have also played an important role in making BotRide possible.

The demonstrators drove hundreds of pink-and-white-liveried cabs along central boulevards and then parked them on the capital’s sprawling main square, known as the Zocalo, and the six-lane street that circles it.  The protesters want the apps banned, arguing that the apps are unfair competition because those drivers are more loosely regulated and don’t have to pay licensing fees. Several cabbies said the ride-hailing apps have cost them 40% of their earnings.  But many Mexico City residents say the apps provide a service superior to that of most taxis, in terms of safety, reliability and comfort, and are competitive on price. Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said that her government maintains an “open dialogue” with the transportation sector and that she considers some of the demands legitimate and others not, the newspaper El Universal reported.

In addition to requiring passengers to bring their own helmets, the group, headed by former board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Ariel Inton, said app-based companies may also provide personal helmets that passengers can avail for an additional fee during a ride.

Angkas, meanwhile, had offered 1,000 free rides to essential health workers during the modified enhanced community quarantine period last month.

They now use “Para,” a tricycle booking app developed by Jovan Ortega, president and chief operating officer of Para Software Inc.  Around 1,700 tricycles ply the streets here but only 140 have joined the network at its initial launch on Nov. 28, said Sean Sarmiento, projects officer of the city government. In neighboring San Juan town, 40 tricycles are part of the Para network, he said.  Technology Ortega, 28, an information technology professional, said his group began developing the app in 2015, believing that the provinces needed to benefit from the technology.  No rules governing apps and sharing platforms are enforced in the provinces, but only local governments regulate tricycles, according to Jojo Guadiz, Ilocos regional director of the Land Transportation Office. According to Ortega, the company operates like any other business entity in this city and San Juan, where they have to get business permits and pay taxes. Sarmiento said he paid P40 for a trip from the City Hall to Poro Point, using the app, a distance that would cost him P30. Like the ride-sharing company that uses a booking app, Para requires clients to enter their destination to be informed as to how much the trip costs. Knowing the cost is convenient for passengers who sometimes deal with exorbitant fare charged by tricycle drivers, said Joe Hipol, an employee of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.  Demand “With the growing population, the demand for tricycles as the most commonly used mode of transportation had surged as not all people have cars of their own and majority still opt to commute daily. Para offers a solution,” said the Para website. But unlike other apps, Para signs up tricycles operating legally. “Our app is basically a communications line between tricycle drivers and passengers,” Ortega said. Tricycle drivers using the app are screened to ensure passenger safety and to protect the company. In Binalonan town, Pangasinan province, ride-sharing firm “Grab Taxi Holdings” launched its “Grab Trike” on Oct. 26, with 40 units of “tuktok” vehicles taking part in the tricycle-hailing network. Tuktok is the local name for electric tricycles. The town government said Grab Trike would address exorbitant fares, complaints about arrogant tricycle drivers and those who only ferry passengers to specific destinations. Tricycle drivers who are not part of the Grab system charge P20 for the first kilometer and P10 for each succeeding kilometer. Tuktuk, on the other hand, charges P30 for the first kilometer and P10 for each succeeding kilometer."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab. FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. [To say that] one taxi car is equivalent to one ride-sharing car is simply not true,” he said. “It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/980508/habal-habal-offered-via-facebook-what-can-ltfrb-do","title":"‘Habal-habal’ offered via Facebook; what can LTFRB do?","date":"06:32 AM April 06, 2018","snippet":"","body":" A newly formed commuters advocacy group called on the government on Wednesday to consider legalizing and regulating the operation of motorcycles for public transport following the proliferation of Facebook groups that offer such a service, also known as “habal-habal.”  According to Transport Watch convener Noemi Dado, the group had monitored over the last six months various “underground” motorcycle ride-sharing groups on Facebook, with drivers charging fares. Dado noted the lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms involved in the transactions being offered, “compromising” rider safety.  She also pointed out members of a ride-sharing group, numbering up to 200,000, are not allowed to post negative feedback about the rides. They are also required to delete their request each time they are able to get a ride, Dado added. Transport Watch coconvener George Royeca warned that since there are no records of the trips, commuters have no recourse should they get involved in a road accident or fall prey to criminals during the ride.  Under Republic Act No. 4136, or the “Land Transportation and Traffic Code,” motorcycles couldn’t be used to transport passengers for a fee. This was the basis of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) when it ordered last year the closure of motorcycle ride-sharing provider Angkas. Despite the announced closure, however, the Angkas Riders and Passengers Group continued to be active on social media. Group shutdown Sought for comment, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the agency would coordinate with Transport Watch to help them determine all of the motorcycle groups on Facebook that are illegally offering their services nationwide. She noted that they will also seek the assistance of the Department of Information and Communications Technology as well as Facebook to shut down these groups.  Lizada added that these motorcycles would also be included in anticolorum operations of the newly created interagency group, “Task Force Kamao.” But Royeca said shutting down the Facebook pages won’t make the problem go away, as officials should understand that the use of habal-habal has become popular throughout the country due to the lack of transport options. Hence, it has become the only alternative especially in poor commuters. Unless Congress comes out with new legislation amending the law that bans the motorcycle as a public utility vehicle, Lizada stressed that it is illegal to use it as a public transport as its safety could not be assured. Dado said Transport Watch was in talks with at least four lawmakers to revisit the country’s “antiquated” transport laws to address the need for inclusive mobility and resolve issues that mostly affect the poor."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1295793/back-riders-only-for-private-motorcycles","title":"Back riders only for private motorcycles","date":"04:05 AM June 23, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque made it clear on Monday that only privately owned motorcycles would be allowed to have back riders while the ban on motorcycle taxis would remain.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque made it clear on Monday that only privately owned motorcycles would be allowed to have back riders while the ban on motorcycle taxis would remain.

For now, ride-sharing services on motorcycles could not be allowed even if the regulations for back riders come out as the dry run for motorcycle taxis has ended, Roque said. For them to become operational again, they would first have to get a franchise, he added.  House transportation committee chair Rep. Edgar Sarmiento, however, was planning to propose that motorcycle taxis like Angkas and JoyRide be allowed back on the streets provisionally while the bill legalizing their operations is pending in Congress. Sarmiento said he would bring up the matter with the Department of Transportation.

Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919650/number-of-uber-grab-vehicles-shocks-ltfrb","title":"Number of Uber, Grab vehicles shocks LTFRB","date":"01:11 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.","body":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said.

The country’s major messenger app company, Kakao, has entered the e-bike sharing business with a new service called Kakao T Bike. The company began its service on Mar. 6 in Incheon and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.  Socar, a Seoul-based car-sharing startup, also joined the foray by investing in a young e-bike sharing service provider, Nine2One. The company said it would launch the sharing service within this month. “We are hoping to provide various transportation options for consumers without cars,” Socar CEO Lee Jae-woong said when he announced the plan for launching the sharing service on Mar. 6. “We can resolve traffic problems by reducing the number of cars on the streets.”  The bike-sharing business is the focus of intense competition across the country, whether the bicycles are conventional or electric. The country has allowed electronic bicycles to run on the lanes alongside ordinary vehicles since March last year. Inspired by the success of a similar endeavor in Seoul, some of the surrounding municipalities such as Seongnam and Suwon have been joining hands with global bike-sharing platforms.  Seoul has been operating a bike-sharing service since 2015. The bicycles are available at designated places scattered around Seoul. Currently, about 20,000 are being provided to the public by the Seoul government. “The number of bicycles (available for sharing service) is 20 per every 10,000 Seoul citizens,” Seoul city government said. “Most of them are located at least 20 meters away from the subway and bus stations.” In Suwon, about 5,000 bikes are being used as part of the sharing service since the program was launched in January last year. The municipal government is working with Singapore-based bike-sharing company O-bike. Seongnam has also introduced a similar bike-sharing service in cooperation with Kakao. About 600 electric bikes are part of the service. Some 400 Kakao bikes are operational at Songdo, Incheon. The Korean ride-sharing companies said their businesses would ride high, as bike-sharing has gained popularity as a form of environmentally friendly transportation amid growing concern over air pollution.  “Although we make money out of the car-sharing business, our ultimate goal is to reduce the number of cars,” Socar CEO Lee Jae-woong wrote on Facebook last week. “It is the only way to make our business sustainable.”  Automobile exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major contributors to worsening air pollution in South Korea. Some vehicles with harmful pollutants can be restricted from operating in Seoul when the city  government declares emergency measures to reduce the level of fine dust. The companies also stressed that their service is much more user-friendly than those provided by the municipalities, as the users don’t have to be bothered looking for parking spaces after borrowing the bicycles. For example, Kakao users are able to check out where the bicycles are placed via its Kakao T apps before using them. The borrowed bicycles can be returned to any places that the users see fit — except for the places such as motorways, underground parking places and the building’s entrances. “For those seeking to travel a short distance, we can provide alternative to traditional transportation,” Kakao Mobility CEO Jung Joo-hwan said on March 5 when the company launched the bicycle sharing service in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon. Kakao Mobility is seeking to provide about 3,000 bicycles for nationwide sharing service after achieving the success of its service in Incheon. About 1,000 electronic bicycles are operated in Incheon, with most of them being manufactured by Samchuly and Alton Sports. After investing into Nine2One, Socar is planning to launch its own bicycle-sharing service in Seoul by the end of this month. The company said it will provide 350 bicycles as initial service and expand the number to 2000 for nationwide service."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/198787/pldt-joins-forces-with-uber-in-ph","title":"PLDT joins forces with Uber in PH","date":"08:30 AM September 09, 2015","snippet":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.

(PLDT), the country’s biggest telecommunications company,  is moving beyond the digital highway to Metro Manila’s roads through a partnership with popular ride sharing app Uber. PLDT, with units Smart Communications and Voyager Innovations, announced Tuesday a multi-year, strategic agreement with Uber in the Philippines, which will include free in-car Wi-Fi and promotions through Smart’s network.  The development is the latest partnership in the telecommunications industry, which is seeking new ways to generate revenues in a digital age. It also comes as Uber in the Philippines gains legitimacy following the government’s recent move to regulate transport-related smartphone applications, ahead of other countries.  With the partnership, Uber riders will be able to use free Wi-Fi, using Smart and PLDT’s network infrastructure, while onboard Uber vehicles. The service will initially be available in Uber black vehicles, which refers to the app’s premium service, but will be rolled out across all Uber cars “over the next few months.”  Uber was established in 2009 and was first launched in San Francisco, United States. Today, it is being used in 335 cities across 60 countries and in the Philippines, it mainly competes with other apps like GrabCar and regular taxi services, which have raised their opposition against the ride-sharing industry as an unfair threat to their business. Smart said that through the partnership, Uber riders on Smart’s network would be able to avail themselves of promotions, discounts and so-called on-demand experiences. Smart subscribers in Metro Manila who are first time users of the app can get two free Uber rides worth up to P300 each, from Sept. 9 to Sept 30, it added. The Uber mobile app will also be pre-installed on all smartphones that come with Smart postpaid subscriptions.  “We’re excited to partner with Uber, the world’s leading technology company that is transforming urban mobility, to bring its innovative digitally enabled service to more commuters in the Philippines,” PLDT chair Manuel V. Pangilinan said in a statement on Tuesday. “Filipinos are early adopters of new technology and through this partnership with Uber, we’re providing our subscribers the opportunity to make their ride experience even more convenient and enjoyable,” he added. “In Smart, Uber has found the perfect fit to realize our common vision of providing an unrivaled user experience built on a strong foundation of reliability, convenience and network efficiency,” Mike Brown, Uber regional general manager, Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand, said in the same statement. “The Philippine government has shown tremendous leadership in recognizing the value of ride-sharing services like Uber and developing new sector specific regulations,” he added. Smart said Uber drivers also gain exclusive prepaid and postpaid mobile packages as well as exclusive phone offers. As noted, the move is in sync with strategies employed by domestic telcos to shift their revenues into more digital and Internet-based services. PLDT earlier announced that it would increase its 2015 capital spending to a record P43 billion from P39 billion, mainly to bolster its high-speed Internet infrastructure. The spending, which may remain “elevated” for the next two years, comes as PLDT sees a big decline in its traditional revenues such as toll earnings and wireless pre-paid business.

The council has 10 days to send the approved law to City Hall. Mayor Fernando Haddad will then have two weeks to approve or veto the bill. In its first vote on June 30, the council voted 48-1 to prohibit the use of ride-sharing services such as Uber.

Uber has been banned in Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, the only other two cities where the service is present.  If the measure goes into effect, Sao Paulo Uber drivers who ignore the ban can be fined 1,700 reals ($447) and have their cars confiscated. The service has drawn increasing use since last year’s World Cup of soccer, with many of its cars cleaner and newer than those of regular cabs. Cab drivers complain Uber is unfair competition because its drivers don’t have to pay city fees or undergo official inspections. To prevent the expansion of Uber elsewhere in the country, city councils in at least another 13 state capitals have laws pending approval to ban the service. In Maceio, capital of the northeastern state of Alagoas, city councilman Galba Netto recently told reporters: “We are trying to prevent a future problem, because the arrival of Uber in our city would be a disaster.”  On its Facebook page, Uber said people “who cross the city every day have the right to choose how they will travel the streets of Sao Paulo.” RELATED STORY Brazil cabbies ambush Uber driver — report"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/856456/uber-grab-vow-compliance-to-ltfrb-over-price-surges","title":"Uber, Grab vow compliance to LTFRB over price surges","date":"01:51 PM December 25, 2016","snippet":"Transport network companies Grab and Uber have vowed to cooperate with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) over the reported surge in their rates this holiday season.","body":"Transport network companies Grab and Uber have vowed to cooperate with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) over the reported surge in their rates this holiday season.

We also continue to invest in technological solutions like UberPOOL and UberHOP, to help reduce traffic congestion by getting more people into fewer cars while providing more affordable fares,” Uber said. Grab said it will “fully comply to LTFRB’s requests and directives,” adding that it will voluntarily place a cap in its service rates from Dec. 24, 2016 to Jan. 30, 2017 “to ensure that the riding public will get the best service during this season.”  “For our passengers, may we request that you double check your pickup and dropoff points before confirming your booking. However, we are ready to refund rides, upon verification, should they be charged for any incorrect rate caused by a system error,” Grab added.

Uber on Friday said the service, dubbed uberHOP, will be initially available only for people traveling between Makati City and Bonifacio Global City.  UberHOP will be available on weekdays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. then between  4:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.  Uber, which mainly competes here with rival mobile platform GrabTaxi and traditional taxi services, said riders save on the fare since the cost would be split with other passengers. For this pilot test, the introductory fee is a flat rate of P75 per ride and the passenger could share the trip with as many as five other riders on board a “large vehicle.”  According to Uber, the savings could amount to as much as 70 percent compared to an UberX ride. Since it is a flat fare, there will be no surge pricing mechanism, Uber said. “We’re testing uberHOP as a special pilot here because Manila suffers from some of the worst congestion in the world,” Uber said on its website.  “Congestion is more than just an annoyance; it’s a drain on our cities, our economies and our planet. Innovative solutions like uberHOP, that put more passengers in fewer cars – safely, reliably and affordable – help move us towards a brighter, cleaner and less gridlocked future,” it added. Uber pointed out that an uberHOP ride can only accommodate one person per request. That means that riders will need to book their own uberHOP rides separately, it said. UberHOP rides are booked in a similar manner to regular Uber trips although an app update might be needed for some users. It said passengers can select the uberHOP feature and the platform will pair the rider with a driver along with other people travelling in the same direction. As noted, this is only for the Makati City to BGC route. There are some key differences to a regular Uber ride.  Passengers will be asked to walk to a “suggested meet up spot” that comes with a scheduled time indicated in the app, which Uber said will be within “10 minutes or less.” The drop-off of point will also be suggested by the app. The uberHOP driver will not wait for late passengers, it said. At no point is the passenger allowed to contact the driver to make alternative arrangements. Moreover, passengers are also discouraged from cancelling rides. In a regular Uber trip, a passenger can cancel a request, but this comes with a P100 fee. Uber did not detail any penalty when cancelling an uberHOP but it noted that booking in this manner means a passenger is “making a commitment to both your co-riders and the driver.” “Cancellations damage both of their experiences, so please don’t leave them hanging,” Uber said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/930533/ltfrb-only-3-cars-per-uber-grab-operator","title":"LTFRB: Only 3 cars per Uber, Grab operator","date":"06:24 AM September 14, 2017","snippet":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday.","body":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday. At a Senate briefing on the Department of Transportation budget, Delgra told Sen. Grace Poe that the LTFRB would issue a memorandum circular on this new requirement in “moving forward to solve this issue” on regulating the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS).  “We have to go back to the original concept of ride-sharing. We cannot allow that there are TNVS operators operating more than 20 or 30 units,” he told Poe who asked him whether the LTFRB would limit the number of vehicles to be owned by TNVS operators. Asked by Poe what would happen to operators with 10 or more units, Delgra replied: “We know we cannot simply drop them.”  He said he was aware that a large number of TNVS operators had gone to the extent of borrowing money from banks to “get a car so they would be able to put it in Uber or Grab.” According to Delgra, there will be a “transition period” for those who will be affected by the new requirement and they will be offered options.  “Considering the fact that they are actually maintaining a fleet already; they own 20 units under one name [so] they can go [into] taxi service. Second, they can also go into [the] shuttle service if they want. And third, they can also go into tourist transport,” Delgra said. The LTFRB earlier said it would come out this month with new regulations governing the app-based transport industry such as extending the validity of franchise given to drivers. Uber has 66,000 vehicles while Grab has over 52,000. Of these, however, only more than 3,700 are licensed to operate by the LTFRB."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/962479/poe-to-ltfrb-explain-cap-on-grab-uber-other-transport-units","title":"Poe to LTFRB: Explain cap on Grab, Uber, other transport units","date":"01:15 PM January 22, 2018","snippet":"Senator Grace Poe is urging the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to “explain the science” behind its decision to limit the number of Grab, Uber and other ride-sharing units to 45,000 in Metro Manila, 500 in Metro Cebu and 200 in Pampanga.","body":"Senator Grace Poe is urging the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to “explain the science” behind its decision to limit the number of Grab, Uber and other ride-sharing units to 45,000 in Metro Manila, 500 in Metro Cebu and 200 in Pampanga. “What’s the math used in this decision? What were the parameters used, like demand and supply?” Poe asked in a statement on Monday.  The senator said “some formula would have been used because these figures, which are important to the riding public, cannot and should not be plucked out of thin air.” “In this age of algorithms, LTFRB should make public the factual basis of its decision. Ilabas nila ang minutes ng meetings and consultations para alam ng publiko (They should release the minutes of the meetings and consultation so the public will know),” she said.  “Such disclosure of a public document is what the FOI (freedom of information) rules, issued by the President, require.

The said base would mean that ride-sharing companies would share the pool, without exceeding it. The LTFRB earlier assured the public that the base would be reviewed every quarter and adjusted correspondingly based on “churning rate” or the number of vehicles that are no longer in the system. Poe, however, pointed out that the review “should not just be based on the churning rate, but on an “algorithm that determines supply and demand.” “The cap will also affect not just the TNCs but the livelihood of drivers of TNVS. Given that there are currently about 100k TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,” she added in the statement."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/85024/option-for-commuters","title":"Option for commuters","date":"12:52 AM May 19, 2015","snippet":"THE MOVE of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya to legalize the operations of so-called ride-sharing firms such as Uber and GrabTaxi is a boon for the riding public.

Earlier targeted by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for allegedly using colorum vehicles, these firms offer a much safer ride to commuters than many of the cabs plying Metro Manila. Abaya is correct in observing that technological innovation can drive progress, especially in transportation where it can provide safer and more convenient options to commuters. Noting that app-based transport services—referring to software applications downloadable to one’s smartphone—help address the increasing demand for mobility, the Department of Transportation and Communications created last week the Transportation Network Vehicle Service classification to allow transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and GrabTaxi to exist within the Philippines’ regulatory framework.  But there is growing apprehension over the LTFRB’s plan to regulate these ride-sharing firms. It currently regulates traditional cab operators, yet the news media are replete with horror stories of cabbies robbing, raping or even killing passengers. Colorum cabs abound, especially at night. Many cabbies also turn away passengers heading to certain destinations, particularly during rush hours, or demand extra charges if there is heavy traffic along the way. And anything left in a regular taxi is more often than not considered lost. Contrast this with the operations of ride-sharing firms. The service lets commuters book through their mobile phone a private vehicle to take them anywhere within Metro Manila. Passengers who book a ride on Uber, for example, can check within minutes on their mobile phone app what kind of vehicle is coming and who the driver is. Payments are charged to a credit or debit card; no cash is involved. The company also conducts a background check on the driver/vehicle owner before being accredited. Passengers are required to open an account where they have to disclose personal details and register a valid credit card. At the end of the service, both driver and passenger can leave feedback for each other.  It’s unfortunate that traditional taxi operators are threatening to sue the DOTC. Instead of complaining, shouldn’t they improve their services to be at par with ride-sharing firms? And this is not the only potential roadblock to ride-sharing. The LTFRB also wants to impose restrictions and requirements that, as the bureaucracy is sadly known for, can end up discouraging prospective ride-sharing participants. The most worrisome is the plan to require a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for all ride-sharing vehicles, which is reportedly not required in other countries where the concept is flourishing. Just how difficult is it to obtain a CPC? Judging from LTFRB requirements, it can take forever. Among the requirements are: copies of verified application forms; operator’s data sheet; route measured capacity certification from the DOTC; evidence of Filipino citizenship; authenticated birth certificate; evidence of financial capability; certificate of average daily balance from a bank; certificate of business name issued by the Department of Trade and Industry; certificate of registration and official receipt of authorized vehicles from the Land Transportation Office; photograph of units being applied for (front, back and sides of the vehicles, and the photo should include the front page of a newspaper to show the date when the picture was taken); location map and picture with dimension of garage with a transfer certificate of title or tax declaration or contract of lease for the specific garage area; and proof of publication of notice of hearing to be submitted during the actual hearing at the LTFRB. An applicant is also required to personally appear during the submission of an application. Whew!  Transportation regulations should facilitate, not hamper, convenient, safe and reliable services to the public. That’s according to Abaya himself. Smartphone-based transportation companies have transformed the way people move in many cities abroad with a safer, more reliable and efficient option. They are about to do the same in Metro Manila. In ensuring passenger safety, ride-sharing firms are way ahead compared with the traditional taxis. Regulatory authorities would do well to keep this in mind."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/896698/ltfrb-nixes-2-new-uber-ride-offers","title":"LTFRB nixes 2 new Uber ride offers","date":"01:13 AM May 15, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has warned a transport network company (TNC) not to implement two new features it wants to offer to commuters, citing safety and fare issues that have yet to be approved by the agency.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has warned a transport network company (TNC) not to implement two new features it wants to offer to commuters, citing safety and fare issues that have yet to be approved by the agency. According to Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, Uber cannot roll out UberMoto in Cebu and UberXL in other parts of the country as these are not compliant with the agency’s terms and conditions for TNCs.  UberMoto allows commuters to book a motorcycle through the app while UberXL can accommodate up to six passengers at a time. Uber said that UberMoto was in response to Cebu City’s planned release of an ordinance to “level up the operation of habal-habal (motorcycle-for-hire) drivers.” UberXL, on the other hand, was the result of passenger demand for six-seater cars which it said would encourage ride-sharing, thus easing traffic.  “Everybody has a good idea. But if you allow everybody with a good idea to implement it, we would be disorganized,” Lizada said. She added that the LTFRB had disallowed another TNC, Grab, from operating its motorcycle ride-sharing feature, pointing out that encouraging more motorcycles on the road would go against the government’s vision of a modern public transport. “We are promoting high-capacity transport like buses and P2P (point-to-point) service. You are going against the thrust of the government. You will flood the roads with motorcycles,” Lizada said.She warned that peer operators who would offer the features may be apprehended for operating without a valid franchise.  As for UberXL, Lizada said that six-seater vehicles under Uber and Grab have yet to be approved by the LTFRB. Aside from possibly affecting the operations of other public utility vehicles like tourist vans, the new feature’s fare structure has yet to be discussed with the agency, she pointed out. According to the company’s computation, UberXL passengers will be charged a base fare of P60 while P8.55 will be added for every kilometer and P3 for every minute. “They better stop this UberMoto and UberXL. There has to be a sense of regulation at their end. If they are not able to comply, they better bring their business elsewhere,” Lizada said, quoting LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III’s stern warning to Uber. The LTFRB is set to hold a meeting on May 23 in which Uber’s compliance will be discussed. Lizada said that if the TNC fails to comply, they may cancel or suspend its accreditation with the agency. “You have a good program, marketing, but you can’t just implement it without even telling us.

We need to remind the LTFRB that before these ride-sharing services became popular, taxi scams were blatant.(And they still are.) They were so bad that they even led to alleged rape and theft. Others have even been apprehended for masturbating while driving a passenger. Every so often, public commuters ran the risk of getting their belongings snatched while in the jeepney.

Hopefully.  In one of its ways to reduce the alarming traffic congestion in the country, Uber Philippines – a transportation network vehicle service company – launched on Wednesday UberPOOL, the carpool version of Uber. Starting at 6 a.m. Wednesday, passengers from 16 cities and municipalities of Metro Manila availing of Uber service, can ride and reach their location with a 25 percent cheaper fare compared to the usual UBerX – by sharing a ride with their fellow Uber passengers who are headed in the same direction.  With the UberPOOL, people going to the same place at the same time can ride together at a cheaper price, thus reducing number of cars plying Metro Manila. In a press conference at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board office, Laurence Cua, general manager of Uber Philippines, said UberPOOL could help solve the country’s worsening traffic problem, at the same time, reduce carbon and greenhouse gases emitted by vehicles.  According to a 2015 Waze study, Metro Manila has the worst traffic situation on Earth. A Japan International Cooperation Agency study, meanwhile, has put the cost of traffic in the country at P2.4 billion every day. The number of cars is rising at a yearly average rate of 2.13 percent, another study shows. Outgoing LTFRB chair Winston Ginez was happy with the launch during the LTFRB’s 29th anniversary. The regulation on TNVS has been the LTFRB’s legacy, he added. “We and the Department of Transportation and Communication went through an eye in the needle in bringing change and reforms in an old-age public transportation system; we faced a lot of opposition,” Ginez said. In fact, the Philippines is the first country in the world to have a nationwide regulation – from Batanes to Jolo – on ride sharing. “This is not going to be a new franchise. All those authorized will be using the same authority, so no authority, no license shall be issued,” Ginez said when asked if UberPOOL would be an added competition to UV express drivers. As of Apr 6, of the 17,591 Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) units plying the roads of Metro Manila, 4,141 units are operated by Singapore-based GrabCar while 13,450 are operated by Uber, Inc.  Ginez, encouraging more TNVS applications, added that Uber drivers would benefit more from carpooling as it would result in continuous rides and less idle time for drivers. The main goal, he said, would be “to take off more cars on the road… More people, in fewer cars.” Traffic, Cua said, has been an indication of the increase in the Filipino’s purchasing capacity. “We are growing; people are having more money, and buying power; people keep on buying cars.” In fact, Philippines ranked second next to China in terms of vehicle sales worldwide, followed by India. In 2015, 300,000 new cars hit the road in the country, he added. Uber, as an additional option to car ownership, he said, has lessened problems for motorists such as lack of parking space and parking time. Cua said safety of passengers from holdup men and other criminals has been assured by Uber’s 24/7 support system and validation of every rider. Marjorie Dasco, an Uber user, found the idea of UberPOOL great and said she would like to try it out, considering the worsening Metro Manila traffic situation. “The time of waiting to pick another passenger may be from 5 to 10 minutes but in the long run, it’s not a big effort compared to the impact of this initiative on the traffic problem,” Cua told reporters. Since the launching of the app in September 2014, a total of 464 cities and 70 countries have been using Uberpool; and over 100,000 people have taken pooled trips in over 11 cities worldwide including New York, Los Angeles, Beijing and Shanghai. “Uber has revolutionized carpooling through technology in the country. This is much faster than organizing carpooling with officemates. This is real time, and practical, since, we found out that most of the passengers are going in the same direction,” Cua added. To use UberPOOL, a passenger should register first. Uber shall match a passenger with another who is headed in the same direction, and shall notify the passengers through the application the places where the Uber driver picks up another passenger. The passengers are also assured that “they are never taken more than a few minutes out of their way.” Payment is on a credit card basis. Passengers are expected to pay just like a normal Uber trip and will be given an electronic receipt after.  SFM"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/734910/taxing-rides-bir-targets-uber","title":"Taxing rides: BIR targets Uber","date":"05:11 AM October 28, 2015","snippet":"Uber rides may soon become less convenient for the public as tax authorities plan to require the issuance of receipts—a rule ignored by many taxi operators.","body":"Uber rides may soon become less convenient for the public as tax authorities plan to require the issuance of receipts—a rule ignored by many taxi operators. Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Deputy Commissioner Nelson Aspe said new guidelines would be issued to spell out the tax responsibilities of all parties in the Uber system.  Apart from the issuance of receipts, the BIR said it expected owners of cars used for Uber rides to file tax returns. Uber drivers who don’t own the cars they use will also be considered employees, hence appropriate taxes should be withheld from their salaries. Uber rides will also be subjected to value-added tax (VAT), which will add 12 percent to total costs. Aspe said the BIR would charge it retroactively.  “All of these taxes are in the present law,” Aspe told reporters at the sidelines of a financial services forum hosted by accounting firm Punongbayan & Araullo. “We’re telling everyone what the law provides… It’s just a reiteration of what they should pay.” Uber drivers who own the cars they use would have to issue receipts as self-employed individuals, like doctors and lawyers. Uber drivers who work for car owners, meanwhile, should issue receipts on behalf of their employers.  Aspe said BIR would dig through information from credit card companies, which are required to make regular reports to the government on all transactions. This will ensure that the tax liabilities of drivers, owners and Uber itself are computed accurately. Uber passengers are charged online using their credit card information. The same rules will apply to other ride-sharing services like GrabTaxi, which offers a similar service called GrabCar, the revenue official added. Unlike Uber, however, GrabTaxi’s business is entirely cash-based, which, according to Aspe, is more difficult to track. The guidelines on Uber rides, which Aspe said would not create new rules but define how existing laws should be applied, would be issued before the end of the year. The requirement for receipts is the latest legal hoop faced by Uber and other ride-sharing service providers. Earlier this year, the Philippines became the first country in the world to issue formal regulations for ride-sharing services, which allow passengers to book rides using smart phone apps. Uber vehicle owners and drivers were required to get licenses from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), much like regular taxis. Uber’s accreditation as a Transport Network Company was approved in August."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/251538/pcc-cites-grab-price-hikes-decreased-service-quality-after-uber-acquisition","title":"PCC cites Grab price hikes, ‘decreased’ service quality after Uber acquisition","date":"03:12 PM May 28, 2018","snippet":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday.","body":"The price and quality of Grab Philippines’ services have worsened after it acquired its only rival in the market, Uber, but not even the entry of new players could challenge the transport firm’s influence in the ride-sharing market, the country’s competition watchdog said on Monday. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248487/pcc-says-grab-uber-deal-will-create-virtual-monopoly","title":"PCC says Grab-Uber deal will create a ‘virtual monopoly’","date":"05:55 PM April 02, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. In a statement, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering a review of the deal regardless if the transaction falls under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. The Uber app, which has provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, will no longer be functional starting on April 9.  “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anti-competitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives on Monday. It was not clear if the statement preceded or followed their meeting.  The acquisition would likely have a “far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it is looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.” During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-sharing services, and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways – through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met – one of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable.  As of press time, PCC said that it does not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1063208/despite-scs-tro-angkas-to-continue-operations","title":"Despite SC’s TRO, Angkas to continue operations","date":"01:05 PM December 14, 2018","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The management of Angkas said Friday they will continue giving motorcycle rides to commuters even after the Supreme Court (SC) overruled a lower court’s decision that previously disallowed government from interfering in the ride-sharing app’s operations.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The management of Angkas said Friday they will continue giving motorcycle rides to commuters even after the Supreme Court (SC) overruled a lower court’s decision that previously disallowed government from interfering in the ride-sharing app’s operations.

LTFRB Board Member Atty. Aileen Lizada said three local ride-sharing companies Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their accreditation before the agency.  “So if you say that there is no competition, soon there will be, and any competition is good for any industry because it benefits the riding public,” Lizada said in a press conference at Grab’s processing center at Mega Tent in Libis, Quezon City. The announcement came days after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move that secured the Singapore-based company’s dominance in the region’s TNVS industry.  Lizada also allayed concerns that the merger would result in higher fares as public utility vehicle operators have to first secure the LTFRB’s approval before increasing their fares. “Grab on its own, just like any other public utility vehicle, cannot increase its fare on its own,” she said.  “We also have monitoring. We know ano yung range nila, and if there are complaints, we see them and read them sa Twitter as well as our Facebook account, LTFRB Citizen Enforcer, and @ltfrb for Twitter,” she added. Lizada said that with the Grab-Uber merger, the LTFRB would “all the more” be strict in implementing transportation rules and regulations. “We will not allow any infractions, any violations especially so with this merger. All the more that we will be strict in monitoring,” she said. Lizada explained that before approving any petition for fare increases, the LTFRB conducts public hearings where the agency’s board members, including representatives from the National Economic and Development Administration, deliberate on the petition.      /muf READ: Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/952036/news-ltfrb-angkas-habal-habal-ride-sharing-job-fair","title":"LTFRB holds job fair for Angkas and ‘habal-habal’ drivers","date":"01:43 PM December 13, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday held a whole-day job fair for drivers of “habal-habal” (motor taxi) and suspended motorcycle-ride hailing app Angkas.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday held a whole-day job fair for drivers of “habal-habal” (motor taxi) and suspended motorcycle-ride hailing app Angkas.

In the video, Daza shared four top don’ts of ride-sharing to make sure everyone keeps themselves in check.  “When I take Grab, I always find myself chatting with the driver,” she wrote. “Their stories gave me an idea for a video to remind everyone on how to be good Grabbers. Check out the dont’s when you ride share. Don’t be a no-no!”   Next time you book a Grab or Uber, perhaps it wouldn’t hurt not to keep your driver waiting, or to remember to greet them a cheery “Hello!” or a grateful “Thank you!” once you arrive at your destination. A little tip goes a long way, too.

That may sum up the effect on the riding public of one bold unflinching decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Recently, LTFRB imposed a maximum limit on the number of Uber and Grab cars, impossibly called TNVS (transport network vehicle service), to 45,000 at most plying Metro Manila, home to more than 13 million people. Just exactly how LTFRB churned up the number, nobody knew for sure. The fact remains that both Uber and Grab reported to LTFRB that their requests for rides ran by the millions every month.  Anyway, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III said the magic number was the result of studies, careful to point out that it was … well, “not arbitrary.” Well and good! It’s just that he forgot to release those studies to the public.  While the guys down here in my barangay could believe LTFRB about the studies, the public would never know whether or not those studies were wrong. Some four years ago in 2014, ride-sharing became an alternative to driving ourselves to work or taking a cab. We would get a chauffeur-driven car at the push of a button on the cellphone, and we would get the service right at the doorstep exactly when we needed it. Based on a paper done by Uber, about 1.5 million people in Metro Manila actively use Uber at present, including tourists from some 79 countries. Uber claimed that, in a month, it only registered about 30,000 active units, and only about 16,000 of them took at least one trip every day. In short, there was a shortage of units.  Statistics gathered by Uber showed that in July last year, it was able to fulfill 80 percent of requests for rides, which went down to a pathetic 40 percent last month, or less than half of the requests. Stop right there. In fact, in the last Christmas season, the figure even dropped miserably to just 20 percent! No wonder, in the real world, people like my friend LC could feel the lack of rides that LTFRB perhaps forgot to study. The Uber data also showed the public has started to use the ride-pooling option (meaning, more than one passenger per trip), which now accounts for about 40 percent of the trips. In actual figures, some 670,000 individuals who use Uber were willing to share their rides with others. Thus, ride-sharing could be one way of easing the public affliction called traffic. Consider for a minute that, based on data compiled by the Metro Manila Development Authority, more than 80 percent of the cars plying the streets of Metro Manila only had one passenger—the driver. People would rather buy their own cars, drive themselves to work and bear the high cost of parking, if they could find a vacant slot, precisely because of our inefficient public transportation system. Another survey also showed that some 88 percent of Filipinos would be willing to forego buying a car, if they could have a reliable ride-sharing transport. Anyway, despite the claims of the chief of LTFRB about having studied the situation, his need to control the number of Uber and Grab vehicles still had some huge holes. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For example, LTFRB forgot to say just exactly how the different TNVS would share the 45,000 units. Nobody, but nobody had any idea who would get what number. Moreover, the entire TNVS sector reportedly already had more than 100,000 units among themselves. Question: Which one among them would LTFRB remove? And nobody, but nobody still had any idea what the criteria could be. Controlling the supply of anything, just like price control, would always have bad effects (although the limit set by LTFRB would benefit taxi operators). What is LTFRB so worried about? So what if the metropolis would have too many Uber or Grab cars? It would actually be good for the riding public—which, by the way, according to Sen. Grace Poe, LTFRB did not consult before it arrived at its decision."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/76935/50-uber-cars-on-hold-in-cebu","title":"50 Uber cars on hold in Cebu","date":"December 05,2015 - 01:41 AM","snippet":"","body":"The  Cebu  launch of Uber, a private ride-sharing service that connects drivers online, is  affected by the stoppage order of the Quezon City Trial Court. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will not process franchise applications for 50 Uber units in Cebu while a 20-day temporary restraining order against ride-sharing services, which includes GrabCar operations, is in effect. But 10 Uber cars, which were issued a 45-day provisional authority before the issuance of the TRO, will be able to operate for 45 days, said LTFRB 7 Regional Director Reynaldo Elnar. The much-awaited Uber launch in Cebu was scheduled on Dec. 3 withannouncements  posted online for a 20 percent discount from Dec. 3 to 9.  It said “Uber partners will be ready to take your ride requests. Experience the 5-star service Uber has become known for — to and from anywhere in Metro Cebu: from Consolacion to Talisay, and all of Mactan.” Cebu Daily News e-mailed Uber’s online support team for comment but got no reply yesterday. “We’re coordinating with the LTFRB and our lawyers for our next steps,” said Grab Philippines spokesman Lorelei Olalia in a text message. Grab Philippines operates only one of its formats, GrabTaxi, in Cebu. GrabCar, which is similar to Uber, operates only in Manila. On its Facebook page, Grab Philippines said it will “continue to operate as usual” until they receive a copy of the court order. “We are hopeful that we will get (government) support to be able to provide safe and convenient GrabCar rides in the country. Our commitment towards providing the highest quality of service remains,” the company said. Judge Santiago Arenas of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service without a certificate of public convenience (CPC). The 20-day restraining order halts  implementation of Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) and LTFRB issuances on accreditation, conditions and implementing guidelines to operate TNVS.

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which licenses about 180,000 drivers of car services and yellow cabs, called his behavior “ridiculous.”  “It’s 2018 in New York City, and this isn’t the way we live anymore,” commission spokesman Allen Fromberg said. The women, Alex Iovine and Emma Pichl, a couple in their 20s, were on their way from Brooklyn to Manhattan on Saturday when they exchanged what they called a “peck” on the lips. They said driver Ahmad El Boutari, who’s 35 and lives in Brooklyn, forced them out and a confrontation ensued.  A cellphone video taken by Pichl shows the driver saying that kissing in an Uber is illegal. “You can’t do this in the car,” the driver says.  “Kissing is not illegal,” one of the women responds. “Why are we not allowed to kiss in an Uber?” “It’s disrespectful,” the driver says. Fromberg noted that the city does not regulate behavior in Uber cars and similar services. But he called what the driver did to the women “an unacceptable and repugnant act that will not be tolerated.” The Taxi and Limousine Commission is investigating. Uber has behavior rules amounting to, basically, no sex in cars. But Iovine and Pichl said they were doing no such thing.  El Boutari told the Daily News that the women played loud music on their phones and one put her feet on the seat. But Iovine said that was not true. “We would never try to upset someone in their own car,” she said by telephone. Then, “after we had peck-kissed, sitting on opposite sides of the back seat and not even touching, I saw him looking at me in the rearview mirror,” she said. “He was very angry.” She said they were in lower Manhattan when the driver pulled over, opened a rear door and ordered them to “get out of my car.” During the altercation, when Pichl started recording the scene, “he grabbed Emma’s arm to try to get her to stop,” Iovine said. “It was kind of a scary experience.” Uber, which is based in San Francisco, has removed El Boutari’s access to its app, saying it does not tolerate discrimination. It said it is investigating. /cbb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/923358/bill-compels-govt-officials-to-take-public-rides-during-rush-hour","title":"Bill compels gov’t officials to take public rides during rush hour","date":"07:06 AM August 17, 2017","snippet":"Government officials, including lawmakers and Cabinet members, may be forced to put themselves in commuters’ shoes under a new bill that would compel them to use public transport during rush hour at least once a month.","body":"Government officials, including lawmakers and Cabinet members, may be forced to put themselves in commuters’ shoes under a new bill that would compel them to use public transport during rush hour at least once a month. As outrage mounted over a host of transportation issues, especially the suspension of the ride-sharing company Uber a lawmaker has filed a bill that would force officials, including those of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, to “empathize” with the riding public.  Weekday rush hours Under the proposal of Aangat Tayo Rep. Neil Abayon, officials and employees of national and local government offices will be required to habitually ride buses, commuter trains, light rail, taxis and transport network vehicle service, public utility jeepneys and tricycles.  They will be required to do so “at least once every calendar month during weekday rush hours using each of the various modes” of public transport, according to the bill filed on Tuesday. Flying economy  Public servants will also, by default, have to fly economy “regardless of rank,” under Abayon’s bill. Officials covered by the bill will include those with the rank, or its equivalent, of division chief all the way to department secretary. Though not explicitly stated in the bill, members of Congress are covered. “The personal, firsthand experience of riding public transportation will enable legislators to gain real world perspectives and inputs in aid of legislation,” Abayon said in his bill’s explanatory note. But there are exceptions, including those with physical handicap or serious medical conditions. The President, Vice President, the Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court may also be exempted for security reasons. “However, these particular constitutional officials may voluntarily set aside the exception” provided they are accompanied by a personal security team under terms determined by the Presidential Security Group and the Philippine National Police, it adds.  No punitive provisions The bill, however, has no punitive provisions, meaning there are no consequences for noncompliance. In his explanatory note, Abayon said public service “requires empathy and concerns for the people being served.” “Public service improves when it is rendered with empathy and compassion. Public service requires living modestly and does not mean entitlement to perks such as business-class and first-class accommodations with airlines,” he said. ‘Publicity gimmick’ Transport and commuter groups assailed the bill. “It’s just a publicity gimmick. What we need is for the government to come up with more good transport programs, such as having a publicly owned, efficient modern mass transport system,” said George San Mateo, president of Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide. Maricor Akol, president of the National Center for Commuters’ Safety and Protection, noted government officials needed security. Their battalion of aides and security would just cram an already packed transport system and elbow out the legitimate commuters. —With a report from Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/980009/koko-to-ltfrb-ensure-entry-of-new-tnvs-when-uber-exits-pimentel-ltfrb-senate-news-grab-tnvs","title":"Koko to LTFRB: Ensure entry of new TNVS when Uber exits","date":"12:21 PM April 04, 2018","snippet":"Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III asked the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to fast-track the entry of other transport network vehicle service (TNVS) players to ensure that Grab would not monopolize the ride-hailing industry in the country.","body":"Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III asked the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to fast-track the entry of other transport network vehicle service (TNVS) players to ensure that Grab would not monopolize the ride-hailing industry in the country. “There is a legitimate fear among regular TNVS users that Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s operations in the country will lead to higher fares, which is the natural consequence when a player monopolizes a particular industry,” Pimentel said in a statement on Wednesday.  Singapore-based Grab has acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber’s last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. The senator noted that many TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride but this option, he said, would no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9.  Thus, Pimentel said, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB “to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry.” “The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,” he said.  READ: After Grab-Uber merger, LTFRB says 3 new TNVS to enter PH He said the LTFRB should strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country’s TNVS guidelines. “We need real competition, not potential competition,” said the Senate president. “As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service—and this is where the LTFRB must come in.” Pimentel also called on the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. “Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. They should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” he further said. /jpv"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/69017/less-cars-metro-manila-roads-people-use-ridesharing-app-study-uber-ride-sharing-app-commuting","title":"Fewer cars on Metro Manila roads if people use ridesharing app—study","date":"03:58 PM November 09, 2017","snippet":"Metro Manila would have a million less cars on the road during peak hours if a significant number of consumers use the ridesharing applications instead of taking individual cars, according to a survey commissioned by Uber.","body":"Metro Manila would have a million less cars on the road during peak hours if a significant number of consumers use the ridesharing applications instead of taking individual cars, according to a survey commissioned by Uber. This is according to the “Unlocking Cities” report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global management consulting firm, which conducted the survey in 10 cities in Southeast Asia including Metro Manila. The results were made public Thursday.  In essence, the report wants to assess the potential benefit of ridesharing in key Asian cities, namely: Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Surabaya, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Manila. One of the findings of the report pointed to a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road during peak hours. Peak hours were pegged at 7 to 9 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.  To come up with an estimate, BCG said it quantified the number of vehicles that could be taken off the road in a scenario where the most widely privately owned vehicles were substituted by ridesharing. “In cities where private cars make up the majority of private transport, between 40 percent to 60 percent can be removed,” the report said, noting that this would be the case if ridesharing became the third, if not the second, most popular mode of transportation.  The BCG survey took place from September to October this year, covering approximately 300 commuters per city. This was around the same time Uber Philippines went back online after a spat with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board (LTFRB), which sanctioned the transport network company for accepting new driver applications in spite of a government directive urging against it. The study covered ridesharing in general, which includes pooling and non-pooling. Among other benefits, the study said ridesharing could also convince a good number of people not to own cars anymore. According to Uber Philippines General Manager Laurence Cua, the company’s Uber Pool option — wherein rides are shared among people with common routes or destinations — accounts for 40 percent of their trips on average. He did not clarify, however, whether or not this is on a daily or monthly basis. Since being introduced over a year ago, the demand for Uber Pool has been growing, he said, without giving more specific figures. “The demand is continuous there. We were surprised with the adoption (of Uber Pool) that a lot of people were actually willing to share (a car) with other riders,” he said.  Uber is present in Metro Manila and Cebu, he said. He said Uber is also exploring other options, such as penetrating the market in Pampanga. /jpv RELATED STORY Uber says growth strong as it gives a peek at earnings"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1011002/news-uber-ride-sharing-gender-discrimination","title":"Source: Uber facing probe into alleged gender discrimination","date":"08:23 AM July 17, 2018","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO, United States — Uber is facing a U.S. government investigation into allegations that the ride-hailing service set up a pay structure that discriminated against its female workers.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, United States — Uber is facing a U.S. government investigation into allegations that the ride-hailing service set up a pay structure that discriminated against its female workers. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission opened the probe in August 2017, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The person insisted on not being identified because the inquiry is considered confidential.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the ongoing investigation. The EEOC declined to comment Monday. Uber said it has already revamped its compensation practices and introduced other measures designed to ensure its male and female employees are treated fairly.  Some of the changes have been rolled out since Uber hired Dara Khosrowshahi as its CEO in September 2017, shortly after the EEOC opened its probe. Since his arrival, Khosrowshahi has been focused on cleaning up Uber’s corporate culture poisoned by a pattern of sexual harassment and other abuses that included a yearlong cover-up of a major computer break-in and the use of duplicitous software to thwart government regulators. The incidents have cast a cloud over Uber while it has been battling fiercer competition from its biggest U.S. rival, Lyft, and trying to reverse its long history of huge losses as it prepares to sell its stock on the public markets for the first time next year.  If the EEOC finds Uber broke the law by paying women differently than men for the performing the same jobs, the agency could slap fines on the company as punishment. San Francisco-based Uber already has paid $245 million in stock to self-driving car pioneer Waymo to settle allegations that it stole technology from the Google spin-off to help build a fleet of self-driving cars. In separate development Monday, the Federal Trade Commission began mailing out nearly $20 million that Uber agreed to pay last year to settle claims that the ride-hailing service misled some U.S. drivers about their earning potential and vehicle financing costs. More than 88,000 drivers will receive an average of about $223. News of the EEOC’s probe into alleged gender discrimination comes a week after Uber’s top personnel executive, Liane Hornsey, abruptly stepped down. A wide range of technology companies have been grappling with complaints of gender and racial discrimination while trying to diversify workforces consisting mostly of white and Asian men, especially in the highest-paying jobs. Uber’s latest diversity report disclosed that women make up 38 percent of its worldwide workforce. That number does not include people driving for the service. The U.S. Labor Department last year publicly accused Google of shortchanging its female employees for doing the same work as men, but those allegations haven’t resulted in any action against the company. Google has adamantly denied paying its female workers differently than their male counterparts. /cbb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/905563/uberboat-launches-on-the-croatian-coast","title":"UberBOAT launches on the Croatian coast","date":"10:00 PM June 14, 2017","snippet":"Users of the ride-sharing and private driver app heading to Croatia this summer will be able to island-hop with Uber’s on-demand boat service UberBOAT, connecting coastal destinations in the country.","body":"Users of the ride-sharing and private driver app heading to Croatia this summer will be able to island-hop with Uber’s on-demand boat service UberBOAT, connecting coastal destinations in the country.

Travelers will be able to share the ride with other tourists to split the cost of the journey between Split (or Divulje, where the nearest airport is located) and the famous island of Hvar. The reverse journey is also possible. The transfer costs €352 (a little less than $400) for eight people or €440 (roughly $500) for 12 people.  As well as offering speedboat connections, Uber will be trying its hand at tourist services with boat trips. Vacationers will be able to book full or half day trips to visit the coast from Hvar, Dubrovnik or Split. Average pricing will be €980 (around $1100) for eight people for a day trip.

In “Unlocking Cities,” the Boston Consulting Group, which transport network company Uber commissioned, said government plans to increase the capacity of rail-based public transport services “will not be sufficient to meet growth in transport demand” over the next five years.  The study looks into the impact of ride-sharing in Southeast Asia. It pointed out that mega cities like Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi and Surabaya — considered “Tier 3” cities — were “at risk of reaching standstill levels of congestion during peak hours by 2022” because of the rate of vehicle growth.  This meant that by then cars would run at less than 10 kilometers per hour (kph). These cities have relatively undeveloped public transport networks or rely heavily on informal road-based transport networks.  “Tier 3 cities have ambitious plans to expand transport networks. However, roll-out will require considerable time and funding,” the study said. It said “ride-sharing adoption of between 16 and 40 percent across these cities is needed in conjunction with public transport to maintain congestion levels today.” To help ease road congestion, the Department of Transportation has rolled out projects like the Light Rail Transit 1 (LRT 1) extension and Metro Rail Transit 7, as well as plans to build the first Mega Manila subway. In 2016, there were more than 2.4 million vehicles registered in Metro Manila, of which close to 1.5 million were private cars, according to the Land Transportation Office. As of October, vehicle sales had grown by 16 percent from more than 292,000 units last year to close to 340,000 units, said the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. and the Truck Manufacturers Association.  The surge in the number of vehicles on the road comes as Edsa, Metro Manila’s busiest thoroughfare, is already well beyond its carrying capacity of 6,000 vehicles per hour per direction. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said that to date, around 7,500 vehicles are using Edsa per hour per direction. The study, conducted from September to October and covering around 300 commuters per city, warned that congestion may become unmanageable in cities such as Manila because “80 percent of commuters surveyed indicate plans to purchase a car in the next five years.” It noted, however, that these commuters expressed willingness to forgo buying cars if ride-sharing could meet their transport requirements on price, timeliness and availability. “Across the cities studied, we estimate [around] 40 to 70 percent of private vehicles on the road today could be removed, if ride-share becomes a viable substitute for private vehicle ownership,” the study said. Earlier, the MMDA presented the possibility of implementing a carpooling system on Edsa to reduce the number of cars using the major highway. Uber’s study estimates that road congestion during peak hours may be reduced by up to “88 percent” should carpooling be highly adopted in Manila. The MMDA pointed out though that it was still discussing with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board how the measure could be best implemented since this may lead to the proliferation of “colorum” cars. Officials are also wary that this may result in the illegal jockey industry, which was seen in Jakarta when it implemented the 3-in-1 carpool policy."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/771517/moa-allows-grab-to-operate-at-naia","title":"MOA allows Grab to operate at Naia","date":"12:11 AM March 08, 2016","snippet":"GRAB, a regional ridesharing platform, will start serving passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) next week.","body":"GRAB, a regional ridesharing platform, will start serving passengers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) next week.

The development marks the opening of the Naia terminals to popular ridesharing platforms which allow passengers to book rides in taxi cabs and private cars using their smartphones. The Philippines was the first country in the world to release regulations covering ride-sharing, legitimizing the business amid protests by traditional taxi operators. These rules, however, left it to MIAA to decide whether or not to allow ridesharing operations at the four Naia terminals.  “MIAA wanted to keep track of the vehicles picking up passengers, as well as the identity of the drivers,” Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chair Winston Ginez said in an interview on Monday. He added that there were also discussions with Grab’s rival, Uber “but the talks between Grab and MIAA were more advanced.”  Grab has been aggressively expanding in the country, either through new areas or product lines.

The model works for items that are costly to buy and own, and widely owned by people who do not make full use of them. Cars and bedrooms have become the most common examples.

In Metro Manila, it has become the preferred choice of tech-savvy commuters who see it as a safer and more reliable alternative to taxis. It gained wide attention last year when the Land Transport Franchising and Regulatory Board began cracking down on Uber car drivers, for supposedly providing transport services illegally. The concept behind Uber, as in other “sharing economy” business models, is an appealing one: Anyone who can share the use of his/her car can readily hire it out to someone needing a ride, using the app. Member owners/drivers are screened by Uber, while both users and drivers may rate each other so that they can see who have good or not-so-good records as drivers or passengers. Airbnb (Air Bed & Breakfast), a platform by which people can rent out space in their homes for short-term stays, now has over 1.5 million listings in 34,000 cities and 190 countries. I know many who are avid users, and are able to save significantly over normally much higher costs of comparable hotel accommodations. There is the added bonus of a wider choice of locations and facilities to suit a traveler’s particular needs and tastes. Like in Uber, renters can rate the facilities they hire, while owners can also rate their customers, helping provide information to both sides that could minimize their risks of dissatisfaction. Founded in August 2008, Airbnb has gone well beyond simply renting out air beds and shared spaces that it started with, on to a wide variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, castles, boats, manors, tree houses, tepees, igloos, private islands and other properties.  Uber and Airbnb are but two of a growing field of Internet platforms that have turned the concept of sharing into a profitable business model. Apart from the “sharing economy” tag, other terms are used to describe the arrangement, such as “access economy,” “collaborative consumption” and the more technical “peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.” Such models offer a number of benefits, both to individuals and to society as a whole. For one thing, it is argued to promote greater inclusiveness through improved access to goods for people who otherwise can’t afford buying them. Proponents also cite increased independence, flexibility and self-reliance for both consumers and providers. For example, it has been cited that homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage after losing their jobs to recession have been able to save their homes with incomes due to Airbnb rentals. Economists recognize how it promotes greater and wider competition through decentralization and removal of entry-barriers. Development advocates like the way it enhances stronger communities and increased participatory democracy. And environmentalists welcome how it helps reduce adverse environmental impacts, save costs through borrowing and recycling, and promote more sustainable consumption and production patterns in cities worldwide.  But there are downsides as well. The taxi and hotel industries are obviously aggrieved by the surge in popularity of Uber and Airbnb, and one must worry about the welfare of workers in these industries as well. In Metro Manila, it is suspected that the “Uber phenomenon” may be contributing to already bad traffic congestion. I’ve heard of an instance when a friend who tapped into the app was surprised to find that more than 200 Uber cars were within reach of his office in Makati. Because it has turned out to be so lucrative (some report earning tens of thousands of pesos a month from one car), enterprising Filipinos have been purchasing fleets of cars with the sole intent of operating them with hired drivers via Uber—a departure from its original concept of ride-sharing. There is also concern that the dominant firms, while promoting more competition within the products of which they facilitate the sharing, are themselves becoming dominant monopolies as tech platforms in their respective areas. As first movers, they have managed to leverage that advantage into massive financing running into tens of billions of dollars, which in turn can scare away potential competitors. It is thus time for an appropriate legal framework that will maximize and widen the benefits of the sharing economy, while providing necessary safeguards to protect overall public interest. * * * cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/90784/the-sharing-economy","title":"The ‘sharing economy’","date":"12:22 AM December 01, 2015","snippet":"YOU MAY have seen that post in social media that says: “The world’s largest transport service company owns no vehicles; the world’s largest accommodation provider owns no real estate…” The “transport company” referred to is Uber, and the “accommodation provider” is Airbnb.

For one thing, it is argued to promote greater inclusiveness through improved access to goods for people who otherwise can’t afford buying them. Proponents also cite increased independence, flexibility and self-reliance for both consumers and providers. For example, it has been cited that homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage after losing their jobs to recession have been able to save their homes with incomes due to Airbnb rentals. Economists recognize how it promotes greater and wider competition through decentralization and removal of entry-barriers. Development advocates like the way it enhances stronger communities and increased participatory democracy. And environmentalists welcome how it helps reduce adverse environmental impacts, save costs through borrowing and recycling, and promote more sustainable consumption and production patterns in cities worldwide.  But there are downsides as well. The taxi and hotel industries are obviously aggrieved by the surge in popularity of Uber and Airbnb, and one must worry about the welfare of workers in these industries as well. In Metro Manila, it is suspected that the “Uber phenomenon” may be contributing to already bad traffic congestion. I’ve heard of an instance when a friend who tapped into the app was surprised to find that more than 200 Uber cars were within reach of his office in Makati. Because it has turned out to be so lucrative (some report earning tens of thousands of pesos a month from one car), enterprising Filipinos have been purchasing fleets of cars with the sole intent of operating them with hired drivers via Uber—a departure from its original concept of ride-sharing. There is also concern that the dominant firms, while promoting more competition within the products of which they facilitate the sharing, are themselves becoming dominant monopolies as tech platforms in their respective areas. As first movers, they have managed to leverage that advantage into massive financing running into tens of billions of dollars, which in turn can scare away potential competitors. It is thus time for an appropriate legal framework that will maximize and widen the benefits of the sharing economy, while providing necessary safeguards to protect overall public interest. * * * cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/233826/grab-secure-historic-2-5-b-investment","title":"Grab out to secure historic $2.5-B investment","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings.","body":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings. The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand. China’s Tencent Holdings Lte is said to have invested over US$100mil in Go-Jek."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/297177/rocky-road-ahead-for-sharing-economy-platforms-amid-pandemic","title":"Rocky road ahead for ‘sharing economy’ platforms amid pandemic","date":"11:50 AM May 13, 2020","snippet":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit.","body":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit. These companies are now bleeding more cash than ever, shedding workers and scaling back expectations for profitability amid heightened uncertainty about consumer trends and the economic outlook.  The sharing platforms had “tremendous momentum” in industries like transport and tourism and even apparel-sharing prior to the pandemic, said consumer markets analyst Steve Barr of PwC, which had previously predicted the sharing economy to generate $335 billion in revenue by 2025. “I think there’s going to be a very significant shift in consumer behavior,” Barr said.  One factor could be a move away from urbanization in dense cities — a major force driving the sharing economy. That could dampen the sharing economy “lifestyle” that had been building for people who opted to shun ownership, Barr noted.  Uber said in its quarterly update that it lost nearly $3 billion and its rides business was down some 80 percent in April, prompting cuts to 14 percent of staff. The rideshare giant said it has seen some “green shoots” in the recent weeks and is seeing strong revenue growth for its food delivery operation UberEats. However, an IBM survey released this month found more than half of those who used ridesharing apps planned to reduce or stop using these services completely. “Riders are to continue to have a strong aversion to getting in a vehicle with a stranger for fear of infection which will not be allayed until there is a vaccine,” said analyst Richard Windsor on his Radio Free Mobile blog. Arun Sundararajan, a New York University professor who researches the sharing economy, said he nonetheless sees some room for optimism for ride-hailing firms.  “I think we’ll see a shift to greater personal space control,” Sundararajan said. “A lot of people will move away from mass transit in densely populated areas.” This could bring more business to ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber or to “micromobility” platforms for bicycles and scooters, which the two companies also offer. The researcher said, however, that it may take more time to see a rebound for “pool” rides with multiple passengers, and that the health crisis might slow the trend in which people give up their personal vehicles for shared rides. Leading home-sharing platform Airbnb has cut 25 percent of its staff with the travel industry crushed, with some estimates of bookings down 50 percent from earlier this year. Sundararajan says things may not be so bleak for Airbnb, which has over the years learned to build consumer trust and allow people to host or stay with strangers. The startup has already unveiled a new sanitary protocol and guidelines on leaving spaces vacant between bookings. “As people start to travel again, they will be oriented toward spaces where they feel they have control,” he said. “They may not want to pass through crowded hotel lobbies or stay in places where they don’t know who was there before.” He said Airbnb might be better positioned than some hotel operators “because it doesn’t rely on an extremely high rate of occupancy to make its business model work.” As in other sectors, the sharing economy firms will need to rebuild consumer trust to get consumers back. Sundararajan said these firms have an advantage because they have been working for years on helping change consumer habits. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The platforms are better-situated to deal with this uncertainty and rebuilding trust because that’s what they’ve been doing for a decade,” he said. But behavioral economist Lucas Coffman of Boston College said trust can be difficult, pointing to the “reputational” system of rating developed by online platforms. “You also need to trust everyone who rode in your seat before you,” Coffman said. Some segments of the sharing economy may emerge stronger, PwC’s Barr says, such as corporate jets or high-end black car rides. “Safety is going to be the new experience,” he said. Saif Benjaafar, director of the University of Minnesota’s Initiative on the Sharing Economy, said the platforms have been part of a lifestyle trend to on-demand, collaborative services that are extending to new areas such as medicine and education. “There has been a shift in the traditional way of delivering products and services, and I think that will continue,” Benjaafar said. “I think people are getting used to the idea of going to an app and getting things whenever they need it.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

The ride-hailing giant launched “comfort” rides in dozens of cities Tuesday. Riders are guaranteed 36 inches of legroom in “newer” cars — meaning those that are under five years old — and they can request a preferred air temperature. Riders can also use the app to tell drivers they don’t want to chat, avoiding what some consider an awkward exchange.  Uber is responding to requests from business travelers and others who say they just want to work or rest quietly when they’re on their way to the airport. “It’s a way to set up an expectation up front…it takes some guess work out of the process,” said Aydin Ghajar, senior product manager at Uber.   In the early days of ride-hailing, when drivers for Uber and its main U.S. rival Lyft began picking up riders in their personal cars, riders were often chatty, asking the drivers lots of questions.  “It was so new and innovative that a lot of people were curious about other things they (drivers) did,” said Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, a blog and online community for drivers. “Over the years, it’s gotten more transactional.” Uber rolled out a “quiet mode” for Uber Black — its premium car service — in May, which left some drivers feeling like robots. “Some drivers like it, they don’t want to have to look at social cues,” Campbell said. “Other drivers feel that it’s a little dehumanizing…I do feel like in our society, everything is turning into an app, and we’re losing the lost art of conversation.” Comfort rides cost 20% to 40% more for time and distance charges than standard Uber X rides. The move could help Uber boost revenue, which could nudge the company closer to profitability.  “I think it would help maybe to boost those numbers up a little bit and maybe give some of the analysts on Wall Street something more to hang their hat on to remain bullish on the stock, based on the fact that the company still is not profitable,” said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust Company. Uber has yet to turn a profit and lost $1 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Executives have said it could take years to make money. It’s unknown whether the benefits offered by Uber Comfort will be enough to convince riders to cough up more cash. A five-year-old car is not really “newer,” it’s more “middle aged,” said Morgan. And at 6 feet, 5 inches tall, the additional legroom wouldn’t really be enough for Morgan — but it might be sufficient for people who are average height, he said. “They might try it once and see if it’s that much more of an improvement and worth it,” Morgan said. “If they can’t deliver it and it’s not that much more comfortable, then it’s like well, I’m not really going to pay up for it.” Uber declined to provide an average age for its drivers’ cars, and said age requirements for vehicles vary by city. Uber’s smaller rival Lyft offers “Lyft Lux” rides, which are in high-end sedans or SUVs with leather seats and more legroom. Lux cars are driven by drivers with a 4.85-star rating or above, and cost more than a standard Lyft ride or the company’s less-expensive Shared ride. But riders do not have the option of requesting a quiet, conversation-free ride. Uber already has some premium products that cost more than the basic Uber X. For example, Uber Black includes high-end cars driven by professional drivers and offers a “quiet mode.” Families or groups of six can choose Uber XL to get a van or SUV. Uber Select connects riders with highly rated drivers. On the other end of the spectrum, Uber Pool is the cheapest option, but riders have to share the car with passengers going to other destinations. Uber says its Uber Black product will generally cost more than Uber Comfort, but specific pricing will vary by city. Drivers who qualify for can make about 20% more on an Uber Comfort ride than Uber X ride, said Uber spokesman Steve Imm. But some drivers earned less during an Uber Comfort pilot, because their cars qualified for the pricier Uber Select or Uber XL options, and they couldn’t easily opt out of the Uber Comfort option, Campbell said. Drivers will now be able to opt out of Uber Comfort using the app, Imm said."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/60050/millennials-dont-identify-online-identity-risks-says-study","title":"Millennials don’t identify online identity risks, says study","date":"04:05 PM March 19, 2017","snippet":"A SureID study conducted at this year’s SXSW finds that 18-to-37-year-olds place a premium on time and this could leave them exposed online, particularly when using sharing economy services.","body":"A SureID study conducted at this year’s SXSW finds that 18-to-37-year-olds place a premium on time and this could leave them exposed online, particularly when using sharing economy services. When asked, 79 percent of respondents said that they would be less likely to buy from someone, whether on- or offline, if that person couldn’t prove their identity. However, when questioned about two of the main foundations of the growing gig economy—ride sharing and food delivery services—91 percent of those polled over the course of the event said that they presumed the person they’re interacting with has already been vetted and their identity verified by a third party.  “Technology is enabling us to interact perhaps too comfortably with strangers for modern conveniences. These findings point out the growing demand for people in the gig economy to prove they are who they say they are, to create a higher level of trust,” said Justin Oberman, vice president of identity strategy at SureID. In June, SureID polled regular dating site and ride-share service users and found that 88 percent of dating app users want a way of independently verifying the identity of the person they could soon be dating.

The development comes as the Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board begins regulating ride-sharing apps and as competition with one of its biggest rivals, Uber, heats up.  In a statement, GrabTaxi said on Thursday that the money was raised from global investors such as US-based Coatue Management, L.L.C., China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp. and Didi Kuaidi, “apart from support from existing shareholders.” This brings GrabTaxi’s total funding to about $700 million, making it one of the best funded startups in Southeast Asia.  GrabTaxi launched in Manila in July 2013 and later expanded into Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod and Baguio. It is also present in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. GrabTaxi said the money would be used to further develop its technology offering as it continues to invest in expanding its engineering offices.  GrabTaxi also plans to expand its private hire vehicle booking service, GrabCar, to as many as two more major cities in the Philippines this year, Natasha Bautista, head of Grabcar in the Philippines, said in a previous interview. Figures provided by the company showed that GrabTaxi operates across six countries, with 101,000 registered drivers serving about 10 booking per second in Southeast Asia. “We exist to solve the region’s transportation challenges. Diversifying into private cars and motorbikes has allowed us to touch people of varying income levels and commuting needs. We are the only app in the region that has such an extensive network and range of transportation choices,” Tan said in the statement. GrabTaxi has diversified its offerings beyond taxis to include private cars and motorbikes. GrabCar is a private hire vehicle service available in all countries where GrabTaxi is available. GrabExpress is an on-demand, same-day delivery service that is currently available in Manila. Both GrabCar and GrabExpress are available through the same GrabTaxi mobile app."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/86608/ubers-rocky-road-to-global-powerhouse","title":"Uber’s rocky road to global powerhouse","date":"06:27 PM May 12, 2019","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber, which made its stock market debut in one of the largest technology share offerings, has become a disruptive force in local transportation and generated its share of controversies.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber, which made its stock market debut in one of the largest technology share offerings, has become a disruptive force in local transportation and generated its share of controversies. A Paris idea  The history offered by Uber is that the plan for app-based rides came about in Paris in December 2008, when founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp could not find a taxi and hatched the idea of summoning a ride with the push of a button. They launched UberCab in July 2010, later shortening the name to Uber, with the first ride the following year in San Francisco.  By 2014, Uber was present in 100 cities and began its “Uber Pool,” allowing customers to share rides. Today it has operations in 700 cities in 65 countries, having booked more than 10 billion rides.  Kalanick was the chief executive until mid-2017 when he was forced out amid a series of scandals on workplace harassment, cutthroat business practices and other ethical lapses, which hurt the image of the company as it was preparing to go public. Taking over, Dara Khosrowshahi from the travel website Expedia sought to clean up Uber’s image, settling lawsuits including one accusing the company of stealing secrets on autonomous driving technology from former Google car unit Waymo. Bumps in the road Uber has faced protests in multiple countries by taxi drivers who claim its unregulated business model represents unfair competition. Some regulators have limited or banned Uber as well. It has been banned in Bulgaria, Hungary and Denmark and earlier this year pulled out of the Catalonia region of Spain in the face of government restrictions.  Uber stopped some services in Paris in 2016 in the face of violent protests and is operating on a provisional license in London amid legal challenges. In the United States, Uber has faced litigation and protests in New York and challenges from drivers seeking to be classified as employees with benefits instead of independent contractors. This week thousands of drivers turned off their apps in many cities, seeking improved revenue sharing and other changes. The company suspended its self-driving car project in early 2018 when an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Path to profits While Uber has become a large company, its path to profitability remains uncertain. Its losses continue to pile up despite taking in some $11 billion in revenue last year. But Uber sees a future beyond simple ridesharing. It wants to be an all-encompassing solution for transportation with autonomous cars, electric bikes and scooters to solve the “last mile” problem and help move consumers away from car ownership. It also operates the Uber Eats food delivery service and Uber Freight, and is even looking at “flying taxis.” Uber claims it wants to be the “Amazon of transportation,” evoking the model of the e-commerce firm which took many years to achieve consistent profitability and now dominates several sectors."}]}
