In a statement on Tuesday, Grab said it would work with merchant-partners and the government “to find an effective way to provide 20 percent discount to senior citizens” for food purchased on its platform. “Grab is committed to providing meaningful service and everyday value to our kababayans,” Grab said. Under the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, a 20 percent discount applies to delivery orders subject to certain conditions such as providing their senior identification card number while on the phone and presenting their senior citizen ID card upon delivery. Last week, Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera called for a congressional inquiry on the failure of food delivery platforms to honor the 20 percent discount for senior citizens. Herrera cited a number of complaints from senior citizens who could not avail of the 20 percent discount using platforms such as Grab, Food Panda, among others.

This commitment was made as the government, through the Task Force Zero Hunger and alongside its partners in the private sector and other non-profit organizations, launched the \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" (PKG), a multi-sectoral anti-hunger initiative, which aimed at addressing involuntary hunger and food security in the Philippines on Monday. Margot Torres, private sector lead for the PKG movement, said the private sector has responded to the government's call for joint initiatives to end malnutrition and hunger being experienced by some Filipinos in different parts of the country. Torres said the private sector has translated the \"key responsibility areas\" of the National Food Policy into frameworks that can serve as a \"springboard\" for synergized initiatives and communication to end hunger issues among Filipinos. She said the PKG movement will be functional into four \"A\" frameworks: --Availability relates to food production by improving the productivity and income of the farmers and fisherfolk. It will also ensure a resilient food system. --Accessibility relates to distribution as well as ensuring 100 percent access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round. --Adequacy addresses hidden hunger with the vision of ending malnutrition experienced by children under five years old as well as pregnant women and lactating mothers. --Assistance that addresses hunger and ensures a resilient food system during crisis periods such as the current pandemic or natural disasters. \"While the long-term goal is to end hunger by 2030, we have set an immediate realistic goal of uplifting one million Filipinos from hunger and malnutrition by 2022,\" Torres said. She said the PKG programs will be pushed through in the priority areas with the highest poverty and malnutrition incidence. The Task Force Zero Hunger has identified 32 priority areas while the private sector has identified 17 more areas in 49 provinces nationwide. \"As the multisectoral collaboration continues, we have mapped out where in the Philippines there are existing programs to guide us in synergizing our efforts for both the present as well as the future,\" she said. Torres said they are targeting to include the public and partake in the PKG movement as she invited them to join the \"Lahat kasali, lahat kasalo\" initiative. \"We are preparing a consumer campaign and this will really invite the public to also participate even as low as 20 or 25 pesos to feed a hungry child so we're in the works,” she said. Torres noted that the campaign is set to be launched by April this year. Zero hunger movement Meanwhile, Task Force Zero Hunger chairperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said resolving issues on involuntary hunger in the country is a \"collective responsibility\" among the general public, the government, and the private sector. \"[It is] an imperative for all of us—the government needs the help of the private sector and other stakeholders to achieve our shared goals for zero hunger in the country,\" he said. Under the national food policy, Nograles said various programs and projects are lined-up to assist the food producers to sustain their livelihoods. The PKG movement also targets to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children by 2030 with the involvement of promoting breastfeeding and providing nutritious meals for every household.

These are consistent with the Zero Hunger roadmap outlined in the National Food Policy unveiled by TFZH last month. PKG's initial projects include the following: -- Farmer assistance: With the end in view of elevating farming as a dignified and sustainable profession, these projects aim to increase farmer income by as much as 20 percent within the year, and to double farmer productivity by 2025 via the expansion of value chain projects and logistics improvements. -- Sustainable nutrition programs: Projects that will collectively work to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children across all households by 2030 via a strategy that involves campaigns to promote proper breastfeeding, address malnutrition, and roll out nutritious meals for Filipino households. -- Disaster response: Private sector companies will work to revolutionize their disaster response in close partnership and coordination with the attached national agencies and local government units to streamline the private sector’s efforts to facilitate a prepared, synchronized, and targeted action flow for food security when crises strike. -- Food banking: This effort involves the initiation of food surplus assessments among food manufacturers, restaurants, supermarkets, and public markets in Metro Manila, with the food surplus from donors eventually allocated for distribution to those in need. To promote these projects, to raise awareness regarding hunger, and to invite companies and organizations to join PKG programs, PKG is set to launch a public information campaign, the details of which will be accessible at pilipinaskontragutom.com.

It will also assist PDEA in the investigation on reports on suspected delivery packages, design mechanisms where the items for delivery are properly recorded and visible to the driver.

In an announcement, Grab said the service, currently at its beta phase, is available on its smartphone application and would allow users to purchase grocery items and other dry goods from its partner establishments, while other products such as medicines will soon be offered as well. “GrabMart is one of the few app-based grocery services that offers on-demand delivery, which means orders are expected to be delivered as early as 30 minutes or within a few hours,” Grab said. During its beta phase, purchasing through the service would cost the total price of goods, plus a delivery fee at a minimum of PHP89 to a maximum of PHP149, and a flat rate of PHP30 per order. Fees may change after the beta phase of the program, Grab said. The service is available in select areas of Quezon City, Pasig, Manila, Mandaluyong, Makati, San Juan, Valenzuela, Parañaque, and Taguig, and will soon be expanded in the coming weeks to cater to more locations within Metro Manila. Its retail partners include Robinsons Supermarket, Great Deals E-commerce Corporation, FamilyMart, Starbucks at Home, ASSI Fresh Plaza, Fetch! Naturals, Dog City, and Barcino. RJ Cabaluna, Grab country marketing head, said the service was launched to help provide necessities, as well as livelihood for its delivery-partners and continued income for businesses, during the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon. “With the launch of GrabMart, we are hoping to further serve Filipinos during this trying time,” Cabaluna said. Similar to its GrabFood and GrabExpress service, Grab said that cash payment is still available but encouraged its users to avail of cashless payment through GrabPay.

The driver, the first confirmed Covid-19 case in the province, has reportedly transported passengers to and from Manila to Angeles City, and other areas in Pampanga. Mayor Carmelo Lazatin Jr. cited on Saturday the need for everyone’s cooperation and support to contain the spread of the highly contagious disease. Lazatin said he asked the Grab officials to back-trace passengers who may have been exposed. “This is not the time to think of their business,” Lazatin added. He also appealed to passengers who rode the said vehicle to report to the city government for monitoring and assistance. Meanwhile, Grab Philippines, in a statement said, that they will be working closely with the health and local government officials to assist in the necessary contact tracing to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have a team on standby to immediately respond to and support DOH’s [Department of Health] contact tracing efforts and identify the close contacts of the infected individual,” it said. Grab also said it has already provided the DOH with the incident report. “As the incident report includes the personal details of our driver and his passengers, it is imperative that we comply with DOH instructions as the authorized agency responsible for contact tracing, and limit the sharing of personal information to protect the individual’s privacy,” the statement said. However, given the urgency of the situation, the Grab said they “carefully decided to provide the needed information to Mayor Lazatin and the local government, so they can initiate the contact tracing.” Meanwhile, Grab said their driver-partner will receive medical and financial support from the company and will disinfect the vehicle.

As part of such measures, he said the company previously sent out a warning to such users and gave them until February 22 to correctly update their information. “Those who have failed to correctly update their profile have been suspended from the platform. Last 2019, we have already suspended more than 351,000 fake, incomplete, and invalid accounts from the platform,” the statement read. Most recently, he said Grab has suspended a total of 856 accounts as of February of this year due to the same violations. “The anti-fraud team has been continuously identifying multiple accounts that were created and being used by the same user. These initiatives have deterred users who use the platform with ill, fraudulent, and malicious intent,” the statement read. He said aside from violations in relation to fraudulent names, the company also flag users who frequently cancel rides and do not show up to claim food orders for possible account suspension. “This behavior is resulting in loss of opportunities and resources for our driver and delivery-partners,” the statement read. He said users who regularly provide low-ratings to drivers and delivery partners without a reason can also be flagged for possible account suspension. “Low-ratings provided to drivers- and delivery-partners can be disputed by especially if these low-ratings do not include specifics and actionable insights,” the statement said.

The passenger selfie verification, it said, was also being rolled out in other countries, especially in the Southeast Asian market, while audio and video recording were also being tested in select locations. Grab also said its new safety features, meant “solely for purposes of maintaining the safety and security of platform users, and to assist law enforcement on investigations,” follow existing rules on lawful processing of data. However, the NPC, in its recent statement, said Grab has failed to sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by its new safety measures to the rights and freedoms of its passengers. “Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account,” the NPC said in its privacy impact assessment of Grab’s new measures. Among other issues mentioned by the NPC were Grab’s failure to inform its passengers that the photo, audio, and video files collected by the new systems would be released to police authorities upon request in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint, and failing to mention its legal basis in processing collected data. It added that while there was an option for Grab passengers to withdraw consent for in-vehicle audio and video recording, the details on how to do so were “not sufficiently communicated to passengers.” “It was also unclear if and how the data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,” the NPC said. In the first half of January, Grab began a pilot run of in-vehicle audio and video recording in 180 of its GrabCar vehicles as a safety measure for both its drivers and passengers.

The NPC said the firm explained that the materials taken through the three data processing systems will be released upon the request of police authorities should dispute, conflict, and complaint arise. However, Grab did not put this information through its privacy notice and policy, it said. “The company also failed to mention its legal basis in processing the collected data.

The privacy body further said the CDO is not a punishment for Grab but will give an opportunity to the company to achieve full compliance to the DPA. “While this Commission believes that the security of passengers and drivers is a primordial concern, their privacy rights must not be disregarded.

Stella Quimbo on Wednesday said Grab would continue to monopolize the ride-hailing market if transport authorities do not allow the entry of motorcycle taxi operators. In a statement, Grab said Quimbo’s statement revealed that on-demand and platform-based motorcycle taxis were “effectively competing” with Grab, as withdrawing motorcycle taxis would limit consumer choices on transportation. “It is in the same spirit that we respectfully seek the PCC to review the basis for defining the competitive market in which ride-hailing services operate,” Grab said in a statement. It said the ride-hailing competitive market could also be broadened to include street-hailing transportation such as taxis. “Right now, what we hope for is to review the basis for defining the competitive market and that would include motorcycle taxis and taxis as well,” Grab said. It said the voluntary commitments (VC) made by Grab with the PCC to improve service quality, pricing and transparency following its acquisition of then competitor Uber, were “totally different” from their call to review the definition of the ride-hailing market. “We cannot right away apply for release from VCs because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release. That’s why we need the PCC to clarify the definition of competitive market,” Grab said. Earlier, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said Grab could be released from its VCs if the company proves that its services were substitutable with motorcycle taxis and that the substitute or competitor has acquired a certain percentage or threshold in the market. He added that once motorcycle taxis were established as a public utility vehicle, Grab would then have to prove whether four-wheeled vehicles such as Grab’s would be substitutable with two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycle taxis.

In a petition dated January 6 filed before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 223, Angkas asked for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the new rider cap, apprehension of “excess riders”, and to exclude its two competitors in the pilot program. In a statement, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran noted that Angkas was “telling a lie” when it said it was open to competition and would no longer object to guidelines imposed in the program by the TWG. “Dito natin makikita na doble-kara ang Angkas.

On Wednesday, George Royeca, head of Angkas’ regulatory and public affairs, apologized for the company’s previous actions and assured its cooperation for the success of the pilot program. The DOTr said Angkas previously assured that it would no longer object to Section 10 or the imposition of a cap on riders of the revised guidelines of the pilot run of the TWG and was open to competition from other transport groups. Royeca’s apology came after TWG officials issued a warning against Angkas after the company was found to have made violations that could result in it being \"blacklisted\" when the TWG submits its findings and recommendations to Congress for the legalization of motorcycles as taxis. These violations include the illicit operation of Angkas riders in Cagayan de Oro City and the alleged “99.9 percent” ownership of Angkas by Singaporean national Angeline Tham.

Yap noted that the “unfair and unjustified” pricing of Grab has been discovered during two separate monitoring periods last year. He said Grab must honor its commitment to meet the price cap, as he echoed the woes of Filipinos for its unreasonable pricing. “Sabi nila kung hindi mo kaya magbayad, huwag ka na lang mag-book ng Grab.

He explained that promoting competition would prevent monopoly, but letting other ride-hailing service companies to enter the market must be thoroughly studied by Congress to avoid its possible contribution to traffic congestion.

The fines, he said, were imposed after Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from its prices before its buyout of rival Uber. The allowable deviation or increase in prices was set to 22 percent from levels before Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing market, which meant Grab constantly exceeded its allowable price-hike since the buyout, and was fined based on how much it breached its agreement with the PCC.

These include commitments to prevent exclusive membership or registration of drivers or operators to Grab, monitoring of incentives to drivers/operators, and provision of licensing and regulatory support. Grab’s service quality commitments, meanwhile, will be effective for one year from Nov. 1, 2019 and would help ensure that Grab drivers would not discriminate against passengers through the removal of the “see destination” feature for drivers with a completion rate below 65 percent for the first quarter and 70 percent for the remaining quarters. For price-related commitments, which would also be effective for one year, Balisacan further said these include a fare transparency commitment and a system-wide average fare cap to limit the average fare increase to 22.5 percent in most months. He added each violation will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach, not including a disgorgement mechanism wherein Grab will refund its commissions in excess of the system-wide average fare cap per month. “We hope that with the commitments set out in the extended undertaking, the riding public will be protected from the threat of monopolistic behavior,” Balisacan said.

In a statement, Grab highlighted the modernization efforts of Valenzuela City through its 3S Plus Online Services which include the Paspas Permit that would enable business permit applicants to receive their provisionary permits in seconds following confirmation of payment through an online portal. During the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the two parties on Tuesday, Mayor Rexlon “Rex” Gatchalian said the Paspas Permit project will officially launch on November 12, coinciding with the city's founding anniversary. Grab president Brian Cu said Valenzuela City’s embrace of technology and innovation makes it an “equitable and reliable partner to help build Metro Manila’s first smart city.” “Valenzuela is one of the LGUs (local government units) in the country that we deeply admire as they are embracing and adopting technology to provide their constituents efficient and meaningful public service,” Cu said. Once a provisionary permit is received by the applicant, Grab enters the transaction through their on-demand courier service Grab Express which would deliver the actual business plates right at the applicant’s doorsteps. “This is where Grab comes in. As we all know, Grab has made on-demand delivery of parcels faster, and this partnership is a great compliment to our 3S Plus Online Services,” Gatchalian said. The process effectively eliminates the need for a business permit applicant to visit and line up at the city hall, Grab said. Grab also announced the collaboration with the city government in building a “hyper-localized mapping system of Valenzuela City” which would enable accurate and efficient bookings of services offered by Grab in its mobile app. The ride-sharing company added that Grab and the city government will also share relevant data on the updated base map or satellite imagery of Valenzuela City in compliance with Philippine data privacy laws.

During the launch at the L’ Fisher Hotel, GrabFood Philippines head EJ de la Vega said after rolling out Grab’s transport services here in 2015, they are now taking on “the challenge of improving access to great food and bringing more livelihood opportunities for the people of Bacolod.” De la Vega added that the local culinary scene and homegrown restaurants banner GrabFood’s delivery service. “Bacolod’s great culinary scene has developed locals to be discerning eaters. As such, GrabFood has partnered with a variety of merchants to cater to a diverse range of pallets,” he said.

In a statement, Grab belied crash victim Karen Graneta's claims that she did not receive any financial aid from the firm. Grab said the case involving Graneta was pending in court. It clarified that a check worth PHP160,000 was issued to Graneta's family, specifically to her uncle, a certain Roel Capuno. The company said its chief of drivers’ services personally went to the University of Santo Tomas Hospital a day after the accident to see Graneta’s family and asked them about their needs. “At the time, Ms. Graneta’s family acknowledged that it was not the fault of the GrabCar driver, who also sustained injuries due to the accident,” the statement read. During the second visit of a Grab representative, Capuno was designated by the family to transact with Grab and was later given the check named to and personally received by him. “The family’s biggest concern at that time was the hospital expenses,” Grab said. Aside from providing financial aid, Grab said they also assisted the victim’s family in the processing of insurance claims as part of the company’s protocol. However, the family failed to comply with the requirements of the insurance claim. “Ms. Graneta’s family expressed interest to claim insurance benefits but were not able to submit the documents required for the processing of insurance claims,” Grab said. To express their willingness to extend support “above and beyond” what is necessary, Grab said they have also engaged additional third-party insurance since the accident — on top of the government-required insurance. On Wednesday, Graneta narrated the events of the 2016 collision that killed her friend, during a hearing by the Senate Committee on Public Services on the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Graneta and a friend were aboard a Grab car in full-stop at the Nagtahan (Mabini) bridge on Sept. 27, 2016, when a truck crashed into them from behind, causing their car to surge forward and hit another truck in front. Graneta recalled that they were trapped inside the vehicle for almost an hour. She was hospitalized for six months and her hospital bills amounted to PHP3 million.

In a Twitter post, Gatchalian said aside from the bill, he has also filed a resolution to investigate the incident. The senator said Grab should provide the money for purchasing goods ordered by their customers instead of its delivery partners. Verifying the legitimacy of buyers was also needed, Gatchalian said, noting that even fast-food giant McDonald’s asks for legitimate landline numbers to validate orders. He added that cashless payments must be encouraged to help ease, if not eliminate, the risk in their GrabFood delivery service. On Saturday, GrabFood released a statement on the said incident and initial investigation showed that the delivery-partner did not incur personal losses or needed to pay with his cash as the order was paid in a cashless transaction. “The cashless payment capability is currently available in select merchants and is being tested as a solution to limit the need for our delivery-partners to carry cash or working capital,” Grab said. Language differences and miscommunication between the delivery-partner and the customer were found to be the source of the failed transaction. “After waiting for more than 20 minutes at the drop-off point, the delivery-partner proceeded to treat the transaction as a no-show,” Grab said. However, Grab said their no-show and reimbursement policy was not followed by their delivery-partner which prescribed the drinks to be surrendered immediately to Grab. Afterwards, the customer tried to claim the drinks but was too late. The company added that they have reimbursed the customer and compensated the driver for his time and effort. Grab also reminded its GrabFood drivers that unclaimed orders are fully-reimbursed by the company. “We also encourage our customers to review their orders and ensure accuracy of delivery details before placing an order,” Grab said.

Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, said Grab, as the “leading super app,” aims to continue its innovation, use “technology for good” and improve quality of life through transportation, logistics, and lifestyle services. “Grab has introduced a bunch of new services, and existing services have in fact grown multiple folds since we did this earlier this year. So, we’d like to share those updates with you and really tell you the story of how Grab has grown into your everyday ‘Super App’ here in Southeast Asia,” Cu said during a media townhall in Makati City. Through a partnership with Toni & Guy, an international chain of hairdressing salons, and L’Oreal, a global leader in beauty products, Grab would bring hair salon services right at the doorsteps of its users. Customers would be able to choose featured haircuts and hair color services and need only book these services at least two hours in advance. To supplement its current GrabExpress service which currently gives same-day delivery to its users in limited areas such as within Metro Manila, Grab partnered with Ninja Van to extend its package delivery range nationwide. Martin Cu, head of Ninja Van in the Philippines said their company has a network of 9,000 riders which covers 95 percent of the country’s population and would give GrabExpress users, especially those with small and medium enterprises (SMEs), cheaper nationwide deliveries, bulk pick-up of up to 30 parcels at once, and next-day scheduled pickup. “Grab and Ninja Van’s shared vision is to be the game changers in the logistics segments. We are committed to creating solutions that will enable millions of SMEs to scale their businesses and afford Filipinos the ability to easily reach their loved ones across the Philippines,” Cu said. In October, Grab users can expect to see a new “Videos” tile in their app made possible through a partnership with video-on-demand company HOOQ, giving users access to over 8,000 Hollywood titles, local series, and free-to-air content. Through efforts initiated in 2018 and now fully realized, the Grab app currently lets its users book hotel rooms and other services online, made possible in partnership with Booking Holdings Inc. which operates both hotels booking websites Agoda and Booking.com. Last July, Grab launched its Bus Marketplace in-app feature which allows users to purchase bus tickets initially limited to point-to-point operations by Tas Trans and San Agustin which includes Glorietta 2 to Nuvali and Glorietta 2 to Southmall routes. In September, Bus Marketplace will be expanded to include bus routes servicing Olongapo to Clark, Clark to Dagupan and Makati to Noveleta, Cavite (and vice versa) routes. To compete with other online and mobile payment services vying for a place in the country’s growing digital market, Grab bolstered its GrabPay service through a partnership with PLDT Group and SM Investments Corp. SM malls would soon allow GrabPay users to skip regular lanes and use the malls’ ‘Express Lanes’ in SM Cinemas, and ‘Prestige Lanes’ in SM Markets and give these users double GrabReward points in every purchase. Through PLDT Global Corp. (PGC), overseas Filipino workers in Singapore and Malaysia will be able to purchase PGC Free Bee Voice Buckets which lets its users make international voice calls.

The ridesharing company is set to appear before a hearing of the Board set on June 11. “The LTFRB regularly sends a report to Grab containing the list of drivers who apply for LTFRB accreditation. Drivers who do not apply at all for a Certificate of Public Convenience should have already been deactivated by Grab per LTFRB order issued months ago,” the LTFRB said in a statement. There are more than 5,000 unclaimed PAs issued by the LTFRB. Earlier, Grab said it deactivated the drivers in compliance with the June 7 deadline set by the LTFRB for the application of 20,000 TNVS units, which was opened last December. The company assured its riders that the inconvenience would be temporary as it anticipates new drivers to apply for 10,000 new slots starting June 10.

The move was in compliance with the directive of the LTFRB to suspend the fees following its meeting with Grab and other TNCs on Tuesday. The Board has created a technical working group (TWG) composed of representatives from different TNCs to discuss passenger and driver cancellation policies. Grab implemented last April 29 a PHP50 cancellation fee that will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after five minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within five minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they force passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. The ridesharing firm said the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. The policy was implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed within this month. “We wish to clarify that while Grab has announced the intended implementation of passenger cancellation fees this month, no fees have yet been charged or collected, since actual implementation of the policy was set to start next week,” Hosaka said. Grab assured that it will continue to provide further updates as discussions with the LTFRB progress.

Jimenez is optimistic that the voters’ participation will be encouraging specifically with their partnership with the private company. “There is room to believe to be cautiously optimistic that we will have higher turns out than expected and in addition to that, of course the activation of voters when they ride Grab vehicles through this voter education campaign will drive up that number even more,” Jimenez said. “Marami sa mga botante na nagdedesisyon lamang na bumoto sila on election day (There will be a lot of people who will decide to vote on election day),\" Jimenez added. Comelec data shows that the voter turnout in the 2010 polls was 74 percent while it was 77 percent in the 2013 election.

A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of 5 cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they forced passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations.

The firm assured that it will refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours, when reported via their in-app Help Centre. The new policy will be implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed by the end of May. “We will be implementing this initially to the first 10 percent of the riders and drivers with its full implementation set by end May.

PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said the commission was able to monitor violations of Grab with its pricing commitments over the period from August 10 to November 10 last year. “The monitoring team of the PCC found that there were certain inconsistencies and inaccuracies with the data that was provided as it relates to the price monitoring commitment. Suffice it to say that this prevented the monitor and the PCC monitoring team from carrying out its review of the pricing commitments in an effective way, which results in an unbiased and credible outcome. In that sense, we’ve thought that reviewing the undertaking of Grab, this ran counter to specific procedures of that undertaking,” Bernabe said. The PCC has approved the acquisition of Uber by Grab on Aug. 10, 2018 following the submission of the voluntary commitments by the ride-hailing company. Its voluntary commitments include the improvement of the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates, which existed before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall likewise not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares that are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments on a quarterly basis for a period of one year. The commission also slapped a PHP16-million penalty on Grab last October for violating the interim measures it has imposed during the review period of their deal with Uber. Meanwhile, Grab said it will file a motion for reconsideration against the fine imposed by the PCC. In its statement, the firm said it wants to determine the rationale for PCC to impose the maximum penalty. “We assure our passengers that we are charging fares within the range as allowed by the LTFRB,” Grab said in the statement. The PCC issued the fine against Grab last January 22 with the company receiving the notice on January 23.

The mayor said the city government had earlier reached out to Grab Philippines, convincing the company to bring the Grab Trike service here. Binalonan is the third local government to partner with Grab service after Pampanga province and Balanga in Bataan province. “This is advantageous to both tricycle drivers and passengers. Anywhere you are, you can book a ride. For the driver, he can have a passenger anytime. Grab Trike Binalonan operates 24/7, meaning a passenger is assured of a tricycle ride anytime of the day,” Guico said. “Just like a ‘Grab Taxi’, the fare is fixed and it is up to the passenger if he wants to give a tip.” He dispelled rumors that the new system would deprive other TODA tricycles of their livelihood, clarifying it is one way of increasing their income. They are welcome to register, he added.

Grab completed the transaction legally, and did not violate the interim measures order,” Lawyer Miguel Aguila, Grab's counsel, said in a statement. The ridesharing firm reiterated that its transaction with Uber was done in a legal manner and did not violate the PCC’s orders particularly the maintenance of independent operations and other conditions such as platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, among others, prior to the merger on March 25. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and drivers’ data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” Aguila added. He said Uber’s acquisition of an equity stake and board seat in the company was consummated prior to the issuance of the interim measures order. “The interim measures should be interpreted to apply prospectively and should not cover acts already consummated before its issuance,” Aguila said. He said Grab's fares and surge rates are within the minimum allowed fares set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Grab’s price algorithm, until the LTFRB suspended the time component in its fares, remained the same. The supposed increase in price was affected by the higher incidence of surge, which was driven by the low supply of vehicles and high concentration of demand,” Aguila said.

The parties have until October 29 within which to file their MR,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a text message to the Philippine News Agency (PNA). PCC, in its decision issued on October 11, imposed a fine of PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review and another PHP4-million fine for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period. Uber was also imposed a fine of PHP4 million for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review. The commission said both Uber and Grab violated two of its seven-interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction.

Cu said the company will be implementing a surge cap for as low as 1.4 times the fare rate to enable their riders to plan out their trips during the Christmas season. He said the company will also continue to provide promos to its riders for them to avail of lower fares, while performance-based incentives will be given to drivers based on higher acceptance rates of rides, lower cancellation rates and consistently following traffic rules, among others. To date, Grab implements a surge cap of 1.6x from the previous 2x after its PHP2-per-minute charge was reinstated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board last September. The ride-hailing firm said the lower surge rate seeks to help passengers adjust their transportation costs. Meanwhile, the PCC has approved last August Grab’s acquisition of erstwhile corporate rival Uber’s operations in the country after it has submitted its voluntary commitments which include improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints. Grab has committed that its fares will not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares set by the LTFRB. The deviation should not be more than 22 percent of the fares before Uber’s acquisition. The company also assured that it will provide a breakdown of fares on electronic receipts to its riders. The receipts will include the distance, fare surges, discounts, promo reduction, and per-minute waiting charge.

The anti-trust watchdog said the non-compliance of both companies has prejudiced its review process and impeded their ability to impose remedies for the benefit of the riding public. “This would include an order for them to revert to their pre-merger condition. We asked Uber to come back to the market and operate independently of Grab,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo said in a press briefing held in Makati City on Wednesday. “Given the challenges, it was really just more difficult to complete the review process. We required more information, we required more analysis, we required more meetings with the parties which would not have occurred if they were able to return to the pre-merger conditions,” she added. The fines imposed against Uber and Grab are broken down as follows: PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; PHP4 million against Uber for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; and PHP4 million for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period In its resolution issued last Oct. 11, the PCC said Uber and Grab violated two of its seven interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction. The commission has approved the acquisition deal between Uber and Grab last August 10. This was made after Grab has submitted its voluntary commitments to the PCC which includes improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares, which are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board.

Grab will also remove the “see destination” feature for drivers with low ride acceptance rate. It will not introduce policies that will result in drivers and operators being exclusive to Grab, to allow them to register with other ridesharing companies through a multi-homing scheme.

In the same decision, the Board, however, noted that the PHP10-million penalty against Grab still stands.

LTFRB’s decision to open 10,000 new vehicle slots is a step in the right direction towards resolving the current lack of supply on the road but it’s not going to be enough. Replacing the inactive vehicles in the masterlist would be an additional measure that could go a long way in improving TNC service,” Leo Gonzales, Grab Public Affairs Head, said in a statement Tuesday. Currently, Grab receives an average of 600,000 passenger bookings daily but only 35,000 drivers are on the road to address the demand. Its allocation rate for ride bookings in Metro Manila is at 40 percent, which is the lowest in the Southeast Asian region. “Supply is struggling to meet the massive demand from the riding public and only the LTFRB has the authority to address this,” Gonzales said. “We urgently request the LTFRB to replace inactive vehicles with active vehicles ready to serve the riding public. We also appeal to the LTFRB to increase the common supply base to 80,000 vehicles (equivalent to 65,000 active vehicles) and review the demand quarterly consistent with their earlier pronouncements.

The Board has started accepting the on-line registration of TNVS applications for new certificates of public convenience (CPC) not included in the master list through the LTFRB website on August 24. It has likewise ordered all TNVS units included in the master list provided by transportation network companies to submit their applications and to secure the necessary provisional authority on or before August 31. The Board has noted that there were fewer applications for new CPCs for TNVS despite its order for the resumption of their acceptance last March.

The scheme allows vehicles with two or more occupants with driver to traverse in Edsa from North Avenue in Quezon City to Magallanes in Makati City on both northbound and southbound directions from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. during weekdays. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the agency respects the view of the senators, who cited that it was crafted without consultation with various sectors and this might lead to heavy vehicular volume on alternate routes. “We respect the resolution. What we are trying to do is to convene the Metro Manila Council hopefully soon,” Garcia said in a TV interview Thursday. The MMC is the policy-making body of MMDA, consisting of the mayors of the 16 cities and a municipality in Metro Manila. Senate Resolution No. 845 urges the MMC and the MMDA to suspend the HOV scheme and look for long-term solutions to ease traffic in Metro Manila. The resolution pointed out that the driver-only ban would effectively deprive thousands of people of the use of the country’s major thoroughfare since it would be in effect during the working and commuting hours of the week. Garcia said traffic has eased in Edsa during the first day of the dry-run Wednesday. “Lumuwag ang Edsa. Napunta yung traffic sa mga alternate routes (Traffic eased on Edsa and was diverted to alternate routes),” he added. He reiterated that the scheme aims to encourage carpooling among motorists and is one of the short-term measures being implemented by the MMDA to improve the traffic situation in the metropolis. “HOV is not a band aid solution; it’s a short term measure while infrastructure projects are being constructed for the long term,” Garcia said. Data from the MMDA show that a total of 2,905 vehicles were monitored to have violated the HOV scheme through closed circuit television cameras under the no contact apprehension policy and handheld cameras of its enforcers on the ground Thursday morning. A total of 3,628 violators were flagged down during the first day of the dry-run on Wednesday.

Around 60-70 percent of vehicles that pass along Edsa have only single occupants, according to data from the MMDA.

He assured Grab's drivers and operators that they “will do (their) best to also make it work here.” The MMDA had proposed the HOVL last year to reduce vehicular volume along Edsa. Vehicles with at least two or more passengers were allowed to pass through Edsa using the fifth and leftmost lanes. A dry-run was conducted in December last year to test the feasibility of the scheme but the MMDA later decided to cancel its implementation as its traffic enforcers were having difficulty inspecting heavily-tinted vehicles.

The DOTr has issued DO 2018-013 last June authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. DO 2017-11 which was issued by the department on June 19, 2017 allows TNCs to have a pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB. “Any issuance by this Honorable Board which would ultimately determine the fare that may be charged by TNCs and TNVS should only be applied prospectively and should not prejudice respondent for relying on a valid and subsisting DO 2015-011,” according to Grab. The company further said that it has informed the Board of its fare structure which includes the per-minute charge. “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,\" the firm further said. MyTaxi.PH is the registered company of Grab in the country. The LTFRB said in its order that the fine shall be reimbursed through rebates that will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier. The amount of the rebate is limited to the portion of the income of Grab which is directly related to the PHP2-per minute charge during the period of its imposition. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any per minute rate when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flag down rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges.

The Zambales Mayors’ League (ZML), headed by its president and San Antonio Mayor Estela Antipolo, believes the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) expansion plan would result in more employment opportunities and community development for the province. “On the part of the Mayors’ League, we are here to support SBMA’s programs,” San Felipe town Mayor Carolyn Fariñas said during their meeting Thursday with SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma. “We are really excited to hear SBMA Chairman Eisma’s pronouncements that she is moving to expand the area and jurisdiction of the Subic Freeport. We can see that she is seriously working to put more businesses further up north in Zambales,” Fariñas said. Aside from Antipolo and Fariñas, other mayors who were present during the meeting were Jay Khonghun of Subic town; Jose Angelo Dominguez of Castillejos; Elvis Soria, San Marcelino; La Rainne Abad-Sarmiento, San Narciso; Joycelyn Apostol, Cabangan; Bing Maniquiz-Jeresano, Botolan; Rundy Ebdane, Iba; Napoleon Edquid, Candelaria; and Luisito Marty of Santa Cruz. Meanwhile, Eisma urged the Zambales mayors to take advantage of the Freeport’s development impetus and asked them to start identifying areas that may be suitable for the expansion program. She said that Subic faces brighter prospects than ever and that current developments like its emergence as a new cruise ship destination in Asia, are bringing more livelihood opportunities to local communities. The SBMA chief noted that the number of investors in the Freeport had grown to 1,587 in the first quarter of 2018 from 1,355 in the same period last year. The new investors that the SBMA signed in this first quarter, she added, have committed investments worth PHP866 million, which is 80 percent higher than the PHP480 million recorded in the same period in 2017. Eisma said, however, that because of lack of space in the former Subic military base where the Freeport is located, the SBMA could hardly accept any more investment proposals for major projects. “A lot of investors are really looking for bigger locations. And I’m serious about it— please don’t dawdle on this expansion offer. We have to do this now because the next official might not have the same inclination as we do,” she told the mayors. Eisma explained that any local government unit can nominate land for development as Freeport expansion area. With favorable resolutions approved by the Sangguniang Bayan, a memorandum of agreement will be signed by the municipality and the SBMA, granting the latter the right to take over the administration and regulations of the area. The SBMA will then market the area to investors. Fariñas said the ZML is committed to preparing their areas for a successful expansion program, noting that it will bring more jobs and community development in the entire Zambales. She and the other mayors also thanked Eisma for inviting transport service provider Grab Philippines to enter Zambales, saying this will help provide an effective, efficient and tourist-friendly transportation service that may further boost local tourism, a growing industry in Zambales province. “We share (Eisma’s) vision about 'malasakit', of a greater community helping each other as leaders, we intend to give a better quality of life to our people. And these things are a big boost to our efforts in accomplishing this mission,” Fariñas said.

This as Grab plans to appeal the decision of the LTFRB, maintaining that an order of the Department of Transportation allows TNCs to set their own fare rates subject to the oversight of the Board. “We will stick on the majority rule na may paglabag doon sa pag-impose nila ng PHP2-per minute (there was a violation when they imposed the PHP2-per minute),\" LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launching of the implementation of the Pantawid Pasada Program for jeepney operators and drivers Thursday afternoon. Grab may be able to file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days upon issuance of the order and may appeal to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) in case this was denied, according to the LTFRB. In its statement, the ride-hailing firm said that the per minute charge was in accordance with Department Order 2015-011 and that this is still valid. “This DO is valid despite the position of the LTFRB to the contrary. LTFRB has no authority to declare DOTr order invalid. Only the courts, not LTFRB can rule on the validity of an order especially one issued by DOTr which has direct supervision and control over the LTFRB,” Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said. “There is no basis for the fine being imposed by LTFRB. We disagree with the Board’s decision and we will file an appeal to protect the ridesharing industry in the country,” he added. Grab also said the per minute fare was also part of the presentation and discussions during its technical working group meeting with the LTFRB on July 2017 and that the LTFRB Chairman was also informed of the fare structure. “We likewise received an e-mail response from the Office of the Chairman. No concerns were raised by the Board at that time,” it said. However, Delgra said an e-mail response from his office cannot be seen as approval of the fare structure. “The Board is going to decide as to whether we are going to grant a fare increase or not. It’s the Board who’s going to decide, and that’s basically what happened to the taxi fare, to the PUJ,” he said. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges. In its order dated July 9, the LTFRB said the rebates will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier.

The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The DOTr has issued an order last June 11, authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. This will ensure that the TNCs will comply with policies, laws, and regulations as the DOTr recognizes their role in providing transport services to the public.

In her dissenting opinion dated last July 9, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the per-minute charge was imposed before the Department of Transportation (DOTr) issued Department Order No. 2017-011 or the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines for Public Utility Vehicles on June 19, 2017. The order authorizes the LTFRB to determine the fare structure of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). “Facts would show that the basis of the respondent in prescribing the per-minute charge was Department Order No. 2015-011. Additionally, the assailed PHP2-per-minute charge was communicated to the Board, through the Office of the Chairman. Emphasis is made that the PHP2 per-minute charge was set when Department Order No. 2015-011 was not yet amended,” Lizada said. The Board order fines Grab PHP10 million for overcharging and to reimburse the per-minute charge through future ride bookings of its passengers. “Thus, in the imposition of any administrative sanction, the Board must only do the same after the effectivity of Department Order No. 2017-011. Said issuance should be applied prospectively and not retroactively. However, if after thorough evaluation and investigation, respondent will still impose the per-minute charge after the effectivity of the said Department Order, then and only then can the Board impose the appropriate penalty. Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,” she added. Grab has reiterated that the PHP2-per-minute travel charge is legal, adding that it is deliberating on its next legal moves regarding the LTFRB order. “But no matter how we decide to move forward from this, be assured, Grab will stay,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement posted on his Facebook page.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said.

The LTFRB has approved the accreditations of ride-hailing firms Hype Transport Systems Inc., Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc., Go Lag, Owto and MiCab Systems Corporation following the halt of the operations of Uber as a result of its acquisition by Grab last month. According to Grab, the Board has approved the fare structures of these new TNCs allowing them to impose per minute charges to their riders. The suspension will enable drivers and operators belonging to the common supply base which was imposed by the LTFRB to transfer to other TNCs as they are allowed to impose per minute charges, the firm said. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” its petition read. The firm also said that the filing of a motion for reconsideration will render the LTFRB’s suspension order not executory. \"Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,\" Grab said.

This will go a very long way in terms of making a difference in performing the duties of our traffic enforcers. This is very important. Thank you very much. Let's continue to help each other for the good of Metro Manila,” said Lim during the turn-over ceremony. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the donation would be a big boost to the agency’s operation, particularly in going after erring motorists on the road. “This will show transparency in our jobs because there will be evidence of the apprehension through video recording. These cameras will serve as protection ng traffic enforcers and also of the motorists,” Garcia said. He said that the donation will not in any way protect erring Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers under Grab should they commit any traffic violation. “There is no such order. These donated body cameras will show transparency. These gadgets will somehow protect our traffic enforcers who would be harassed or verbally abused. For motorists, there will be evidence if the traffic enforcers ask for bribes,” said Garcia. He said the body cameras will be issued to traffic enforcers manning Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) and chokepoint areas in the metropolis after undergoing training. “We are giving warning to all motorists who violate a traffic regulation, do not attempt to bribe our traffic personnel. If you know you are wrong, then just let the traffic enforcer give you a citation ticket,\" said Garcia. He said the agency hopes to procure more body cameras for other traffic enforcers in the future but it cannot be easily done due to budget constraints. For his part, Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Grab Philippines Public Affairs head, expressed optimism that the body cameras would help the agency in managing traffic in the metropolis. “We are one with the MMDA. They need eyes on the road. They need to be visible during any apprehension or any part of their work to dispel any questionable transactions between the parties,\" Gonzales said. The body camera, which costs PHP9,000 each, can be used all throughout the day as they have 10 to 12 hours battery life.

This, as Grab has reiterated its commitment to work with transport regulators on replenishing the supply of drivers in response to increasing demand from its passengers. “Our immediate priority is to work with regulators to onboard the 6,000 displaced drivers who are not part of the LTFRB masterlist. We are continuously working with government agencies to find a long-term solution on the supply issue,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a statement. To address the situation, Grab is regularly releasing incentives to increase driver productivity by at least 15 percent per day. The firm also encourages its riders to utilize the Grab Share feature on its mobile app to share its available cars to fellow passengers and to save on fuel costs. Passengers may also use GrabCar’s Multi-Stop feature for multiple destinations instead of booking separately. “We also seek our passengers to plan their trips and book ahead of time,” Toh said. Grab currently receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests each day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve the riding public. The overflow in demand and severe undersupply of cars has resulted in longer waiting times for passengers or not getting allocated a vehicle according to the ridesharing firm. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has imposed a common supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units in Metro Manila. The LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap of TNVS units.

For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a press conference in Makati City on Tuesday. “When Uber was implementing it, there was friction between drivers in terms of connecting. We are reviewing that and will be rolling it out as soon as we have the solution,” Toh added. Uber used to charge a fee on riders who cancel trips, which they will have to pay on their next trip, before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted last April due to its acquisition by Grab. Grab is imposing a maximum cancellation of one trip per day as part of incentives for its drivers. Currently, its drivers cancel 8 percent of their trips while passengers cancel 12 percent of their rides. The ridesharing company seeks to reduce the rate of driver cancellation by 4 percent, and passenger cancellation by 6 percent under its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and welfare, provide better ride experience, and upgrade customer support. Under the initiative, Grab will enhance the performance incentives it offers to drivers to motivate them to provide quality services to its riders. Top performing drivers will be rewarded based on their number of rides, high rating, and good feedback from passengers. Grab is also considering to implement a breakdown on its fares to ensure transparency of its operations. “We are working already a breakdown of the fare on the receipt. I have a team that is working on revising the receipt that you get. On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers traveled. That is already a work in progress,” Toh said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the campaign. “We just have tech constraints. We will be rolling it out. Our target is this will also be implemented within the 100 days,” she said. Grab implemented the masking of passenger destinations last April 27, which was initially rolled out to 25 percent of Grab drivers with historically low acceptance rate. It has also activated an auto-accept feature that will automatically allocate trips to drivers allowing a more seamless experience in continuously accepting passenger requests. Grab has maintained that the main reason for the difficulty in booking a ride is the lack of cars, resulting in low supply. The company is appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to increase the supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle service units in Metro Manila. Grab said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. The suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles, leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides according to the firm.

We've seen people posting about driver cancellations, their rude behavior, all of this we see and we know that it's been a very difficult time for the people that we are serving,\" she added. To improve driver behavior, Grab will implement an improved Driver Code of Conduct (COC), a set of updated rules and regulations that will stipulate the tasks and traits of a responsible Grab driver-partner. Drivers must comply with the COC for them to continue access to the Grab app. A Driver Academy will also be established that will provide modules on road courtesy, customer service and data privacy and social media handling on top of driver onboarding and rehabilitation training services. Grab drivers will also be qualified for perks such as discounted gas prices, driver lounge and maintenance discounts under the company’s rewards program. Passenger will be able to expect a new app interface for iOS and Android by July. The new app will enable them to easily set their pick-up points and quickly select their preferred service. Rewards will also be categorized for easier selection and redemption of offers. Grab is urging its riders to utilize the Help Center to report their concerns as well as their location issues particularly pick-up and drop off points. The ride-hailing firm will also partner with a BPO company to upgrade its customer service team which will be operational by July. Dedicated service lines for passengers, drivers and platinum users will allow easier access to after-ride services. “We hope that with these new improvements, our driver-partners will continue to be good and responsible members of the TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) community and enablers of better journeys,” Toh said. “Our aim is to be our passengers’ partner for better trips at all times.

Grab said the suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides. “Driver numbers continue to drop as uncertainty in maintaining sustainable livelihood increases. With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs. If we will subtract something from the pool, we will replenish,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination, everyone is working on the fly. It is still too early to set rigid rules on a technology that is still being tested first by its newness vis-a-vis the owners, drivers, passengers, and competition,” she added. The LTFRB has imposed a common supply cap of 65,000 TNVS units for TNCs in Metro Manila. It has also approved the accreditation of Hype, Hirna, Go Lag, Owto, and Micab as new TNCs.

Calalang said that Grab transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units were issued certificates of public convenience (CPC) and provisional authority (PA) by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which means that the TNVS are performing a public service. \"If a TNVS driver cancels at least 24 accepted bookings in a day, that is an average of one cancellation per hour and that I believe is enough information and reason to conclude that driver is reneging on its commitment to perform the public service authority it got from LTFRB,\" he said.

Grab said its driver cancellation rate doubled to 11 percent last Friday. This was primarily caused by lower fares, resulting in the firm being able to service only half of the passenger demand. “Drivers have to buy gas, pay the monthly amortization for the vehicle or the daily boundary, and when traffic stalls them, it is only the PHP2 per minute that saves their income. So with the PHP2 gone, many of our drivers earn less and drive less, if at all. No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them have resorted to cancelling booking especially when they know they will traverse traffic,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. Cu said 80 percent of the travel duration charge goes to the driver directly, while 20 percent is spent on driver incentives and rider promos. Last Friday, Grab filed a motion for reconsideration before the LTFRB, explaining that the PHP2 per minute travel charge is legal and in accordance with a 2015 order of the Department of Transportation that allows transportation network companies to set their own fare rates. Drivers will not earn a sustainable income and would be forced to quit their jobs as transport network vehicle services operators if the PHP2-per-minute charge is stopped, resulting in fewer vehicles for passengers, according to Grab. The firm had presented its fare structure including the PHP2-per-minute charge, in a technical working group meeting with the LTFRB in July 2017, after imposing the charge the previous month. Cu hopes that the LTFRB reinstates the travel time fare as this will benefit both drivers and passengers. “Let’s face it: kapag lugi ang driver, hindi lalabas yan. Walang masasakyan ang tao (Let's face it : if the driver is not earning, he will not drive. Commuters would have no rides),” he said.

Department Order 2015-11 states that transportation network companies (TNCs) can set their own rates subject to oversight of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in cases of shortage of electric power or other sources of energy; strikes; civil disorders or other cause of an abnormal disruption of the market which results in the declaration of a state of emergency by the President. Aguila said Grab decided to impose the PHP2 per minute charge to ensure sustainable income for its drivers. Eighty percent of the charge goes directly to the drivers as part of their earnings while 20 percent is remitted to Grab which is reinvested as driver incentives and passenger promos. “What is important is for drivers to have sustainable livelihood in order to provide services to commuters,” Aguila said. Grab has also lowered its surge price cap from 2x to 1.5x in compliance with the order of the LTFRB.

There is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the \"upfront price\" or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip which includes the computation for the travel duration charge. \"The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors are charged and it's fixed,\" Cu said.

In June 2017, Grab, upon review of its pricing structure, initiated per minute pricing of pesos. This was integrated to the existing per km (kilometer) charges and is not added to the upfront fares,” Grab Philippines Public Affairs Head Leo Gonzales said in a statement Wednesday.“The per minute charges were implemented to ensure that despite serious congestion issues on the road on a daily basis, hardworking TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) drivers would have a greater chance of making ends meet and supporting their needs,” he added.Grab has presented its business model; supply and demand models; and pricing structure in a meeting with the LTFRB on July 2017.“Per minute charges remain part and parcel to Grab’s fare structure today and we have continuously been transparent about this truth, in fact, during times when questions were raised about fares in certain trips, we would always back compute and provide the basic formula for the same including the per minute charges,” according to Gonzales.Meantime, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Partylist Rep.

The Board wants to ensure that the fares would be acceptable to transport vehicle services (TNVS) operators who would transfer to Grab’s platform as a result of the acquisition of Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia. “This is to ensure that the fares will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” LTFRB Board member Aileen Lizada said during a hearing Wednesday. This amends LTFRB’s order that sets the surge price rate of TNCs at twice the normal fare. The Board is also giving Uber until April 15 to operate. “The soonest possible time that you will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC (Philippine Competition Commission), the better. Therefore, in the interest of all TNVS and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” Lizada said. For its part, Grab said it would comply with the LTFRB’s order to decrease its surge rates. “We respect the Board’s decision to further lower the surge cap and we understand the justification for it.

In a statement, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho Nograles claimed that Grab does not even issue a receipt with the specific breakdown of all its charges, which deprives its consumers of knowing about the hidden fees and thus leads to overcharging. Nograles earlier revealed that Grab has been \"illegally charging\" its customers PHP2 per minute of travel time, contrary to the company's claim that they have no hidden per-minute charges. He said Grab should refund its customers some PHP1.8 billion for overcharging in the past five months alone. The PHP2 per minute additional charge is on top of its flag-down rate of PHP40 and charge of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer. \"Grabbers are being taken for a ride by Grab Philippines. All along we all thought that Grab rates are based on approved rates and we are not being charged extra for our travel time,\" Nograles said. \"So obviously Grab doesn't want us to know that we are being charged extra and that is against the law. That is against the provisions of our existing consumer laws particularly Republic Act 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines,\" he added. Nograles, a principal author of the proposed Transport Network Services law, said providers of goods and services are required by law not just to issue official receipts but also a detailed breakdown of what were paid for. He said he would file a resolution calling for a congressional probe on the issue once sessions resume in May. Nograles recounted his commuting experience using Grab from his house in Makati to his office in Congress in Quezon City wherein the ride-hailing service failed to immediately provide him with a breakdown of his fare receipt. He noted that he had to use his position as Congressman to ask for the breakdown and it had to be handled by Grab's Public Affairs head Manager Leo Gonzales. \"Had I been an ordinary citizen with no position in government, these people could probably have just ignored me and that would have been the end of the story,\" he said. Based on the detailed fare breakdown, on top of the approved fare of PHP11 per kilometer which amounted to PHP246.98 for the 22.25 kilometer travel distance, Nograles was charged an extra PHP118 for 59 minutes of travel time at PHP2 per minute and another PHP40 for the base fare equivalent to the taxi's flag-down rate. The total fare for Nograles' trip was PHP404.98. \"This means that the claim and publication of Grab that they don't charge per minute is a brutal lie. High tech ang panloloko at systematic pa (The deception is high-tech as well as systemic),\" he said. \"By the time you get a Grab, the fare computations that was shown on our Grab app which looks like a fixed rate already contains the per-minute charge,\" he added.

Grab believes that this measure increases the transaction costs of the parties, contrary to the spirit and rationale of interim measures. Grab intends to discuss this matter with the PCC,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on 25 March and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure. In the spirit of cooperating with the PCC, Grab has also agreed to continue to bear the costs of the Uber app extension (from March 25 to April 8) until April 15, 2018. Our understanding from the PCC is that this interim arrangement, which was fully explained to the PCC, is not a breach of its Order,” Cu added. Grab also said that although the Uber app will be able to operate, it has already limited functionality and support. Uber has disclosed that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. “Grab noted that the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) has expressed concerns pertaining to customer support and safety issues arising from Uber’s limited operations. Grab wishes to stress that this interim arrangement is only for the purposes of satisfying what the PCC appears to require until Grab is able to discuss with the PCC,” Cu said.

The number of the common supply base was decided by the Board considering various factors such as unserved demand, number coding scheme and churning rate or the number of inactive drivers for the past few months and will be reviewed every three months. The ridesharing companies welcomed the decision of the Board as it will enable them to efficiently deliver services to their passengers. “The supply base will enable us to address our passenger demand. This assures us na walang drivers ang mawawalan ng trabaho (no drivers will lose their jobs), Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said. \"On the number that they provided, we still need to assess the impact it will have on our reliability, but we'll continue to work with LTFRB on the quarterly process,\" according to Uber policy associate Irish Almeida.

The regulatory board will issue different plates and stickers for TNVS units for enforcement purposes. The stickers will be released as soon as the Provisional Authority has been issued with the plates to be issued later. There are 59,020 accredited TNVS units for both Uber and Grab whose Certificates of Public Convenience were not processed by the LTFRB due to the moratorium on applications last July 2017. The application for the TNVS units will begin on March 5 with priority to be given to the master list of active drivers submitted by the ridesharing companies to the LTFRB.

This after Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Arthur Tugade ordered a review of the LTFRB’s memorandum which imposed a common supply base for TNVS units at 45,700 nationwide. DOTr would create a team to evaluate the number of request bookings per day and the number of served and unserved rides of transportation network companies (TNCs). The transportation department and LTFRB will start monitoring within the next few weeks the number of booking requests received by TNCs. This will include served and unserved requests as well as other factors affecting the supply of TNVS such as number coding, maintenance schedules, and working hours of drivers. Such will determine an objective number for the common supply base which will be based also on the official list of accredited TNVS from Grab, Uber and U-Hop. For its part, Grab is appealing to the LTFRB that the cap on the TNVS units be increased to 75,000 as setting a limit would hamper their ability to deliver transport services to their passengers. “I think 75,000 would be the number of unique drivers on the road right now. So yung lumabas na 45,000 medyo nagulat kami (So we were shocked when LTFRB came up with a 45,000 supply cap on TNVS),” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a press briefing held in Quezon City Tuesday. Cu further said that LTFRB should consider using its master list of active drivers to be prioritized during the applications.

The initiative was derived out of the current practice of TNVS drivers who are accredited by more than one transportation network company (TNC). “The policy on a common supply base for TNVS was envisioned to create a distinct denomination for this type of public transport service and not defined by the individual business models of the TNCs, thus giving the Board a more focused regulatory function on such service,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in a statement over the weekend. “As it is now, the current TNCs and several other TNCs who have expressed interest to the Board to provide this type of service are now free to get the supply from the common supply base for their respective network unbridled by any preference over any TNC,” he added. The LTFRB, in a memorandum issued late last week, imposed a common base of 45,700 TNVS units nationwide which were broken down as follows: Metro Manila - 45,000 TNVS units Metro Cebu - 500 TNVS units Pampanga - 200 TNVS units The cap on TNVS units was determined from relevant data given by the leading TNCs, taking into consideration churning rate, percentage of full-time and part-time TNVS, peak and off-peak hours and average daily bookings, among others. The Board will review the policy three months after it becomes effective as demand varies from time to time. The common base will enable TNVS drivers to register under ridesharing companies that are accredited by the Board.  All valid and existing certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to operate TNVS and those with pending applications are included in the common supply base. The validity of existing CPCs to operate TNVS shall remain effective subject to the new terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Board. Accredited TNCs should accept and process for accreditation only valid CPC holders. For its part, Grab said LTFRB’s move would adversely affect the number of TNVS units that they are operating amid increasing demand from their passengers. The ridesharing firm needs around 70,000-80,000 units in order to replenish their supply of transport services to the commuters. “What this supply cap does is take away the power of the part-timer who adds supply during critical supply. 45k DAILY ACTIVE DRIVERS in Manila make sense, but we need around 70k-80k total franchise holders since not all of them will be driving every day, despite any minimum active hours required,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a social media post. The new guidelines will take effect on Feb. 3, 2018. There are around 125,000 TNVS units in Metro Manila, according to the LTFRB.

The company is set to file a petition for the fare increase before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) within this week, according to Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. “The fare increase aims to cover the higher operating costs of our drivers due to the implementation of the TRAIN policy,” Cu explained in a press conference Wednesday. A full-time Grab driver earns an average of PHP3,200 to PHP3,600 daily. Of the amount, PHP800 to PHP1,000 is spent on gas. “Our biggest worry is the day-to-day operations with regards to the fuel that drivers need. If a fare adjustment is not made, this would (compromise) their income on a monthly basis,” Cu said. Once the fare adjustments are granted by the LTFRB, Grab assures its riders that these will be implemented only when there are “significant changes” in oil prices. The average fares of Grab passengers were pegged at PHP150 to PHP170 as of December 2017. Under the TRAIN law, an initial excise tax of PHP2.50 per liter shall be imposed on diesel this year, which will eventually increase to PHP6 by 2020. An excise tax of PHP7 will be imposed on gasoline in 2018, gradually increasing to PHP10 in 2020. The Department of Energy (DOE) has advised oil companies not to apply the new excise taxes on old stocks of petroleum products, as these are levied on importation and not at the point of sale to consumers.

The company is projecting that there was a 30-percent increase in demand since October this year, while the supply of its transport network vehicle services (TNVS) remain the same, according to Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu. “The extra load of 30-percent growth in demand will be very hard to serve. What we are doing now is trying to improve our allocation methodologies and algorithms -- the way the supply is set, providing incentives to our drivers to get them to drive a bit longer and to expand their opportunities for this holiday season,” Cu said in a press conference at Grab’s main office in Makati City Friday. “The only thing we can do is to stretch our supply because we cannot add more supply,” he added. Grab is not accepting new TNVS applications in compliance with the directive of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last July for transportation network companies (TNCs) not to accept and activate new drivers into their systems, pending review of regulations governing the ridesharing industry. Cu stressed that the TNCs should not be the ones to be blamed for the traffic jams being experienced in Metro Manila. “Well, put it this way. We stopped adding cars in August. Has traffic got better or worse? Traffic has worsened. It’s not the TNCs or TNVS that are causing traffic,” Cu pointed out. He said an average Grab ride is now taking around 45 minutes, up from 38 minutes six months ago. Grab is advising passengers to adjust their travel schedules because of the expected heavy influx of vehicles for the Christmas season. Riders may avail of the app’s carpooling feature Grab Share, wherein they can share rides with passengers traveling in the same direction and split on the payment of the fares. “Grab Share is one of the features that we have to stretch supply because it allows passengers to share their rides. It will help stretch the existing supply base that we have,” Cu explained. Grab currently has around 54,000 accredited TNVS nationwide. Of this number, 20,000 are full-time drivers. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said TNCs are not being blamed but these are among the contributing factors to the heavy traffic in Metro Manila. “On the matter of Metro Manila traffic, we are not blaming them because there are other causes as well. However, they are contributing to the heavy vehicular volume, which is the top cause of the current traffic situation in Metro Manila,” MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The MMDA expects an increase of 50,000 in vehicular volume, based on data gathered from car dealers. Other causes of the traffic in the metropolis are the malls and bus terminals located along EDSA. Around 4,022 stalled vehicles along the major thoroughfare were likewise recorded by the MMDA from January to August this year. MMDA is urging TNCs to comply with the regulations that are being implemented by the LTFRB. “We hope that the TNCs will be able to settle the matter with the LTFRB. They need to comply with the regulations. Whatever the decision of the LTFRB is, we will just enforce it,” said Pialago. LTFRB is eyeing to create a common pool number that will manage the allocation of the TNVS of ridesharing firms to address passenger demand. The board is also considering extending the validity of the TNCs' franchises from one year to three years.  (PNA)"},{"title":"Grab pushes for common database of blacklisted passengers","date":" November 7, 2017, 3:42 pm","snippet":"Grab Philippines is urging other transportation network companies (TNCs) to provide a common database of blacklisted passengers to ensure safety of both drivers and passengers.","body":"MANILA -- Grab Philippines is urging other transportation network companies (TNCs) to provide a common database of blacklisted passengers to ensure safety of both drivers and passengers.

Leo Gonzalez, head of the Public Affairs, said Grab is testing the environment in Davao City if Davaoenos are ready to pay higher fares for a more convenient ride. Gonzalez stressed the company is looking more on the demand side under such operation. He said the company has already expressed interest with the Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB) to operate in the city. GrabCar is a car-booking application that dispatches private vehicles. The app has high demand in Metro Manila. Grab has been operating in Davao City since 2014 when it partnered with taxi operators and drivers in Davao for GrabTaxi. Jose Thor Villarreiz, Grab Davao Manager, said there are now 1,300 Grab-a-Taxi drivers still using the Grab platform averaging about 500 drivers active per day. When Grab started in Davao City there were about 2,600 because of the incentives they offered to establish the brand. Meanwhile, on Friday, Grab Philippines revealed it has already accepted 100 drivers from Uber as of Friday, August 18, after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units to transfer to two other accredited Transport Network Companies (TNCs). Grab Philippines Country head Brian Cu, however, is not sure how many will be joining Grab. “It is yet to be seen,” Cu said when asked how many the company would take in. Cu, who was here for the 32nd Kadayawan sa Dabaw, said Grab will just submit a list to LTFRB daily until his company will be told it is enough. The submission of a list is required by LTFRB. On Thursday, LTFRB released Board Resolution No. 19 stating Uber TNVS units will be allowed to transfer to two other accredited TNCs like Grab and UHOP to ease the burden of commuters. Under the said resolution, the TNVS should only show their proof of accreditation by Uber and insurance coverage. Grab and UHOP should submit to the LTFRB a list of operated TNVS on a daily basis. Cu said, “We will accommodate the members of the TNVs community who want to join Grab’s platform so long as they abide by the requirements clearly stated in the order and the company’s policies.” Cu said Grab is also looking at people whose livelihood is affected by the suspension of the operations. Uber was suspended last August 14 and was ordered to cease and desist the operations of its online booking applications. Cu stressed that Grab understands very well about the lack of supply to serve the need of the riding public. With LTFRB’s resolution, Cu is optimistic Grab can meet the demand beginning on Monday. To maintain Grab’s quality of service, Cu said drivers will undergo training, cross check their background. “We’re focused on serving drivers and consumers, and ensuring that the car-and-taxi-hailing transport continues to run as smoothly as possible,” he said. He added that aside from the fare cap which Grab put in place to ensure consumers continue to pay a reasonable fare, Cu said Grab also ensures that the onboarding process will be smooth so that TNVs drivers can start to make a loving again.

In a statement, the transport network company (TNC) said it has its own third party private insurance that covers all its transport network vehicle service (TNVS) partners and passengers in the Philippines and the rest of the Southeast Asian region. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated Passenger Accident Management and Insurance (PAMI) coverage. Grab’s third party insurance policy from Great American Insurance Company ensures that those without PA or CPC are enrolled to an insurance premium as early as April last year. Those with PA/CPC get the same insurance on top of PAMI. “Our passengers are protected by a third-party insurance, whether they ride a GrabCar TNVS unit with PA/CPC or not,\" Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Public Affairs Head and Spokesperson of Grab Philippines, explained as he assures that the TNC complies with the no fault policy which entitles passengers to full insurance claims regardless of who’s at fault at the time of the accident. Grab’s insurance package which is the first of its kind insurance policy in the industry to be provided by a ride sharing platform applies to all 65 cities in the seven countries that it currently operates making it the largest in terms of coverage in Southeast Asia. Its insurer Great American Insurance offers coverage in the event of accidental death, permanent dismemberment and bodily injuries in the event of accidents for drivers and passengers. For death or permanent disability, Grab's TNVS drivers, partners, and passengers can claim up to USD 4,100 or PHP 200,000; while up to USD 410 or PHP 20,000 can be claimed for medical reimbursements.  Moreover, coverage varies for different types of injuries. Grab also reminds its TNVS partners to always abide by the law. “Any violation that would result to serious physical injuries or would put Grab’s credibility in question would be tantamount to suspension or even deactivation of their respective accounts,” according to Gonzales. “Grab always puts the interests and welfare of its partners and passengers at the heart of its priorities. It is important for us that they are assured of peace of mind as they take and complete a Grab ride,” he added. Accountability was one of the issues discussed during the two congressional hearings held last week to tackle the issues involving TNCs. Insurance coverage for the passengers was identified as the means to ensure passenger safety and security.  (PNA)"}]}
