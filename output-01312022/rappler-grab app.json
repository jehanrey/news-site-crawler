Yet, whether the Philippines or the United States, it might well seem like it is always a matter of two steps forward and one step back as the coronavirus continues to evolve and so too the responses to it.  In our annual look back at Asia’s winners and losers, we find even the good news was bad in the year that was. The chaotic US withdrawal in August 2021 brought to an end an era of advancements in Afghanistan, and hunger and misery are on the rise again in one of Asia’s poorest nations. Still, even amid the “worse off” some are even more “worse off.” Sadly we give “worst year’ in Asia to Afghanistan’s beleaguered and increasingly-at-risk women and girls. The US presence in Afghanistan – the “graveyard of empires” – was doomed in part by hubris and denial. But a bright spot of the last 20 years was the dramatic improvement in the lives and opportunities for Afghanistan’s women and girls.  A record number of Afghan girls went to school. Women ascended in public life, taking on roles as ambassadors, parliamentarians and civil society leaders. The “Afghan Dreamers” – an all-female, high school robotics team – won acclaim in international competitions. Now, under a back-in-power Taliban, the worst may still be to come for Afghan’s women and girls as the world looks away. One-time de facto leader of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi found herself at year-end 2021 back where she has spent so many years – under detention by a military government – and takes the prize for “bad year” in Asia. After a military coup, the Nobel laureate was detained, tried, and found guilty on charges of incitement and breaking COVID-19 rules. Stalled democratic reforms and the persecution of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority, which she did little to stop, had already dimmed the democracy icon’s prospects of instituting lasting change in her country. She is not alone though as the pandemic provided added cover for governments in Asia to restrict civil liberties and clamp down on protests. The awarding of a Nobel Peace Prize to Rappler’s own Maria Ressa and Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov underscored the challenges to free press and democracy worldwide. With her future now looking very much like her past, Suu Kyi offers up a case study of just how difficult it is for democracy to take root and thrive not only in Myanmar but in all of Southeast Asia. With the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics ultimately held in 2021 shining bright, and Beijing’s 2022 winter counterpart facing hurdles even before the games begin, the international Olympics sporting movement in Asia has had a decidedly mixed year. Despite concerns over budgets and COVID-19, the delayed Tokyo Olympics provided a much needed distraction from the pandemic. American gold medalist gymnast Sunisa Lee dazzled the world. And athletes from host nation Japan won the third most gold medals, after athletes from the US and China. Now in the countdown to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have announced a diplomatic boycott of the games over China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority and other human rights concerns. A now vanished social media post by Chinese star tennis player Peng Shuai that was interpreted as alleging sexual misconduct by a former communist party leader had many posting #WhereIsPengShuai? – and raising prospects of more protests to come. These developments have many questioning whether the International Olympic Committee had put profits over principle, and whether the organization can live up to its charter of “promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.” Amid the gloom and doom of 2021, Southeast Asia’s fintech firms benefited from changing consumer habits and growing investor interest. Lockdowns throughout Southeast Asia forced many indoors and increasingly online, accelerating a trend that was already gaining steam in Thailand and elsewhere before the pandemic hit.  In the first nine months of 2021, Southeast Asia saw a record 80 fintech deals worth US$3 billion, exceeding what was invested in 2019 and 2020 combined and making it a very good year for the sector. A one-time unicorn that has integrated itself into the lives of Southeast Asia’s citizens is Grab – the “Everyday Everything App” – which evolved from a ride hailing app to a digital platform and superapp that offers financial services, deliveries and much more throughout the region. In the largest SPAC merger and public listing deal of its kind, Grab went public at a nearly $40 billion valuation in December. Southeast Asia’s fintech players are also benefiting from venture capital shifting away from China as Beijing puts the brakes on the sector’s development and reins in one-time high-flying success stories, including Alibaba Group’s affiliate company Ant Group and founder Jack Ma. It now seems we will need to look also to Southeast Asia, rather than Northeast Asia, for digital trends that will shape our future. Hard-pressed to find anyone having had a great 2021, we give the dubious distinction of “best year” in Asia to the region’s new Cold War warriors. Year 2021 sadly proved to be a banner year for a return to Cold War rhetoric.  The election of US President Biden proved to be no panacea for troubled superpower relations as China’s President Xi Jinping stayed home, and Chinese nationalists and state-owned media including now “retired” Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin sought to push back against leaders from Australia, Canada and other nations whose views and values clashed with those of China. Social media in 2021 amplified the nationalistic rhetoric of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats, and bots and trolls made matters worse. The spread of COVID-19, China’s rapid military buildup and development of hypersonic missiles, militarization of the South China Sea and crackdowns in Hong Kong and China’s Xinjiang region as well as threats to Taiwan all heightened tensions. Is the United States in a Cold War with China? The answer could be “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” depending on the day of the week. The answer not only has deep implications for China and the United States, but for the Philippines, ASEAN and the world as nations navigate the US-China relationship and look to a better 2022. – Rappler.com Curtis S.

It's because of the December fee. DTI says it is not allowed.","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Trade and Industry has asked delivery service app Lalamove to explain why it is charging a “December fee” of up to P100 for parcel deliveries this holiday season. The December fee is slapped on top of the base price and high demand surcharge, making deliveries more expensive. Rappler observed that a two-kilometer delivery through a Sedan could cost over P463 due to the various fees. For motorcycle deliveries, Rappler observed a P40 December fee. In a text message to Rappler, Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said that such charges were not allowed. “That should not happen…. It has to be explained what the December fee is for,” Castelo said. In an email, Lalamove said that the extra fees were “common” in delivery platforms. It said the fee was temporary and implemented to ensure that delivery orders were fulfilled. Similar apps like Grab and Transportify only have a demand surcharge adjustment, making Lalamove deliveries more expensive than competitors. “During the festive seasons where demand for delivery surges, temporary fees are implemented for drivers, who are independent contractors and work on their own time, to be more willing and able to accept the orders being offered via the platform. This is to ensure users’ delivery orders are fulfilled, and to ensure partner drivers are compensated during the peak season,” Lalamove told Rappler. Lalamove said that the additional charges were disclosed to the customer prior to booking. “Similarly, this also allows our partner driver to assess whether he wants to accept such an order at that fees. Drivers are able to take home the combined amount of base fare and surcharges net of commission,” the company said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/rising-food-businesses-share-secrets-surviving-covid-19-pandemic/","title":"These rising food businesses share secrets in surviving the pandemic","date":"Dec 10, 2021 9:27 AM PHT","snippet":"Golden Grab Awards winners Blake’s Wings and Steaks, Thai Mango, and Corndog 28 are some of the new kids on the block","body":"Editor’s note: This press release is sponsored by Grab and was handled by BrandRap, the sales and marketing arm of Rappler. No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. In the Food & Beverage (F&B) landscape, no restaurant owner is assured a win amid the highly competitive nature of the industry. And with the pandemic initially halting operations, restaurants were forced into an even tougher challenge of surviving the unexpected.  Despite these challenges, however, it soon seemed that not all hope was lost for small and medium food businesses. Despite many competing brands and changes in customer habits, online food deliveries helped provide businesses another avenue to reach customers.   While the online food delivery industry was already rising even before the pandemic, the shift from offline to online accelerated further when Filipinos were forced to stay at home. Since then, online food delivery services have become a way of life.  “Food is a big part of our culture, and online food delivery opened a world of endless possibilities for us food-loving Filipinos. Now, any food craving can be satisfied with just a few taps on your phone. And we at GrabFood are proud to contribute to that satisfaction by providing Filipinos with the widest range of restaurant selection,” said Greg Camacho, GrabFood Philippines’ head. Leading online food delivery service GrabFood consists of thousands of restaurants for Filipinos to choose from, including up-and-coming restaurants Blake’s Wings and Steaks, Thai Mango, and Corndog 28. More than just surviving the challenges of the pandemic, these businesses also brought home sought-after recognitions at the recent Golden Grab Awards 2021, which celebrated Grab’s best-performing merchant-partners. Known for its flavorful wings and steaks, casual dining restaurant Blake’s Wings and Steaks has been a GrabFood merchant-partner even before the pandemic. Starting out as a friendly neighborhood restaurant in Marikina, family-owned business Blake’s Wings and Steaks has since expanded to seven branches – all available for delivery via GrabFood. With the delivery app’s “long-distance delivery” feature, the restaurant was able to even further expand its delivery range up to a 10KM radius, reaching even more customers across the metro. “We got most of our sales from the Grab app – maybe 90% or even 95% come from the Grab app – so that’s really how Grab played a huge role in how we’re still thriving in the business now,” said Blake’s Wings and Steaks owner Joana Manalo. Aside from their presence in GrabFood, Blake’s Wings and Steaks recognizes the importance of a well-curated online menu. Because of its visually appealing and creative menu options, they were given the “Menu Maven” award. Aside from GrabFood’s Long Distance Delivery feature that expands restaurants’ delivery range, merchant-partners can also benefit from GrabFood’s 24/7 operations. Thai Mango Dessert by Chef Kim, which was recognized as the “Newbie No More” at the Golden Grab Awards, is one of the many merchant-partners that acknowledge the positive impact of the 24-hour service. What they once thought would only work for big-name brands, the 24/7 operations helped their business expand to a new set of customers: the night shift workers. With a goal of becoming the pioneer of 24/7 Thai food delivery, Thai Mango Dessert provides healthy options for those working at night or have late-night cravings. From one branch in March last year, this Newbie No More merchant-partner has now expanded to five branches across Metro Manila. A rise in online delivery services has also brought about the need for restaurants to adapt to a more delivery-friendly packaging that not only preserves the quality of their food, but also gives customers a more enjoyable eating experience. Korean corndog food business Corndog 28 bagged the “Pack It Like It’s Hot” award because of their dedication to innovating through their packaging. Beyond being functional, Corndog 28 owner Eugene Leo Uy also stressed the importance of creating an attractive packaging. “It’s one of the main entry points for the customer to really see and understand your product,” he shared. In the age of digital content creation, an aesthetically pleasing or “Instagrammable” dish is bound to make a restaurant more impactful to consumers. It goes without saying the pandemic took the world by surprise – but this did not stop Grab from rising up to the challenge of serving Filipinos. From being just a ride-hailing app to the super-app it is today, Grab now offers a food delivery service with GrabFood, an on-demand groceries and essentials service with GrabMart, a parcel delivery service with GrabExpress, and a safe and rewarding e-wallet with GrabPay. “At the onset of the pandemic, movement was much more limited—even for a delivery service like us. But that challenge is what motivated us to find solutions to how we can provide Filipinos their cravings and essentials. Aside from customers who needed safe and convenient access to their essentials, we also had our delivery, driver, and merchant-partners to think of – and how we can continue to provide them with income opportunities,” said Anton Bautista, Grab Philippines’ head of deliveries. GrabFood, first launched in the Philippines in 2018, is now available in 107 cities. As the company expanded its operations to more locations, even more merchant-partners have joined the platform, some even joining its GrabFood Signatures program which allows them to be available for delivery only on GrabFood and enjoy exclusive benefits and marketing opportunities from Grab.  To encourage customers to continue supporting their favorite food businesses, Bautista assures that both customers and merchant-partners can look forward to more promos and features in the coming year, including an enhanced Self Pickup service for a more convenient ordering experience, as well as new offerings through GrabFood Signatures. “With the country slowly easing back into the ‘old normal’, we anticipate more consumers choosing to eat out. Despite this, we at GrabFood are always thinking of opportunities to provide our merchant-partners the same level of support we’ve given them in the past two years. As we continue adapting, one thing is certain: We will continue to provide our fellow Filipinos with the safety and convenience they have relied on with us,” said Bautista. – Rappler.com Hungry?

But Move It denounces other companies for allegedly orchestrating the suspension.","body":"The Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) ordered Grab and Move It to suspend their partnership starting Thursday, September 30, just a week after operations began. The partnership is premised on users being able to book Move It drivers through the Grab app. In a statement on Thursday, the TWG said the parties “were not operating in accordance [with] agreed parameters and guidelines.” “Grab’s application instead of Move It’s application was used to avail, book, and pay for the ride service; and that the entire process of training, driver onboarding, marketing, issuance of official receipts, and the use of the Grab Driver app was all undertaken by Grab,” the TWG said. It added that the partnership makes it appear as if Grab is a “de facto member” of the pilot study on motorcycle ride-hailing services. “Grab’s entry is a circumvention of the processes and guidelines that had been laid down at the start of the study,” the TWG said. The TWG claimed that Move It and Grab “were not prepared to engage” in the collaboration. But Move It maintained that it has been transparent with the TWG and other stakeholders. “Our partnership has gone through several rounds of discussions with the TWG where all of their concerns were addressed. So bakit ngayong naka-launch na kami, tsaka kami ipapa-suspend (So why are they suspending us after we’ve already launched)?” asked Move It. Move It also said the “maneuvering,” which it blamed on “complaints” by other members of the pilot study, was tantamount to bullying. “This suspension was orchestrated by a number of stakeholders in the motorcycle taxi pilot against Move It – the smaller player in the pilot,” it said. “We strongly condemn this maneuvering by other stakeholders resulting [in] this suspension as it is anti-consumer, anti-Filipino, and is tantamount to bullying.” While Move It did not name the companies, the other two members of the pilot study are Angkas and JoyRide. Move It disclosed that the partnership it sealed with Grab was offered to Angkas and JoyRide as well, but the two declined. “Mahirap na po ang buhay kaya dapat tayong magtulungan – at hindi naman po masama ang humingi ng tulong,” Move It said. (Life is very difficult right now that’s why we have to work together – and it isn’t bad to ask for help.) Grab, meanwhile, said discussions with the regulators are still ongoing.  “Grab is committed to empowering local businesses, and our partnership with Move It is consistent with our ongoing efforts to help everyday entrepreneurs thrive and succeed,” it said. Grab said it hopes that the partnership will be given the green light again soon. “The pandemic has brought upon many challenges to the transport industry, and these challenges would require a whole-of-industry solution,” it said. “As a community partner, Grab Philippines will continue to do right by our consumers and partners, encourage constructive dialogue using facts and objective information, and help contribute to the recovery of our transportation industry.” Aside from studying the legalization of motorcycle taxis, the government allowed their operations to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/motorcycle-taxis-available-grab-philippines-starting-september-23-2021/","title":"Motorcycle taxis available on Grab starting September 23","date":"Sep 22, 2021 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines partners with Move It for its motorcycle taxi services","body":"Commuters will be able to book a motorcycle taxi on the Grab app starting Thursday, September 23. In a statement on Wednesday, September 22, Grab Philippines said it partnered with Move It for its motorcycle ride-hailing service. Move It will still offer motorcycle rides through its app, but the partnership will allow its riders to have a wider market given Grab’s large user base. Similar to Grab’s transport bookings, cashless payments will be implemented. Commuters can pay through credit or debit card, GrabPay credits, or by cashing in with the driver. “Through this landmark partnership, we are confident that many Filipinos will experience and enjoy its many benefits, and we are hopeful that the bike-hailing industry will continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic,” said Move It president and chief executive officer Francis Juan. Since the service is being offered during the coronavirus pandemic, commuters will have to bring their own helmets. Commuters can book Mondays to Sundays, from 5 am to 10 pm, in the Greater Manila Area. “Our partnership with Move It is a hallmark expression of how transport stakeholders can come together for the common good, and we invite all companies to join us towards this mission,” said Grab Philippines head Grace Vera Cruz. Grab said statistics required by the Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) will still be submitted. In 2020, Grab had said it was “seriously considering” entering the motorcycle taxi market “if given the chance.” The motorcycle taxi TWG, however, did not seem keen on granting authority to other players outside of the original participants in the government’s pilot study. Aside from Move It, Angkas and JoyRide were authorized to offer motorcycle ride-hailing services.

Here are the valuable perks you’re missing out on","date":"Sep 21, 2021 6:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s one: There are no transfer fees","body":"Just like how the world has shifted into a more digital landscape, Filipinos have swiftly adapted to online transactions and cashless payments. Though it’s unfortunate that the pandemic served as a catalyst, it provided the right opportunity for most of us to take advantage of the convenience of e-wallets, such as no more pila (long lines), and being granted insta-access to bank accounts and due date-beating bills payment services, among other things. To be fair, all market players deliver on their promise; each one has its strengths depending on your needs. Consumers are now provided with a one-stop shop for their transactions, and seem to have an endless stream of deals. Banks are also stepping up their game, with their apps carrying e-wallet-like capabilities. (READ: Cashless payments 101: Starting out with a digital wallet) As with all bright and shiny things, everything isn’t spotless. With the increasing dependence on e-wallets and online banking comes a glaring compromise that we can’t escape from – those inconvenient “convenience fees.” Towards the latter part of 2020, we all watched in horror as PESONet and InstaPay slowly engulfed big names, leaving only a handful without fees. If you’re using one of the “affected” services, there seems to be no choice, and it’s hard to give up on their benefits. Or so we thought. How about considering GrabPay, the Grab app’s native e-wallet? Most of us are familiar with it as Grab’s preferred mode of payment on rides – a significant attempt to lessen physical contact between driver and passenger – but it’s so much more than that. Once you’re aware of its perks and advantages, you can harness it to become one of your most valuable digital wallet accounts. For starters, and perhaps its best feature, GrabPay has no convenience fee when you transfer to other banks and e-wallets, which saves you at least P15 per transaction. Likewise, you can spend less on those extra fees when you cash in from one of its partner institutions – BPI, BDO, and Unionbank – by simply linking your online banking account.  Pro-tip: You can turn your GrabPay wallet into a “halfway point” between accounts to avoid those insidious fees. If you have a BPI account, for example, cash in your intended amount to GrabPay, then transfer it to another bank. That way, you’ll regain that no lugi (loss) feeling that you once enjoyed. Is that possible? You best believe it. With each in-app or outside transaction that makes use of GrabPay as a mode of payment, you earn GrabRewards points! When accumulated, these can be used to save on future GrabCar rides, GrabFood orders, GrabMart groceries, and GrabExpress deliveries. There are even more perks awaiting as you progress the GrabRewards tiers – from “Member” all the way up to “Platinum.” You’ll gradually unlock and redeem more offers and prizes, such as free coupons, food items via GrabFood, and a premium Spotify subscription. If we’ve piqued your curiosity, know more about the hows of earning points, the tiering system, and the range of benefits by visiting the GrabRewards site. Most of all, by simply using GrabPay on purchases from its partner brands, including adidas, ShopSM, and Zalora, you’ll be able to shave off prices through loads of exclusive discounts. And lest we forget, your next Lazada or Shopee check-out sprees have been taken into consideration, making you eligible for up to P500 off in savings too. Just how sulit (worth it) can GrabPay be? We can’t thank e-wallets and online banking enough for making our transactions easier and faster at such an inconvenient time. But as you use one (or some), continue pushing your luck by going for a service that’s flexible, yields more value for your money, and leaves you without a lugi feeling. And GrabPay is the key. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/grabkitchen-branch-pasig-city/","title":"LOOK: GrabKitchen opens Pasig City branch","date":"Sep 7, 2021 7:38 AM PHT","snippet":"Order from 10 establishments – from Japanese food to milk tea – in one go","body":"Food delivery giant GrabFood recently launched its fifth GrabKitchen branch in Pasig City, allowing customers within range to order from different restaurants in one go.  GrabKitchen is a central commissary which allows several different food and beverage brands to prepare their products in one central kitchen.

This month, GoodRap is putting the spotlight on brands that have made quarantine easier for everyone. In this story, the author shares how she utilizes Grab’s in-app services not just to purchase essentials but also to give back to delivery riders. Like many Filipinos, I still spend most of my days at home. Last year, this was definitely a challenge. Since I used to live on my own in Quezon City, it was difficult to adjust to living in my childhood home in Pampanga again.  Among the many challenges I faced – which you might relate to – is the lack of access to the food I used to enjoy. Here’s an example: when I lived in Quezon City, there was a Bon Chon near my workplace and the condo I lived in. In my Pampanga hometown, the nearest branch is 15 minutes away. If we pair this with the fact that going out of the house for non-essential tasks isn’t encouraged, I used to think that enjoying restaurant food wouldn’t be part of my quarantine experience. Thankfully, delivery apps and logistics services recognized this concern. Most of them have improved their operations – by extending service hours, widening coverage, and adding more partner restaurants – to cater to customers like me. Nowadays, I turn to delivery apps like Grab to satisfy my cravings or to buy essentials.  Of course, I’ve become a dedicated customer. I open the Grab app almost daily. I could probably already name most of the restaurants that are available on the app. Most of all, I’ve become familiar with our modern-day heroes, the delivery riders that regularly come to our home.  Whether it’s a rainy or extremely hot day, at breakfast or dinner time, or for small essentials like tube ice or large orders of Chinese food, these delivery riders make sure that I get what I order promptly. Most of them do it with smiles on their faces and with a kind word when I get my packages.  We’re all probably familiar with a few ways we can be nicer to our delivery riders. Some of the habits I practice as a customer include giving my riders even just a small tip, waiting for them near the gate to ensure quick deliveries, and properly communicating with them to minimize the risk of these riders getting lost on the way.  While these are helpful (and have proven to make these riders happy), I wondered if there was more that I could do to help them out. And it seems like Grab heard my thoughts.  One of the restaurants I always order from is Starbucks. One day, I noticed that the Starbucks store on the Grab app gained a new feature. They have included a “For your rider” tab, which now allows customers to buy food or drinks for their riders.  This is on top of the tipping feature, which enables customers to input a certain amount to give as a tip directly from the app itself. This will be deducted from the customer’s chosen payment method and is helpful for those who prefer contactless delivery since there is no need to physically hand over the tip.  Grab continues to implement programs for the benefit of its riders. Just this month, they rolled out a new feature under the Food for Your Drivers program. Until May 31, 2021, customers in select parts of Metro Manila can go to the Mart section of the Grab app and buy goods from select supermarkets and establishments for their delivery riders.  Partner stores and brands include:  Interested customers can also find the “For your driver” section of these select stores on the app.  Do you also enjoy these services offered by Grab?

Under the GrabForGood fund, Grab will fully cover the costs of COVID-19 vaccination for its drivers and delivery partners across Southeast Asia who are not covered by a national vaccination program. “The GrabForGood Fund will commence immediate work on meeting the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, where it’s not easily available,” said Grab Group chief executive officer and co-founder Anthony Tan. Grab said eligible drivers and delivery partners are those who have completed a ride or a delivery on the Grab app within 3 months leading up to inoculation. “Grab has started sourcing for vaccines and will look into setting up vaccine centers to inoculate eligible partners locally,” it said in a statement. Aside from the vaccine drive, Grab will also support other initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the endowment fund. Grab is planning an insurance subsidy for drivers and riders on top of the personal accident insurance coverage, education scholarships, and financial aid for people with disability to enable the use of the app for income generation. The holding firm said details of the initiatives will be announced eventually. The rest of the Grab community in Southeast Asia will also be able to access programs on financial and digital literacy, climate change resiliency grants, and catastrophic relief aid. The GrabForGood Fund will have a seed fund of $50 million in cash and $200 million in expected value of Grab shares. Tan, along with Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling and Grab president Ming Maa, also pledged a combined $25 million worth of shares as personal contribution. An advisory board will be created to give Grab partners and users representation in providing feedback and recommendations on how the funds should be spent. In the Philippines, Grab has already launched programs that support online sellers and small businesses amid the pandemic. It also covers swab tests for drivers and delivery partners. Grab is present in 428 cities in 8 countries in Southeast Asia. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-upsizes-debut-term-loan-strong-investor-demand/","title":"Grab upsizes debut term loan to $2 billion on strong investor demand","date":"Feb 1, 2021 4:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab group CEO Anthony Tan says investors recognized the value of the company's super app platform","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab has raised $2 billion from its first term loan, in what it said was the largest institutional debt in Asia’s technology sector, as the company expands its regional services. The 5-year senior secured loan was upsized from the initial $750 million after the company secured commitments from international institutional investors, Singapore-based Grab said in a statement on Monday, February 1. Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Grab, said that investors recognized the value of Grab’s super app platform, as “we continue making consistent progress in achieving our growth and sustainability milestones.” Backed by investors including Softbank Group Corporation, Grab has evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. Ranked as Southeast Asia’s most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $16 billion, Grab recently won a digital bank license in Singapore. Last month, Grab said its total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year-on-year in 2020 and recovered to comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. The loan will be used for general corporate purposes and will allow Grab to diversify its finances. Grab said the interest rate on the loan was lowered by 100 basis points from the original launch guidance to 450 basis points over LIBOR. Grab’s food business, which has benefited from a sector-wide boom in food delivery as countries imposed lockdowns, accounts for more than 50% of its revenue. Grab expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. JPMorgan was the lead bookrunner on the loan facility, while Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mizuho, MUFG, and Standard Chartered were the joint bookrunners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/disabled-delivery-rider-on-frontline-of-malaysian-virus-war/","title":"Disabled delivery rider on ‘frontline’ of Malaysian virus war","date":"Dec 10, 2020 8:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Muhammad Sidek Osman may be stooped and only be just 3.5 feet in height, but on his modified motorcycle he becomes a different man – zipping from restaurants to people's homes delivering food","body":"Diminutive Malaysian delivery rider Muhammad Sidek Osman cuts a striking figure weaving through traffic on a modified four-wheeled motorbike, on his way to drop off food. Birth complications left him stooped and shorter than average at just 108 centimeters (3.5 feet), making even simple tasks such as climbing stairs a challenge. “Being like this, it’s a bit hard to work–it’s a bit hard to do anything,” the 21-year told AFP at a delivery rider hangout on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. But on his modified motorcycle, Sidek becomes a different man – zipping from restaurants to people’s homes delivering food, with business booming as people stay home during the epidemic. It has not been easy for the 21-year-old, who now works for the transport and delivery app Grab. Employers repeatedly rejected him for full-time roles due to his disability, leaving him with little other option than to become a self-employed rider. Sidek looks on the bright side, however, saying he enjoys his job “because you get to interact with other riders and customers”. Riders with disabilities are a rare sight in the Southeast Asian nation, home to an army of bikers tirelessly delivering items ordered on mobile apps. But life in general is not easy for members of the disabled community as there is little in the way of infrastructure –such as wheelchair access– to help them. The government has not been proactive enough in protecting the rights of those with disabilities, said V. Murugesan, president of the Damai Disabled Person Association of Malaysia. “The discrimination will cease when the government makes necessary changes,” he told AFP. Sidek said he experienced this first-hand. After finishing school, employers rejected him for what he described as “normal” jobs– without giving further details– forcing him to take on piecemeal work. During one interview, “they asked for someone tall”, he recalled. “They asked me ‘can you really work here?'” Still, Sidek is not one to dwell on the past and is happy to have a steady income during the coronavirus pandemic. He started working as a delivery rider soon after Malaysia imposed a nationwide lockdown in mid-March, which saw many businesses closed and people confined to their homes for weeks. “During these times, if you can work, just do whatever is available,” he said, adding that he earns up to 100 ringgit ($25) a day from deliveries. He is also convinced of the important role delivery riders are playing as Malaysia’s outbreak worsens, leaving people reluctant to head out to restaurants and shops. The country recently re-imposed some restrictions after a surge in coronavirus cases, and has so far reported more than 68,000 infections and over 360 deaths. “During this lockdown, we riders are front-liners because we take care of people by delivering food so that COVID cases won’t rise,” he said.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/the-grid-do-it-yourself-food-kits-available-grabmart/","title":"The Grid’s DIY food kits now available on GrabMart","date":"Nov 30, 2020 1:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Gourmet selections from the Grid Food Market can now be delivered to you via Grab","body":"The Grid Food Market now offers their DIY Food Kits on GrabMart.

Local businesses, especially small shops typically managed by an individual or a small group of people, were seriously affected by the quarantine regulations established at the start of the year. As the pandemic stretches on, it is becoming vital for these businesses to recalibrate their operations.  The challenge today isn’t just to keep up with technology. It’s to utilize technology to help you better reach and serve your customers as well as grow your business. And this is exactly what these entrepreneurs have accomplished with the help of GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program.  The GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club (MBC) is a rewards and loyalty program for entrepreneurs who use GrabExpress. As part of the MBC, they get a wide range of benefits including exclusive promos, webinars, free ad spaces, and even capital loans. They also become part of the MBC community, where they get to meet fellow entrepreneurs. From pet care products to sushi bake and everything in between, the Madiskarteng Boss 20 shows that any business has the potential to be successful – with diskarte and by embracing digitalization. Today, we’re giving you an inside look at how.  In this article, we highlight the humble beginnings of the Madiskarteng Boss 20, share what makes them stand out, and give you a glimpse at how they work with Grab to ensure the steady growth of their respective businesses. Introducing the future of Filipino entrepreneurship – the Madiskarteng Boss 20:  How should you begin a successful business? Try starting with something you are passionate about. Before establishing Activ Green PH, Kellsey was already a sustainability advocate. When she observed that there were only a handful of sellers of eco-friendly products in Manila, she decided to look for local sources and began her business from there. Nowadays, they are a well-known one-stop shop  for sustainable products.  Activ Green PH stands out because they don’t just promote products. They also promote a lifestyle. As advocates for sustainable alternatives to various household products, they make sure that they themselves try the products for a couple of months first before selling them.  They recently just celebrated their second anniversary with a fundraising project in partnership with the Philippine Eagle Foundation. All orders made within Metro Manila were delivered through GrabExpress. Kellsey attributes their successful celebration to the MBC promos offered at that time, which ensured that their customers were able to receive their items at the best condition for a discounted delivery fee. Nicole is proof that business inspiration can come even at the worst points of your life. In 2018, she decided to quit her advertising job to spend more time with her father after he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure. She began baking as her form of therapy. Eventually, she used her father’s successful kidney transplant journey as an inspiration for Baba Bake’s best-selling sinless cookies.  When asked why she chose to focus on keto-friendly cookies, she mentioned that she wants to change the negativity attached to healthy eating. Her goal is simple: to create cookies so delicious you wouldn’t even notice that they don’t contain sugar and flour. She has succeeded – customers constantly rave that their low-carb and sugar-free cookies taste just like any other normal sinful dessert. Baba Bake has always operated from home but that doesn’t mean there weren’t any adjustments she had to make. Because she lived in a condo community, she had to personally hand over deliveries to riders who couldn’t enter the premises. Thankfully, she discovered Grab Express’ multi-stop booking feature, which allowed her to categorize the deliveries by area and had them delivered by one rider in a multi-stop booking. These helped the riders finish deliveries faster, which also allowed her to save time and effort.  Managed by a husband and wife tandem, Backspacer Records was established in 2017 by avid record collector Robert. Since both he and Tasha had corporate jobs, his only motivation was to sell his extra copies to offset what he spent for his own collection. As their network of customers grew, he saw the business’ potential. In 2019, they set up a retail store in their friend’s Kapitolyo bar.  When lockdown regulations were implemented, they had to cease operations. But they did not let this affect them. Because it gave them time to build their own website, they were able to migrate their operations from social media platforms to a proper e-commerce site that has a shopping cart and an integrated payment system. Luckily, the lockdown also afforded their target customers with time and yearning for good music on vinyl while they’re  stuck at home. Robert says that pivoting online is the single best business decision they have made so far. Of course, they couldn’t have done it without Grab. The GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program gives them access to webinars, where they learn how to improve their services and grow their business. Aside from the consistent and reliable services that GrabExpress provides, they also get big savings from their exclusive promos. In Gemma’s own words, Bathgems is “a soapery that offers handcrafted all-natural soaps and bath products that are artisanal in design, world-class in quality, competitive market-wise, and proudly Filipino.” The quality of these products cannot be understated. Customers commend not only the appearance of these soaps but also their effects – many of them now forego lotions or moisturizers!  Unlike other soaps in the market, these products have a unique story. Each soap is environment-friendly, skin-safe, non-carcinogenic, cruelty-free, and fully biodegradable. This is in line with her belief that we need to take care of the environment while we take care of ourselves.  With the character of each product and the meaning behind her brand identified, Gemma continues to prioritize excellent service by making online shopping easier for her customers. This is made possible by GrabExpress. She praises their delivery system, which she describes as quick and precise. She also emphasized the help that the free ad spaces on the Grab App offered to MBC members has helped increase visibility for her products. Agnes began her career with a fascination for Dangwa. She used to buy flowers for her friends until some of them started commissioning her to make bouquets for their loved ones. As a senior in college, she created her first arrangements, which she sold in mason jars at P400 each. Today, Blooms by Agi is her full-time job. She has also expanded to supplying for events and weddings. Following her appreciation for Dangwa, Agnes uses local flowers from Tagaytay, Baguio, and other parts of the Philippines. Supporting the local industry is one of the tenets of her business. When the pandemic forced ports to close and no flowers came in, she and her team organized a fundraising activity for the staff and the entire Dangwa community. She also personally sold pressed flowers in frames, with all the proceeds going to the donations.  It’s no wonder that she’s in full support of the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club program. “On a personal perspective, I love how it empowers Filipino entrepreneurs and gives solutions to small and medium enterprises (SME). They’ve built a community of go-getters and supported them all throughout, which means so much during these trying times.” Melvene grew up drinking fresh tea from her mother’s garden. The business itself is a tribute to her as the concept of Celestea was developed in their final 3 months together. Because of diabetes complications, she went blind and never saw the product. But as Melvene’s first customer, she loved Celestea’s first set of local teas – ginger, turmeric, and lemongrass from their hometown, Nueva Vizcaya – and made the suggestion of offering it to their family and close friends. Two years later, Celestea continues to thrive not just because of Melvene’s passion for locally-sourced teas but also because of her creativity. At the beginning of the lockdown, they were preparing for Mother’s Day and included their essential oil-infused alcogels as part of the curated boxes. When alcohol supplies ran out in stores, they sold their alcogels. With this initiative they were able to stay afloat for a few months, since people would purchase teas with the alcogel. At the beginning of the pandemic, they became dependent on same-day delivery service and used it for all their transactions. This is why she is grateful for GrabExpress MBC’s flat rate promo. Being part of the program has helped them conduct cost-efficient deliveries anywhere in Metro Manila.  Cousins Jacqui and Jam started CocoxFifi in 2013 to earn enough money and be less financially-reliant on their parents. With this homegrown brand, their goal has always been to sell bags and shoes that are stylish, functional, and affordable. This brand has another strength: they have built a lasting relationship with their customers, which they call the #CoFiCommunity.  As an established brand with set operations, the pandemic definitely necessitated several changes to their business. Apart from providing transportation and housing allowance to their employees, they also implemented a work-from-home arrangement. To support local communities in these trying times, they also added more locally-crafted bags and shoes to their product line. But their biggest change was the transition to online selling.  Being part of the Grab Madiskarteng Boss Club has been vital to their continued operations. They praise the discounts and promos offered to business owners as well as the same-day cash-on-delivery (COD) option. What do they love about these? The COD option gives customers a guarantee that they see the product before paying, making them less wary of purchasing online. Meanwhile, same-day delivery guarantees they receive the order immediately. In 2017, Larissa’s father Jojo began working with indigenous farmers in T’Boli. These farmers had arabica beans they did not harvest because they thought no one would be interested in it. Because the area is difficult to reach, production and logistics were also extra laborious – but he knew that the taste of the coffee had potential. He asked Larissa to use her background in storytelling and marketing to create a brand that would honor the farmers they were working with. Thus, The Dream Coffee was born.  Currently in their fourth harvest year with the farmers in T’Boli, their priority remains the same: to have a working sales and resource channel for coffee from T’Boli. They were also one of the few businesses that only had online operations. While in 2017 and 2018 these business decisions were not the norm, the strategy has paid off in 2020. When physical stores closed down, they did not have to make as big of a shift as other businesses. Although it was not easy to continue operations during the ECQ, they were still able to continue providing excellent coffee to their customers through GrabExpress. Through GrabExpress MBC’s many freebies for its members like flat rates, discount and price-off codes, rebates, and free ad spaces, Larissa noted that it has become easier for entrepreneurs to save on operational costs or to create delivery promos for their products and services.  This Instagram shop, run by a group of 11 cousins who live on the same street, began its operations in June, at the height of the sushi bake hype. But an ingenious business decision helped them rise above the crowd. Instead of starting with the traditional kani flavor, they gravitated towards uni (sea urchin), their family’s favorite item on any Japanese menu. Their best-selling flavor – the Truffle Scallop Aburi Sushi Bake – can give you an idea of how unique their products are.  Starting a business in the middle of a pandemic was not an easy feat. Government regulations and putting health and safety as their number one priority meant absolutely no shortcuts could be taken. But they did not let this deter them. They now have customers who have ordered more trays than they can count and some with whom they have already become friends with! Aside from providing quality bakes, the success of their business can be traced to GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club. As a member of the MBC, they were able to save a significant amount through the monthly promo codes and rebates. They also signed up for the promotions and merchant features that ran during sale events, which helps home-based business owners like them utilize tools that would otherwise be too costly and inaccessible. George’s business is the result of her love for her dog, Drogo the Bichon. When she discovered that neem – the active ingredient of the Italian product that solved his recurring skin problems – was available in the country, she made the decision to create her own product. Fetch Naturals products are safe for pets, humans, and the environment. They are the first in the country to create shampoos made out of 100% aqueous plant extracts, not oils. They use a long, low heat procedure that gently and slowly brings out the good properties of the plant in a water soluble form, making it non-toxic to pets and eco-friendly. They are also the first local pet care brand that is registered with the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) on top of being registered with the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). When the pandemic began, they already had a website. Because of this, they were not fully dependent on retail stores. To complement her online set up, she utilized the perks and promos provided by GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club including its free ad spaces for added visibility, and rebates and promos to further entice customers. GrabExpress also gave the business a fast and convenient way to deliver products for a reasonable cost.  Who begins a business in the middle of a pandemic? Only the bravest of us all. Jorge started Fresh Neighborhood Seafood during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) period. As a wine merchant, he had to follow government regulations and stop all sales. Since he had no income, he had to be resourceful. When a mini-market was opened in their multipurpose hall, he learned that there were a lot of vegetable, fruit, and seafood dealers within his neighborhood. Thus, the concept of the business was born: a community of seafood resellers, dealers, and exporters that provide consumers with a wide selection of fresh, premium, and export quality seafood that are all locally-sourced.  What started as a simple online post to help them sell their products to Jorge’s network and contacts became a business with the help of the Madiskarteng Boss Club. With Grab, they were able to implement cashless transactions. They also utilize Grab’s Pabili feature to serve clients who want to pay in cash upon delivery. GrabExpress’ new COD feature has also strengthened their sales because it has enabled them to serve customers who prefer to pay with cash. Owned and managed by powerhouse senior citizen Ada, The Juicery Manila is part of the menu of The Garden Brunch Cafe. Ada personally created the beverage menu for this restaurant, and then decided to sell her concoctions online as well. While it was originally only a simple menu, a lot of customers praised “The Vital Shot” – a ginger, turmeric, lemon mix – because it helped boost their immunity. She currently has a lot of repeat customers, including well-known celebrities. Amid the pandemic and the constant challenge to take care of our health, the demand for the best-selling “The Vital Shot” and all-natural cold-pressed vegetable and fruit juices is high. This meant that there were more orders to manage. But with GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club, this became an easy task.  Grab’s services have allowed Ada to reach more customers. GrabExpress delivery has also helped her dispatch orders quickly, ensuring that customers receive their products within an hour after booking.  For Nicole, one good thing came out of the pandemic – she was able to establish her own online business. Kuya Crepes started as a small initiative with the goal of providing food for frontliners. They wanted to ease the pain of frontliners, who did not have time to eat. Her team decided to send crêpes because these are easy to eat, filling, and delicious – perfect for anyone on the go.  As days passed, they started getting requests from the doctors, nurses, and staff to sell the crepes so they can start sending care packages to their loved ones as well. And the rest is history. They have now sold more than a thousand authentic French crêpes, all made by a chef from Bretagne, France, the crepe capital of the world. Through GrabExpress, they were able to deliver to customers in various areas, even as far as Cavite and Laguna. But more than covering this physical distance, she believes that GrabExpress makes it possible for people to gain new experiences amid the pandemic. “Through GrabExpress, our customers no longer need to leave their houses to experience authentic French crêpes. They don’t even need to go to France! It’s like experiencing France from the comforts of their homes.” Tonette’s business was conceptualized at a very inconspicuous time: over dinner with a group of friends. There was a mention of a meat shop in Farmer’s Market looking for someone to take over. In the beginning, she was told not to waste her time in building an audience on Facebook because meat is usually purchased in markets.  Fast forward to today – she currently manages a Facebook page that she describes as not-so-formal or business-like. Les Aunor Meatshop chats with its customers. “We have conversations about how they cook the meats they bought, pet care, Bible verses, anything and everything.” This revolutionary way of selling meat was made possible with the help of GrabExpress as it made the booking for deliveries easier. Unlike physical stores and markets, they were also able to cater to customers that were nowhere near their area. With GrabExpress MBC, she was able to learn new tips and revolutionize her business model. GrabExpress’ excellent service also gave them added confidence that their products are handled with utmost care.  Carmela isn’t new to the world of online selling. Prior to this brand, she used to sell brand new and preloved clothes and accessories. The success of Likha Lokal can be attributed to its unique concept: they create tote bags that are literally one of a kind. Using retazo and katsa, Carmela works with her seamstress to create a unique pattern for each product. Carmela’s story shows us that passion and ingenuity should always be complemented by innovation. At the start of the pandemic, Likha Lokal’s Facebook account was not properly managed. Now, it has become a catalog for available products and designs. She also had to reorganize her Instagram account to make it more visually appealing for the online market. In addition to this, she’s  also in the process of creating a website for an easier shopping experience for her customers.  She was able to keep abreast of the new technologies available through GrabExpress MBC Exclusive Talks. Aside from the promos that are available to MBC members, she also notes that it’s a relief to have a partner like GrabExpress who ensures that their customers receive products in good condition.  Grace’s business began when she helped a friend design a monogram-style necklace. With the help of Mang Vic – who creates the jewelry she designs – as well as the Barrio Lucnab sewing community and the women of Barangay Vergara in Mandaluyong – who create the canvas bags, pouches, pillowcases, and other fabric products – Monogram Style personalizes various products based on their customers’ preferences.  What do customers love about their monogrammed necklaces, burlap bags, shoe bags, and aprons? The beauty of these products comes from their uniqueness and individuality. These simple items, once styled by this shop, become statement pieces for the wearer. The success of this shop can be attributed to Grace’s hard work and dedication. After identifying the need to focus on online selling, she took the initiative to learn social media marketing and build a strong online presence. Her online education has been strengthened after becoming part of GrabExpress MBC because online talks and other learning opportunities have become available for her and other members of the community.  Nene Prime Foods was one of the first businesses that took advantage of social media platforms to sell and market their products. In 2014, they established this online business. Years later, they are now well-known for their Spicy Bangus in Olive Oil.  However, this long-running business also experienced some setbacks after the onset of the pandemic. To counter these, they shortened their store hours. They also scheduled their deliveries efficiently since there were limited riders and to ensure the safety of everyone as well as maintain the quality of their products. Jennivev describes the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club as the fuel of Nene Prime Foods during the pandemic. Through GrabExpress, they were able to keep conducting deliveries. She notes that without Grab, they probably would’ve put their business on hold. The Madiskarteng Boss talks also motivated them to keep going and persevere despite the challenges they face. In 2019, Carlos and his business partner Darlene Tan both discovered the keto diet and noticed that the market – especially for baking necessities and other treats – was quite small. Because they already had existing connections with suppliers, they decided to help others while taking care of their own needs. Since the shop is managed by partners who both adhere to the keto diet, buying from them also gives you access to other services, such as tips to help combat cravings for the usual high carbohydrate food.  When asked how the pandemic has challenged the business, Carlos mentioned they both feel truly blessed in this time of crisis. The shift to online buying has really boosted their sales. With the help of their trusted courier GrabExpress, they were able to help customers stay indoors and stay safe, while still providing them with their delicious low carbohydrate food. Carlos believes that – aside from the discounts – the best part being a member of the GrabExpress MBC is establishing lasting connections. In the group, Carlos and Darlene have met riders and other business owners. They have all been really generous not just with their friendship but also with sharing their knowledge and tips gathered from the different businesses they are in. Sometimes, business ideas can appear when you least expect it. In 2018, Isabella stumbled upon a Youtube tutorial for handmade soap and fell in love with the process. Using her background in Food Science, she experimented with recipes and eventually came up with her own formulations. Today, she has expanded her offerings to other self-care essentials such as shampoo bars and body scrubs. Aside from their customer-approved scents – which they curate very carefully – what sets Saipo Soap apart is the sustainable advocacy behind it. They use premium, plant-based ingredients and eco-friendly packaging as well as conduct plastic-free delivery within Metro Manila. Promoting this unique brand became their priority amid the pandemic. They focused on their YouTube channel and collaborated with like-minded brands.  The sense of community is also part of what she appreciates about the GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club. She mentioned that communicating with other entrepreneurs is very encouraging, especially since the members of the Madiskarteng Boss Club are always willing to share their knowledge and tips.  When she first started growing succulents, Gugma was a corporate worker who did not have enough time to water her plants 3 times a day. Surprisingly, this became a blessing since succulents, according to this master gardener, thrive on neglect. Her newfound passion eventually paved the way for a thriving business that can be seen in different Papemelroti branches, bazaars, weddings, celebrations, newspapers, magazines, and social media. Gugma stressed that she is a plant parent first before an entrepreneur. This is evident in her products. While SucculentsPH is known for its wooden terrariums, not many know that they have only sold plants that they have personally cared for. Their purchase process is also unique as they directly work with their clients to select plants based not just on their preference but also on their capability to care for the plant’s needs in terms of light, water, and ventilation. As a business with a lot of physical stores, the pandemic posed a huge challenge in the form of supplementing not just the lost sales of their retail partner stores but also the hundreds of plants consigned and left at the mall for months without sunlight and water. They focused their efforts on strengthening their online shop and focused on selling indoor plants, soil mix, top stones, and garden tools with the help of their delivery partner, GrabExpress.  Filipino entrepreneurship is now shifting towards online and digital operations to keep up with the changing demands of the market. For any aspiring entrepreneur, integrating business and  technology should be the foremost priority.  GrabExpress Madiskarteng Boss Club makes it easier for local businesses, no matter how big or small, to operate.

Grabbing our daily caffeine fix. Eating in our favorite restaurants. Commuting to work. But now that we continue to spend our days devoid of normalcy despite the easing of quarantine rules, many are missing everyday things no matter how mundane they seem.   Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading everyday app, understands that adapting to this new reality may be challenging for most of us. So, to bring comfort and delight to Filipinos in these trying times, they’re helping us re-experience the things that we miss about our normal lives through the #SagotKita project. Through a crowdsourcing social post published last June 6, Grab randomly chose 3 lucky people and granted their everyday wishes. Rose Tapang-Feliciano, finding comfort in hakaw and her husband  Rose was busy preparing to move out of her housing unit inside the UP Campus before the pandemic struck. “I opted for early retirement as a faculty member of the UP College of Mass Communication effective January 2020,” she said.  At first, she didn’t mind the lockdown and being quarantined at home since she was preoccupied with sorting and packing. The reality of the enhanced community quarantine only hit her when she realized she and her husband couldn’t move their things out. “We were indeed locked in with no freedom of movement – us and our stuff!” When she saw Rappler’s post last June 6, she was at first dubious. But then she thought, “katuwaan kung baga” so she wrote her answer – visiting her 90-year-old mother in Baguio monthly and eating yang chow rice, sweet and sour pork, and hakaw with her husband at HapChan.  Two days after, she received a message from Grab. She was so surprised that she checked the Facebook page of the person who messaged her, thinking it might be a prank. “But it was kinda funny because just an hour before I got the message from Grab, I had just ordered wonton noodles and siopao from HapChan for our snacks, which my husband and I agreed would already be our dinner,” Rose said. “Then the message came! It’s a good thing that what I wished for was different from what I ordered for our merienda. As an afterthought, I jokingly told my husband, ‘Sana dinagdagan ko pa yung wish ko!’ Totoo pala ang news/promo na ito’ (I should have wished for more. This news/promo is true)”.  Analyn Tenedero, providing milk for her child  Analyn Tenedoro has 7 children. With her meager income from selling fruits in the streets and her husband out of job because of the community quarantine, she’s thankful to Grab for granting her wish.   “Wala na po kasi kaming pambili ng gatas dahil sa mahal na presyo. Pero yun lang po ang nirerekomenda ng doctor ng heart center (We can’t afford to buy it because it’s expensive. But we have no choice because it’s the only milk recommended by my child’s doctor at the heart center), she said.   She was so excited to receive the milk for her child that they waited outside as soon as she was informed that GrabExpress is on its way. “Maraming-maraming salamat po dahil pinagbigyan niyo ang wish ko (Thank you so much for granting my wish),” she said.  James Velasco, hustling with the help of his wife It’s not just them that Grab has been trying to help adapt to the new reality. They’ve also been granting the wishes of their driver-partners and providing relief as they continue to work amid the health crisis. James is a part-time GrabExpress rider and volunteer messenger for AcessiWheels, a PWD transportation service. Ever since the community quarantine started, his wife, Mean, had to scrimp on their budget. So even though his worn-out pair of shoes for work already needed replacing, it had to wait because they had to prioritize their household expenses.   This is why James was so surprised when Mean suddenly gave him a new pair of high cut shoes. “Huli ko na po nalaman eh. Nung natanggap ko na, saka niya lang sinabi kung saan galing (I only knew where the shoes came from when she gave it to me),” he said.  Through GrabPay, Grab was able to grant her wish for a new pair of shoes to help protect her husband’s prosthetic leg. This opportunity, Mean said, came at a perfect time because it served as a belated birthday gift and advanced Father’s day gift for James.   To show their commitment to being every Filipino’s partner in life, Grab continues to provide various services to help the public perform personal and business transactions while still observing proper health measures through GrabPay, GrabExpress, GrabMart, and GrabFood.  Aside from granting wishes for things Filipinos miss, Grab is also giving over 100 deals for us to enjoy from June 8 until July 5: As Grab celebrates its 8th anniversary this year, they want to assure us that they got our backs. “Si Grab muna ang bahala.”  – Rappler.com  Grab assures Filipinos that they have a partner in threading this new normal.

Under Memorandum Circular 2020-18 signed on Thursday, May 14, the LTFRB said that  its regional offices will determine the number of vehicles to be deployed, depending on “demand.” Taxis and TNVS are still prohibited in Metro Manila because of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), but the memorandum said that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases will determine the number of vehicles once the capital region is under GCQ. The LTFRB also required operators to enforce a cashless payment scheme. Which taxis and TNVS can operate? The memorandum covers all taxi and TNVS operators that have a valid certificate of public convenience or provisional authority from the LTFRB, as well as those whose permits expired starting March 17. As LTFRB will determine the number of allowed units, transport network companies will have to submit a list of qualified TNVS operators. The regulatory board, meanwhile, will provide the TNC the final list of qualified taxi operators, after the firm submits the initial list of taxi drivers within their system. This means that all taxi operators must be under a TNC, such as dominant ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines and taxi-hailing app MiCab. To date, there are 9 accredited ride-hailing companies, including Owto, Hirna, ePickMeUp, GoLag, Hype, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. TNVS operators must submit to their home TNCs photocopies of their certificate of registration, Land Transportation Office (LTO) official receipt, and passenger insurance policy. TNCs must provide the LTFRB the taxi and TNVS operator’s name, case number, plate number, chassis number, and type of electronic payment in case of street-hailed passengers. \n\n Health measures: Under the Department of Transportation guidelines, TNVS and taxis should only be allowed 3 passengers, apart from the driver. The LTFRB also set safety protocols to minimize the risk of infection: Starting May 16, Metro Manila, Laguna, and Cebu City will be under modified ECQ. The rest of the country would be either under GCQ or modified GCQ, where public transportation is allowed.

Wastage has been an issue as goods go undelivered because of the lockdown, leading to higher prices. The hope is that the new monitoring tools will allow the supply chain to function more efficiently.  “Kadiwa on Wheels” will also be able to monitor where the goods may be most needed, and upon identification of these areas, the mobile market of sorts will be able to reach consumers directly.  “Because of COVID-19, food affordability, not only availability, becomes critical.  The threat of food affordability is as real as hunger itself.

A few years after launching their transport services in the Philippines, they saw an even bigger opportunity to improve people’s lives. From “GrabTaxi”, they went with just “Grab” to complement their renewed ambition –  to be an everyday, everything app.  Today, whether you’re referring to how you’ll get home or where you’ll get food (Mag ga-grab lang ako), the word “Grab” has become synonymous with convenience. RJ Cabaluna, Grab Philippines’ country marketing head, said that he’d describe 2019 as a year that GrabFood and GrabPay have grown so much.  GrabFood just celebrated their 1st anniversary last November yet with the milestones that they’ve achieved, having been recognized by a global market research firm as the most used food delivery platform in the Philippines, it’s as if they’ve been in the playing field long enough to know what makes every Pinoy tick.  This inspired GrabFood Philippines Head EJ dela Vega and his team to amp up their efforts to provide more economic opportunities for Filipinos. Now, they’re in more than 37 areas in the Philippines including Laguna, Pampanga, Metro Cebu, Bacolod, and Iloilo. This means that Grab currently has more than 10,000 merchant-partners that range from luxury restaurants, fast-food chains, down to mom-and-pop stores and Makati’s famous Jolly Jeeps.   24 Chicken, one of the recognized breakthrough merchants at Grab’s first Golden Lunchbox Awards credits GrabFood for their increased revenue. “When GrabFood was introduced to us, our sales doubled or sometimes even tripled. From 1 branch, we now have around 10 branches in two years because of GrabFood. We weren’t expecting an influx of customers but with Grab, we now serve more customers than before,” said Jeff Uy and Jeff Sy, owners of 24 Chicken.  2019 is also the year Grab launched Grab for Good, a social impact program that aims to empower MSMEs and promote financial inclusion.  In a report they released last September,  9 million people in Southeast Asia are now using the platform to earn an income and grow their businesses. Alicia Laqi, owner of Sisig sa Rada, one of the Jolly Jeeps in Makati, said that GrabFood has helped her increase her revenue by allowing her to reach more people. “While the queue for my food already reaches far beyond a normal line, my revenues rose sharply because of the addition of GrabFood. It helped complement my already popular small stall and allowed me to earn more without adding a new branch,” she said.  Aside from providing jobs and helping microentrepreneurs expand their businesses, they’ve also started offering loans to driver-partners and MSMEs to help them grow their businesses or get them through emergency expenses.  Another innovation GrabFood is also proud of is the launch of GrabKitchen. GrabKitchen offers customers an on-demand delivery and in-store dining experience through a self-order kiosk. They offer users in a particular city a variety of food selections in one kitchen.  They opened a branch in Glorietta 2 and partnered with the following merchants: Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean, and CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice.  GrabKitchen helps MSMEs reach more clients without incurring additional costs. While cloud kitchens are usually delivery-only in nature, Grab Philippines added the dine-in experience knowing that Filipinos love to eat together and share their food.  Grab Philippines is also making waves through GrabPay. Now that customers can pay for their GrabFood deliveries, shopping items and groceries, bills and utilities, and more using the platform’s cashless payment method – the GrabPay wallet, more Filipinos are now ditching cash for a hassle-free transaction. For Jonathan Bates, head of GrabPay, this is their way of helping reduce the number of unbanked Filipinos or those who don’t have their own bank accounts.  Building on the idea of Grab being no longer just about transport, Bates, says that their goal in 2020 is to bring the convenience of cashless to as many Filipinos as possible. Thanks to their partnership with SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) and other partners, it has begun. Today, GrabPay can now be used to pay for GrabFood deliveries from over 10,000 restaurant partners, more than 5000  shopping, grocery and food outlets nationwide such as SM Stores, Starbucks and more, and pay for bills and utilities. Bates plans to make this platform available in cities outside the metro and eventually make Grab a 100% cashless app.  While Grab Philippines’ ambition has evolved, their passion to make an impact on communities remains the same.  With their expansion, Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president, recognizes the important role they play in addressing socio-economic challenges. May it be about championing financial literacy, giving safer transportation or offering additional income streams, he vows to help more Filipinos both living inside and outside Metro Manila thrive this 2020. For Cu, everyone can grow with Grab.   Cu and the rest of the executives of Grab Philippines are dedicated towards creating an impact by leveling the playing field and improving the quality of life for everyone. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/249709-road-legitimizing-motorcycle-taxis/","title":"The long road to legalizing motorcycle taxis in the Philippines","date":"Jan 20, 2020 1:01 PM PHT","snippet":"At least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seek to amend the 55-year-old Land Transportation and Traffic Code","body":"AT A GLANCE {source}<hr />{/source} MANILA, Philippines – Every day after work, Jenlain Impat, 26, finds herself rushing to go home to take care of her one-year-old baby. The fare is cheap. It would only take a total of P25 for her to travel from her office in Urdaneta Village in Makati City to her home in San Juan City – but that’s the case only if she’s willing to spend more than an hour stuck in EDSA and another 30-minute jeepney ride to their house. She’s not. “Alam mo [ang] traffic sa Makati, hindi uubra ang normal commute. Sayang oras mo,” Impat told Rappler. (You how the traffic is in Makati. Your normal commute won’t do. Your time is wasted.) As a new mom, Impat started using the pioneer motorcycle taxi app Angkas to book trips, even if that meant a higher fare. By booking a motorcycle taxi, her commute time is now down to 30 minutes. “Before kasi umuuwi ako ng San Juan or Antipolo, super traffic ‘pag rush hour. And being a mom, gusto ko mabilis makauwi sa baby ko for quality time, kahit ‘yung pamasahe is P25, if naka-Angkas ako, P150 to P170 depende sa surge,” Impat said. (Before, whenever I go home to San Juan or Antipolo, traffic is heavy during rush hour. And being a mom, I want to get home immediately to spend quality time with my baby, even if that increases fare from just P25 to, if I would choose Angkas, around P150 to P170, depending on the surge rate.) Ana Lubiano, 25, is another regular user of motorcycle taxis. She found it as a cheaper option than other ride-hailing services such as Grab. “Kaya talaga ako gumagamit ng Angkas is to beat traffic, lalo na ‘pag nakikita ko na malala na ‘yung traffic. Mase-save ka talaga ‘nya para hindi ka ma-late, kasi nga motor. So p’wedeng sumingit-singit, hindi katulad if naka-4 wheels, ka stuck ka na – stress ka pa talaga – sa traffic,” Lubiano said. (The reason why I’m using apps like Angkas is to beat traffic, especially when I see that traffic congestion is bad. It will really save you so that you won’t be late because you’re using a motorcycle. Motorcycles can cut in between vehicles, unlike 4-wheeled cars that can get you stuck – and stressed – in traffic.) Whenever she finds it hard to book a ride on Angkas, which is usually the case now since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) imposed a 10,000-rider cap per firm, Lubiano would “book” habal-habal on Facebook. “‘Pag mahirap mag-book and walang available na Angkas within the area, no choice na kundi ‘yung sa FB group or mga Habal sa daan,” Lubiano said. (When it’s hard to book and there’s no available Angkas within the area, I don’t have a choice but book on Facebook or hail one on the streets.) Mobility as service The prospects of a “dignified commute” in Metro Manila seem bleak in the short term, as the population growth rate continues to accelerate to a point that is beyond the current public transportation’s capacity. According to a report by Bloomberg, driving a kilometer in Metro Manila has worsened in 2019. In September 2019, data from navigation app Waze showed that it took an average of 5 minutes per kilometer to travel around Metro Manila, longer than the April record of 3.8 minutes per kilometer. The population outlook for Metro Manila is not seen to decrease in the coming years either, as a United Nation report in 2018 showed that the metropolis is projected to have an annual increase of 1.9% in the next decade. Because of heavier traffic in cities, “mobility as a service” has been on the rise to provide an alternative mode of transportation that is faster than current options, according to a 2017 report by United Kingdom-based financial consultancy firm Deloitte. “Mobility as a service” is a model taken on by ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber, and the new motorcycle taxi firms JoyRide and MoveIt, along with Angkas. While more Filipino commuters shift to motorcycle taxis as their preferred mode of transportation because of its ability to “beat traffic,” the motorcycle-hailing industry may hit a dead-end, pending the passage of a law that would allow its permanent operations. The long and winding road to legalization As early as 2017, the government led the crackdown on motorcycle-hailing services of Angkas because it is illegal. (READ: Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition)   But even then, underground habal-habal operations were already widespread, it’s just that Angkas was able to train the bikers to drive more safely. Romeo Maglunsod, who used to be a habal-habal driver before joining Angkas, said this in one of the public consultation hearings at the LTFRB in 2017. The point is to regulate instead of turning a blind eye, Maglunsod said. Under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was enacted 55 years ago, motorcycles can only be registered as private or government vehicles. Therefore, it can’t be used by its owners to carry passengers and be paid for it. In the 17th Congress, bills amending the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was tackled by the House of Representatives and the Senate. House lawmakers passed their version of the bill in February 2019, but it remained pending under the Senate committee on public services, which Senator Grace Poe headed. In one of the Senate hearings in 2019, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to just issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate, just like what it did with Grab and Uber (when the latter was still here). Arguing that legislation is the way to go, the DOTr started the 6-month pilot run, which was extended by 3 months to March 23, 2020. The point of this pilot implementation is to “collect” data that may be used by lawmakers when crafting the bill. However, on Monday, January 20, the inter-agency technical working group overseeing the test run terminated it – more than two months earlier than end of the extension period. The announcement was made just as Senate committee on public services was about to start its hearing on the matter. Proposals In the 18th Congress, there are at least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seeking to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. All of these carry more or less the same language: {source} <blockquote style=”border-left: 5px solid #FFD700;“> Section 7. Registration Classification. Every motor vehicle shall be registered under one of the following prescribed classifications: (a) XXX (b) XXX (c) XXX … (j) XXX and (k) motorcycles-for-hire. </blockquote> {/source} At the Senate, Poe, Recto, and senators Juan Edgardo Angara and Imee Marcos have filed separate proposals to legalize motorcycle taxis. Poe and Recto propose that motorcycles-for-hire must be less than 1,000 kilograms in weight, can travel more than 50 kilometers per hour, and has an engine capacity of 125 cubic centimeters. In the proposals of Poe, Angara, and Marcos, government regulators would be mandated to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycle taxis before registration. No modification shall be made apart from the luggage carrier at the back, a saddlebag, a foot peg, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring devices. In Poe’s bill, there is a section on fare setting, specifically saying that LTFRB should “determine, prescribe, approve, and periodically review and adjust” reasonable fares for the operation of motorcycle taxi services. Meanwhile, Marcos, in her proposal, “urges” local government units (LGUs) to issue guidelines for the operations of motorcycle taxis in their jurisdictions. She also proposed that the Land Transportation Office require insurance for passengers and cargo. Similar measures have been filed by Muntilupa Representative Ruffy Biazon, Batangas 6th District Representative Vilma Santos-Recto, Quezon City 2nd District Representative Pecious Castelo, and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas. Meanwhile, majority of the bills in the House of Representatives include the proposal for motorcycles-for-hire to only be allowed “for a limited period, with limited number of units and in specific routes only,” which should be determined by the DOTr and the LTFRB, in coordination with LGUs. At least 11 congressmen argue that the transportation department should give priority to higher-capacity vehicles or mass transit sytems. This specific measures have been separately filed by Makati City Representative Romulo Peña Jr, Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Barba, Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, South Cotabato 2nd District Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, Bohol 1st District Representative Edgar Chatto, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Luis Villafuerte, Cebu City 1st District Representative Raul del Mar, the late LPGMA Representative Rodolfo Albano III, and Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio Albano, and Quezon City 6th District Representative Tyrone Agabas. Instead of adding another classification specific to motorcycles-for-hire, Makati City 2nd District Representative Luis Campos’ bill proposes to amend Section 7 (c) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to allow the registration of motorcycles “either as private or public utility vehicle.” ‘It’s needed’ As traffic congestion worsens, Impat and Lubiano said it’s even more important for lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow commuters like them to have options to beat traffic, save their time, and use it somewhere else. “[Motorcycle taxis like] Angkas helps commuters to beat the traffic, especially in Metro Manila. I can say, they can be considered as part of the solution,” Lubiano told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. “Regulations lang din [kailangan] kasi sa super traffic ngayon. Heaven-sent ‘yung may option ka na mas mapabilis ‘yung travel time mo, given na ‘pag rush hour talagang almost two hours ang b’yahe na ‘pag sa Angkas 30 minutes mo lang makukuha,” Impat said. (Authorities only need to regulate them. Because of the heavy traffic nowadays, it’s heaven-sent to have an option that would make your travel faster, especially during rush hour when you would have to spent almost two hours, but which an Angkas ride can shorten to 30 minutes.) Public Works Secretary Mark Villar says some road projects will be done by 2020, removing private car volume along main roads. But in terms of public commute, majority of big-ticket railway projects are set to be in partial operations only by the end of the Duterte administration or in 2022. However, if commuters are to escape horrors of current state of public transportation between now and 2022, lawmakers will need to make motorcyle taxis stay on the streets – legally. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/248481-philippines-strengthens-crackdown-competition-law/","title":"Philippines strengthens crackdown on consumer fraud","date":"Jan 4, 2020 8:17 AM PHT","snippet":"The Department of Justice boosts witness protection for whistleblowers against businesses that violate the Philippine Competition Act","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is strengthening its crackdown on violators of the Competition Act with new policy adjustments coming from both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Supreme Court. The DOJ is crafting new rules for what it calls its “leniency program” that will give protection to whistleblowers of businesses engaged in anti-competitive practices. The High Court, meanwhile, has designated special courts that will focus on trying cases involving Republic Act No. 10667 or the Philippine Competition Act. RA 10667 ensures markets remain competitive, so that consumers can enjoy lower prices. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is a quasi-judicial body tasked to implement the law. It recently made headlines for imposing penalties on ride-sharing app Grab Philippines.  New programs Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete said the new rules to institute the leniency program will be finalized in late January. “The leniency program allows for a respondent, someone who participated in a criminal act, to be exculpated from criminal prosecution if he or she will testify,” Perete said. He added, “We have to take into consideration the reality that those who would enter into an anti-competitive agreement would probably have a lot of resources so you want an incentive for witnesses to testify, and protection for them as well.” In a notice of resolution dated December 10, 2019, but released only on Friday, January 3, the Supreme Court has designated as competition courts the previous special commercial courts in Quezon City, Manila, Makati, Pasig, Cebu City, Iloillo City, Davao City, and Cagayan De Oro City. These assignments are additions to new rules made by the High Court in September 2019, where it laid down procedures for application, issuance, and implementation of inspection orders for administrative investigations by the PCC.

The extended pilot run included two new players, JoyRide and Move It, which will now operate alongside pioneer motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas until March 23.  The objective of the pilot run supervised by the TWG is to determine the viability of motorcycles as a mode of public transportation. The TWG earlier said that it heard proposals from 4 other players which were denied entry into the pilot run. But in a press briefing on Friday, January 3, Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection (LCSP) member Ariel Inton said that a total of 9 other groups applied to join the motorcycle taxi pilot run but were denied entry by the TWG. These include: Inton questioned why these applicants were not granted entry, saying the TWG did not explain its evaluation of each provider. LCSP member Raymond Fortun said TWG Chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr would be one of the respondents, along with other members of the TWG who participated in the decision-making. Fortun questioned the mandate of Gardiola as the chairman of the TWG, since the initial 6-month pilot run guidelines were approved by Transportation Undersecretary Mark de Leon and signed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade.  The revised guidelines for the extension, however, were only signed by Gardiola and Land Transportation Office Chief Edgar Galvante. Gardiola is also a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. (DOCUMENT: Updated guidelines on the motorcycle taxi pilot run)  Fortun claimed that the Department of Transportation did not release a department order delegating the TWG as the one solely responsible for the pilot implementation of motorcycle taxis. The lawyers also reiterated their earlier complaints that the TWG failed to consult civil society groups, such as commuter welfare and road safety advocates, in deciding on the extension as well as the inclusion of new players. According to Fortun, they are filing the complaint early next week. But Gardiola seemed unfazed. “No [problem], we will face it,” he told Rappler in a text message. However, he did not clarify the basis for accepting only two out of the 11 applicants into the pilot run. What about Pimentel? Inton and Fortun said that the LCSP was also contemplating filing an ethics complaint against Pimentel for his endorsement. Fortun questioned why JoyRide had to secure assistance from Pimentel in its bid to join the pilot run. “Nababahiran ng dungis ‘yung ginawa ng senador (The senator’s endorsement is tainted),” Fortun said. Fortun cited Section 4b of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, which states that public officials must act with the highest degree of professionalism. Trixie Angeles also pointed out the option of having the Senate ethics committee discipline the senator. Earlier, Pimentel justified his endorsement, saying he did it to prevent Angkas from being a monopoly. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/science/247971-philippines-explores-unchartered-territories-sciences-2019/","title":"2019: PH explores unchartered territories in sciences","date":"Dec 26, 2019 8:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Here's a rundown of some of the most exciting and memorable scientific stories in the Philippines in 2019","body":" MANILA, Philippines – 2019 was a good year for science in the Philippines. The country fared relatively well in the 2019 Global Innovation Index, climbing up 19 places from 73rd in 2018 to 54th this year. Sharing the headlines this year were groundbreaking discoveries, from a new human species to the largest known volcano worldwide. A series of laws were passed in support of the scientific community; and a couple of initiatives happened, proving that the country is embarking on a seemingly unchartered territory: space science and technology. Here’s a rundown of some of the most exciting and memorable scientific stories in the Philippines in 2019. When Filipino archaeologist Armand Mijares unearthed ancient human bones in Callao Cave in Cagayan, they didn’t know how huge the impact of the findings in the Philippines would be until they confirmed that the bones belong to a previously unknown species of human called Homo luzonensis. The discovery not only cemented the Philippines’ place on the map of archaeological expeditions, it also changed world history – textbooks have to be rewritten to include this new species in teaching the history of human evolution.  Meanwhile, off the coast of Aurora is a 13-million-hectare underwater plateau called Benham Rise, part of the Philippines’ continental shelf. Within Benham Rise, a group of scientists led by a Filipino marine geophysicist Jenny Baretto discovered the largest caldera in the world. A caldera is a crater-like formation after a volcano erupted. Aptly named Apolaki Caldera – after the Filipino mythology god of sun and war – it has a diameter of about 150 kilometers, according to the Facebook post by the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UP MSI) Geological Oceanography Laboratory.  A team of app developers from Caraga State University-Butuan led by Angelito Cagulada Jr and instructor Ernest Jay Cubillas has created Transeek, a Grab-like tricycle hailing app for Butuan commuters. Now in its beta stage, users are raving about the effectiveness of the app in making their commute safer and more efficient. Up north in Metro Manila, the country’s first hybrid train made its inaugural run on May 6. The five-coach train uses hybrid diesel-powered generator and batteries, like what hybrid electric cars use. It is about 12 meters in length, and has a maximum capacity of 880 passengers. This locally-made hybrid-electric train seeks to augment the number of trains used by the Philippine National Railways.  President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law a number of legislations that are deemed beneficial for the scientific community. Among them are Republic Act No. 11312 or the Magna Carta for Scientists. Under this law, workers in the science and technology sector are expected to receive more benefits.    Another law that was passed this year is the Philippine Innovation Act or Republic Act No. 11293. This law establishes the National Innovation Council which will set the national innovation agenda and strategy. The law backs the promotion of technology to enhance the competitiveness of micro-, small- and medium-scale enterprises.  The President also signed into law Republic Act No. 11337 or the Innovative Startup Act which seeks to “strengthen, promote and develop” the Philippine startup ecosystem.  But the top science-related law that was enacted this year is arguably the Philippine Space Act or Republic Act No. 11363. The law establishes the Philippine Space Agency as well as the Philippine Space Development and Utilization Policy. This landmark legislation proves that the Philippines is ready to embark on new heights when it comes to space science and technology.  At the same time, the University of the Philippines and the Department of Science and Technology-Advanced Science and Technology Institute launched a space lab named ULyS3ES, a hub for space technology research and development. This initiative follows the series of satellite launches the Philippines has done over the past few years, with Diwata-1, Diwata-2, and Maya-1 successfully flying into orbit. The Philippines also established its largest Ground Receiving Station for satellite data and information in Davao City this year.  This year, agronomist and former UP President Emil Javier was conferred the title and rank of National Scientist, joining 41 others, 11 of whom are still living. “[Javier] led and promoted sound agricultural policies and programs, massive utilization of climate-resilient and environment-friendly agricultural innovations, and improved governance and management systems to help improve the livelihood of Filipino farmers and fisherfolk,” according to the Proclamation. Meanwhile, National Scientist Edgardo Gomez, a known conservationist and marine scientist, passed away this year. He pioneered research on the state of coral reefs on a national scale. He was also known for establishing the UP MSI. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/245508-grab-riders-rebate-range/","title":"Grab says riders to get rebate of ‘less than a peso to over P100’","date":"Nov 22, 2019 1:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines also insists that 'no overcharging happened' as the higher fares were driven by 'uncontrollable factors' such as booking demand and traffic conditions","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab riders would have to manage their expectations as the ride-hailing company clarified on Friday, November 22, that that some of them may get a rebate of “below P1” and others over P100. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu made the statement in a news briefing on the P5.05-million refund that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) had ordered the company to give to its customers. “If we take P5 million over 3 million (riders), the average that the passenger would get is around P1.50. There are some that will get below a peso, there are others who will get over a hundred pesos,” Cu said Grab Philippines said that there were 3.2 million riders from February to May 2019, the time period covered by the penalties. Miguel Aguila, lead legal counsel of Grab Philippnines, said that the amount each rider will get will be “proportionate” to the amount that they spent during that time period.  “If you are a rider [who] spent P1,000, you should get 10 times more than a rider who just paid for P100. So as much as possible we want it to be proportionate,” Aguila said in a mix of Filipino and English. The PCC had ordered Grab to refund P5.05 million to its riders as the company had breached its pricing commitments to the government agency. Grab  had said that it looked forward to paying its passengers, and will announce the mechanics at least 5 days before the refund. Cu said on Friday that the payment will be sourced from the company’s contingency funds. He also emphasized that drivers will not be affected by the fines. Cu also maintained that there was “no overcharging,” saying that the company was compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB. “Walang overcharging na nangyari (No overcharging happened). So even if we disclose to consumers how we charge, which we do in the receipt, sang-ayon naman ‘to sa fare matrix ng [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] (It is compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB),” Cu said. Cu cited “uncontrollable factors” such as booking demand, traffic conditions and the supply of transport network vehicle services, that kept them from maintaining the fare range imposed by the PCC. The refund procedures have yet to be announced. The guidelines will be available in Grab’s mobile app and social media platforms 5 days before the refund.

We believe education should be accessible to everyone, specifically, tech and digital literacy,” said Andrea Della Mattea, president of Microsoft Asia Pacific. “This encourages ingenuity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, all of which are key to the future.” Grab claims that over 6.6 million workers across the 6 major Southeast Asian countries are going to require reskilling by 2028. Approximately 41% of that number reportedly lack relevant IT skills that new jobs will demand. To narrow the digital skills gap, Grab and Microsoft are combining their resources and ecosystems to fulfill their shared vision to make the economic opportunities in technology accessible for people in Southeast Asia. They aim to train a total of 20,000 people in the region by 2025. There are 3 ways the partnership plans to achieve this. One is by partnering with select universities across the region to train students with technical skills that are in demand by industry. Microsoft will provide the learning materials, curriculum, and certifications, as well as Azure for Education, a platform that provides students access to developer tools for applications; while Grab will facilitate learning experiences such as hackathons and internships. Grab has yet to announce which schools they partnered with. Another way is by providing Grab driver partners access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification program, which has basic courses covering topics such as computer basics, using the Internet, and productivity software. The driver can be awarded a Microsoft certification for free upon completion of the course. These will all be available in the driver’s Grab app. Grab and Microsoft will also help drivers interested in pursuing a career in tech by letting them enroll in a practicum-based curriculum developed by the nonprofit organization Generation: You Employed, or receive certification in Microsoft proprietary courses. Those who will graduate will have opportunities to work for Grab and Microsoft partner companies in technology-related roles. “If the private sector actively creates programs for local communities, technology can be within reach for many, and the learning of new skills can immediately improve the livelihoods for many more people in Southeast Asia,” said Anthony Tan, CEO of Grab. Meanwhile, Grab plans to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs running mom-and-pop shops by digitizing their business and having them integrate the platform’s services so they can reach a bigger market. They also plan to provide them economic access through loans and lending services that can give them the capital they need to scale their business In the Philippines, Grab will start with Jollijeep mobile food stalls by offering them access to GrabFood food delivery and GrabPay cashless payments to help them grow and compete with newer restaurants. The project is expected to kick off within the year and will be expanded to other traditional and home businesses moving forward. The other flagship initiative that was announced is called “Break the Silence”. It looks to champion inclusivity by offering differently-abled people such as those who are deaf and the hearing-impaired an opportunity to earn their own income by becoming a Grab driver partner. At the event, Grab announced they will expand the initiative to Indonesia and Singapore and enhance it in countries where it’s already running – like Thailand and Malaysia. The company currently has over 500 deaf driver partners on the platform and plans to double this number over the coming year. The initiative currently cannot work in the Philippines as the Land Transportation Office does not issue professional driver’s licenses to people who are deaf or have other disabilities. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/239813-apple-september-2019-event-announcements/","title":"Everything Apple announced at its September 2019 event","date":"Sep 11, 2019 1:01 AM PHT","snippet":"Check out our list of announcements from Apple's September 2019 event!","body":" MANILA, Philippines – If you’re looking forward to new gadgets and devices from tech giant Apple, you’re in luck!  Apple announced a number of new devices and initiatives, including its latest iPhones, at its event on Wednesday, September 11, Manila time.

We want to take more responsibilities and see how we can use our platform and technology to create Grab for good for all Filipinos. And we’re starting with the SMEs,” said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president. “SMEs are considered the backbone of Asian economies, making up 99.6% of businesses in the country. Yet, they contribute only a fraction of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).”   Cu also shared that Grab aims to put at least 1000 more SMEs on the map to allow businesses to be discoverable in-app. Some of the enterprises featured at the fair were Aysees Sisig, Nathaniel’s buko pandan, Ate Rica’s bacsilog, La Paz Batchoy of Liezl’s, Empanada Nation, Bulalugaw, Uncle Moe’s Shawarma, and Cow Wow’s sausages. “We wanted to bring Ilocano dishes in Manila because there’s a lot of Ilocanos here and we saw its potential. People no longer have to travel to Ilocos. Their empanada now is just one Grab away,” said Ellice Chew, owner of Empanada Nation.  Asked how Grab has helped them build their business, Chew said that they were able to reach more people through GrabFood. Meanwhile, Ate Rica’s bacsilog franchisee, Gregory Chen, shared how he decided to promote Filipino classic silog dishes.  “Lagi ko siya kinakain noong college. Nag stick siya even until graduation. So, nung nalaman ko na nag-fa-franchise na siya, I grabbed the chance (I have been a fan of Ate Rica’s bacsilog since college. It stuck with me even until graduation so when I heard that she opened it up for franchise, I grabbed the chance),” he said.  Grab helped Chan’s business bounce back when he took the chance and signed up for GrabFood.  Aside from food enterprises, #GrabNakakaLOKAL Festival also featured Filipino craftsmen and businesses in partnership with Karton, an alternative online shopping platform dedicated to local businesses like Auro Chocolate, Natural Balance, The Green Tummy,Bebebalm, Lick Iced Tea, and Foodsource. The GoLokal team of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) was also present to highlight Filipino crafted, designed, and produced products that span from different regions across the country. The #GrabNakakaLOKAL Festival will run until the end of August, every Friday and Saturday at  Central Square, Bonifacio Global City and The Market by Sugbo in Mandaue City, Cebu.  “We have always been inspired by the power of technology when used for good, and we at Grab, would like to harness that asset to empower more Filipinos to live better lives every day,” said Cu. – Rappler.com   Go to #GrabNakakaLOKAL Festival and pay using GrabPay to get 15% discount on all food and Karton concessionaires and participate in NakakaLOKAL MVP, Grab’s in-app challenge where you can win tours, flight tickets, and more.

Claiming to be the first in the country, Hakoot developer Efren Jamolod Jr. – a Dapitanon working as software architect in Linköping, Sweden – said he, together with his brother Jesrome – a software engineer in Cebu City – developed two applications for the system, one for the garbage collectors and the other for the residents and establishments. “Through their cellphones, residents and establishments can in real time inform garbage collection management (of) the volume and kind of garbage they want to dispose,” Efren said.  He added the city’s solid waste management receives feedback and input, enabling them to efficiently manage the routes of their garbage trucks, effectively dispatch garbage trucks and crew, and decide whether there is a need to send garbage trucks for another round. Efren added Hakoot enables residents and establishments to monitor through their cellphones the location and direction of garbage trucks. An existing ordinance provides that garbage should be taken out to the streets only when garbage collectors arrive.  “Hakoot enables residents to know when to take out their garbage, unlike the present set up wherein residents and establishments have to watch out the whole day for the garbage truck that sometimes doesn’t come,” he said.  Efren also stressed that the maximum effectiveness of Hakoot remains dependent on solid waste management infrastructure – having enough garbage trucks and collectors and the establishment of Material Recovery Facilities and the main residual containment facility.  “We have the residual containment facility, but we still have to prod each barangay leadership to establish their own material recovery facilities, and worst we don’t have garbage trucks, we just borrow two dump trucks from the Engineering Office,” Alvi Agolong, head of Dapitan’s Solid Waste Management operations, said, The problem with borrowing trucks is a borrowed truck can only be used for a single round on its route every day, “and it has to be sent back for engineering works,” Agolong said. Dapitan has only about 5  tons of garbage daily, which can be met up with 3 to 4 garbage trucks and about 32 collectors and drivers.  At present, Agolong admitted they can hardly collect the city’s garbage, “particularly if the schedule is disrupted when the aging dump trucks bog down or if trucks are already full before its routes are completely covered.” Efren noted, “Frustrated residents have no one else to go to but social media.” He added, “We were troubled, annoyed with the rants of our fellow Dapitanons on uncollected garbage, that’s why I called up my brother telling him we have to do something.”  “Thus the birth of Hakoot, but we will continue on improving the software through the feedback of those in the solid waste management (department) and the residents and establishments. Hakoot has to be tailor-fit for the needs of the city,” Efren stressed.  In principle, the Jamolods and the City Government have already agreed to use Hakoot, and a memorandum of agreement will be signed this week with Mayor Rosalina G. Jalosjos, who just ordered the immediate purchase of two new garbage trucks and another two next year.  Asked why the letter “o” is used twice in Hakoot, the developers smilingly replied, “That’s how we Bisaya-speaking pronounce it.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/234609-ride-hailing-drivers-go-on-transport-holiday-july-8-2019/","title":"Ride-hailing drivers to go on ‘transport holiday’ July 8","date":"Jul 4, 2019 5:13 PM PHT","snippet":"Some ride-hailing drivers will go offline on July 8, in protest of the franchise requirements of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing drivers and operators said they will hold a “transport holiday” on Monday, July 8, as they expressed concerns over some “oppressive” policies of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). In a news briefing on Thursday, July 4, Ariel Inton of the Lawyers for Community Safety and Function said that the transport holiday is “for the sake of the TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Service) community and the riding public.” “It’s a holiday in the sense that every organization will have a different mode of action. Some will hold vigils, conduct a caravan…. But one thing is sure: hindi sila papasada (they will go offline),” Inton said. Inton apologized in advance to commuters and explained the reason for the transport holiday. “Ginagawa lang nila ito dahil darating ang panahon na kung mananatili ang mga pahirap policy na iyan, wala tayong masasakyang TNVS dahil malulugi ang negosyo,” he added. ([TNVS operators] are doing this because there will come a time when we won’t be able to ride TNVS vehicles because businesses will suffer if these oppressive policies are maintained). TNVS groups have not provided a total number of vehicles scheduled to go offline on Monday as of posting. But they assured that “majority” of their 45,000 members under the umbrella group TNVS Community Philippines will participate on Monday. Ride-hailing drivers lament the LTFRB process of applying for franchises, saying that the application for the certificate of public convenience has become “more difficult.” Drivers and operators said that the additional requirement on “bank conformity” and the “proof of financial capacity” made it harder for them to secure a franchise. Dominant ride-hailing app Grab Philippines said on Thursday that it will encourage the drivers to “show utmost restraint” with their actions, but they would respect their right to free speech and peaceful assembly. “We urge our TNVS partners to show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides,” Grab spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “We recognize the TNVS partners’ right to free speech and peaceable assembly. In many ways, we also support the call for smoother processes and faster timelines,” she added. Grab recently deactivated 15,000 “colorum” drivers since the year started, for failing to submit proof that they are processing their franchise. – with a report from Aika Rey/Rappler.com Enrico Berdos is a Rappler intern.

In a statement early Friday, May 10, the DOTr said they issued a guideline on the pilot implementation, which was signed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade on Wednesday, May 8. “Patunay ito na nakikinig ang gobyerno sa publiko. Patunay ito na bukas ang aming mga isip. Noong Disyembre ay inatasan natin ang pagbuo ng TWG (technical working group), at itong general guidelines ang bunga ng mga pagpupulong na iyon,” Tugade said. (This is proof that the government listens to the public. This is proof that we are open-minded. In December, we ordered the creation of a TWG, and these general guidelines are the result of those discussions.) Based on the document, the service will be rolled out in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu one month after the secretary’s approval, or on June 8. The DOTr has set the fare that motorcycle taxis should charge, as well as safety requirements that should be provided by the drivers or operators.    The pilot operations should run on a ride-hailing app, according to the guidelines. The DOTr said the data that will be collected from the pilot operations will be used when drafting the bill on legalizing motorcycle taxis. The pilot implementation will be done in partnership with motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas. Currently, Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. This is the reason why Angkas has been facing legal hurdles in its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) Guidelines For the pilot implementation, the DOTr has set the fare for the two areas. In Metro Manila, P50 is the base fare for the first two kilometers (km) of the ride. An additional P10/km will be charged for succeeding kilometers up to 7 km. Beyond 7 km, there will be an additional charge of P15/km. {source} <iframe title=”Metro Manila motorcycle taxi fare” aria-label=”Short Table” id=”datawrapper-chart-KWwXH” src=”//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KWwXH/1/” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ style=”width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;” height=”250″></iframe><script type=”text/javascript”>!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var e in a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.getElementById(“datawrapper-chart-“+e)||document.querySelector(“iframe[src*='”+e+”‘]”);t&&(t.style.height=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][e]+”px”)}})}();</script> {/source} In Metro Cebu, the base fare for the first kilometer is much cheaper at P20, but the additional charge up to the succeeding 8 km will be P16/km.

The DOTr has given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board the power to change the fare matrix or to revise the surge cap. Meanwhile, below are the safety requirements included in the guidelines:  The DOTr said that riders should not drive for more than 10 hours. They are also asking for operators to have an accident insurance. Legalization up next? The DOTr said that certain key performance indicators were set by the department in studying the viability of motorcycle taxis for transport. The accident threshold was set at 5% of the total rides. If this figure is met, the TWG will conduct an emergency meeting to investigate the situation and decide whether to suspend the pilot operations. The DOTr will also look into violations of traffic policies, as well as commuter feedback. Senators earlier urged the DOTr to just issue a department order that will allow the operation of motorcycle taxis for hired transport, similar to what they did to ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber before. In December 2018, the DOTr created the TWG to flesh out these issues but maintained that there is a need to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code or pass another law that would allow such. In the 17th Congress, the House of Representatives passed on 3rd and final reading House Bill 8959 or the Motorcycles-for-Hire Act. Its counterpart measure in the Senate, Senate Bill 2180, already passed the committee level. The DOTr said the safety of passengers is the top priority during this test run. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride)  “Pangunahing responsibilidad natin ang kaligtasan ng publiko. Kaya kapag pumalya kayo sa pamantayan natin, we will not have second thoughts on halting the pilot implementation,“ Tugade said. (Our primary responsibility is the safety of the public. If you fail our standards, we will not have second thoughts on halting the pilot implementation.)

And they’re aggressively competing to be adopted by both consumers and merchants. It’ll take some time before we determine who emerges on top – right now, only a portion of the population is using e-wallets. But here’s how the competition is playing out so far. The cream of the crop Among standalone apps, GCash ranks number one on both Google Play and App Store, according to data from analytics firm App Annie. Take note that Android accounts for roughly 83% of mobile operating systems in the Philippines, so you may want to pay more attention to the Google Play column. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259176/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:400px;’></iframe>{/source}   Longtime player GCash and rival PayMaya were created by the innovation units of the country’s powerful telco duopoly: Globe Telecom’s Mynt and PLDT/Smart’s Voyager Innovations, respectively. Coins.ph, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Hose in 2014, is a blockchain-based mobile payments startup that recently sold a majority stake to Indonesia’s ride-hailing behemoth Go-Jek. PayPal probably needs little introduction. Set up in 1998, the US firm is a pioneer that introduced the world to the idea of sending funds to anyone across the world – online. It’s also a staple secure payment method for e-commerce sites globally. Another force to contend with is GrabPay, the e-wallet embedded in the app of Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing firm. Grab tops the “Travel” and “Maps & Navigation” categories in the Philippines. App ranking is a good gauge of an app’s performance. It doesn’t just count downloads, but also factors in things like uninstalls, rating, usage, and more. However, it doesn’t give you the full picture. Other factors – such as monthly active users, transaction volume/value, competitive differentiation, financial muscle, stickiness, user acquisition costs, revenue, user experience, and so on – matter, and we’ll look into some of these later on. Same same but different First, let’s check out the compelling e-wallet models that have popped up worldwide. In emerging markets with a large unbanked population, a common model is one focused on financial inclusion. Here, an e-wallet is possibly the user’s first experience with a formal financial service, rather than a bank account. The e-wallet can perform basic functions – cash in/out, money transfers, as well as micropayments (e.g. phone credit top-ups). Then you have the ecosystem play. This e-wallet is part of an app that’s engaged in segments such as transportation, logistics, and shopping. Its users are already kind of digitally savvy, likely banked but do not necessarily qualify for credit cards. The app operator accepts cash as a mode of payment, but its e-wallet offers convenience and greater benefits. Philippine telcos kicked off their e-wallet services – GCash and Smart Money – in the 2000s with a wider financial inclusion goal. They initially offered SIM-based remittance and micro payments, making use of a vast network of agents – mostly sari-sari stores – to facilitate the transactions. This kind of remittance works this way: a customer hands a store cash, the store sends the amount via mobile phone to another store where the customer’s recipient can claim the money – also in the form of cash.  Years after introducing SIM-based e-money services, the telcos launched app versions to boost use cases and cater to the rapidly growing, digitally savvy base of smartphone owners in the country – whether they’re unbanked or banked. Coins.ph started out as a cryptocurrency exchange (buying and selling cryptocurrencies) and evolved into a suite of payments services similar to the telco apps. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/5857203A97624D1C8426325943F475E6/coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Meanwhile, GrabPay is part of the Grab ecosystem, which started with ride-hailing and branched out into more services, including courier and food delivery. Now, all these apps are aiming to transform into a third model: the lifestyle super app. Many e-wallet providers are eyeing this as an end-state, but few have been able to achieve it. Lifestyle super apps are ecosystems of services that have built an extensive base of active users – unbanked and banked – and have become indispensable in daily life. They’re not just used to pay online, but also in physical stores. Sitting on volumes of customer transaction data, these apps monetize that data by offering adjacent services like micro-loans. The greatest success stories can be found in China, where Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba-backed Alipay are used by people to pay for almost everything in the country. An outlier in the local scene perhaps is PayPal, which falls under another model that hinges on payment convenience. Largely targeting the banked segment, PayPal’s early solution stored and safeguarded bank card details, enabling users to shop on websites via their PayPal accounts without giving away those sensitive details to sellers. For sellers, the US company provided a checkout system for accepting online payments. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/1ED17AD5396F4A779AD4016924D33A9F/paypal.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, PayPal’s app works the same way, storing card details that users can use to pay other users or businesses with PayPal accounts. It can’t be used for payments in physical shops, but its balance can be transferred to other mobile wallets that are accepted by stores. What makes them stand out Though still a ways off, GCash seems to be leading the race to become a lifestyle super app in the Philippines. That’s thanks in part to its progressive and first-mover approach. Thinking that direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are the future, for instance, GCash decided to move away from sari-sari store-facilitated remittance as soon as it launched its app in 2012. The reason was simple: how do you persuade people to go cashless and digital if you don’t eliminate – or at least try to reduce – cash and human intervention in the transactions?  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/E8598F9B04734E54A88C95A1561035B6/g-cash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   While some may argue the move could mean missing out on the base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market in rural areas that’s reliant on agents for money transfers, it has allowed GCash to capture more of the urban consumers who are receptive to mobile technology and have higher-value transactions. Other moves that makes this progressive approach evident: Playing catch-up, PayMaya, which was launched in 2015, has yet to introduce such features. And its SIM-based counterpart Smart Money has maintained the biggest network of agents – 26,000 as of last count, most of which are sari-sari stores. But that’s due to the strong demand that its Smart Padala service has enjoyed from the BOP market, who are mostly located in rural areas with no stable internet connection, and still own feature phones. On the upside, this means a healthy revenue stream for Smart Money and a potential new base of users for PayMaya – if the latter successfully persuades the former’s users to migrate to the app, that is.  Nevertheless, the competition is still in its early days, and GCash and its rival camp are expected to extend well beyond their current focus segments. Moreover, both GCash and PayMaya – by virtue of being owned by the telcos – could have the strongest brand recall and consumer trust among the apps. Since Tencent, Alibaba’s chief competitor, made an investment in Voyager last year, you could say that the GCash-PayMaya battle is an extension of the war between China’s tech giants. What makes Coins.ph unique, on the other hand, is its underlying blockchain technology. What this means is it can store, transfer cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum), and convert them into pesos, helping it capture a niche. Coins.ph probably got a boost when Bitcoin prices were hitting record-highs a couple of years ago as more people got in on the action. However, the Bitcoin hype started fading as prices slumped.  While cryptocurrencies are considered volatile investments due to wild price fluctuations, blockchain has real utility for cross-border money transfer. Two reasons: it’s quick and cheap. Settlements using blockchain are instant, versus about an hour through a service like Western Union, or two to three days through banks. That’s because money transferred the traditional way goes through financial intermediaries, which are subject to strict regulation and charge fees. Blockchain keeps track of transactions using a digital ledger where entries cannot be fudged, so it eliminates intermediaries from the picture and lowers the costs (if you want to know more about blockchain, here’s a good resource). At the moment, Grab’s strength lies in ride-hailing where it has monopoly after beating Uber in Southeast Asia. On-demand transportation is a daily use case that’s hard to beat. The Singapore-based firm’s food delivery and courier features are also gaining a lot of traction among users in the region. While Grab is a frontrunner in launching financial services, including credit scoring and micro-loans, in markets like the Lion City, it’s still in the rollout phase for such services in the Philippines. This means it has to play catch-up with most of the local apps. But Grab’s regional presence also means it has economies of scale – it’s able to share costs over several markets.  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9E230ABABC234F329B97C2DB0CED5965/grab.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   For its part, PayPal’s global payments service has become the method of choice among individuals catering to overseas clients. Next to the US and India, the Philippines’ gig economy is ranked third in the world, with more people opting for online jobs to avoid long commutes and work flexible hours. Citing data from the Global Freelancer Survey, PayPal claims that its platform is widely used by freelancers in the Philippines (92%), Indonesia (88%), and Singapore (76%). Although domestic clients opt for bank transfers, about 76% of payments from international clients are made via PayPal, the survey notes. Here’s a comparative look at most of the finance apps’ features: {source}<iframe class=”app-features” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259205/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Here are Grab’s features in the Philippines at the moment: Increasing stickiness In theory, the more services an app has, the stickier it gets since existing users have more reasons to use it (how frictionless and efficient the services are is another story). Developing new services is also a way to add users and reduce the risks posed by regulatory changes in one sector – for example, transportation. This suggests improved long-term viability. In the same way, having a vast network of merchants who accept this mode of payment is critical to accelerate usage.  The ease of cashing in is important, otherwise there’s really no incentive for people to fund their e-wallets. Here are ways to add funds to the different e-wallets: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashin” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263579/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The ability to convert e-wallet balances into cash or return them to bank accounts is also just as crucial in driving adoption, especially if the market has yet to overcome the trust barrier. Without this ability, it’s like having unused miles stuck with an airline company. GCash and PayMaya allow users to withdraw cash via ATMs using their linked prepaid cards. These ATM withdrawals, however, come with the usual bank charge. Speeding ahead of other players, GCash now lets users transfer their balances to more than 30 banks in the country for free. Although PayPal allows transfers to banks, the minimum amount required without incurring fees tends to be relatively high for the general population. In the Philippines, the transfer will not incur charges if the amount is P7,000 (US$138) and above. On top of that, banks impose fees which further reduce the amount to be received by the user. Below are the different cash-out options offered by the apps: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashout” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263583/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Apart from drivers’ takings, Grab does not allow users to change GrabPay credits into cash or transfer them into bank accounts. This means Grab will have to contend with providers that offer cash redemption. Attracting merchants E-wallets are impractical for people without stores that take them, and no merchant will accept e-wallets if their customers don’t use them. Players have to find a way to build both sides of the marketplace. If an app collects a critical mass of users and merchants, it becomes harder for a competitor to lure them away. Merchants would find it tough to ignore Grab and GCash’s user base. Grabbers come from across Southeast Asia, where the firm controls the ride-hailing sector and is increasingly encroaching into the travel space through its partnerships (Booking.com is an investor in Grab, for example). Hence, Grab’s local arm is poised to capture tourists visiting the Philippines from neighboring countries.  For its part, GCash has integrated with affiliate Alipay to allow the latter’s users – mostly Chinese nationals – to make purchases from merchants that accept GCash. It’s uncertain whether PayMaya has done the same with its ally WeChat. In the Philippines, where most payments still happen offline, offering physical stores a mobile payment system that doesn’t require huge capital expenditure is a sound step toward sweeping adoption. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9504C856932C4236AD521F864470667E/paymaya-checkout.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   QR code tech is way cheaper than near-field communication (NFC) and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Except for PayPal, all local apps have QR code capabilities.  {source}<iframe class=”qr-merchants” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/274752/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Though Grab’s QR can’t be used in stores yet, the company has struck a partnership with retail titan SM to offer it in malls soon. Another key selling point is the fact that apps charge merchants lower fees (% of transaction value) for payments compared to credit cards. Heavy ammunition With an extensive user and merchant base comes significant revenue potential. Most apps charge users minimal transaction fees for things bought or paid for on their platforms to fuel adoption. Even without those fees, there’s potential to earn from users’ balances. In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay hold billions of dollars in funds that accumulate in their apps when users do not immediately use the funds or transfer them to a bank or investment account. The firms invest those funds to generate returns. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/712272D9E64A4B409F0BFDEC42CAC0E9/ali-pay-we-chat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   However, the companies are said to be losing that revenue after the Chinese government required that all e-wallet funds be deposited in non-interest bearing accounts with the central bank, rather than private institutions. More than the user fees, players earn from taking a cut of merchant sales – online and offline. Ultimately, the lifestyle apps serve as e-commerce platforms where third-party merchants and the apps themselves or their parent companies sell their products and services. In this case, payments essentially act as the backbone that allows the transactions to happen. For instance, Globe and Smart are using GCash and PayMaya to sell phone credit top-ups. Coins.ph is offering its crypto exchange and trading services – akin to how a foreign currency exchange service and stock exchange work. Here’s how many e-wallet accounts there are in the Philippines, as per government data: {source}<iframe class=”ewallet-accounts” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} And here are the companies’ own user stats: {source}<iframe class=”companies” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259234/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The picture looks rosy if we go by the players’ numbers. However, it’s uncertain how much of their user acquisition is organic. App companies spend not just on ads but also marketing promos – cashbacks and price discounts, among other things – to hook price-sensitive Filipinos and foster frequent use.  That’s not to say those subsidies are at all bad. For new technologies, subsidies are a potent – perhaps necessary – tool to acquire users and increase adoption. However, they’re costly to maintain, so winning the payments war will require deep pockets. The road to making money will be long and hard, but there are enormous rewards for becoming the dominant player. The question then becomes: who will last in the game? All the key players in the market right now have heavy war chests and high-profile investors in their rosters. {source}<iframe class=”high-profile” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263586/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The risk with cashbacks and discounts is that they may not necessarily inspire loyalty to a particular brand. In a situation where two players offer exactly the same services, people tend to gravitate towards the one that gives out more promos. So organic approaches like growing your merchant base and differentiating your product to entice users, as well as robust loyalty programs to keep users engaged are vital. Grab has a rewards program that lets users gain points as they use the app and progress up the tiers. The higher their tier is, the more rewards they can access. In Singapore, Grab has begun to offer subscription plans wherein users pay a fee upfront to avail of bundled discount vouchers across its services. The plans lock in customers for a longer period: the vouchers are already paid for so people are inclined to use them. What’s even more interesting is that the subscriptions are linked to the rewards program. Rides booked under the subscriptions earn reward points. On GCash, credit scoring and micro-loans will only be unlocked after a certain level of usage. The app, which currently has the most number of QR merchants, also introduced a program where users get vouchers after a purchase, to keep them coming back. To better gauge how an app is performing, one can look at active users and transaction volume/value. Unfortunately, the local apps are keeping those numbers under wraps. GCash claims that its active user base has grown 4x from 2017 to 2018.  We reached out to the other players for stats and other info, but have yet to receive a response. What consumers are saying Overall, companies will have to compete in terms of the quality of their products and services, including the crucial user experience. To know more about what people think of the payments apps, TheNerve used its natural language processing tool to monitor and analyze Twitter posts about them. The analysis spanned January 1 to December 31, 2018, with posts geo-tagged in the Philippines. Here’s what the team found. GCash and PayMaya {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/251672/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Both GCash and PayMaya’s social maps are dominated by clusters of tweets about:   {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/257704/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Announcements and news coverage are focused on partnerships with malls and brands that have started accepting the apps as modes of payment, as well as referral and cashback programs. Zooming in on the user conversations, here are some key findings: GCash {source}{module 4131}{/source} PayMaya {source}{module 4132}{/source} Coins.ph {source}{module 4133}{/source} PayPal {source}<div style=”text-align: center;”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/D3F4D8BA56F74FD19E7FA1671AFA59E5/img/15B5CD41997843FC805732EDD8B17907/2_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   GrabPay {source}{module 4134}{/source} Survival of the deepest pockets As the local race is still in a relatively early stage, there’s room for players to co-exist and share the market. Having several e-wallet firms that spend for marketing campaigns raises consumer awareness and expedites adoption. At this point, players are fighting a common stubborn enemy: cash. Today, cash still makes up 99 percent of Philippine transactions. That means the market may remain fragmented, with more players potentially throwing their hat into the ring. Yet having too many options can also hinder adoption. It’s tedious for a user to maintain dozens of apps. In the long run, consolidation is bound to happen (we’ve actually seen a form of consolidation when Go-Jek acquired control of Coins.ph). In China, which is past the tipping point for mass e-wallet adoption, it’s evident: this is a sector where only a couple of players hold the majority of the market.  Players are expected to heavily burn cash to compete for market share so that means those with the deepest pockets will survive. It also means that profitability may be a long way off.  As e-wallet adoption grows, banks will be gravely affected. Apart from losing out to e-wallets in the unbanked market, existing transactions in their credit and debit card systems may shift to mobile as well. To stay relevant, they must determine how to compete and collaborate with new payment methods. Seeing the onslaught ahead, the country’s lenders have led the talks to come up with a national QR code system with the goal of having the codes readable across financial apps – bank or non-bank. So this means that a merchant can display a single QR code that all payments providers will be able to scan. This kind of interoperability will level the playing field. How the landscape will evolve when banks join the fray is definitely something to watch.

Now some think it is time to escape the tyranny of the digital age. Everyone staring for hours at a screen has had some exposure to “captology” – a word coined by behavioural scientist BJ Fogg to describe the invisible and manipulative way in which technology can persuade and influence those using it. “There is nothing we can do, like it or not, where we can escape persuasive technology,” this Standford University researcher wrote in 2010. All of us experience this “persuasive technology” on a daily basis, whether it’s through the endlessly-scrollable Facebook or the autoplay function on Netflix or YouTube, where one video flows seamlessly into another. “This wasn’t a design ‘accident’, it was created and introduced with the aim of keeping us on a certain platform,” says user experience (UX) designer Lenaic Faure.  Working with “Designers Ethiques”, a French collective seeking to push a socially responsible approach to digital design, Faure has developed a method for assessing whether the attention-grabbing element of an app “is ethically defensible.” In the case of YouTube, for example, if you follow the automatic suggestions, “there is a sort of dissonance created between the user’s initial aim” of watching a certain video and “what is introduced to try and keep him or her on the platform,” he says. Ultimately the aim is to expose the user to partner advertisements and better understand his tastes and habits.  Dark patterns UX designer Harry Brignull describes such interactions as “dark patterns”, defining them as interfaces that have been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they may not have wanted to do.  “It describes this kind of design pattern – kind of evil, manipulative and deceptive,” he told AFP, saying the aim was to “make you do what the developers want you to do.” One example is that of the newly-introduced EU data protection rules which require websites to demand users’ consent before being able to collect their valuable personal data. “You can make it very, very easy to make people click ‘OK’ but how can you opt out, how can you say ‘no’?” Even for him, as a professional, it can take at least a minute to find out how to refuse. In today’s digital world, attention time is a most valuable resource. “The digital economy is based upon competition to consume humans’ attention. This competition has existed for a long time but the current generation of tools for consuming attention is far more effective than previous generations,” said David SH Rosenthal in a Pew Research Center study in April 2018. “Economies of scale and network effects have placed control of these tools in a very small number of exceptionally powerful companies. These companies are driven by the need to consume more and more of the available attention to maximise profit.” Internet as tool, not trap Faure suggests that for a design to be considered responsible, the objective of the developer and that of the user must largely line up and equate to the straightforward delivery of information. But if the design modifies or manipulates the user, directing them towards something they did not ask for, that should then be classed as irresponsible, he says. French engineering student Tim Krief has come up with a browser extension called Minimal, which offers users a “less attention-grabbing internet experience” on the grounds that the internet “should be a tool, not a trap”.  The extension aims to mask the more “harmful” suggestions channelled through the major platforms.  An open source project, the extension should “make users more aware about such issues”, Krief says.  “We don’t attribute enough importance to this attention economy because it seems invisible.”  Design as a defense But is this enough to fight the attention-grabbing tactics of powerful internet giants? Brignull believes some designers can bring about change but are likely to be restricted by the wider strategy of the company they work for.  “I think they will have some impact, a little impact, but if they work in companies, those companies have a strategy… so it can be very difficult to have an impact on the companies themselves.” Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, former head of the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) also believes that design can be used to effect positive change.  “Design could be another defense whose firepower could be used against making individuals the ‘playthings'” of developers, she said in January in a presentation on the “attention economy.”  Faure says he has seen a growing demand for an ethical approach to digital design and thinks his method could help “bring better understanding between users of services and the people who design them.”  This type of initiative “could be a way to tell the big platforms that such persuasive designs really bother us,” Krief says.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/224516-grab-philippines-donates-shooting-simulator-highway-patrol-group/","title":"Grab Philippines donates shooting simulator to highway police","date":"Feb 27, 2019 6:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says the simulator would enhance the PNP Highway Patrol Group's road safety and security skills","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to enhance road safety, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines donated a shooting simulator to the highway police.

Here’s how to save a little cash while commuting around the metro: Avoid rush hours Think about it: how many hours do we actually spend commuting? An extra 30 minutes of sleep may not be worth that extra hour or two traveling. Leaving earlier in the morning reduces the stress on both your body and your budget. For one, you have lesser competition when it comes to booking a ride or getting a seat on the train. Next, you get to beat the surge price of rush hours. And for nights? It may be time to pick a hobby. Why not get into jogging or some other exercise. Not only do you get to skip the traffic, but you might also start hitting your health goals. That’s hitting two birds with one stone! Share a ride Got extra time to spare on your trip? Why not carpool with a friend or share a ride with a stranger? Not only do you get to save when someone is sharing the bill with you but, by not commuting alone, at least you could get into a good conversation that could help your travel time fly by. Take advantage of points and special features Sometimes walking or taking the public transportation just won’t cut it if we’re going to a wedding or a dinner date, for example. In cases where we need to stay neat and fresh, we would, of course, opt for a more convenient way to commute like taking a Grab. While the fares can go up from time to time, there are promo codes that you could use if you’re traveling during off peak hours or on certain days. However, if you prefer to travel on your own time, using services like GrabPay Credits is for you. You get three times more points which you can use for discounts versus when you use cash. If you’re worried about going beyond your budget, you don’t have to because it doesn’t work like a credit card. You can set a budget and cash in to your app through a Grab driver, credit/debit/prepaid cards, or 7-11’s bills payment, and monitor your expenses with the transaction history in your app. You can also use your GrabPay Credits to buy prepaid load for all networks at 5% off.  How about you?

Employee bonuses on Facebook now based on contributions to social progress Mark Zuckerberg announced at a company assembly, Tuesday, February 5, US time, that a new performance indicator will be considered when determining employee bonuses: one’s contribution to solutions to any of the major social issues that the company is facing such as data privacy, fake news, and hate speech. Previously, the bonus formula was based on 6 factors such as user growth and increasing sharing among users. The addition of the social factor appears to be a new attempt by Facebook to steer the platform to a more accountable, responsible direction. Zuckerberg also said that they’ll be spending $3.7 billion in 2019 for safety and security or about 7% of their $55-billion 2018 revenue.

Navigatú, taken from the word “navigation” and inspired by Butuan’s “balangay” boats, offers an idea incubation program and business skills course for startups in the region. Just recently, Navigatu acquired P2 million in funding from an investor. Aside from providing a safer commuting alternative for the public, the application also hopes to increase the income of tricycle drivers. Users can quickly book a ride with a few taps, while Transeek will search for the nearest available tricycle using GPS (Global Positioning System). (READ: IN PHOTOS: How new jeepneys, buses, tricycles could look like) Not alone in solving transport woes The Philippines knows its fair share of public transportation problems, as well as proposed methods of harnessing technology and data to address the said issues.  Ride-hailing platforms like Grab, Wunder, and Angkas make it clear their services aim to serve commuters readily in a bid to solve the city’s all-too familiar gridlock. The effectiveness at which they do a good job is still arguable though, with recent studies seeming to suggest a different set of issues arises. In Pangasinan, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines also launched a premium service for tricycles, in partnership with AutoItalia Philippines, aiming to “fill in the gap for short-distance commutes.” (READ: LOOK: Grab launches premium tricycle service) Transeek aims to uplift A survey of 100 tricycle drivers in Butuan found their average income ranged from P400 to P500 a day. Transeek hopes to increase their income up to 300% by helping in decreasing delays and standby hours. The base fare for a maximum of 3 passengers per ride will be P30, with a service charge of P5. Drivers will get P25 for every ride from the system. “We have interviewed drivers during Tricycle Operators and Drivers’ Association (TODA) meetings and most of them liked Transeek since they don’t have to waste time roaming around to look for passengers,” said Cubillas. According to the app makers, drivers’ registration into Transeek’s system will be free. They will be required to comply with insurance requirements, however – something most of them fail to adhere to. (WATCH: [Right of Way] Why the PH doesn’t have enough mass transport options) In 2017, several bills such as senate Bill 1284 and House Bill 4334, sought to modernize the transport sector, though they remain pending.

(WATCH: Why is it important to #HackSociety?) Transeek’s team is among the first batch of “incubatees” from the program, alongside 6 other teams developing local IT solutions for agriculture and micro, small, and medium enterprises. Facilities such as computer units and administrative functions are provided for free by Navigatú, enabling them to develop their startup ideas.  “Before, we just made IT systems because we like it. Now, it’s more (about) solving problems or helping improve lives,” explained Cubillas.  Engr. Jeffrey Dellosa, Navigatú Project Leader and CSU’s Innovation and Technology Support Office manager, said they are trying to provide an ecosystem in the university that would enable students – and anyone else who might be interested – to transform their ideas into businesses that will generate solutions to existing societal problems.

Change destination: In case of last minute changes for drop-off points, users can now modify their destination while in transit. Users have to wait to be picked up before they can change the drop-off point. Changing their destination can be done by viewing the driver details and then tapping “change” on the right side of the supposed drop-off point.

To contact the driver immediately after the ride, the passenger only has to click the history tab and view the driver details. Pressing the call button would immediately place a call to the driver. The call button function is available within 4 hours after the trip has ended.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said on Monday, November 5, that the Euro-4 compliant tricycles aim to “fill in the gap for short-distance commute.”  “[GrabTrike] will fill in the short distance commute from the villages. The 3-wheeler would be able to service those areas in a much more efficient and budget-friendly manner,” Cu said. GrabTrike Premium is an upgrade from GrabTrike, which currently uses regular tricycles in Angeles, Pampanga, and in Balanga, Bataan. The firm will be fielding 2,000 Piaggio Ape units, a light commercial vehicle based on Vespa scooters. Since franchises for tricycles are under the supervision of local government units, Grab will be partnering with LGUs to roll out the service.  The Binalonan municipal government in Pangasinan is the first to adopt the premium tricycle service with 24 units. Cu said the fare scheme for GrabTrike Premium depends on the rates approved by the LGU, on top of a P10 booking fee which will go directly to the driver. For Binalonan, the local government approved a fare of P40 for the first two kilometers, and an additional P10 per succeeding kilometer. Modern transport More than being an “everyday app,” Grab aims for transportation modernization at its core, said Cu. The P185,000 Piaggio Ape can reach up to 38 kilometers on a liter of gas, which is Euro-4 compliant. Its transmission has reverse gear and has a maximum climb of 20.5% gradient – features a regular tricycle does not have. Because of the Piaggio Ape’s relatively low acquisition cost, Grab and AutoItalia offer easy ownership access with little to no equity to driver-operators. LGUs may also opt to partner with the ride-hailing firm to modernize their local tricycles.

Around half of the funds came from Japanese car giant Toyota, which announced last month it was pumping $1 billion into Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-share company. Grab said a “significant portion” of the proceeds would go to developing operations in Indonesia, where it has partnered with local firm Ovo to offer what it said was the country’s most widely accepted mobile payments system. The announcement comes after Grab’s regional rival, Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, said in May it was investing $500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Singapore-based Grab, which operates in eight countries, launched an on-demand grocery delivery service in Jakarta last month.

However, Grab’s agreement to buy US giant Uber’s Southeast Asian business this year has run into trouble, with Singapore’s anti-monopoly watchdog calling for changes to the deal and threatening to overturn it. Grab last week disputed the watchdog’s finding that the buyout infringed competition rules, but vowed it would continue to cooperate with the ongoing review. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab.

Under the new fare scheme, the flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer, higher than the previous P3.50 for every 300 meters or around P11 per kilometer. On top of that, taxi operators can now charge a travel duration rate of P2 per minute, to replace the waiting time charge of P3.50 for every two minutes. The LTFRB started the recalibration of taxi meters on Tuesday, July 31, at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Parañaque City. There are about 21,000 taxi units in Metro Manila. Only taxis with recalibrated meters can charge higher fares. A taxi meter calibration certification sticker will be placed on the top right corner of the windshield to show that the driver can apply the new fare scheme. Recalibration comes with a fee of P1,110, which covers the sealing of meters, testing, and administrative matters. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III Delgra warned drivers and operators against charging higher rates without the authoritzation sticker. Violators would be liable for “overcharging,” and a fine of P3,000 on the first offense, he said. Delgra explained that the P2-per-minute travel charge was added to cover time spent in traffic. Taxi operators have long asked the LTFRB to adjust their fares to level competition following the entry of ride-hailing apps such as Grab Philippines. “Nilagay natin ‘yung time rate to serve and cover the congestion. ‘Ayun naman ang mga angal ng taxi drivers or taxi operators na dahil sa traffic ng Metro Manila, nalulugi sila,” he said in a previous media interview. (We added the time rate to serve and cover [time spent] on congestion. That is the complaint of taxi drivers or taxi operators, that because of the traffic in Metro Manila, they were losing money.) The regulatory board also now requires taxi drivers to have a mobile application from an LTFRB-accredited transport network company (TNC). Currently, ride-hailing companies Grab, MiCab, Hirna, and Hype have services for taxi. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?)

Called GrabPlatform, this suite of APIs (Application Programming Interface) allows partners to tap into Grab’s user base as their market. On top of this, it gives them access to components of Grab’s services including transport, logistics, payments, user authentication, messaging, insights, and mapping. “Combining Grab’s assets with the specialised expertise of our partners will enable both Grab and our partners to grow most efficiently and quickly to serve more Southeast Asian customers daily,” Anthony Tan, Group CEO and Co-founder of Grab said. Partners have 3 options on how they wish to integrate their services into the platform. The first is to build into GrabPlatform – directly integrating the services into the Grab app. Second, they can “empower” their apps with GrabPlatform, enabling partners to link Grab’s services with theirs. This is similar to how Lazada and Shopee allow products bought from their site to be delivered via GrabExpress. Lastly, they can engage prospective customers through GrabPlatform by advertising their products and services in the app’s news feed, as well as adding promotions for GrabRewards. With regards to selecting their partners, Grab said that they are first and foremost looking for those who provide everyday services that the platform’s users need. They are also working to ensure no two partners will offer the same service under the platform. Finally, they said that partners should provide income opportunities for the 100 million micro-entrepreneurs already part of Grab’s network. In the same event, Grab launched GrabFresh, an in-app service that lets users shop for and have their groceries delivered right to their homes. The service is a product of GrabPlatform involving the partnership between Grab and popular online grocery platform, HappyFresh. GrabFresh is currently only available in select countries but the Philippines will have a similar service in partnership with a local counterpart. (READ: GrabFood now on soft launch in the Philippines) Meanwhile Jerald Singh, Grab’s head of product, assured users that their personal information is safe because the partners will be forced to abide by Grab’s pre-existing standards and guidelines on data privacy when they integrate into their ecosystem. “Any time we build a platform, this is the first thing we consider,” he added. GrabPlatform has already launched in countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Grab said it should be rolling out in the Philippines sometime next year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/206583-grab-philippines-plans-multimodal-passenger-transport-system/","title":"Grab planning seamless ‘mix-and-match’ transport system in PH","date":"Jul 5, 2018 6:44 PM PHT","snippet":"The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows passengers to select and take different modes of transport using the Grab service to reach their destination","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab officially unveiled a number of newly added features to its platform, as well as plans to eventually have a multimodal passenger transport system in the country. The announcements were made during a media event on Thursday, July 5. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars travelling through the major roads – the highly congested roads – and move them into higher-capacity vehicles like shuttles or buses,” said Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines. The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows their passengers to seamlessly select and take different modes of transport to reach their destination. For instance, a Grab user can first take an on-demand shuttle, then hop on to a public bus, then finally take a GrabCar to the destination all in the same app. Ideally, this should decrease costs for passengers, help increase the income of Grab’s driver partners, and decrease congestion in roads but, Cu admits that there are huge challenges to achieving this vision. Unlike in Singapore where Grab is allowed to run shuttles, Cu said that until they have regulations in place that allow them to implement this system, it’s difficult to move forward with their plans. Despite the lack of a timeline for a potential rollout of this system, Cu said they were reaching out to regulators and operators to build their multimodal transport system. “We’re in talks right now with a few P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as the mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transport, either via car or trike,” Cu added. Expanding GrabPay Meanwhile, Grab discussed plans of expanding the use of GrabPay beyond the services they offer. Grab’s country marketing head, Cindy Toh, said users can pay bills, buy load, and conduct other common transactions with GrabPay and earn rewards by doing so. She believes that by incentivizing the feature, it can convince people to adopt it, even in a cash-dominated market such as the Philippines. For Grab drivers, they can build credit histories with Grab so that they can qualify for financial services such as loans and insurance solutions. Apart from this, the ride-hailing service officially unveiled GrabFood, their food-delivery service on soft launch and Grab Daily, an in-app feed that lets users read lifestyle news, play games, or check restaurant recommendations.

The service initially launched in the company’s home country, Singapore, in late May, where it also announced future availability in other Southeast Asian territories – Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines. The app takes the place of Uber Eats, the food delivery service of former regional rival Uber, which it acquired in March of this year.  In the Philippines, GrabFood will compete with the likes of Germany-headquartered Foodpanda and Honestbee, also from Singapore.  For its soft launch, GrabFood says they will be delivering to areas in BGC, Makati, Ortigas, San Juan, and West Quezon City, with plans to expand to more areas in the future. Operating hours for the service are from 11 am to 9 pm except holidays. Payments are currently cash only.  The service automatically makes suggestions for nearby restaurant partners from which to choose. Opening the service, the app showed a healthy selection of restaurants within a 2-kilometer radius, and a delivery rate of P49 with no minimum order. Grab says on their website that to “keep your food fresh and ensure speedy deliveries, we limit the available restaurants to those within a given distance from your location.” Upon selection of “Food” in the Grab’s dropdown menu, the app will let you know if the service is available in your area or not.  GrabFood follows the introduction of GrabAssistant, their service for miscellaneous errands. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/205653-grab-driver-cancellations-decline-brian-cu/","title":"Brian Cu: Grab driver cancellations down by 50%","date":"Jun 24, 2018 6:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu says they have addressed the 'root causes' of unwanted driver behavior","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Driver cancellations in ride-hailing app Grab declined by 50% after the company addressed “root causes” of the behavior, country head Brian Cu said on Friday, June 22, during the sidelines of the 2018 Techtonic Summit. Cu said they “targeted aspects” of their service where they had to improve, through their 100-day campaign. “We have changed some policies, upgraded our tech, as well as spending. As you may have noticed, the complaints in social media already declined,” he added. According to Cu, lesser income drove the unwanted behavior. Grab assured drivers that they will continue to receive subsidies “as long as they need money.” On June 19, the company announced that it has started to provide subsidy for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the P2 per-minute travel charge.  Grab said the subsidy scheme would cost around P100 million a month. Meanwhile, the company has branched out to food and grocery delivery services.  Cu said there is “great potential in the Philippine market” to launch Grab Assistant and Grab Food. Grab Assistant, which can be accessed through the same ride-hailing app, allows customers to request for drivers to buy anything they want up to P1,000 and have it delivered to their doorstep. The feature is available in Metro Manila, but is more reliable in certain areas such as Ortigas, Bonifacio Global City, and Makati City. As for Grab Food, it allows customers to order from select restaurants nearby. Customers can also track where the courier is through the app. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/204660-dotr-ltfrb-full-authority-ride-hailing-companies-regulation/","title":"DOTr gives LTFRB full authority over ride-hailing companies’ regulation","date":"Jun 11, 2018 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) This means ride-hailing companies can no longer set or change fare schemes on their own","body":" MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Transportation (DOTr) on Monday, June 11, signed an order giving the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) full authority over the regulation of ride-hailing companies. The unnumbered department order (DO) subjects transport network companies (TNCs) and operators of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to the “full regulation and supervision” of the LTFRB. Under the order, which took effect immediately, the LTFRB was given the authority to issue or suspend franchises, set fares, determine operating conditions, and impose fines. The previous DO 2017-11 and DO 2015-11 only gave the LTFRB oversight functions over fare setting. DO 2017-11 stated that there would be a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB,” while DO 2015-11 gave TNCs the right to “set fares, subject to LTFRB’s oversight.” These provisions of the DO were in question when ride-hailing company Grab Philippines changed its fare scheme on its own. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Now, under the newly-signed DO, the LTFRB will determine the fare scheme of ride-hailing companies through “public hearings or consultations.” “The fare for the TNVS shall be determined by the LTFRB, after public hearing or in consultation with the TNCs and TNVS,” the DO states. It also reminds ride-hailing companies and operators to comply with all laws, particularly the law governing common carriers. “Any violation or non-compliance by TNCs and TNVS are grounds for imposition of fines, suspension, and cancellation of accreditation, subject to notice and hearing,” states the DO. Grab to ‘comply’ In response, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said that they have yet to receive a copy of the order, but that they will comply “as always.” Cu added that the DO “strengthens” Grab’s position that the P2-per-minute travel charge it added on its own is “legal.” “Since DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr and the LTFRB,” he said. While Grab believes the DO “strengthens” the legality of its P2-per-minute travel charge, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles thinks otherwise. “It is very clear that TNCs cannot set their own fares like all other land transport systems…. I hope that this is clear to all TNCs that the law should be followed,” Nograles said. For Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, the new order “will benefit” both the companies and the customers. “Kaya mahalaga na may regulasyon, para nababantayan at nasisiguro natin na walang naaagrabyado…. Siyempre, gusto natin patas ang playing field at patas ang kompetisyon,” Tugade said. (That’s why regulation is important, so we can monitor and make sure that no one is taken advantage of…. Of course, we want a level playing field and fair competition.) LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the Board has been engaging with ride-hailing companies more often than other public utility vehicles. “It is because we see their value, and because we believe that if done right, they will make a big difference and our commuters will ultimately benefit,” Delgra said. The DO is the department’s latest attempt in a bid to regulate ride-hailing firms. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?)

Visibly surprised by the information, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III asked Grab representatives during a hearing when the minimum fares were imposed. Grab lawyer Miguel Aguila said they started on June 5, 2017. “Ayusin ’nyo nga ’yung papel ’nyo. Ang gulo,” Delgra told Grab. (Fix your papers. It’s a mess.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles informed the LTFRB in a hearing on Tuesday that Grab Philippines charges “illegal” minimum fares, which “were not declared” by the ride-hailing company,  Nograles said Grab charges a minimum of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, while the premium cars start at P125. In response to a question, Delgra said during a media interview that the board was not informed of charges separate from the flagdown rate of P40. “Obviously, [we were] not [informed] insofar as the computation of minimum fare is concerned – compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,” Delgra said. Delgra said the LTFRB is not yet considering suspending Grab’s minimum fares, but the board needs a clarification on the matter. “We won’t necessarily remove this, but we are asking for clarification. We are only following the 4 elements in determining fares,” he said in Filipino.  Delgra said that the fares depend on the computation of the flagdown rate, the distance traveled, time charges, and the surge pricing. Under the government-approved fares, Grab charges an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer and has a surge cap of twice the distance traveled on top of the flagdown fare. Grab said that it was never the company’s intention to “hide” the fare from its patrons. “What you see on the app, that is an upfront fare. If it is a minimum distance, it’s a minimum fare, we never tried to hide it from the general public,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said. Illegal charges? Nograles earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker’s allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges. “If they truly subject themselves to the board, then why didn’t they apply to the board? Their only formal application for it was January of this year, way after they unilaterally imposed it,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said Grab’s move puts into question the authority of LTFRB as a regulatory agency. LTFRB earlier said they were not consulted either when the P2-per-minute fare was initially charged.  The ride-hailing company’ legal counsel argued that the P2-per-minute charge was added to cover the costs of the drivers when picking up the passenger at their pinned location in the Grab app. During the hearing, Delgra asked Grab to submit to the board the company’s earnings since the P2-per-minute charge was imposed. For the drivers Winson Esteras, leader of the coalition of transport network vehicle services, said on Tuesday that the P2-per-minute charge helps drivers cope with the costs incurred by longer travel time due to traffic congestion. “Kung mapapansin ‘nyo naman na hindi na talaga kami kumikita…. Pa’no ‘yung traffic? ‘Yung fare ngayon hindi na aligned sa sinisingil na gas sa amin,” Esteras said. (If you notice, we’re not earning a lot…. How about the traffic? The fare now is not aligned with the cost of gas.) Grab Philippines had admitted that its riders were not informed when the additional charges were rolled out starting June 5, 2017.  They argued that this is legal and asked for it to be reimposed, saying that it is for the drivers’ benefit. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April.

In a statement, Nograles said this minimum fare was not authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Without any public hearing, Grab Philippines again unilaterally imposed a new illegal fare condition. [D]uring the April 17 LTFRB hearing, Grab Philippines denied to the board that they impose an P80 minimum fare,” Nograles said. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Now, no less than the Grab app publicly declares that the company charges the same minimum fare. This brazen act shows not only disrespect to the regulators, but proof that Grab Philippines has no intention to follow Philippine laws,” Nograles said. “This is a usurpation of the powers of the LTFRB and this is a violation of our existing laws. Just because they now have a virtual monopoly of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) sector, they can now violate our laws by setting their own fare rates?” he added. Under the information card on the Grab app, its sedan and 6-seater vehicles for hire charge a minimum of P80 per ride, while the premium cars start at P125. Nograles said that under the approved fare structure, a rider should only be charged a maximum of P68 for a 500-meter ride at a surge rate of times two. It should not be at P80, he said. The lawmaker earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

(READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Grab Philippines also said that a motion for reconsideration on the suspension was filed, meaning the suspension should have been delayed and should not have been rendered “immediately executory.” “Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,” Grab said.

(READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) In a text message to Rappler, Nograles said Grab’s petition is “unfounded.” “Their petition is unfounded since reimposition means it was legal in the first place. It was never approved therefore there is nothing to reimpose,” Nograles said on Friday. “They dont have the moral authority to talk about equal protection of the laws when they have admitted that they have never conducted a public hearing for the P2-per-minute [charge],” Nograles added. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said.

With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities.

On the tech side of things, they’re rolling out a new app interface for both iOS and Android.  Visually, the revamped interface cleans all the clutter in the home screen and divides Grab’s services to two tabs, namely Transport and Delivery. What’s more is that pinning locations in the map is now said to be more intuitive, and has been designed to make it easier for passengers and drivers to locate each other.   But for passengers who feel they have had a bad experience with the service, the key update is the new ability to report their concerns to Grab’s Help Center without leaving the app. The hope is it will expedite the filing of concerns, and encourage consumers to voice out their issues via the help center. To support the improved intergration, the ride-hailing service also announced that they’re enlarging their customer service team by partnering with a BPO company, which they expect to be fully operational by July. With the expansion of the cusomter service team, Grab said that they’re ensuring reports are resolved within 48 hours. After Uber’s exit, Grab has been in the spotlight for several issues including higher fares, misbehaving drivers, and long wait time for rides.  The in-app Emergency button, added in July of last year, is getting some added features and a name change. Now called the SOS button, passengers can directly connect to 911 and send text messages to three registered phone numbers in-app in case of emergencies. This new button is going to be launched starting June 4 this year.  “Our aim is to be passengers’ partner for better trips at all times. We have carefully studied new features that will further enhance our services while ensuring passenger safety on the road,” Cindy Toh, Country Marketing Head, said.  Grab also said plans to expand destination masking beyond the 25% of drivers with low acceptance rates are under review. According to them, the introduction of destination masking late last month had a bigger negative impact on ride acceptance rather than ride cancellations. They believe this could make it harder for passengers to book a ride if they expand beyond the initial number.  The revamped app interface has already started rolling out for iOS and is expected for Android by July 2018. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/200953-grab-users-dissatisfied-driver-cancellations/","title":"‘We need better options’: Grab PH users dissatisfied with driver cancellations","date":"Apr 24, 2018 4:21 PM PHT","snippet":"The current dissatisfaction has metamorphosed into an actual Facebook group called 'GrabPH Complaints,' where users are sharing their sentiments and stories","body":" MANILA, Philippines – With the recent shutdown of the Uber app, Grab currently enjoys dominance in the country’s ride-hailing sector.  Some of Grab’s drivers, according to a growing number of social media posts, have apparently been taking advantage of the situation by misbehaving, charging higher fares and cancelling on riders.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu made the statement in response to questions in a press briefing on Wednesday. “Riders were not informed [of the additional P2-per-minute charge]. There were no comms (communication) to the riders,” Cu said, when asked if Grab riders were informed of the charge through the Grab app or via social media. Cu said that there is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the “upfront price” or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip. This includes the computation for the travel duration charge. “The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors [are charged] and it’s fixed,” he added. The company head maintained that Grab is “transparent” in its charges, and reiterated that there was nothing illegal in charging the P2-per-minute charge, contrary to the allegation of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. “Hindi namin tinatago ‘yung fact na nagcharge kami ng P2 per minute since July (We are not hiding the fact that we charged P2 per minute since July). We are well within our rights to charge the P2,” Cu said. Cu said that their rates are now shown on their website. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Grab charges a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The travel duration charge is added on top of the base fare and distance charges. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is investigating the alleged “illegal” charges. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. ‘Fares are legal’ Miguel Aguila, Grab’s lawyer, maintained that the ride-hailing company’s travel duration charge is legal. Aquila cited the Department Order (DO) 2015-11 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), which he said allows Grab to set fares on its own. “Grab would like to set the record straight. Our fares are legal: ‘Fares are set by the TNCs (Transport Network Company) and is subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions in the market,'” he said. On Tuesday, April 17, Cu, Aguila, and Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua appeared before the LTFRB to explain why Grab’s accreditation should not be suspended or revoked amid allegations of  unauthorized charges. Aguila also said that the LTFRB was informed about Grab’s pricing scheme through the technical working group (TWG) in July, or a month after Grab started to impose the travel duration charge.  (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Why change fares on your own?) He added that the email correspondences with the LTFRB on Grab’s fare pricing scheme also transpired last year. Back to drivers, passengers Cu also said that the P2-per-minute charge did not go to the company, but benefitted both riders and passengers. “Fares are more fair for both sides and this P2-per-minute did not go to Grab. But it went to the drivers, it was reinvested by way of incentives or promos for passengers,” he said. Some Grab operators and drivers earlier expressed fears that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Nograles had said that drivers should be spared if a refund is ordered by the regulatory agency. Cu also said that Grab always complies with government regulations. When the LTFRB ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare, it immediately implemented it, he said. Grab is now the only transport network company offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber closed down on April 16. Four other ride-hailing companies are applying for LTFRB accreditation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/199872-grab-uber-operations-separate-pcc/","title":"Does PCC understand Grab-Uber deal?

Cu explained that after the acquisition, Grab was funding the current operations of Uber, thus, operations cannot be totally independent. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on March 25 and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure,” Cu said. Grab has been shouldering the cost of the Uber app extension from March 25 to its earlier scheduled shutdown on April 8, the original period of transition.  Cu added that the Uber app shutdown will be moved to midnight of April 15, which means extra costs for Grab.  The country head of Grab reiterated that the Uber app can still be accessed but “it has limited functionality and little or no support.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it was concerned that there would be a deluge of customer complaints. “The current solution does not benefit the riding public. It’s a risk for the riding public. If a road crash happens, who has the accountability?” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, as keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely will cost them “expensively.” Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order. However, both companies will be given a chance to explain their sides before this order will be implemented.  Many Uber patrons slammed the deal between the two companies, arguing that Grab has “monopolized” the ride-hailing service until the LTFRB approves 4 new ride-hailing apps. But Cu said that fares will remain as is, as they “cannot unilaterally” increase the fares. Although fares right now may not increase given the acquisition, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition to increase fares due to the tax reform law.– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/199744-pcc-interim-measures-uber-grab-merger-review/","title":"PCC releases interim measures pending review of Grab-Uber deal","date":"Apr 7, 2018 2:54 PM PHT","snippet":"'This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,' says Philippine Competition Commission Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, as the country's antitrust body conducts an in-depth review of the deal","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) on Saturday, April 7, released interim measures that seek to protect the riding public and drivers of Grab and Uber as the country’s antitrust watchdog reviews the deal of the ride-sharing services.

PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo had announced the forthcoming release of the interim measures during a public hearing on the deal on Thursday, April 5, when it was first announced that the PCC had asked Uber and Grab to continue using their own platforms beyond Sunday, April 8.

(READ: No migration of personal data to Grab in Uber app shutdown – privacy commission) The PCC also ordered the ride-hailing services to: Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order, but this will not be immediately executory as they will be given a chance to explain their side. Compliance report Referring to the continued independent operations after April 8, the PCC said in its order, “Should the Respondents failed to comply with item (a) above within five (5) working days from service of this Order, Respondents shall show cause within twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the aforementioned five (5) day period as to why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” The PCC also ordered Uber and Grab to submit periodic verified compliance reports with supporting documents, the first within 15 days from the service of the order, and evern 20 days after. The PCC is mandated to protect competition in the market and prohibit anticompetitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition.

This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,” he said.  “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he added. The PCC chief cited the case of Uber operations in Singapore. “Uber’s compliance with our antitrust counterpart in Singapore to extend the operation of its app indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” he said.  Balisacan also said that Uber does not highlight the fact that it would become a “part-owner” of Grab through the deal. “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here.

This is in order not to preempt the PCC’s voluntary review of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to its rival firm Grab. After a 3-hour public hearing conducted by the two-year-old commission on Thursday, April 5, the PCC said it has come up with interim measures to ensure the integrity of the merger review. Tabled for discussion, among other measures, are maintaining the independence of Uber and Grab’s business operations while the review is ongoing, refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses, and refraining from sharing any confidential information like pricing. The PCC said it will also ask Uber and Grab to avoid practices that would reduce the business viability of parties involved, as well as avoid practices that would prejudice the watchdog’s power to review the transaction. “We will impose that the Uber and Grab [apps] will continue to operate beyond April 8, and that they will [still] be operating independently,” PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo said during the hearing. (READ: PCC warns Grab-Uber deal may have ‘far-reaching impact’ on commuters) ‘No capital, no people’ But Uber said it no longer has the capital and people to continue its operations in the Philippines and 7 other markets. “[From] a business standpoint, Uber exited 8 markets, including the Phiippines, as of Monday. Now, I look after 10 markets, instead of 18. Our funding is gone. Our people are gone. We don’t intend to come back to these markets,” Brooks Entwistle, Uber Asia Pacific chief business officer, said during the hearing. Grab, meanwhile, claimed the interim measures of the PCC are “unnecessary” as the end result of the transaction would not have a negative impact on commuters. “The interim measures will not be necessary because the concerns are not really real,” Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said during the public hearing. “Any concern that the commission may have in relation to operating as a single entity is actually not a real concern because there is nothing in the transaction that actually merges the operations,” she added. Uber announced last March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. A day before the public hearing, Grab said the full transition of Uber drivers to its platform will push through despite the ongoing merger review.

This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,' warns an economist","body":" MANILA, Philippines – An economist warned that Filipino commuters could face higher fares and fewer incentives, after California-based Uber decided to sell its entire Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. Ending stiff competition between the ride-hailing behemoths, Uber on Monday, March 26, sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. “Obviously, it is not good. From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,” Fernando Aldaba, dean and professor of economics at the Ateneo de Manila University and a senior fellow of Eagle Watch, told Rappler. “Without competition, prices may go up and quality of service might deteriorate,” Aldaba added. Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8 – or two weeks from now. (READ: Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks) Pola del Monte, a 28-year-old editor in Quezon City, said this gives her no choice but to rely on Grab for ride-hailing services. “I’m an Uber loyalist – largely by force of habit, but also because I prefer its sleeker interface, have had too many pleasant riding experiences, plus I find their customer service impeccable. I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,” she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. “Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won’t be able to compare prices now. We won’t know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,” she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. “If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,” Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  “If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan’s statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. “As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,” the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a “dynamic surcharge” would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. “With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,” the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/198978-uber-philippines-southeast-asia-drivers-grab-migration/","title":"Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks","date":"Mar 26, 2018 1:55 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber's operations in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, will only be available until April 8, following the sale to Grab","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – In two weeks’ time, all drivers of Uber in the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia will have to move to Grab, after the California-based company sold its Southeast Asian business to its Singaporean rival. Uber’s Southeast Asia operations will only be available until April 8. “To minimize disruption, Grab and Uber are working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders, Uber Eats customers, merchant partners, and delivery partners to the Grab platform. The Uber app will continue to operate for two weeks to ensure stability for Uber drivers,” Grab said in a statement on Monday, March 26. “We’re working hard to onboard Uber drivers onto the Grab platform. We appreciate your patience during this transition timeframe if there may be any service disruptions,” the ride-hailing firm added later on its website. In the immediate term, Grab noted that “nothing will change and operations will continue as normal.” Current Uber users’ account information, however, will not be shared with Grab. “If you are new to Grab, we will still need you to register your account with us to start riding,” Grab said. The firm added that fares would remain the same, with a dynamic surcharge applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. As for firms that use Uber as company transportation, Grab said: “Uber for Business services for employees of local and global companies will not be supported for trips taken in Southeast Asia after the transition. Uber rides outside of Southeast Asia will still be supported through existing Uber for Business agreements.” Grab had announced on Monday that it is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the acquisition deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. “We will retain our commitment towards quality of service and continue to adhere to regulatory guidelines on activations and pricing. Most importantly, we are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Grab Philippines country manager Brian Cu said in a separate statement. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was sought for comment on whether it will review the deal, which is seen to affect the local ride-sharing market. But representatives of the antitrust agency could not be reached as of posting. (READ: GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion) The Philippines in May 2015 categorized ride-hailing firms like Uber as a new mode of public transportation called transport network vehicle services (TNVS). These allowed the firms to fall under rules that allow “pre-arranged transportation services” using smartphones and other similar technologies. The Philippine government has since suspended the processing of TNVS applications twice, after issues on the scope of regulation as well as complaints from taxi operators who argued there was “unequal application” of rules. It was just on February 5 this year when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again opened TNVS franchise applications. Despite its aggressive expansion in the region, Uber still lags behind Grab, which covers over 2.3 million drivers in 168 cities across 8 countries. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/198392-facebook-cambridge-analytica-suspension-personal-information-third-party-violation/","title":"Facebook suspends Trump’s data analysis firm for rules violations","date":"Mar 17, 2018 7:17 PM PHT","snippet":"Facebook says a third-party app passed Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, Trump's election campaign data analysis firm, thus leading to the suspension","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Facebook announced late on Friday, March 16, it was suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including its data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, for policy violations pertaining to data retention and collection. In a statement, Facebook wrote that in 2015, “a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.” The Verge said Donald Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 to run data operations for the campaign.  What happened?  Kogan’s app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” was a profiling app billing itself as “a research app used by psychologists.” Some 270,000 people downloaded the application. Those picking up the app gave permission for the app to grab information on the downloader, “such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it,” Facebook explained. Kogan violated Facebook’s policies by passing the information on to a third party, which in this case included SCL and Cambridge Analytica, as well as Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. After finding out about the policy violation, Facebook had the offending parties certify they had destroyed improperly collected data. “Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data,” Facebook said. It doesn’t end there, however, as Facebook recently received reports the data was not all destroyed despite the certifications given. The company is moving to verify the claims and is suspending SCL, Cambridge Analytica, Wylie, and Kogan from the social network till it gets more information. Why is this important?   Facebook banks its reputation on trust, and people working with Facebook in some manner who violate that trust can bring massive consequences for the social media giant’s own perception in the public sphere. A February report from Vox said that separately from Cambridge Analytica, the Trump Campaign hired digital marketing firm Giles-Pascale for social media microtargeting. It added, “Cambridge Analytica convinced Parscale to “try out the firm.” The decision was encouraged by Trump’s campaign manager at the time, Steve Bannon, who was also a former vice president of Cambridge Analytica.” While it’s unclear if Cambridge Analytica actually helped the Trump campaign, the campaign’s social media push was effective. Furthermore, the perception that Facebook got hoodwinked in this manner hurts its reputation in terms of vetting interested parties who want to use Facebook. The company has likely made some changes since then, such as instituting manual and automated checks on apps using Facebook. Still, this tarnishes Facebook’s record somewhat. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/196143-ltfrb-hatchback-metro-cebu-pampanga/","title":"LTFRB: Hatchbacks also allowed in Metro Cebu, Pampanga","date":"Feb 15, 2018 4:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Hatchback units are allowed to operate under ride-hailing services only within a 3-year period according to the LTFRB","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) clarified on Thursday, February 15, that hatchback and compact vehicles are allowed in Metro Cebu and Pampanga. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III made the clarification during the Senate committee on public services. “The issue on the hatchback is that it is allegedly considered in Metro Manila only, but we are allowing it to those areas we allowed the application of TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Service). That is in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Pampanga,” said Delgra. He pointed out, however, that hatchback units under TNVS cannot bring passengers outside Metro Manila and in areas that will have to ply expressways. Delgra said that the LTFRB puts a premium on public’s safety and convenience, hence the regulation of hatchback vehicles providing ride-hailing services. “We have consistently set a higher standard for public utility vehicles for safety and convenience of passengers such as enough legroom or a baggage compartment,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Under LTFRB’s latest memorandum circular, hatchback units will also have to charge lower rates compared to sedans. 3-year period In January, LTFRB planned to ban hatchback and compact vehicles from being accredited for ride-hailing services. Drivers and operators from the TNVS hatchback community appealed to the regulatory board, saying some operators are still paying for the vehicle’s loan amortization.  In February, LTFRB allowed the hatchback units to continue operating but only within a 3-year period to give way to car loan payments. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of Senate committee on public services, asked the LTFRB to reconsider the allowed period for hatchbacks to operate. “I hope there will be an extension, especially if the LTFRB finds that hatchback units do not bring inconvenience to its riders and other road mishaps. Maybe TNVS groups can discuss that again. Hopefully, the allowed hatchback units will be given the opportunity to expand their service,” Poe said in Filipino. On Monday, February 12, the LTFRB raised the allowed number of TNVS franchises to 66,750 from 45,700 units nationwide.

In a press conference, One Goal 1 Voice TNVS community said the LTFRB does not give current and active drivers who do not have provisional authority (PA) assurances that they will be accredited. The application for TNVS permits opens on Monday, February 5, and it will be done on a “first come, first served” basis. The TNVS community is concerned that new operators would submit applications and “hog” the available slots. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III earlier said some 32,000 slots are open to fill the “common supply base,” which was recently set at 45,700 units. Currently, there are around 125,000 units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber Philippines, exceeding the cap twice over. When asked whether current and active drivers would not be prioritized, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said “that seems to be what is happening.” Cu said they are hoping the LTFRB will consider using the transport network companies’ master list of active drivers and prioritize them during the application period. “What we’re proposing, and hopefully that gets settled, is that they (the LTFRB) use the submitted master list as basis of who’s active… I don’t want to log jam the applications that are not complete or are not active and I think a lot of people will agree to that,” Cu said. He also urged the LTFRB to review the cap, suggesting ways on how to arrive at better numbers. Given the total registered number, Cu said there are probably around 90,000 unique units or some 40% less the total registered vehicles. “You subtract those who are not active. I think that’s about 75,000 active unique drivers in total,” he added in a mix of English and Filipino. “Provided with all the numbers, ilan ang active daily? Medyo nagulat kami sa’n nanggaling ‘yung number na ‘yun (How many are active daily? We were surprised where that number came from),” Cu said, referring to the 45,700-unit cap. Review the cap On Monday, January 29, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said he has already ordered the LTFRB to review Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-003 which limits the common supply base of TNVS. Tugade said policies “should be anchored in the spirit of good governance and compassion, in order to better serve the interest of all the stakeholders.” In a statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said it will monitor the number of booking requests received by ride-hailing apps, including the served and unserved requests. The DOTr will also take into acount number coding, maintenance schedules, and drivers’ working hours. “We assure you that should there be adjustments in the common supply base as a result of the review, the decision would be based on actual data from the different transport network companies, thorough DOTr study, and consultations with the public at large,” the department said. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, earlier asked the LTFRB to “explain the math” behind the common supply base crafted by the regulatory board.

Impact Poe highlighted the possible impact on both drivers and patrons of the service. The senator asked if consultations with patrons were done by the regulatory agency. “If the most important components in the ride-sharing business, the customers, were consulted, was there a survey? Was the pulse of those who’ll be affected were taken into account?” Poe said in a mix of Engish and Filipino.

At first touch, you wouldn’t feel you were holding an entry-level device, with its matte back and glossy, curved-glass front. But does the Nokia 3 hold its own among the slew of other budget Android smartphones in the market today? Let’s find out. Design When you first unbox the Nokia 3, you’ll be greeted by an unassuming but solidly built smartphone. Its metal edges give it a premium feel, complemented by its matte polycarbonate back that, although plastic, still looks stunning.    A squarish design with rounded corners nods back to Nokia’s historic Lumia design philosophy, but it stops there. There are no brilliant hues and glossy plastic. The review unit I got was the matte black one, but there are other color options, including tempered blue, silver white, and copper white. Nokia paid attention to the details with the Nokia 3, too, featuring power and volume buttons on the right side that are painted black but have stainless edges. It’s a small detail that has a very big effect on the design. The buttons are barely noticeable when viewed head-on, but from an angle, the stainless edges accentuate them beautifully. Atop the device is the 3.5mm jack, and at the bottom are the micro USB charging and data port and speakers. The SIM and SD card slots can be found on the left side. Ergonomically speaking, the device sits comfortably in the hand despite its 5-inch 720p display. Design-wise, you could say that the Nokia 3 beats the competition; you won’t find any other smartphone with a similar design in this price point. At least, not now. Performance Nokia promises regular updates, but didn’t specify if it meant that you’ll always have the latest Android OS. It may be a vague promise for now, but at least the Nokia 3 comes with Android 7 Nougat, the latest available release. We don’t have to wait long to see if Nokia will hold true to their word regarding “regular updates,” as the release of Android 8 Oreo seems to be just around the corner.  Android purists will love the Nokia 3’s stock Android software, which goes well with the minimalist look of the device. No bloatware or third-party apps here – just pure Android enjoyment with no Nokia branding whatsoever.  The MediaTek MT6737 processor is a bit of a letdown, though, clocking in at only 1.3GHz. Although, it’s quad-core, you might find yourself frustrated with the Nokia 3’s performance at times.  Apps may lag or freeze when things get too heavy, but once the device gets its bearings back, it’s smooth sailing again.  One minor annoyance I experienced while using the Nokia 3 was ride-hailing apps, specifically the Grab app, not working and often freezing up on me. I don’t know if it’s related to the GPS chip used on the device, but it irked me because I didn’t think getting a ride home should be that hard. Using the GPS on a smartphone may work its battery hard, but it shouldn’t be a problem with RAM, especially with the Nokia 3’s ample 2GB of it. My experience with app crashes and longer load times with the Nokia 3 deterred me from installing bigger and memory-heavy apps, but of those I installed, I found that all of them worked – eventually. Gaming surprisingly worked well, although you’ll have to wait a bit longer for the games to load. Watching videos was a delight with the Nokia 3, but I recommend using earphones because the speaker on the device is rather unremarkable. The bundled headset isn’t the best, either, so if you have your own set of headphones, wired or otherwise, I suggest you use them.  Speaking of wireless audio, I had some minor issues when connected to a Bluetooth speaker. I paired devices with no issues, but when I walked some ten steps away from the speaker with the Nokia 3 in hand,  I found that the sound became choppy and sometimes cut out.   Take note that there were no obstructions between the phone and the speaker when this happened so I found it kind of strange. Wireless headphones may be different issue altogether, but it’s something to take note of when using wireless devices for audio. Cameras The cameras found on the Nokia 3’s back and front are both 8MP shooters. While they may serve acceptable spur-of-the-moment snapshots, the performance of both cameras is mediocre, at best. In fact, they can be quite frustrating at times due to its quite long boot time and a disappointing shutter lag. If you’re worried about missing fleeting moments, the Nokia 3 doesn’t do a lot to ease the anxiety.    In good lighting conditions, however, and with minimal action and camera shake, both cameras take sharp photos. The powerful LED flash helps a bit in low-light situations if you find yourself in a pinch, but who takes photos with the flash on these days? Taking videos was surprisingly stable, considering that there’s no stabilization to speak of here. Of course, as an entry-level device, videos are limited to a resolution of 720p. No 4k videos here. Battery Battery life is pretty good but not the best; for a 2630mAh battery, I expected it to last a bit longer. It’s enough for a day’s use, though, but expect to charge it every night. The real disappointment with the battery is the charging time.  The Nokia 3’s battery takes a long time to charge fully – around 4 to 6 hours. I got tired of waiting to see the exact length of time it took. Suffice it to say, it’s a hassle when your battery runs low in the middle of the day and you need to fully charge it immediately.  This is unacceptable for a smartphone in 2017, and the only workaround is charging it overnight, which isn’t always ideal. I’d have hoped there would be a fast-charging option, but no dice. Will the Nokia 3 be your next Android phone?  If you’re looking for a no-frills smartphone that has all the basics in a slick, premium-looking package, then the Nokia 3 should suit your needs fine. If, however, you’re looking for power and the bells and whistles of a flagship, you better look elsewhere.  Power users will find the Nokia 3 wanting, but it’s a great backup phone due to its price (P6,999 at launch), and it will make your mom or significant other happy if they were to receive it as a gift. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/190107-grab-star-wars-choose-side/","title":"The First Order vs The Resistance: Which side are you on?","date":"Dec 1, 2017 7:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s your chance to pick a side before things take a turn for the worse in Star Wars: The Last Jedi","body":" MANILA, Philippines – This December, the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order is expected to take a turn for the worse in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When Starkiller Base, the First Order’s headquarters, was destroyed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it may have taken a toll on their resources but not at all on their strength and numbers. And they’re more than ready to launch yet another attack. The Resistance also have no choice but to fight back to save the galaxy’s freedom and democracy. Now that Luke Skywalker is back, he’s here to train Rey, the only chance that the Resistance has against the First Order, to prepare her for a face-off with one of the order’s leaders, Kylo Ren. And because there is really no room for peace, and a war is inevitable, everyone is forced to pick a side. If you were living in this galaxy far, far away, (but you’re not really an avid Star Wars fan) how will you know which side you’ll take? Here’s a quick guide: First Order  Background: The First Order is a political and military faction organized following the fall of the Galactic Empire. It’s composed of former Imperial military members and sympathizers who resided in unknown parts of the galaxy to carefully plan for their return to power. The Order is patterned after the fascist ideals of the Empire but taking only its strengths and eliminating its weaknesses. They have an alliance with Knights of Ren. Leaders: Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, Captain Phasma, Kylo Ren Members: Stormtroopers, Flametroopers, Snowtroopers Mission: Get their revenge against the Resistance for destroying the Starkiller Base and ultimately, take over the Republic as the Galactic Empire once did before it was overthrown by the government. The Resistance  Background: The Resistance, as the name suggests, is a military resistance movement that was formed to fight against the First Order. It was when the Galactic Senate didn’t see the Order as a threat to the Republic that General Leia organized this militant group. And when the First Order fired the Starkiller Base’s superweapon that destroyed the Hosnian System, it was the Resistance who launched a counterattack. The Galactic Senate is now their ally. Leaders: General Leia Organa, Admiral Statura, Admiral Ackbar, Major Brance, Major Ematt  Members: Poe Dameron, Rey, Finn, Doctor Kalonia, Snap Wexley, Jess Pava, Ello Asty, Nien Nunb, Vober Dand, Goss Toowers, Bollie Prindel, Kaydel Ko, Pamich Nerro, Korr Sella, C-3PO, R2-D2, BB-8 Mission: To save innocent lives and maintain peace, freedom, and democracy by preventing the First Order from overthrowing the government and claiming the Republic. Now, that you know more about the two opposing sides, it’s time to pledge your allegiance using Grab. This December, Grab is urging you to choose a side – the First Order or the Resistance – and to battle it out to win special prizes including a Sphero Droid and Lego Set, The Last Jedi premiums, tickets to the private movie screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi,  or a grand prize of an all-inclusive trip for two to the world’s largest privately-owned Star Wars memorabilia museum, Rancho Obi-Wan in San Francisco, California, USA. All you have to do is click on your chosen side from the pop-up window that will appear when you launch your Grab app (see the car icons change into A-Wings or TIE Silencers once you activate the Star Wars theme!). Use the promo code THELASTJEDI to qualify. Top five riders from Resistance and First Order sides will have to battle it out for a chance to win the grand prize: a Rancho Obi-wan trip. Every ride also earns you GrabRewards points that you can use to redeem Star Wars premiums. Watch out for the Resistance and the First Order car wraps driving around the streets of Manila and more details about this Star Wars x Grab event. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/science/189328-artificial-intelligence-story-not-data/","title":"I am story, not data","date":"Nov 23, 2017 7:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'We live and die as stories, not as data'","body":"Three days ago, I was face to face with “Alter” and it was not just looking at me, it was sensing me and its environment. Alter is a humanoid robot stationed in Miraikan, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo. Alter’s insides are laid bare but it had a face and arms that moved in patterns that it “thinks up” by itself.  It senses noise, humidity, pressure and temperature around it and reacts to these elements. And since those things change minute to minute, Alter builds up on its own learning and reacts to it in ways that are not predictable. What you see is a humanoid that moves, not quite like a human does, but you get a sense that it is no longer mechanical, that it is alive in its own right, even if in the place of a beating heart, it has “coupled pendulums” that mimic neural signals. I participated in the Science Center World Summit held last week so in that same day, I also listened to the Chief Scientist of Hitachi, Kazuo Yano, with great optimism, about the role of AI in promoting human well-being. He is involved in AI technology that examines the link between human happiness and movement. One big finding he revealed was that people in call centers who are active, are able to sustain their activity more, and report (through the sensors they were fitted with) being happy more than those who stay at rest more. The goal of this study was not to measure happiness per se but to link it with productivity since it has been pretty much established in studies that happy people are more productive. It would have been so easy to accept the robust link between productivity and happiness if human productivity only included call centers or sales performance. An Italian researcher, Daniel Archibugi, who sat in the same panel as Dr. Yano, did raise a challenge to the latter as to what we will do with poets whose obvious productivity, as seen in their works, are, in great part, attributable to their inner capital: “unhappiness”. In a session that I moderated, I had presenters who demonstrated technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, robots and learning trackers not only as they are today but what they would probably look like at least 10 years from now. Maholo Uchida, the one in charge of the robots in Miraikan, spoke of their robots as members of their team, even taking great care of the humanoids when they would be lent to other institutions, to the extent of having fashion and hair stylists for these humanoids. Towards the end of the summit, I had a chat with the first Japanese astronaut, Dr. Mamoru Mohri, who also headed Miraikan – the science museum of new and emerging technologies, especially AIs. At the summit, he showed us videos of when he was in space looking at the Earth, giving us a keen sense that the Earth was indeed a lonely planet – there is no neighboring planet that could save it or save us. He was born of the Earth and as an astronaut, has risen above it to contemplate it and to share that wisdom with the rest of us, who most likely will remain grounded. He possessed this wisdom that also seemed unabashed to welcoming AIs as complementing human lives. He noticed my earrings. I was wearing a pair of astronaut earrings given as a gift by someone whom I treated like my own son. Dr. Mohri pointed to them and said “Is that Asimo?” (Asimo is the Honda resident robot of Miraikan.) I said, “No, Dr. Mohri, it’s you.” My head spins imagining our common future with AIs. AIs are the chief sense-makers of what has come to be called “big data” that everyone wants to collect. My head did not just spin with the prospects that are already articulated in the news and current literature: “AIs will eliminate jobs”, “AIs will augment jobs”, “AIs will annihilate humans and the world”, “AIs will transform the world for the better”. I get worried when Stephen Hawking, who has contemplated the death of stars and planets and Elon Musk, a revolutionary technologist, rise as top voices that warn against an uncontrolled AI future. But my AI anxiety is also tempered when I hear Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg be more optimistic about what AI can do to make us better humans or a force for good. But then, there is also what critics too say about Musk and Zuckerberg standing where they do, because it is consistent with their branding. But even without the hyped debates of these tech celebrities, there is no escaping future days and nights with AI. Robots  do not only do backflips, or animate science museums. They are also now embedded in the pillars and peripherals of human work and life including transport (yes, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab rely on AI), defense, food, and commerce. In the future and some say in the near-future, self-driving cars and trucks will be familiar.  Food will be tailored and made according to detected requirements, and stores and supermarkets will be characteristically human-less, save for the shadow humans who designed the AIs that run them. I am fascinated by AI prospects.  I am also anxious about them. This is the nature of a non-AI. I am very conscious that I was not raised to look at machines as living but I also am aware that some cultures do not differentiate or they do not find it hard to look at AIs as a genuine part of human lives. I know that their view is as valid as mine. But maybe there are profound questions that we all can agree on posing, regardless of culture or level of technological development. Like any technology, AI could go spectacularly well in some aspects or gloriously fail us in others. But aside from those, it would also have unintended consequences.  Would we be ready to reverse the consequences if they do not turn out to be good? Just as an earlier study this year has shown, AI could also learn human biases and operate with them. Then, would AI just be a mere technological mirror of the human designers in First World countries and their own biases – a repeat of our imperial and colonial past? Will AIs be able to make imaginative leaps in thought and action that our most profound human stories are made of? Would an AI have made that leap that Einstein did, given data that was only Newtonian? Would slavery have been outlawed by AI given only data from slave owners? Would AI ever do the neural razzmatazz that would make it even come close to the literary and musical genius of say, a Lin-Manuel Miranda? Data is not narrative. It is only part of it. A narrative is a story we tell ourselves to keep ourselves together so we know who we are and can imagine who we can become, joined by all the other selves that we scoop and tuck in the folds of our own lifetimes.  We live and die as stories, not as data.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/188978-singapore-rolls-out-tough-measures-to-keep-cars-off-the-roads/","title":"Singapore rolls out tough measures to keep cars off the roads","date":"Nov 20, 2017 11:56 AM PHT","snippet":"Singapore's policies on transportation are facing mounting criticism thanks to rush-hour jams, surging vehicle prices, and public transport breakdowns","body":" SINGAPORE – In the battle against the car, space-starved Singapore has deployed road tolls, massive spending on public transport, and a license fee that bumps the cost of an average vehicle to over $80,000. But urban planners looking for solutions to gridlock may find the draconian measures hard to replicate in other less-compliant cities. Singapore has gone further than any other major city to avoid the monster jams that have blighted Asian metropolises such as Jakarta or Manila. The tough approach has been possible as Singaporeans are used to strict control – with media closely monitored and harsh punishments for minor crimes – and are fearful the city-state will be flooded with vehicles without the curbs. However the model faces mounting criticism thanks to rush-hour jams that have frustrated commuters, surging vehicle prices after a freeze on car numbers, and public transport breakdowns. “I think the system can be made better and fairer,” Joel Lee, a 28-year-old technician, told Agence France-Presse. He said authorities should make “a distinction between those who need cars, be it for work or family commitments, and those who just want more cars as a status symbol”. Six times the price Authorities’ main tool is the certificate of entitlement, or COE. Every potential car buyer must bid for a certificate and the cost is added to the vehicle price. The current cost of a COE for an average family car is almost Sg$50,000, pushing the price of a Toyota Corolla to Sg$114,000 (US$83,000). But COEs fluctuate depending on demand and at their high point 4 years ago the same car was Sg$159,000 (US$127,000 at the exchange rate at the time) – six times the price in the US. The certificates are valid for 10 years, after which the car must be scrapped or the certificate renewed. Despite the high price, many in the financial center, home to hordes of wealthy expats and millionaires, have bought cars, with some 600,000 on the streets – a considerable number for a limited road network. Other key measures include controlling the number of vehicles on the road and charging tolls on main roads at busy times. Authorities last month decided to freeze the number of private cars on the road from February for at least two years, citing land scarcity. But the decision sparked anger and was followed by a jump in the price of COEs by several thousand dollars, in what the Straits Times newspaper described as “panic buying”. To mitigate its tough policies, Singapore has built a modern public transport network with a subway, overland trains and buses, and the government recently announced a plan to spend Sg$28 billion to upgrade the system. Ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber have helped those unable or unwilling to spend on a car, and the government plans to build 700 kilometers (430 miles) of cycle paths. But the subway has recently been hit by repeated delays and breakdowns during rush hour. In the most serious incident for years a tunnel on the network flooded last month, crippling a main line for 20 hours, and sparking widespread anger. ‘Car-lite’ woes Some are now questioning the government’s plan to make Singapore a country where most people walk, cycle or take public transport. “The government has been trying to make the city ‘car-lite’ but you have a train system that’s not very reliable,” Jason Lin, a 66-year-old retiree, told Agence France-Presse. “If you take a bus, because there are so many cars, it’ll take a long time. It can be very frustrating.” Speaking in parliament this month, Lam Pin Min, a senior minister of state for transport, insisted there significant growth in the transport network was planned and there would be “less need to own a car”. Singapore has not heavily promoted electric cars as it pushes public transport – unlike rival financial hub Hong Kong – but an electric-car sharing scheme starting next month is a first step to changing that. Other places echo Singapore’s approach – London has a congestion charge while Paris sometimes orders some private cars off the road due to air pollution – but they are unlikely to copy the city-state’s tougher measures as it would be too risky. “COE is not a very popular measure, and any government that tries to implement this kind of a measure in any other country may lose elections,” Vivek Vaidya, a transport expert at business consultancy Frost and Sullivan, told Agence France-Presse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/188106-commuters-traffic-edsa-asean-summit/","title":"EDSA ‘parking lot’: Commuters endure traffic ahead of ASEAN Summit","date":"Nov 11, 2017 5:58 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) MMDA opens the ASEAN lane along EDSA Northbound to the public as of 6 pm on Saturday, November 11","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Angry commuters and motorists complained of being “trapped” in traffic congestion along EDSA on Saturday, November 11, two days before the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit.

Businesses based on apps or digital technology are poised to become successful if backed by the right idea, Concepcion said during the 2017 Manila Social Good Summit held on Saturday, September 16, in Taguig. “The future for you is the digital economy that is growing…Tech space, whether it’s robotics, AI (artificial intelligence), that is your advantage. Because you understand it more than we who are above 50, [the] 70, 80 generation. You are not scared of playing around with gadgets,” said Concepcion. He cited the example of apps like Uber and Grab, wildly successful digital ventures that make money but also provide essential services to people. Many other apps allow plumbers, house cleaners, or other service providers to access bigger markets through technology. At no other time has the digital economy been so robust since so many people today are dependent on their smartphones and apps. All millennials need to do to become a successful digitial entrepreneur is to identify a problem that can be solved on a smartphone. “Identifying a problem gives you an opportunity. You can develop a business model on the digital space,” said Concepcion.  Opportunities for Filipino millennials to start successful business ventures abound and millennials should not be scared to take them, he said. Never fear failure Fear of failure is one big factor stopping young Filipinos from becoming entrepreneurs, given all the risk involved. “Never fear to fail because if you fear to fail you will never be successful because you will never attempt to do anything,” said Concepcion. He started his presentation by recalling the time he sold his first cotton candy as a budding entrepreneur. This kind of training has helped Concepcion, who now heads food and beverage company RFM Corporation. His grandfather, Jose N. Concepcion Sr, is a co-founder of RFM. Earning from his cotton candy business made him feel “happy and accomplished” but it was only one of many enterprises, some of which had failed. Challenge and opportunity Setbacks and hardships may discourage even the most determined entrepreneurs but Concepcion said some of the best opportunities arise from the most dire of circumstances. He pointed out that some of today’s most successful businessmen started their businesses during the Marcos regime, which was fraught with uncertainty and a climate of fear due to martial law. Businessmen like Henry Sy and John Gokongwei managed to shepherd their businesses through these trying times and emerge winners. “It is the times that are most challenging that presents the greatest opportunity. There would be no Jollibee, no SM if our eonomy was so robust many, many years ago because these multinational corporations would have come to the Philippines and many of our local brands would have had a difficult time challenging these huge corporations,” said Concepcion. But today’s aspiring entrepreneurs face different challenges and opportunities compared to entrepeneurs of previous generations. Technology is changing what consumers want and need, thus revolutionizing the kinds of services and products that are in-demand. “Technology has really changed and increased the speed of doing business, creating ideas, and that is your advantage,” said Concepcion. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/179186-grab-ltfrb-cancelled-trip-surge-price-nograles/","title":"Declined, cancelled on by drivers, lawmaker calls on LTFRB to check Grab","date":"Aug 18, 2017 7:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Representative Jericho Nograles says 'was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – After being declined and cancelled on several times by drivers using the platform Grab, party-list Representative Jericho Nograles called on the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to check these violations. Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/175950-analysis-cracking-down-uber-grab-hurt-commuters/","title":"Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them","date":"Jul 18, 2017 1:23 PM PHT","snippet":"Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters?","body":"The daily commute around Metro Manila is bad as it is. But impending government regulations are about to make it downright painful. Starting July 26, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend and fine Uber and Grab drivers, and impound their cars, if found lacking the necessary permits. Before this, LTFRB fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for allowing such illegal or “colorum” vehicles to ply the streets. The LTFRB maintains that this crackdown is meant to protect commuters. One official said, “Paramount to LTFRB is the demand and the need [of the] riding public.” But will this crackdown really help commuters? In this article we argue that, given the significant value of ride-hailing services to Filipino commuters, this crackdown will invariably hurt the riding public, not protect them. Consumer value  Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters? In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmario.limos%2Fposts%2F10155541327053147&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”626″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

But these proudly Pinoy brands are fast becoming known in Southeast Asia, with some even venturing beyond the region and bringing their products to the global market. Several brands from neighboring countries like Singapore and Malaysia are also making waves – from Grab, Malaysia’s ride-hailing service that rivals the US-based Uber, to Singapore bakery BreadTalk, with its signature open-plan kitchen that has established an international presence. Rappler lists down some regional brands in Asia that are making their mark around the world.  1. Grab (Malaysia) Grab – then known as GrabTaxi – was a gamechanger in the ride-hailing service industry when it first launched in 2012. Following in the success of the San Francisco-based Uber, the app makes it easy for passengers to hail taxis with just a few taps on their smartphones. The idea for Grab came about following a conversation between co-founder Anthony Tan and an Indonesian friend about the difficulty of hailing taxis in Malaysia. Tan, then a student at Harvard, worked with fellow Malaysian classmate Tan Hooi Ling to create a business plan for what would soon be launched in Malaysia as MyTeksi. The mobile app aimed to connect taxi drivers to passengers efficiently, making it easy for riders to get a ride and for drivers to be assured of their next passenger without aimlessly roaming around the city. (READ: GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes) Since its launch in Malaysia in June 2012, the app has launched in 6 more countries around the region: the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Manila saw the app’s launch in August 2013; it has since expanded to include other Philippine cities such as Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. Aside from booking taxis, the Grab app also offers booking of private cars, a ridesharing carpool service, and a motorcycle delivery service.  2. British India (Malaysia) Established in 1994, British India is a fashion label calling Malaysia – not Britain or India – as its home. It was founded by Pat Liew, who has more than 30 years of experience in the retail industry under her belt. Upon launching, the colonial era-inspired fashion brand had a cheeky tagline: “Presenting British India. An era of racism, oppression, injustice and nice outfits.” Within months since its launch, the brand came out with 4 outlets in Malaysia and 4 in Singapore by the mid-1990s. The Singapore launch, Liew said, was a testbed for the brand’s readiness for a global presence. Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the Malaysian brand has expanded into other countries in Asia, with more than 40 outlets in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.  3. BreadTalk (Singapore) BreadTalk entered the Philippine market in 2004, opening its first branch at Glorietta 4 mall in Makati City and enticing customers with its unique open-plan kitchen that offered a glimpse of how the bread was made. The Singapore-based brand was founded in April 2000, entering Singapore’s bakery industry with products that catered to traditional tastes as well as promoting and creating new varieties of bread. The bakery often has customized product offerings to fit the local flavors or preferences in their outlets in the region. They also launch new products to fit in with seasonal festivals and trends. The company opened its first overseas outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003. Since then, it has expanded to more than 900 outlets in 17 countries. Its brand portfolio also includes Toast Box, Food Republic, and Ramen Play. It manages the Singapore franchise of the Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung as well.  4. TWG Tea Company (Singapore) Luxury brand TWG Tea (which stands for The Wellbeing Group) was founded by Taha Bouqdib, Maranda Barnes, and Rith Aum-Stievenard in 2008, with Singapore as the launch base of the brand. The famous teashop, which brands itself as an upscale tea salon, offers more than 1,000 fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, as well as a variety of tea patisseries and delicacies. The “1837” in the company’s branding doesn’t refer to the date it was established, but refers to the year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore, when the island became a trading post for teas. The luxury brand quickly became well-known worldwide, with its teas being served in some of Singapore’s best hotels and in the front cabins of Singapore Airlines. Food chain Dean & Deluca also brought the brand to US markets, while Harrods brought the brand to London.   5. Potato Corner (Philippines) Known for its flavored french fries, this homegrown brand has been in the industry for 24 years, with more than 500 branches in the Philippines and several more in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Panama. Potato Corner opened its first kiosk outlet back in 1992. Two years since it started business, the brand opened 70 outlets across the country. It opened its first overseas outlet in 2006 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and entered the US market in 2012. By 2016, the brand had 800 stores and had begun operating in Thailand.   6. Jollibee (Philippines) Filipinos love Jollibee. And so does the rest of the world.  The fast food giant behind well-loved food products such as Chicken Joy and Yumburger traces its beginnings to 1975, when Filipino-Chinese founder Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice cream shop in Cubao, Quezon City. The ice cream shop would later become Jollibee’s first outlet, and would become the bedrock of the company’s rapid expansion for years to come. Jollibee boasts a presence of nearly 978 stores in the Philippines and 80 stores internationally to date. The company also operates other fast food chains including Chowking, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, and Red Ribbon. Jollibee has established an international presence in Canada, the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Brunei, Oman, and Qatar. The group caters not only to Filipinos working overseas but also to locals, who form part of the snaking lines that greet Jollibee’s store openings outside the Philippines. The company withstood the entrance of McDonald’s to the Philippine market in 1981 as it catered to distinct Filipino tastes, setting it apart from the international fast food giant.    7. URC (Philippines) Tracing its beginnings to as early as 1954, Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was started by Filipino businessman John Gokongwei, who learned to do business as a trade importer during World War II and the postwar years. The company started out as a corn mill under the name Universal Corn Products. This business would become the foundation for URC as it is known today – a household name in the snacks industry, agro-industrial operations, and commodities distribution. URC products are distributed under the company’s brands including Jack ‘n Jill, Robina Farms, Robichem, and Universal Corn Products. The company offerings include snacks, beverages, meat and poultry products, and commodities like sugar and flour. URC has expanded beyond the Philippines, distributing its products to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  8. San Miguel (Philippines) Established in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, San Miguel is Southeast Asia’s first brewery and the Philippines’ largest brewery to date. The Philippine brand is also part of one of the country’s largest conglomerates: San Miguel Corporation, which has businesses ranging from food, power, oil, and infrastructure to airlines, beverages, and packaging.   San Miguel has been under the control of prominent Filipino families such as the Zobel de Ayalas, Roxases, and Sorianos. It is currently largely owned and operated by Ramon Ang and Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. The company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Hong Kong, China, and Australia.  San Miguel exports its beer to major markets around the world and is consistently part of the top 10 bestselling beer brands worldwide. Its brands include Red Horse, Golden Eagle, and the company’s namesake beer products such as household brands San Miguel Pale Pilsen and San Miguel Light.  9. Integrated Micro-Electronics (Philippines) One of the Philippines’ oldest and largest conglomerates, the Ayala group has expanded its presence beyond the country, not only in the region but also globally. The group’s largest international operations is under the company Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated (IMI), a leading provider in electronics manufacturing services and power semiconductor assembly and tests services. Established in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins Incorporated, its services cater to a number of industries including telecommunications infrastructure, consumer electronics, solar energy, automotives, medical machines, and storage devices. IMI’s global presence includes manufacturing operations in China, Singapore, the United States, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Czech Republic. The company also has sales operations in Japan and Germany. The company recently marked its entrance into the aerospace industry and defense sector this year with its acquisition of STI Enterprises, a UK-based electronics manufacturing services company.  10. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) Another Filipino conglomerate, the Aboitiz group, has established an international presence with Pilmico Foods Corporation. Pilmico operates animal farms and also produces and distributes flour and animal feeds. The company was incorporated in 1958 as Central Philippine Milling Corporation by brothers Ramon and Vidal Aboitiz. In 1962, the company partnered with The Pillsbury Company of Minnesota, USA to establish operations in Mindanao. The company changed its name to Pilmico Food Corporation in 1990, upon the sale of all its shares to Aboitiz & Company. The company’s brand profile includes Wooden Spoon flours, Home Style, and Pilmico.  In 2013, Pilmico started exporting its products to the ASEAN market, prompting it to establish operations in Indonesia and Vietnam. At present, Pilmico flour is exported to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Hong Kong. Its feeds business also currently exports to Cambodia.  11. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (Malaysia) Founded by Chinese-Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts opened its first location in April 1971 in Singapore. Inspired by the legendary land found in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton, the Shangri-La group draws from the description of the land being an earthly paradise.  The group, now based in Hong Kong, operates 5-star luxury hotels and resorts in several locations and is famous for its world-renowned hospitality and services. According to its company website, the group’s brand portfolio includes Shangri-La, Kerry, and Hotel Jen and Traders branded properties.  Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts has a presence in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean islands, with over 40,000 rooms.    12. J.Co Donuts (Indonesia) The popular donut brand finds its roots in Indonesia, where it was established in 2005 by businessman Johnny Andrean. Known for its unique flavor offerings, the company opened its first outlet the same year.  In a little over 10 years, the company now operates over 214 stores in Indonesia and has expanded its presence to other countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  J.Co’s donuts are known for their high quality toppings like matcha green tea, premium dark chocolate, and roasted almonds. The brand is also popular for its playful product names and has expanded into other offerings such as frozen yogurt, beverages, and sandwiches. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/165942-fleetshare-unlimited-rides-metro-manila/","title":"PH app FleetShare offers ‘unlimited rides’ for P3,999 a month","date":"Apr 3, 2017 5:25 PM PHT","snippet":"But the app has a couple of restrictions – destinations must be within 15 kilometers from pickup locations and only a passenger's first 40 bookings are given priority","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Local ride-sharing companies U-Hop and FleetShare released a new transport app featuring a subscription-based ride-all-you-can scheme. The app, also called FleetShare, was launched on Monday, April 3. For P3,999 a month, members will be given “access to unlimited rides” in Metro Manila, according to a press release sent by FleetShare. (READ: Ride-sharing shuttle service U-Hop gets LTFRB accreditation) There are a couple of restrictions, however, for these unlimited rides. First, the destination must only be within 15 kilometers from the pickup location. FleetShare didn’t specify what happens if a trip exceeds that range, but it is possible there would be additional costs. We’ve reached out to FleetShare regarding the matter. Second, only the first 40 bookings of a passenger are given priority-booking treatment. This means that when a passenger tries to book a ride after his or her 40th FleetShare trip, the system will prioritize the bookings of other passengers who haven’t reached 40 bookings yet. Passengers will still be able to book and ride, but it will likely take them a little longer to get a car due to this booking system.  FleetShare said its app will not have price surges that passengers experience from competing apps Grab and Uber. Membership is currently open to the first 1,000 registrants in Metro Manila. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/156985-duterte-uber-grab-taxis-identification/","title":"Duterte to order Uber, Grab, taxi drivers to display IDs on car seats","date":"Dec 30, 2016 10:49 AM PHT","snippet":"The President wants guidelines issued by January requiring drivers to place enlarged identification cards on car seats so passengers can easily report abuse","body":" MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte will require Uber, Grab, and taxi drivers to prominently display identification cards on car seats to make it easier for passengers to report abuse. “From now on, ngayong January, I’ll issue the regulations. Itong lahat maglagay kayo ng mukha ninyo sa likod ng upuan ninyo, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card,” Duterte said during a one-on-one interview with Rappler’s Maria Ressa in Malacañang on Thursday, December 29. (WATCH: Duterte: The Wartime President)  (From now on, this January, I’ll issue the regulations. All of you put your face at the back of your seat, your name, a sort of an enlarged identification card.) Apparently, reports of abusive drivers have reached the President who had only harsh words should such exploitation of passengers continue. “Kayong mga taxi driver, you better stop it. Kayo, ‘yung Uber pati ‘yung isa, putang ina, ‘yung, ano ‘yung isa? You stop it. You stop it,” he said. (You taxi drivers, you better stop it. You, Uber, even the other one, son of a bitch what’s the other one? You stop it. You stop it.) Drivers who charge more than they should, based on the meter, are committing the crime of estafa or swindling, Duterte added. It’s not clear if the President is aware of the Uber and Grab app features that provide driver information to passengers and even allow passengers to report wrongdoing to app managers. For him, physical identification cards are an easier way for passengers to note down information necessary to pin down crooked drivers. ‘What if I ride your taxi?’ Duterte also wants passengers to report abuses to the Philippine National Police instead of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) since police have the mandate to discipline criminal behavior. “Don’t go to LTFRB. Those agencies have nothing to do with law and order…Disciplining or forcing peope to obey, not to commit crimes, you report directly to the police and the police will have to act on it,” said Duterte. He acknowledged that many taxi drivers supported his presidential bid and that many of them are honest. For dishonest cabbies, he painted a different scenario, with him as their passenger. “Ano kaya kung magsakay ako sa taxi mo, maglabas ako ng sikreto ng Malacañang? Magsakay ako sa taxi mo tapos ikaw ‘yung naturo na nagrape ng babae, magsabi ako ihatid mo ako doon sa Cavite tapos sabi ko, baba ako dito, ano kaya tingin mo gawain ko sa iyo?” he said. (What if I ride your taxi and I reveal a secret of Malacañang?

The storm has left around a million Bicolanos in evacuation areas and left thousands of passengers hoping to spend their holidays in the Visayas stranded at the Matnog port. Camarines Sur has been placed under a state of calamity on Monday morning. The Philippines is not the only country that went on crisis mode on Christmas day, Chile was hit by a powerful earthquake on December 25. Thankfully, no casualties were reported. The year 2016 has been difficult for many. This is reflected in messages delivered by Church leaders on Christmas day. At the Saint Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis called for guns to fall silent in Syria. He also urged Israelis and Palestinians to “have the courage and the determination to write a new page of history.” In the Philippines, Lingayen Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, urged Filipinos to remain vigilant over extrajudicial killings even as they celebrated the holidays.  In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump considers dissolving his charitable foundation in the face of brewing conflict of interest issues. He is, however, prevented from doing so by ongoing investigations.  Closer to home, China sends its sole aircraft carrier into the Pacific for the first time – a move likely to raise regional tensions. A little good news to Filipino commuters: transport apps Grab and Uber heed the call of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to impose caps on holiday rates.

Rewards, spent his days working in a computer shop near the University of San Carlos in the late 90s. “I didn’t even have a computer. I worked as an assistant in an Internet cafe,” he said. “When it wasn’t busy, that’s when I’d practice design on my own,” he told Rappler. He’s now a co-founder of an original social app called Hoy! Rewards. The app gives rewards for users who take selfies with their favorite brands. He was 17 when he first starting practicing design. “We experienced living in the streets before,” Mayol said in Bisaya. His parents got sick while he was young. While his mother survived, his father passed away. “Computers were really my passion,” he said. “In those days, there weren’t any YouTube tutorials. So I just studied design of the Americans and Europeans,” Mayol explained.  Before founding Hoy! Rewards with his business partner Royce Albert Dy, Seph took the skills he learned in the internet cafe and worked as a freelance designer, creating online and offline projects for Hollywood websites, movies and celebrities.  Freelancing helped provide a good living for Seph and his family. But by 2015, he, together with Dy, was ready to develop his own app. (Read: [Executive Edge] Hoy! Turning selfies into brand placement)  How it works Mayol got his idea for Hoy! from watching movies. “The idea hit me while I was watching Transformers,” he said. “I noticed how brand placements were very noticeable in that movie; usually brand placements are being done in a subtle manner.” This was also the time when the Philippines was hailed as the “selfie capital of the world.”  The idea excited him. “What if there’s a camera in front of us, in all of our daily activities, just like the actors in the movies? How many brands do you think you could show to your audience?” He noticed that people were already doing this, and saw an opportunity. For someone to get rewards, one should first download Hoy! from Google Play or the iTunes app store then set up their profile. Each Hoy! brand partner assigns a “goal memory” or the number of likes the user’s selfie should achieve. For example, Chowking might ask you to take a picture with their store logo, cup, food packaging or take-out bags. The app will tell the users how many likes the photo should generate. Hoy will validate if the task has been completed, then a digi-stub will be issued for a reward of free food or dessert from Chowking. Big aspirations Seph said the goal is for Hoy! to be mentioned in the same breath as Uber, Facebook, Instagram, Grab, Viber and other popular mobile apps used across the globe.  While the company has received partnership and acquisition offers, Seph is committed to maintaining the identity of Hoy! as a uniquely Cebuano-made app. But it hasn’t been without challenges. Mayol said he’s had to market the app to partners on his own in Manila after a partnership with a public relations agency fell through. From this February to June this year, this required him to split his week between Cebu and Manila. “I learned that if you want to get into start-ups, there are no shortcuts. Hard work is the only way to go up,” he said.  “Don’t get carried away with the glitz, glamour and romanticized success stories,” Mayol advises other aspiring tech entrepreneurs. “There are just as many stories of failure as there are of success. It gets discouraging sometimes, but you just have to keep going.”  But since Hoy! re-launched this 2016, 14,000 users have registered to join the rewards network. And almost 400 have claimed rewards for their selfies. Some of Hoy’s participating brand partners include AirAsia, Smart, Globe, MyJoy, Burger king, Dreamworks, Giordano, Pancake House, and Bon Chon, among 42 other partners. The latest launch tapped social media personalities like YouTuber Lloyd Cadena, model Karen Punzalan, and the Cebu-based social media personality Medyo Maldito (Rowell Ucat), to encourage people to sign up and become brand ambassadors for rewards. It wasn’t too long ago, where Seph was sleeping in the streets. Now he and his business partner are planning to seek venture capital funding to help the app go worldwide. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/146763-grab-raises-750m-investors/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab raises $750M from investors","date":"Sep 20, 2016 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raises the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing startup Grab said Tuesday, September 20, it has raised $750 million from investors to expand in burgeoning Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, as it aims to build its lead over US-based rival Uber in the region.

The two companies are already partners in an alliance that also includes India’s Ola and US-based Lyft Inc, allowing users to book rides while traveling to a country covered by any of the 4 apps. Grab chief executive and co-founder Anthony Tan said the latest investment was “the largest in the history of Southeast Asia consumer technology”. “We are particularly excited about the growth opportunity in Indonesia, where we see an almost US$15 billion market for ride-hailing services alone,” he said. The move follows Uber’s decision to sell its business in China to Didi Chuxing last month, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. Grab operates in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Its core product platform includes private cars, motorbikes and taxi-hailing services which are rapidly gaining popularity in the region.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/143070-intramuros-grabkalesa-promotion/","title":"Going around Intramuros?

Once a common mode of transportation back in the Spanish colonial period, they are now popular rides for tourists looking to do some sightseeing around the Walled City. Ride-hailing app Grab puts the spotlight on the kalesa this weekend, offering an on-demand booking service that takes passengers around Intramuros for free. From 2 pm to 5 pm on August 20 and 21, passengers can take a free ride using the app’s special GrabKalesa option. The trip begins and ends at Plaza Roma in Intramuros.   To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabKalesa icon on the Grab app during the booking date and period. The pick-up and drop-off points should both specify Plaza Roma.  The ride will pass through the streets of the historic Walled City, taking visitors around to see popular tourist sites in Intramuros, such as the Manila Cathedral, Palacio del Gobernador, Baluarte de San Andres, Casa Manila, San Agustin Church, and Fort Santiago, among others. Each kalesa can seat up to 3 passengers only, and the trip will last 30 minutes. In its promotional page, Grab said the promotion aims to promote and recognize the kutseros – the drivers of the horse-drawn carriages – and the vast knowledge of history and culture that they impart to their passengers on every trip.

The app allows payment with cash or credit card, which the company says makes it more accessible for drivers and riders.  “Whether you are behind the wheel or on the back of a motorbike, we want to make Uber a service that is truly for everyone. UberMOTOR is a great way to help hundreds of thousands of people get access to cheap, reliable transportation, and get around Jakarta, with a little help from technology,” said Dian Safiti Wibowo, Uber’s Head of Communications in Indonesia. In a statement, uberMOTOR said its new motorbike service is the most affordable ride in town. Rides are calculated using a base fare of 1.000Rp, while every additional kilometer is charged at 1.000Rp and every minute is worth 100Rp.  Other leading motorbike service charge 15,000Rp for up to 5 km. UberMOTOR is also giving away free rides to first time users, using promo code “uberMOTOR” to get a free ride worth Rp 75,000, valid until July.  Uber’s expansion comes less than 3 weeks after a protest by cab drivers against ride-hailing apps – Uber, Grab and the motorbike service Go-Jek – turned violent.  In response to the protest, the government urged ride-hailing apps Uber and Grab to become business entities and partner with a local transport business by May 31 or face a ban.

Businessmen turn to air travel to beat traffic jams","date":"Apr 3, 2016 8:30 AM PHT","snippet":"As ground traffic in Manila continues to worsen, traveling by helicopter has become an option for businessmen who don't mind the price tag to buy extra time for their business trips","body":"MANILA, Philippines – It took me a little over two hours to travel from Pasig City to Pasay City, crawling through heavy traffic around the airport area, including a particularly bad 2-kilometer stretch that had me stuck in a car for more than half an hour. But up in the air, onboard one of Asian Aerospace’s helicopters, we managed to fly across 4 cities in Metro Manila in a little over 10 minutes. With the Philippine capital region continuing to suffer from worsening traffic, making road travel between cities an hours-long trip, the rich and the powerful are turning to air travel as their preferred mode of transport. It’s fast, efficient, and hassle-free, but the price tag certainly doesn’t come cheap: For P50,000 a month, businessmen and multinational CEOs can access Asian Aerospace’s fleet of private jets and helicopters through its recently-launched service AirTaxi.PH. The cost may be too much for the ordinary commuter, but Asian Aerospace’s executive vice president, Peter Angelo Rodriguez, considers it an affordable deal for company executives who don’t want to waste entire business days stuck in Manila’s notorious traffic jams. AirTaxi.PH, launched in January 2016, promises stress-free travel to members of its Emerald Class. To book a ride, members only need to call up Asian Aerospace and specify the time and location where they want to be picked up. Rodriguez said the company currently has helicopters and planes stationed in Manila, Clark, Cebu, and Boracay. The P50,000 monthly fee is consumable, and depends on the type of aircraft requested by clients. For instance, an inter-Metro Manila trip using a 6-seater twin-engine helicopter will cost P42,000. Meanwhile, clients who book one other helicopter used in Boracay trips, which costs P13,500 a ride, can have 3 flights per month. Since launching in January, Rodriguez said there has been an increase in demand and positive feedback from their existing base of clients who are turning to air travel to avoid hours-long traffic jams and get to to their business appointments faster. The service is practical for use in Manila, he said, because of the availability of helipads in business areas such as Ortigas, Makati, and Bonifacio Global City. “Everything inter-Metro Manila is 5 minutes. If you need to go to Greenhills, or Makati, it’s just 5 minutes. It’s like you cut your driving time [by half] already,” he said.  Aside from providing faster travel for their clients, Rodriguez pointed one offshoot of more businessmen going the route of air travel. Since VIPs often travel in packs or with convoys of bodyguards, providing air transport will mean that these VIPs’ vehicles will be off the road, and won’t be adding to ground traffic congestion. “That’s going to remove them [from the road] and already bring them to the location where they need to be,” he said. Aside from its practical use, Rodriguez said the service can also be used for leisure, medical needs, and disaster relief and response. In the popular island destination Boracay, for instance, the company offers a service called Green Heli that offers helicopter rides for tourists. Asian Aerospace also has air ambulances, equipped with medical teams, that can respond to their clients’ emergency. In last year’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the company was tapped as support medical assistance for dignitaries and state leaders visiting for the regional meet. It was also involved in relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), bringing in relief goods and evacuating people from the disaster site.   Future plans Asian Aerospace’s offering of a helicopter service for Manila came about two months since two popular app-based ride-sharing services, Uber and Grab, announced that they would be offering their own helicopter services as an addition to their lineup of car-hailing services.  Grab’s pre-booking chopper service, GrabHeli, offers passengers an aerial tour of Makati City, Bonifacio Global City, and Pasay City for P3,888 per person. Passengers will be given GrabCar promo codes to take them to or from PhilJets’ helipad at the Manila Domestic Airport. The service, however, was a promotional one. The Grab mobile app no longer displays an option to select the GrabHeli service. For Rodriguez, Grab’s rate was “very very cheap” for a helicopter ride. But he also pointed out that it only offered an aerial tour instead of a point-to-point service.  Asked if AirTaxi.PH would introduce a similar scheme for its clients, Rodriguez said that they are eyeing a ride-sharing setup once they have built up their customer base. For now, they are focusing on expanding the areas where their air fleet are stationed around the country. “What we want to do is we want to station helicopters and planes around the country. Right now we’ve got Luzon and Visayas covered, next target is Mindanao,” he said. “As soon as this becomes  a regular thing, and we have enough customers, one of our programs here is that you can split your flight due with other members. For example, there’s 4 of you flying at 9 am. You can just go together, and we’re just going to put you on one flight,” he said. “In the end, you’re not going to pay P42,000, you’re just going to pay P10,500 each. So it’s a nice way of contributing a little bit to what we can do to ease the traffic,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126918-grab-uber-ultimatum-protest/","title":"Indonesia gives Grab, Uber ultimatum after protest from cab drivers","date":"Mar 24, 2016 11:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing apps are ordered to partner with local transport businesses or face a ban from government","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – The government Thursday, March 24 urged ride-hailing apps Uber and Grab to become business entities and partner with a local transport business by May 31 or face a ban after a protest organized by taxi drivers on Tuesday. “It’s in line with a government regulation from 2009 that all public transportation needs to be a legal entity, register and work together with legal taxi businesses,” said ministry spokesman J. A. Barata. In response to the order of government, Grab’s Indonesian unit said it was already working with a local Indonesian partner. “Grab is now trying to ensure that our partner can and will follow every requirement from the government,” said Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director of Grab Indonesia.  There was no immediate comment from Uber. Ride-hailing apps are being blamed by taxi drivers for dwindling their income. Thousands of taxi drivers gathered in Jakarta to express their anger on Tuesday, a protest that escalated quickly and turned violent.  Once incident involved protesters attempting to rip off the jacket of an ojek or motorcycle driver, while another involved taxi drivers taking an ojek driver’s helmet and tossing it. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Free ride A day after the protests, Blue Bird taxi company provided free service for 24 hours in an attempt to restore its image following violent protests involving some of its drivers. “The meter runs but I don’t have to pay,” Stuart Burney from Australia said in Jakarta after taking Blue Bird taxi on Wednesday, March 23. “Taking a free ride offered by the taxi company is pretty good.” Burney was one of the lucky ones since many people found it difficult to hail or order a Blue Bird cab on Wednesday. Netizens also complained about the supposed lack of taxis on Twitter, saying there was no point of it being free. Some Jakartans also expressed fear of taking a Blue Bird. “I am afraid to take Blue Bird taxis even if it offers us a free ride, after seeing drivers attack ojek riders on TV,” Daboe, a commuter in Jakarta, said to Rappler. New apps like Go-Jek have also allowed commuters to hail rides with motorcycles. She also worried that ojek riders might be vengeful towards taxis. Frightened Many drivers of ojek including Go-Jek and Grab, protected themselves from being attacked the day after the protests by taking off their uniform. Instead of their jackets that showed off their companies, they wore their own shirts instead.  “I don’t want to wear my Grab jacket today,” Igun, a rider working for Grab Taxi said. “The taxi drivers attacked my co-workers,” he added.

The protesters adorned their vehicles with signs saying “stop illegal taxis” and rallied in front of parliament and government buildings, in an upsurge of anger at technology they say is threatening their livelihoods. As convoys of vehicles brought downtown Jakarta to a standstill, the demonstration turned violent, with protesters jumping up and down on vehicles that refused to take part, while stone-throwing drivers and rivals from app-based services clashed in several areas of the city.  Commuters faced morning rush-hour travel chaos, with even the motorcades of President Joko Widodo and the vice president getting stuck in the gridlock, making both men late for a meeting. Some people were left bloodied and bruised, with at least one person needing hospital treatment, while police detained 60 drivers from popular motorbike taxi-hailing service Go-Jek. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by US company Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Herman, a 49-year-old taxi driver involved in the Jakarta protest, who goes by one name, said his earnings had dwindled from around 250,000 rupiah ($20) a day several months ago, to almost nothing due to the increased competition. “I haven’t paid my rent, and I need to feed my 3 children and my wife,” he said. The demonstration, which also involved motorized rickshaw and bus drivers, came after weeks of rising tensions between traditional public transport operators in the sprawling, traffic-clogged metropolis of 10 million and a flurry of new ride-hailing services.    As well as Uber, Malaysian app Grab and Go-Jek are providing stiff competition for Jakarta’s taxi drivers.   ‘Unfair competition’ Traditional taxi, motorbike taxi, and other public transport drivers are angry that the new services are offering rides at lower prices, claiming they are not paying taxes, and are operating without official permits. “Why should thousands of people who didn’t pay tax, get a permit, or undergo car checks roam the roads freely while we have had to fulfil those duties?” said Yohannis Rorimpandey, a protester who works for Blue Bird, one of Indonesia’s biggest taxi groups. After rallying outside parliament, where several tires were set alight, a large group of protesters moved to the communications ministry, demanding that the minister block the apps. Uber and other app-based services currently operate in a legal gray area in Indonesia, and there is a division in the government about how to handle them. Indonesian law gives a narrow definition of “public transport,” which does not include the ride-hailing apps, and the transport ministry has sought to ban them.  However the communications ministry has refused to block the services, saying that it is committed to supporting the growth of the digital economy. Jakarta police said that up to 6,000 drivers were involved in Tuesday’s protest, and 6,000 officers were out on the streets for the protest. It was the second anti-app protest by drivers in the space of a week, although the first was on a much smaller scale. However, there was little sympathy for the protesters among commuters caught in the rush-hour travel chaos in the heaving capital. “Must it be anarchy? This only scares passengers and makes them prefer app-based taxis,” said Twitter user Petricia Yuvita. And there was no sign that the government was ready to give in to the protesters’ demands. “You can’t defy technology, it just needs to be regulated,” said Vice President Jusuf Kalla. – Olivia Rondonuwu, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/profiles-and-advocacies/124718-conversation-grabbike-public-transport/","title":"#CommuterWatch: Should the Government bring back GrabBike?","date":"Mar 5, 2016 3:01 PM PHT","snippet":"The LTFRB recently suspended the app-based motorcycle service for safety reasons.

Aside from booking a taxi, car, or even a helicopter, the app’s users can now also book a motorcycle to get around Metro Manila.

Last Feb 4, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) issued a Cease and Desist Order for the service.  The LTFRB decision was founded on concern for passenger safety. But until the LTFRB releases revised regulations for motorcycles, only 4-wheeled vehicles will be allowed to offer public transport. Meanwhile, other 2-wheeled unofficial public transportation systems like habal-habals remain unapprehended. While the Cease and Desist Order is in place, around 800 registered GrabBike riders will be jobless and without income.

LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said the board would start clamping down on these drivers because they are considered to be illegally operating under the public service law. The LTFRB on Wednesday, March 2, summoned MyTaxi.PH – the transportation network company offering GrabTaxi and GrabCar – to explain why its accreditation should not be cancelled after it continued offering the GrabBike service on its app-based platform. The legal counsels of MyTaxi.PH, however, said that they could not answer questions on the operations of GrabBike because it is being operated by a different company. In its show cause order dated February 23, the LTFRB said that Grab once again offered its motorcycle-hailing service even after it announced in early February that it would be temporarily suspending operations. This was in compliance with an LTFRB order issued on January 27, ordering the suspension of GrabBike operations because it was not part of the business model approved and accredited by the board. Illegal operations During the Wednesday hearing, Ginez used his phone to book a GrabBike ride to prove that the service was still ongoing. On the Grab app, the GrabBike service is offered for free. To get a free ride, passengers need to key in a promo code. The driver, identified as Mon Carlo Gaya, was apprehended by LTFRB officials and questioned by Ginez. Gaya said that Grab informed its drivers about the suspension of operations, but was later told it would be resumed with passengers riding for free. GrabBike drivers, meanwhile, would be paid P40 for each trip. Ginez informed Gaya that he was operating illegally. The driver was issued an inspection report summons, requiring him to explain before the board why a fine of P6,000 should not be imposed on him. His motorcycle will also be impounded. While the GrabBike service was being offered to passengers for free, Ginez said that its operations are covered by the public service law. “It’s still covered by the public service law because you are transporting a passenger with compensation…. Compensation under the public service law is treated as any economic benefit to the entity which provides the service,” Ginez said. He said that the company is still benefiting by increasing patronage of the service. Different entities Meanwhile, the lawyers of MyTaxi.PH maintained that it could not explain GrabBike’s operations because it falls under a different company. In a February 3 hearing of the House committee on transportation, Grab said that the motorcycle-hailing service was operated by Grab Bike Incorporated. But it still uses the same app where other Grab services like GrabTaxi and GrabCar can be booked. The LTFRB’s cease and desist letter, as well as its show cause order, was addressed to MyTaxi.PH. “We’re not representing GrabBike Inc…. We were directed to show cause and yet we were obliged to answer for GrabBike, which is not connected to MyTaxi.Ph,” legal counsel Jerome Leynes said. Leynes pointed out that operations of GrabTaxi and GrabCar will stand to suffer if their accreditation is cancelled due to the actions of an entirely different entity. But Ginez dismissed this, saying it was merely “their allegation” that the two companies are not connected. “But it shows otherwise because they use the same system. And what we accredited was the model, the system itself,” he added. The LTFRB decided to amend its show cause order and its cease and desist order to also cover Grab Bike Incorporated. It also expanded the coverage of the orders to include stopping the operations of the recently-introduced free service, Grab Jeep. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/120582-grabtaxi-rebranding-grab-regional-app/","title":"GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion","date":"Jan 28, 2016 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The app company's goals go far beyond taxi-hailing","body":" SINGAPORE, Singapore – With Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing boom, Grab, formerly known as GrabTaxi, has evolved with strategic rebranding and a growing platform of on-demand services. In a regional launch in Singapore on Thursday, January 28, GrabTaxi rebranded itself as Grab to reflect its new range of services. Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012. (READ: GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli) The new Grab encompasses all its services: taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycles (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch), and last mile delivery (GrabExpress), under one umbrella brand.  “We’ve grown over the years – and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers,” Grab Group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said during the regional launch. Dominance in Southeast Asia Since its establishment in 2012, Grab has evolved from a taxi-booking application to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company.  Grab now has over 200,000 drivers and more than 11 million mobile downloads. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) The company’s data show that in mid-2015, it experienced 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region. These figures are encouraging as Grab aims to move far ahead of other ride-hailing companies like Uber. (READ: Uber plans APEC region expansion despite rough ride) “We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,” Tan said. Grab’s CEO said his company will “grow from the current 28 cities across 6 Southeast Asian countries,” but did not specify where.  “What I can say is we are focusing all our energy in providing better transport services in the region,” Tan said. Grab’s regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, “Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.” Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.   On a ‘friendlier’ road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. “We’re not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It’s not all about profit,” Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to “provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,” Goh added. According to Goh, Grab’s end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/53687-visa-application-tips-travel/","title":"Applying for a visa? Keep these 5 tips in mind","date":"Mar 23, 2014 4:10 PM PHT","snippet":"There’s the dream of travel, but there’s also the reality of the paperwork involved","body":" MANILA, Philippines – There’s the dream of travel, but there’s also the reality of the paperwork involved. More budget carriers are flying to Europe, the Middle East and the United States and more direct flights to these destinations are opening up. It’s looking more and more like a buyer’s market for travelers. The one thing that remains laborious and tedious is applying for a visa. Preparing the necessary supporting documents for a visa to one country is already quite laborious. If you’re traveling to more than one country and will require different visas, well, that only multiplies the minor inconveniences you’ll have to go through. Here are some ways to prepare for the visa application process without dampening your travel spirit.  1. Prepare a “grab bag” of documents frequently requested  Get a clearbook to hold all the documents that embassies usually require and make at least five copies of each of these documents. Usually, the embassy will need to look at the original copy for verification purposes and then just keep a photocopy. Make sure that your photocopies are clear. It will save you the trouble of having to photocopy another clearer copy while at the embassy  Documents to include in this clear book are:  Keep all your old passports with other visa stamps as reference. It may not fit in the clear book, but it should be made part of your visa app “grab bag.”  (READ: 5 travel essentials you need to invest in)  2. Keep a list of the countries you’ve visited  Update the list of countries you’ve visited the way you would update your CV. Many embassies require you to list the countries you have visited within a certain number of years. Some embassies will specify a time frame, some will not, so it is best to start from countries you have visited from 5 years back. Keep a soft copy of this list in your computer and update it each time you travel.   3. Make a checklist of the visa application requirements – and triple check that! When applying for a Schengen visa via the Italian embassy, for example, a checklist of requirements (which you can download along with the visa application form) is mandatory in the list of documents to be presented to the visa processing center. It is not a standard requirement for all countries, but a checklist is definitely a good thing to have on hand. Make one of your own if your destination country does not require it.  Double and triple check each requirement, line by line if you have to. It will be worth the trouble because there are varying specifications for each country. Look out for fine print like required payment mode: Is a manager’s check required? Can you pay in Philippine pesos, US dollars or Euros? Tip is to pay in US dollars so you will not be subject to currency fluctuations. Remember to check for exact amount, e.g. if it says $58, bring $58 as some embassies will not offer change. Double check the location of the visa processing centers as their addresses on the application forms may not be updated. I went to the Dubai visa processing agency along Arnaiz Road, as specified in their application form, only to be told that they had just moved to a new office in Pasong Tamo extension.

Have a standard template for letters of introduction to consuls Embassies may require you to prepare a letter to the consul to introduce yourself and state your reason for travel. Make a standard template for this letter of introduction, save on your “Travel Docs” folder and just fill in whenever you need to apply for a visa. This cover letter should have: 5. Make your travel agent your travel buddy Find a travel agent you can trust and make him or her your travel buddy. She can act as a semi-one-stop shop and help you book tickets and hotels that you won’t have to pay for yet (you will want to wait till you get the visa before paying for a ticket or hotel), and facilitate travel insurance, which is now a requirement in Schengen countries. This will (still) not guarantee you getting a visa, but it will at least ease the laborious preparation process of applying for one. – Rappler.com Photo of typewriter from Shutterstock    Ana P.

Can't find a taxi just when you're late – again? Here are basic solutions to everyday minor emergencies","body":" MANILA, Philippines – We all end up encountering minor emergencies everyday. But no matter how small they can be, you know that such things can either make or break your day. Here are some everyday problems that have unusual, yet simple, solutions. But hey, as long as it works, right? Stuck zippers One of the major hassles we may encounter in our daily lives is a malfunctioning zipper. Be it your bag or your jeans, there’s a way to loosen it and get it back working without having to pull hard and damage either the zipper itself or your newly manicured nails. Grab a graphite pencil and rub it on to your old, rusty zipper. Graphite should loosen it up and help you go your merry way.  You can also take a bobby pin, dip in soap, and wiggle it around in the jammed area – that should loosen it up.  Here’s a bonus. For a zippers on your jeans that won’t stay up, get a key ring, get it to go through the zipper’s hole and pull it over your pants button. You just avoided an embarrassing situation which involved exposing what’s behind your fly. Deodorant on your clothes Applying deodorant prior to putting on your shirt may leave you with embarrassing white stains on your shirt. Dabbing water over it won’t help, but there’s an easy way to get it off your clothes. Just rub the fabric against another fabric for a few seconds. Your shirt’s cloth fibers will most likely get it off. Baking failures Baking something for dinner with your boyfriend’s parents? Great idea. It will give them the impression that you’re thoughtful and that you get around – in the kitchen that is. But what happens when you end up enjoying Beyonce’s new music video so much and completely forget about what you had in the oven? And what will you do if you end up burning the pie or cake that you’re making, and you only have 20 minutes before your beau and his folks get to your house? Quick. Remove all the burnt parts of the pie/cake. Take what you can salvage and put them on separate plates. Top the crumbs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and add a cut-up fruits or chocolate bits that you have in your fridge. Give it a fancy name with the word ‘crumble’ in it when his mom asks about your ‘creative’ dessert piece. Gum on your clothes have you ever sat on a bench or a seat on a bus only to find out that you have gum on your skirt? After you get over how gross it is, get your hand sanitizer and spray all over the area where the gum is stuck. Take some hairspray and spray all over the gum (careful not to get too much on the surrounding fabric) and let it dry. The hairspray will harden the gum and will help you pull it off easily. Cat lady problems Love your cat but hate the cat hair on your LBD (little black dress)? When a lint roller is not available, you can always grab a bag or anything that uses velcro to close and press the velcro over the cat hair on your dress. You can also try using scotch tape, pressing it over the dress lightly and carefully pulling it off with cat hair sticking on it. Puffy eyes Getting into a fight with your boyfriend the night before your big office presentation is never a good idea. But on days when you can’t help it and you end up shedding tears then looking like a raccoon in the morning, it’s best to make use of the teabags stocked in your pantry. Use cotton pads to soak up some green tea and put them in a fridge for a good 30 minutes (you can shower while you’re leaving them to cool). Once cold enough, place the cotton pads on your eyes and leave them there for about 10-15 minutes. The cold as well as green tea’s antioxidants will help your eyes relax and ease the puffiness. Use some white eye liner or shadow in the inner corners of your eyes to brighten them right up.  Running late on coding day We know how commuting can be a hassle during rush hour. And when you don’t have your car, chances are it can also be a nightmare to hail a cab. But with the dawn of technology comes the ease and comfort of getting your own cab without having to take your chances along the highway for hours. Nowadays, you can request for a pick up anywhere in Metro Manila just by using apps like Grab Taxi and Easy Taxi which you can download to your smartphone. A luxe alternative? A different kind of ride from Uber. Got basic solutions for everyday minor problems?

It was 9:30 in the morning and, from my bedroom, I could hear the familiar sound of knuckles on our iron front gate. A second later, the voice of our house assistant rang through the house as she called out my name. The cab I requested via GrabTaxi had arrived — more than 30 minutes early.  GrabTaxi, a new smartphone application that seeks to help commuters find cabs and cab drivers find passengers, was launched recently. I decided to take the app out for spin in the streets of Metro Manila.  READ: Need a cab? There’s an app for that! According to CEO and founder Anthony Tan, aside from helping people find a cab, GrabTaxi is also supposed to eliminate the all-too familiar commuter predicament of cab drivers turning down passengers, haggling over the fare and — of course — the constant worrying over the safety of the cab and its driver.  Through the app [available on both Android and iOS], passengers’ taxi bookings are blasted out to drivers within a 3 kilometer radius. Through smartphones used as dispatch tools, the taxis in the area are alerted of your request and can bid for the job. Once matched, both the driver and the passenger are given direct contacts to each other for better communication.  I used GrabTaxi twice in the course of two days: first in the evening, and the second instance in the next morning.  Here’s how it went: The app My first booking was on a Wednesday evening. I was coming from a cocktail party in one of the establishments along Bonifacio High Street in Taguig City. It had been a long night and the party just happened to revolve around different types of alcoholic beverages. Suffice to say I was intoxicated, dazed and a bit drowsy.   I opened the GrabTaxi app and it immediately determined my location with a dot on the map. In the first box, I indicated my exact location. In the second box I put in my home address. Within seconds, the app identified more than 10 cabs within a 3 kilometer radius of where I was. A few seconds later, a notice came up indicating a cab was already on its way to fetch me.  All the driver’s details were displayed on the screen: his name, mobile number, the car’s license plate number and a countdown of how many minutes it would take him to get where I was standing. If I looked closer, I would have actually seen him inch closer and closer to where I was standing on the map. For a first-time user, it was such a treat to stare at a moving taxi icon on the screen. I had a feeling the novelty was not going to wear off anytime soon. Punctuality It was 11:15pm. Based on the GPS tracking, my cab was less than a kilometer away. The app indicated that it would take him 5 minutes to arrive. A few seconds later, it said 4 minutes. It started to count down and then went back to 5 minutes. On the GPS, I could see he had gotten stuck somewhere in the Market! Market! area. 15 minutes later, at 11:30pm, Felipe Capion of Ultimax Transport pulled over in front of the curb where I was standing.  My second GrabTaxi driver the next morning was a little bit too excited. He was Jophel Calipayan of 24/7 Taxi Service. I had expected him to arrive at 10am, but at 9:30am he was already parked in front of our house, ready to go. Our destination was Taguig [again].  On the road We were headed to the South on a weekday morning. Taking EDSA was not an option. I asked Jophel to take C5 road instead. He agreed with my plan after asking for directions on how to get out of our village. At this point, the meter was still at P0. It was only after I sat down and closed the door that the driver started the meter with a P40 flat rate.  The cab was clean, had no suspicious stains on the upholstery and smelled of pine air freshener bought from the gas station. On both cabs, attached to the windshield was a mobile phone mount; in it sat a Cloud smartphone which was running the GrabTaxi app.  On the window of the right passenger seat was a printed, laminated brochure from GrabTaxi explaining how to download and use the application.  (Download Grab Taxi app for Android and iOS)  In the course of our journey along C5 that morning, my driver was in the perfect mood. He had an album of the Bee Gees playing in the background. As Robin Gibb sang, asking the perennial question of how to mend a broken heart, my driver used his turn signals properly, giving way to pedestrians and following traffic lights. My only gripe was that he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. We spent the next 30 minutes talking about the app and how it has made finding passengers easier for him.  Felipe, on the other hand [from the night before], was not a chatty cabbie. However, being as it was close to midnight, I understood. I asked him why it took him 15 minutes to get to me. He said there was a slight vehicular accident around the mall area that stalled him a bit. After clicking in his seatbelt and punching a button on the meter to get it started, we were off into the night.  During the trip, passengers have the option of posting a message on Facebook or Twitter through the app. The message contains the car’s license number together with a link to the GrabTaxi website which allows your friends to follow your journey in real time. It’s an ingenious feature for those who make it a habit of texting people their cab license plate to a loved one. The GPS tracking makes it even better. However, I was in no mood to declare to the rest of the world where I was, and found no reason to suspect my driver was taking me somewhere else.  I arrived home some 20 minutes later. I paid the meter charge along with the additional P70 fee, and gave him a little extra considering the time.  Feedback Both my experiences were very successful. In the course of my morning ride with Jophen, though, he told me of an instance of double-booking: he arrived at the passenger’s home only to find out that another taxi, also affiliated with GrabTaxi, arrived earlier than him and picked the passenger up leaving him wondering what happened.  For most concerns, GrabTaxi has several lines of communication to receive passengers’ feedback. At the end of your journey, there’s an option in the app for you to send your feedback. Or at your own time, you can send them a tweet [@GrabTaxiPH], a message on Facebook [Facebook.com/GrabTaxiPH], or an e-mail [passenger.mnl@grabtaxi.com]. GrabTaxi is an app long overdue. In a place as chaotic, crowded and unpredictable like Metro Manila, it’s a concrete step towards creating a more organized, systematic and efficient way of riding public transportation — even if it is an air-conditioned cab. One can only hope that more fleets in the city [and, perhaps, the rest of the country] will recognize the benefits of using the application, for both passengers and drivers. Now if I could only pay for my fare with a credit card. – Rappler.com     Peter Imbong is a fulltime freelance writer, sometimes a stylist; and on some strange nights, a host.

The first million people using Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4 or Galaxy Note 2 who download the app will be given the complete album 72 hours before release. Here’s a behind the scenes look at ‘Magna Carta Holy Grail’:  One caveat to note, however, is that the promotion is available only for territories where the promo isn’t prohibited. There’s no listing for territories where the promotion is prohibited, sadly, so some places will likely have to take their chances when the app comes out. The Wall Street Journal adds that Samsung reportedly paid US$5 million for the copies they’ll be giving out in advance.
