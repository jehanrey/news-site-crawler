Sydney and its vicinities have been under a weeks-long strict lockdown that is to last at least until the end of August while battling an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant. Saturday’s numbers bring the outbreak to 3,190 cases. About 1,000 police officers have been deployed around Sydney to prevent an unauthorised demonstration against the lockdown and the police have been issuing prohibition notices to taxi and rideshare services banning them from taking passengers to demonstrations, the NSW police said. Protests last weekend resulted in a series of arrests and clashes with police. A late-July poll by the NSW-based market research firm Utting Research showed, however, that only 7% of the people support the demonstrations. Compliance with public health rules has been one of the key cited reasons behind Australia’s success in managing the pandemic. In Sydney, there are 198 people in the hospital, 53 of them in intensive care and 27 requiring ventilation, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. There was also one death reported, bringing the total number of deaths in the outbreak to 14. Parts of the neighbouring state Queensland will enter into a three-day snap lockdown on Saturday after the state recorded six new coronavirus cases of the Delta strain, putting a number of football, rugby and other sporting events into a limbo. “We have seen from the experience in other states that the only way to beat the Delta strain is to move quickly, to be fast and to be strong,” the state’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles said. “That is now the nationally agreed approach.” Despite its struggle with spikes of infections, mostly of the Delta variant, Australia has managed to keep its epidemic largely under control with a total of just over 34,000 cases and 924 deaths. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/ridesharing-reduces-mass-transit-use-united-states-study/","title":"Ridesharing reduces mass transit use by 8.9% in US – study","date":"Mar 31, 2021 5:37 PM PHT","snippet":"The MIT study shows transport network companies increase congestion intensity by almost 1% and the duration of congestion by 4.5%","body":"Ridesharing, in its relatively short history, has been built up as a commuter alternative that’s more environmentally friendly than taking the cab or owning a car.  But a study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Future Urban Mobility Interdisciplinary Research Group at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, and China’s Tongji University found that it may not exactly be the case.  The study is titled “Impacts of transportation network companies on urban mobility,” recently published in the journal Nature Sustainability.    In the US, they found the entrance of ridesharing services by transport network companies (TNCs) in the market reduced mass transport ridership by 8.9%, and only reduced private vehicle ownership by 1%.   The services also increased road congestion intensity by almost 1% and increased the duration of congestion by 4.5%, citing “deadheading” miles or miles travelled without a passenger as a possible cause for TNC services’ added effect on congestion. Studies estimate about 40.8% of TNC miles are deadheading miles in the US.  The study also found that the ease with which commuters can access ridesharing services discouraged them from merely walking or taking public transportation, which are greener alternatives.  These findings are showing that ridesharing services, according to the study, have a negative net effect on the environment, contrary to predominant belief.  The study takes into account Uber and Lyft, two of the biggest TNCs in the US.  “We are still in the early stages of TNCs and we are likely to see many changes in how these ridesharing businesses operate,” says Hui Kong, postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Urban Mobility Lab, and an author of the paper.  “Our research shows that over time TNCs have intensified urban transport challenges and road congestion in the United States, mainly through the extended duration and slightly through the increased intensity. With this information, policies can then be introduced that could lead to positive changes.”  The authors are not dismissing the potential of TNCs completely however, saying that their possible benefits could indeed be tremendous but translating this promise into actual environmental and congestion-easing gains could also be very complicated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/millennials-are-not-the-only-burnout-generation-just-ask-the-rest-of-us/","title":"Millennials are not the only ‘burnout generation’ (just ask the rest of us)","date":"Feb 7, 2021 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'Framing this issue as one belonging to, or uniquely impacting millennials is a trap'","body":"In her new book, Can’t Even, American journalist Anne Helen Petersen writes of how millennials have become “the burnout generation.”  “[It’s] feeling that you’ve hit the wall exhaustion-wise, but then have to scale the wall and just keep going. There’s no catharsis, no lasting rest, just this background hum of exhaustion.“ The book, recently released in Australia, builds on the viral essay Petersen wrote in 2019. At its heart, the book is a critique about the nature of modern workplaces and the modern economy. As Petersen recently told Vox, There’s a feeling of instability that’s the baseline economic condition for many, many millennials, and it’s enhanced by these other components of our lives that make it harder to turn away from. Petersen argues millennials, born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, have come of age in a world where more and more of their time is being demanded by not just work, but by life. Technology means work follows us everywhere, at all hours, while leisure time happens (or is “performed”) on social media. Meanwhile, homes are turned into Airbnb rentals, cars become rideshare services. Peterson tells real and important stories about the frustration, anxiety, and malaise of herself and her contemporaries. However, she does us all a disservice by framing this as particularly “millennial problem.”  While Petersen does acknowledge burnout impacts everyone, she assumes millennials are a concrete group of people whose experience of burnout is exceptional. The idea of clear generational groups, each possessing defining characteristics seems intuitive. It makes sense a group of contemporaries who had similar experiences in their formative years, would come to have similar attitudes, values, and beliefs. But many scholars are uncertain that the generational groups as we know them — such as millennials, Gen X or baby boomers — are as real or useful as we might think. Empirical research to prove generational groupings has produced “highly mixed and contradictory results.” So, many academics aren’t convinced birth-year groups even exist — there are too many variables. For example, if a 20-year-old today doesn’t follow office etiquette, is this a product of them being Generation Z? Or because this person is new to the workforce? More broadly, the majority of research about generations have been undertaken across Europe, North America, and Australia/Oceania. Given these three regions combined make up less than 18% of the world’s population, it becomes clear how little we know. So, while the frustrations of Petersen and her contemporaries are real — it is important to emphasize they are something everyone is facing. Burnout has historically been studied in relation to workplace stress, particularly where employees are in a caring role. It is defined by World Health Organisation as: (a) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; (b) increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and (c) reduced professional efficacy. But medical experts are starting to see burnout as a society-wide issue, particularly as people find themselves overwhelmed and fatigued by COVID-19. Similarly, mental health groups have identified burnout as a product of long-term, or chronic, stress. That is to say, scientists and support services are coming to understand burnout is not necessarily a product of the workplace specifically — but everything going on in someone’s life — from how much technology they use, to how many commitments they have. In 2020, who of us can say they aren’t feeling burned out? After a summer of bushfires, we had (and still have) a pandemic. For many, the boundaries between work and life have collapsed as we have needed to work, care, and relax at home — sometimes in the same room. COVID has been accompanied by a seemingly permanent state of angst, as we all found ourselves doomscrolling for the latest updates. Many people have also lost income and job security. And more than 2 million people around the world have lost their lives. But it is not “just 2020.” The past several decades have seen huge changes to the way that we live, and engage with those around us. For example, social media has had a profound effect — and not always for the better, in terms of our mental health. In the workplace, an “overtime culture” has blossomed. As of 2019, about 13% of Australia’s workforce was working more than 50 hours a week. The rise in casual employment may have allowed for more flexibility, but it has increased insecurity — with no paid leave, and unstable work schedules. Here it is important to note, in 2020, those aged 15-24 made up less than 40% of all casual jobs. While the casual workforce is skewed towards younger workers – the casualization of the workforce impacts all of us. On top of all of this, we have seen rising levels of student and household debt, skyrocketing house prices, and the increasing effects of climate change. We all have plenty of reasons to feel bombarded by life. So, what do we do? It goes without saying, widespread burnout due to social, economic, and political forces in the middle of a pandemic is a complex problem to solve. At an individual level, resources do exist to help us address our mental health and support those around us. However, systemic change is far more complex. Academics and world leaders have suggested reducing the work week might be an important step. Though, as noted by Peterson, it’s no longer just work demanding our time, energy, and attention. As Peterson points out, one area that may need reimagining is how much and how often we consume information. Scholars in the 1960s were already raising concerns about the impact so much information could have on people, and in turn, society. We as humans are social and curious creatures, but how much news, connection and information is good for us? As Slate journalist Shannon Palus observes, Petersen deserves credit for identifying big problems about a culture that constantly asks for more access to every aspect of our lives. However, framing this issue as one belonging to, or uniquely impacting millennials is a trap. It encourages us to compare different generations to see who is the least or most burned out. Really, our attention should be devoted to working together to reduce burnout for everyone. – The Conversation/Rappler.com Steven is a Lecturer in Work-Integrated Learning at the University of Sydney Business School.

But if it’s a must, the least you can do is stick to health protocols and prepare everything you need to at least minimize risks when traveling internationally.  Before you travel, take note of the following:  Prepare a round-trip ticket and take a COVID-19 test This one is a must. According to the IATF, travelers must present confirmed round-trip tickets and proof that they are COVID-19-free with a negative antigen test taken within 24 hours of departure.  It takes at least 15 minutes to see the result on an antigen test, so you make sure to allot time for this.   Keep in mind that there might be additional testing and quarantining when you get to your destination, depending on the country. Make sure to check what will be applicable for any transit or layover flights. Be aware of the COVID-19 situation in your destination Consider the country’s context – its state of public health, and healthcare system capacities. Do note of medical practices, health institutions available, and transportation services at your disposal. Situations across other countries and their responses may differ, so you might want to prepare accordingly. Of course, it goes without saying that you have to check if a lockdown or a stay-at-home order is in place and for how long it’ll be implemented.  Look into the World Health Organization (WHO)’s COVID-19 case tracker to see the number of cases globally and regionally.    Research arrival quarantine rules If traveling overseas, check with the embassy or consulate of your destination if Filipinos are allowed to enter the country for non-essential purposes. When planning your destination, check for any required quarantine regulations. Several places still impose a mandatory quarantine period at an authorized facility for non-resident arrivals. This will be an additional cost on your end.  Prepare an itinerary In some cases, preparation means prevention. Although it’s tempting to live-in-the-moment, you may want to rethink carpe diem. Preparing a daily itinerary before your travel can save you time and uncertainty especially in an unfamiliar place. Not to mention, it may give you extra information on transportation and health protocols in the area.  You may also plan how you will get to and from one place to another, as public transportation and ridesharing can increase chances of contracting the virus.  Contemplate and prepare your travel needs Little things can make a difference. Many travel-friendly essentials are available for purchase. Make sure to pack reusable and disposable face masks, toiletries, alcohol, or sanitizer, shampoo, and soap, in order to avoid unnecessary trips to convenience stores. You might also want to consider bringing your own towels for better hygiene.  Preparing for cashless transactions is also advisable. Apart from having cash on-hand, you may want to contact your bank to safeguard a cashless means of transacting.  When going outside, prepare your own bottled water in case you may need it.  Don’t forget your passport and luggage It’s already a must, but it could be crucial! Don’t forget to bring your DFA-issued passport (at least 6 months validity). Also bring with you other necessary travel documents, including any required health declaration forms or quarantine facilities, along with your luggage. In some countries, wearing a mask is common practice and even mandatory. Wearing a mask may protect you and others from COVID-19. Health institutions advise wearing a mask at all times.  Be mindful about public transportation and facilities as many places will not allow passengers and customers without masks on. COVID-19 can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and surfaces like doorknobs, and elevator buttons. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests practicing hand hygiene frequently especially before and after contact with the nose and mouth.  Besides having hand sanitizer or alcohol at all times, make sure you wash your hands regularly. Crowded spaces are considered high-risk environments. The CDC recommends that travelers avoid close physical contact and stay at least 6 feet apart. Whether lining up or walking outside, make sure to reasonably keep your distance from those around you.  – Rappler.com Winona and Zoe are Rappler interns.

Uber drivers split ahead of California vote","date":"Oct 18, 2020 6:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Proposition 22 will determine whether California can enforce a law requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors","body":"Ahead of a referendum that could upend the whole gig economy, Uber driver Karim Benkanoun says his relationship with the rideshare giant must stop being a one-way street. “If you’re a driver with Uber or Lyft, you’re nothing,” said Benkanoun as he speaks of how he will vote in California’s Proposition 22 referendum. “They don’t consider us as employees, they consider us as independent contractors but we have no say in the contract. “It doesn’t work this way and it has to change.” Proposition 22, which is being put to voters on the same day as the November 3 presidential election, will determine whether California’s government can enforce a law which became effective this year requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors. Were the referendum to be approved, drivers would remain independent contractors but Uber and Lyft would pay them a number of benefits promised as part of a compromise package, including a minimum wage, a contribution to health care and other forms of insurance. If it doesn’t pass, the drivers would be classified as employees and thus entitled to all the benefits laid out in California labor law.  Supporters in the “Yes” camp are warning of mass job losses if they lose as the companies could not afford to keep on all their drivers and say others will quit because they will automatically have less flexibility. While supporters argue the bill would mean increasingly hard-pressed drivers are guaranteed to earn between $25 and $28 per hour, critics cite a University of California study showing that compensation equates to only $5.64 per hour after subtracting unreimbursed costs, taxes and waiting time. The measure has divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others such as Sergei Fyodorov enjoy the flexibility of being able to work on weekends or whenever he chooses to pick up extra income. “If you make a living out of it, great, but for me it’s supplemental income and flexibility,” said Fyodorov, who has a regular job as a project manager at a tech company. “Let’s say Proposition 22 does not happen. I can guarantee that Lyft, Uber and all these services will lay off at least 80 or 70 percent of the drivers and the main thing is that we’re not going to get the flexibility.” Geoff Vetter, a spokesman for the “Yes” campaign, said hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost across a global industry headquartered in California, arguing many drivers would quit if they have to work set hours. “With Proposition 22, we’re trying to recognize first that these drivers want to remain independent contractors – more than 70 percent of drivers say they want to remain independent contractors because it gives them flexibility and choice – while also getting new benefits like a minimum guarantee (for wages) and health care,” said Vetter. Benkanoun, who began working with Uber in 2012, says he used to make between $1,500 and $2,000 a week but is now lucky to make $500 before expenses despite working a seven-day week with demand shrunk by the Covid-19 pandemic. As his income has dwindled, so has his faith in the rideshare companies. “I don’t trust anything Uber or Lyft says,” he said. Another driver, Erica Mighetto of Sacramento, said she was making $40 an hour when she started driving 4 years ago but only $20 earlier this year and now that’s closer to $10 an hour in pandemic conditions. “Uber and Lyft are just trying to exempt themselves from the benefits that drivers need,” said Mighetto, who drove from her home in Sacramento to take part in a recent demonstration calling for a “No” vote. She slept in her car. “We need a guaranteed minimum wage and overtime and in this time we desperately need employment for drivers who are unable to work and support their families.” Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86 percent worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model; Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. “While these services feel ubiquitous to our lives, they’re very new,” Vetter told Agence France-Presse. “I think there’s recognition we need to apply a 21st century solution to 21st century challenges.” But drivers like Mighetto are not convinced. “They’re really trying to scare drivers and scare voters into doing what they want,” she said. “I think that billionaire companies are able to offer flexibility as well as minimum protection.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/investors-load-funds-uber-freight-october-2-2020/","title":"Investors load $500 million into Uber’s trucking business","date":"Oct 3, 2020 7:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber says it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation","body":"Uber on Friday, October 2, said an investment group led by Greenbriar Equity is pumping $500 million into its trucking unit. The preferred stock financing values Uber Freight at $3.3 billion, and comes as the San Francisco-based company’s core ride-sharing service is stalled due to the pandemic. Uber Freight matches truckers to shippers in much the way the ride service connects passengers with drivers in the so-called on-demand economy. While Uber’s ride service has suffered due to people hunkering down or being reluctant to get into cars with strangers due to COVID-19 risk, the freight unit, which launched in 2017, has grown. “We have led the industry with technology, transforming dated and analog processes to ensure that both shippers and carriers are equipped to succeed in a rapidly changing industry,” said Uber Freight chief Lior Ron. Uber said it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation. “We are excited to support Uber Freight in the next stage of its development,” said Greenbriar managing partner Michael Weiss. “We believe that carriers and shippers will be increasingly attracted to the convenience and simplicity that Uber Freight offers in a complex marketplace.” Greenbriar has been involved in the logistics sector for decades and brings expertise that Uber Freight can tap into, Weiss added. Uber reported a $1.8-billion loss in the 2nd quarter of this year as the COVID-19 pandemic caused its shared-ride business revenue to plunge. Meanwhile, California has filed lawsuits against Uber and Lyft for alleged wage theft by misclassifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, in violation of a recently enacted state law. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash are backing a state ballot initiative in November’s election which would classify rideshare drivers and other gig-economy workers as independent contractors, while offering certain benefits such as minimum wage, sick leave, and workers’ compensation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-stock-markets-august-20-2020/","title":"US stocks shrug off weak labor data as European equities retreat","date":"Aug 21, 2020 9:20 AM PHT","snippet":"The tech-rich Nasdaq rockets to yet another record on Thursday, August 20, and is joined in positive territory by the Dow and S&P 500, which win more modest gains","body":"Wall Street stocks shrugged off weak United States labor data on Thursday, August 20, while European equities were pressured by worries over spiking coronavirus cases in several countries. The Labor Department reported a worse-than-expected 1.1 million new claims for unemployment benefits, a jump from the prior week that underscored the continued weakness of the US economy. But Wall Street pushed higher anyway, led by large technology companies that have benefited during the coronavirus, which has kept consumers at home and boosted e-commerce and streaming services. Led by Apple, Facebook, and other giants, the tech-rich Nasdaq rocketed to yet another record and was joined in positive territory by the Dow and S&P 500, which won more modest gains. Earlier, bourses in Paris, London, and Frankfurt all fell more than 1%. A note from Charles Schwab said recent upticks in new COVID-19 cases in European countries are “continuing to drag on sentiment.” While Italy registered 845 new cases on Thursday, its highest daily tally since May, France reported 4,700 fresh infections — a massive increase on the previous day. While Spain’s daily increases topped even those of France, Germany was examining its own resurgence. Despite the rise in cases, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official said additional lockdowns should not be necessary. “With the basic nationwide and additional targeted measures, we are in a much better position to stamp out these localized virus flare-ups,” the head of the WHO’s European branch, Hans Kluge, told reporters. “We can manage the virus and keep the economy running and an education system in operation,” he added.  Among individual companies, ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft surged 6.8% and 5.8%, respectively, after a California appeals court gave them a reprieve from being required to reclassify drivers as employees in their home state of California. Shortly before the appeals court decision, Lyft said it would suspend its rideshare service in the state rather than treat drivers as employees entitled to benefits. American Airlines dropped 1.4% as it announced it will eliminate service to 15 smaller US markets as cash-strapped carriers downsize their operations to cope with the ongoing coronavirus crisis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/265815-uber-deal-buy-postmates/","title":"Uber agrees on deal to buy food delivery app Postmates – Bloomberg","date":"Jul 6, 2020 4:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Bloomberg reports the expected $2.65 billion deal between Uber and start-up Postmates will be announced on Monday morning in the US, citing people familiar with the matter","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber has agreed to buy food delivery app Postmates in a multibillion dollar deal, according to Bloomberg.

Starting as a ride-hailing service in 2010, GoJek launched an app 5 years later with a wide range of offerings, including deliveries, takeaway food and financial services, that could be ordered via smartphone. The company attracted investments from tech giants including Google, Facebook and Tencent. But on Tuesday, June 23, it said it would cut 430 posts – or about 9% of its full-time staff – as it cancels massage, house cleaning and GoFood Festivals, which supplies vending space for food sellers. “These businesses are dependent on close human interaction, and have seen a significant downturn over the past few months as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected consumer habits,” the firm said in a statement. “These will be the only COVID-19-related layoffs,” it added.

It’s crazy,” said Andrea Jones, the daughter of the ice cream parlor’s owner.  “Every day, the line gets longer,” the 21-year-old said. “They come out rain or shine, they bring their umbrella. They support us no matter what. It’s beautiful to see.” The shop, which sits on the banks of the Potomac River, had to close because of the virus, causing huge financial strain until Jones called for support on Twitter the day before a huge anti-racism protest in the US capital. Her tweet was shared almost 30,000 times.  In recent weeks, as the nation has focused on race issues in the wake of the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody, there has been an explosion of solidarity and support from activists, as well as social media and commercial campaigns, to boost African-American restaurant owners.  Uber Eats, the food delivery service run by the rideshare giant, launched a filter to promote black-owned restaurants on June 4 in several cities in the United States and Canada, and eliminated delivery fees for those eateries. ‘Almost devastating’ Numerous studies have shown that black business owners, and in particular those in the food industry, have been among the worst hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic chaos. “Oh man, it was almost devastating,” said Oji Abbott, the owner of Oohh’s and Aahh’s soul food restaurant who is also known as Chef O.  “We lost probably every revenue stream of money that you could lose,” the 45-year-old said.  Close to Howard University, one of the most prestigious historically black colleges in the country, the eatery saw the flow of tourists and students dry up overnight.    Just down the street, Ben’s Chili Bowl, which famously counted Martin Luther King Jr as one of its customers in the days of civil rights marches in Washington, saw its business drop by 80% during the lockdown. “Black-owned businesses tend to be much smaller, they have thinner profit margins,” said Sifan Liu, a research analyst with the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.  “And they also have greater credit constraints and therefore, they are very vulnerable in any recession, and particularly this one,” she said. Between February and April 2020, 41% of small businesses with African-American owners closed due to the coronavirus, according to a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research published in June.  During the same period, only 17% of small businesses with white owners went under. Hard to get capital As with many black-owned businesses, the proprietors of Ben’s Chili Bowl and Oohh’s and Aahh’s were excluded from the first wave of the Trump administration’s loans to help keep small businesses afloat – a vital lifeline for many. “In the first round of the PPP (Paycheck Protection Program), the application process relied on mainstream financial institutions to deliver loans, which favored existing customers at large banks,” said Liu. “And because black business owners are likely to be unbanked or underbanked, they just don’t have those existing relationships and they are less likely to get those loans,” she said.  Abbott opened his eatery in 2003 with $30,000 of his own savings.

In 2018, big banks approved 29% of credit applications from African-American entrepreneurs, while approving funds for 60% of white business owner applicants, Brookings said in a mid-April study on COVID-19 and small businesses. “There needs to be a more targeted effort to attack racial disparities,” said Liu.

Wastage has been an issue as goods go undelivered because of the lockdown, leading to higher prices. The hope is that the new monitoring tools will allow the supply chain to function more efficiently.  “Kadiwa on Wheels” will also be able to monitor where the goods may be most needed, and upon identification of these areas, the mobile market of sorts will be able to reach consumers directly.  “Because of COVID-19, food affordability, not only availability, becomes critical.  The threat of food affordability is as real as hunger itself. If the supply chain is disrupted, food produced in rural areas just go to waste,” said Dar.  Another program called “e-Kadiwa” will let consumers buy goods using smartphones and other devices. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/256697-analysis-how-everyday-technology-saving-us/","title":"[ANALYSIS] How everyday technology is saving us","date":"Apr 3, 2020 12:15 PM PHT","snippet":"This also adds opportunity for businesses and entrepreneurs, including in Southeast Asia and around the world","body":" We should not lose sight of the myriad, positive – and often overlooked or forgotten – ways in which our day-to-day lives have already assimilated high-tech innovations in ways big and small. From crowdfunding to cryptocurrencies and ridesharing to online marketplaces for hotels and homestays, technology is challenging if not yet transforming large parts of established economies and industries. We should not fear this. That power of technology to disrupt certainly has been one of the focus areas of ongoing discussions around the world from Los Angeles to London, and Singapore to Abu Dhabi – even in the age of coronavirus. This past February, the Milken Institute – a non-profit, non-partisan economic think tank with which I am affiliated – brought together in the U.A.E. a curated group of interdisciplinary thought leaders and decision-makers to discuss, develop and deploy solutions to some of the world’s pressing challenges. The two-day Milken Institute Middle East and Africa Summit, Feb. 11-12, in Abu Dhabi, made clear the benefits of technology in areas ranging from access to capital to medical innovations.  Yet, resistance to technological change has long been with us.    From the crash of a Boeing 737 MAX airplane in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019, blamed in part on the plane’s high-tech design and software shortcomings, to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic driven in part by increased air connectivity in our globalized world, setbacks and unintended consequences stemming from technological advancements are fueling new levels of skepticism. There is persistent fear about what a technology-enabled future might bring, from job losses and the deaths of industries to drone attacks and cyber-crimes. Modern media, including Hollywood and social media platforms, have amplified such stories and fears, intentionally or not. Yet, menacing or malfunctioning machines and software only tell one side of the story. Whether it is in the clothes we wear, the way we light our homes, or the way we keep our houses clean, technology has begun to revolutionize basic everyday products and services as tech assumes an ever-more pervasive role in our daily lives. This everyday technology revolution has also added opportunity for businesses and entrepreneurs, including in Southeast Asia and around the world.  In the past, consumers might well have expected the most basic of household products to be relatively inexpensive, partly because their functionality, and so their value, was so limited.  But with advancements – indeed, with technology now embedded in consumer goods’ very make-up – groundbreaking new commercial avenues and opportunities have opened up. The clothes we wear Take something as basic as clothing. A few years ago, a classic cotton T-shirt cost a few dollars, or less, and was worn by many for all occasions: as an undershirt at work, as casual weekend-wear, or while at the gym or working at a labour-intensive job.  But now, technological innovations even in a basic T-shirt are seemingly boundless. Manufacturers today use new technology to reduce odour-causing microbes. Sun-protective clothing is produced from specially-designed or treated fabric and rated for its level of protection from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.  There are fabric blends that wick away sweat and are fast-drying. Other shirts offer stretch-mesh panels that lead to easier ventilation. There are compression fits for athletes.  And that does not take account of all the hugely popular trademarked fabrics that have upended the lucrative sporting-apparel-meets-casualwear industry. Under Armour’s HeatGear, Nike’s DRI-Fit, Reebok’s ACTIVchill to name just a few. Indeed, the world has come a very long way from the days when Americans would spray Scotchguard, from 3M, onto their clothes to waterproof them. The lights we use Or consider the way we light our homes.  Old-fashioned, incandescent electric lightbulbs are notoriously energy inefficient, so much so that many countries have banned them outright.  Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs have swept through the market in recent years, consuming up to 90 percent less power than the old incandescent bulbs and drastically lowering energy costs. They also last much (much) longer. Lights, like T-shirts, now do high-tech backflips as well.  They dim or intensify with the touch of a button, often remotely controlled by a smartphone or via scheduled timers. Some new bulbs employ technology known as “geofencing,” which links the bulb to the GPS in a smartphone and triggers it to turn on when the user is nearby.  And individual bulbs can now shine in many a colour of the rainbow, giving unique accents to a home. The way we clean Then there is the way we clean our clothes and our homes. Technology is pointing new ways forward away from the use of traditional – and often harsh – chemical cleaners. I have seen this first-hand through my work serving on the advisory board of Equator Pure Nature, a Thailand-based “clean-tech” company that produces, markets, and sells a line of natural, environment-friendly, biodegradable household cleaning products under the brand name Pipper Standard. Their products are made by fermenting pineapple – somewhat akin to the process by which bacteria help create yogurt – and the result is a natural cleaning fluid full of bio-surfactants, and powerful enzymes. And critically: the solution cleans comparably to chemical cleaners. The company’s founder and CEO Peter Wainman, who started the company after suffering from a debilitating allergic reaction to a chemical fabric softener, told the MIT Technology Review in February last year: “If we decrease unnecessary chemical exposure, particularly in the home, we may have a positive impact on allergy rates. A healthy environment starts at home.” Indeed, traditional chemical-based cleaners, from laundry detergents to liquid hand soaps, among others, have come under renewed scrutiny amidst a global consumer movement toward environmentally-friendly, non-toxic and non-allergenic, natural products. Just as technology has raised new worries, we need only look to the past to see those same old fears but also how evolving technology has provided solutions and better lives.  Achieving sustainable trade growth, robust capital markets, financial inclusion, food and job security, and gender parity will remain the challenges of today even when we get past the present pandemic. And far from something to fear, technology is already saving us.  It is not just respirators, and innovative medical treatments. We need only look at some of the simplest things – the clothes we wear, the lights we use and how we clean our homes – to see how in our tech-enabled, everyday lives there already exists the power of disruption by technology for good. – Rappler.com    Based in Bangkok, Curtis S.

Since then, the charges against Golunov have been dropped, and in January five Moscow police officers were charged with fabrication of evidence and drug trafficking. According to Russian news website Baza.io, one of these officers, Igor Lyakhovets, said that he had obtained the reporter’s address by requesting his travel history from Yandex.Taxi, Russia’s most popular rideshare app. Yandex.Taxi has publicly confirmed that it received and complied with this request. It was a minor detail in Lyakhovets’ account of the Golunov investigation, but one that has shed light on the ability of Russian security services to carry out detailed surveillance of anyone who uses everyday online services, such as taxi apps. It also raised questions about the security of user data in the many countries outside Russia in which Yandex.Taxi operates. Concerns have risen over whether Yandex.Taxi went far beyond its obligations in giving the Moscow police Golunov’s user data. On March 2, the Russian digital rights group Roskomsvoboda published a report noting that Yandex.Taxi is not listed on the public registry of “information dissemination organizers.” Such organizations are required to grant Russian authorities access to all user data under the controversial “Yarovaya law,” a package of new measures and amendments to existing statutes focused on public safety and counterterrorism enacted in July 2016. But Yandex.Taxi argues that it was compelled to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies, citing a different law – known as the “operative-search activities” law, which regulates police investigations – which applies to any organization, regardless of whether it is on the registry or not. But according to Kirill Koroteev of the legal advocacy organization Agora, this law stipulates that requests for private data are not binding in the absence of a court order. No such court order appears to have been given, but Yandex.Taxi spokeswoman Natalia Zhuravlova told Coda via email that while “certain types of enquiries – for example, requests to reveal text of private correspondence between people – do require a corresponding court decision,” requests for ride histories do not. Golunov raised a further question concerning the legitimacy of the request Yandex.Taxi received from law enforcement. According to Golunov, it was not made via the correct channels, but rather was sent in an email, from an address at the domain Mail.ru – a popular Russian email server. Golunov told Coda Story that he saw evidence of this during the court proceedings. This detail has not yet been made public, as the trial is ongoing. Yandex.Taxi, however, denies that the request was made via email. In a Facebook post, the company’s spokesman Vladimir Isaev said that he personally saw the signed paper that was submitted to the company’s lawyers. In a text message, Golunov explained why the question of whether the request was made via email is significant.  “I don’t like the situation with Yandex.Taxi – that information about my movement is available to any person who can write a letter to Yandex.Taxi and sign as a police officer,” he wrote. “I think that this kind of information should only be shared by the company if there’s a court order.” Whether or not Yandex.Taxi gave up more information than they legally had to, this case shows the extent to which the Russian authorities expect unfettered access to private companies’ information, and do not see the need to give any reason for their requests. “I think it is also highly important to mention that usually, enquiries by the authorities don’t contain any details of cases or names of people in question,” wrote Zhuravlova. “They also don’t mention whether the person in question is under suspicion or whether they are a victim of a crime. As an example, they might contain just a phone number or an internet ID.” International repercussions According to its website, Yandex.Taxi operates in 17 countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and West Africa. In Georgia, where it is one of the two most popular rideshare apps, the news of the company’s involvement in Golunov’s case was met with alarm. Speaking to Georgian television reporters, parliamentarian Irakli Abesadze called for an investigation of Yandex.Taxi by state security services, in order to determine whether the app also shares Georgian users’ data with Russian authorities. Privacy concerns related to Russian access to Yandex.Taxi’s international user data long predate this week’s reports, and are not confined to Georgia. In 2018, the Lithuanian defense ministry’s National Cyber Security Centre published an investigation that found that the Yandex.Taxi app in Lithuania regularly sent encrypted communications to Russian IP addresses. Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis publicly urged Lithuanians not to download the app, owing to concerns that it stored excessive user data with inadequate security. Asked whether Yandex.Taxi would have handed over user data to the Russian authorities had their request concerned the travel history of a passenger outside Russia, Zhuravlova responded: “The responsibility for rides-related data is carried by the legal entity, which operates the service in a particular country. For example, Russian Yandex.Taxi LLC will handle the enquiries about rides in Russia, provided the enquiries are made according to established legal procedure. Enquiries about rides in Georgia will be handled by the Netherlands-based Yandex.Taxi B.V., while enquiries about rides in Ghana will be handled by MLU Africa B.V. and so on.” Yandex’s partnership with Uber In 2018, Yandex and Uber merged their rideshare operations in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Russia into a single entity. Named MLU B.V., it is jointly owned by the two companies and officially based in the Netherlands. Today, if you open the Uber app on your phone in one of these countries, you are redirected to Yandex.Taxi, or another service operated by Yandex. In Russia, a separate Uber Russia app is available, with Yandex listed as the developer. In the U.S., according to Uber’s privacy policy, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena must be submitted by law enforcement before the company shares its user data. Uber has also published transparency reports detailing the number and frequency of these requests. However, an Uber spokeswoman told Coda Story via email that Uber and Yandex.Taxi “operate separately with different products, infrastructures and policies.” Uber declined to comment on Yandex.Taxi’s involvement in the Golunov case. Asked whether Yandex.Taxi could provide similar records of law enforcement requests to those Uber has made public, Zhuravlova responded, “We haven’t so far but are thinking about how to increase transparency on that going forward.” – Rappler.com   Additional reporting by Katerina Fomina and Mariam Kiparoidze.

The South Korean manufacturer said it would produce the four-passenger electric “vertical take-off and landing vehicles” at “automotive scale,” without offering details. The deal announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas could help Uber, which is working with other aircraft manufacturers, to achieve its goal of deploying air taxi service in a handful of cities by 2023. Jaiwon Shin, head of Hyundai’s urban air mobility division, said he expects the large-scale manufacturing to keep costs affordable for the aerial systems. “We know how to mass produce high quality vehicles,” Shin told a news conference at CES. He said he expected the partnership to allow for the short-range air taxis to be “affordable for everyone.” Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate, appeared at the CES event with Hyundai to discuss the partnership. “By taking transportation out of the two dimensional grid on the ground and moving it into the sky, we can offer significant time savings to our riders,” Allison said. He said that because of its other app-based transport options, “only Uber can seamlessly connect riders from cars, trains and even bikes to aircraft.” Uber has announced it had selected Melbourne to join Dallas and Los Angeles in becoming the first cities to offer Uber Air flights, with the goal of beginning demonstrator flights in 2020 and commercial operations in 2023. Hyundai is using CES to show the S-A1 model aircraft with a cruising speed up to 180 miles (290 km) per hour. The aircraft utilizes “distributed electric propulsion,” designed with multiple rotors that can keep it in the air if one of them fails. The smaller rotors also help reduce noise, which the companies said is important to cities. The Hyundai vehicle will be piloted initially but over time will become autonomous, the company said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/240484-california-assembly-bill-5-ridesharing-employees/","title":"California governor signs law making gig workers employees","date":"Sep 19, 2019 9:56 AM PHT","snippet":"The law challenges the business model of the rideshare platforms and others which depend on workers taking on 'gigs' as independent contractors.","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – California governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a controversial law that could shake up the “gig” economy by reclassifying rideshare drivers and others as employees. The legislation, which is being closely watched in other states, responds to critics who argue that companies like Uber and Lyft shortchange contract drivers by denying them employee benefits. Newsom said the new law was a first step toward better treatment of employees and would enable more workers to unionize. The governor called the measure known as AB5 “landmark legislation for workers and our economy” and said it would reduce “worker misclassification” that denied benefits such as minimum wage, sick leave and health insurance. “The hollowing out of our middle class has been 40 years in the making and the need to create lasting economic security for our workforce demands action. Assembly Bill 5 is an important step.” The law challenges the business model of the rideshare platforms and others which depend on workers taking on “gigs” as independent contractors. Efforts by Uber and Lyft to negotiate a compromise to the bill passed by state legislators apparently failed, given the governor signed it into law unchanged. The measure was hailed as a watershed moment for labor activists seeking more rights for gig and freelance workers. “Big thank you to all the gig workers, union members & activists who spent countless hours rallying to deliver this historic win,” the California Labor Federal said in a tweet. “We proved when working people stand together, we win!” Uber balks Uber said it has no plans to immediately reclassify drivers as employees in January, when the law takes effect. The law “does not provide drivers benefits; give them the right to organize, or classify them as employees,” Uber chief legal officer Tony West said on a call last week with reporters. Uber had pressed for a new classification that considers workers independent while guaranteeing benefits, and has allocated millions of dollars to get a referendum on the ballot to support an option that would let drivers remain independent while providing safety nets. “It was a leadership moment that was lost by California, to be able to lead that third way that fits th 21st century economy and the way the world works today,” West said. Uber and Lyft, whose business models are likely to be hit by the law, are seeking a referendum in the state that would overturn the measure. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/239887-gig-economy-challenged-california-lawmakers-approve-landmark-bill/","title":"Gig economy challenged as California lawmakers approve landmark bill","date":"Sep 11, 2019 6:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Under Assembly Bill 5, workers in California must be designated as employees if their work or performance is controlled by the company, and part of that company's regular business","body":" SAN FRANSCISO, USA – Uber and Lyft would be required to treat contract workers in California as employees under landmark legislation approved by the US state’s lawmakers Tuesday, September 10, that could reshape the gig economy. Those in favor of the gig economy – where workers are employed on short-term contracts without benefits like healthcare or minimum wage – say it allows flexibility, but opponents say it deprives workers of stability and security. Under Assembly Bill 5, workers in California – the biggest US state by GDP – must be designated employees, not contractors, if their work or performance is controlled by the company, and part of that company’s regular business. Bitterly fought by the tech giants, the landmark bill – which passed 29-11 in the state legislature’s upper house – sets a precedent that may be copied in states like New York where labor groups are pushing for similar rights for workers. The lower house – the Assembly – which has already passed the bill, will now vote on amendments introduced by the Senate, before sending it to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom is expected to sign it into law, having indicated his support for the measure last week in an op-ed published by the Sacramento Bee. Once a darling of both progressives and hard-nosed economists, start-up apps relying on the gig economy are weathering increasing political pressure, as well as plateauing or decreasing stock values as investors worry about potential legislation. Both Uber and Lyft warned about the impact of such laws in a co-bylined op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle ahead of the bill’s hearing. It said: “It’s also no secret that a change to the employment classification of ride-share drivers would pose a risk to our businesses.” But Lorena Gonzalez, the Democrat who authored the bill, told Bloomberg the law meant a business “cannot game the system by misclassifying its workers.” “As lawmakers, we will not in good conscience allow free-riding businesses to continue to pass their own business costs onto taxpayers and workers,” she said in a statement. “It’s our job to look out for working men and women, not Wall Street and their get-rich-quick IPOs.” Slated to take effect from January 1 next year, the bill’s passing was criticized by Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin, who told Gizmodo: “Today, our state’s political leadership missed an important opportunity to support the overwhelming majority of rideshare drivers who want a thoughtful solution that balances flexibility with an earnings standard and benefits.”  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/230177-uber-stock-set-to-launch-may-2019/","title":"Uber stock set to launch at $45 a share","date":"May 10, 2019 3:12 PM PHT","snippet":"Shares will be priced at $45 for the initial public offering (IPO), valuing the startup at more than $82 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission","body":" NEW YORK, USA – Uber is set for its Wall Street debut Friday, May 10, with a massive share offering that is a milestone for the ride-hailing industry and the so-called “sharing economy,” but which comes with simmering concerns about its business model. Shares will be priced at $45 for the initial public offering (IPO), valuing the startup at more than $82 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. San Francisco-based Uber was set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the eponymous ticker “UBER” in one of the largest initial public offerings in the tech sector. Despite the eye-popping valuation, Uber dialed back some of its earlier ambitions for a value exceeding $100 billion after a rocky start for US rideshare rival Lyft. Analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Uber has the potential to be a game-changing company and “is paving a similar road to what Amazon did to transform retail/ecommerce and Facebook did for social media.” Ives said Uber has the potential to grow as it morphs its ridesharing platform into a more diverse set of services with Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and self-driving vehicle initiatives. “We view Uber’s conservative pricing as a smart and prudent strategy coming out of the box as it clearly learned from its ‘little brother’ Lyft, and the experience it has gone through over the past month,” Ives said in a note to investors. Risks to new model But some of the risks surrounding Uber and its rivals were highlighted Wednesday, May 8, as thousands of drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike over pay and working conditions. The strikes targeting Uber and its US rival Lyft highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange with some signs reading “Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.” Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber said in a securities filing Thursday that it had reached agreement with a large majority of the roughly 60,000 drivers contesting their status as independent contractors and who had instituted arbitration proceedings against the firm. The company anticipates the total cost of the individual settlements, combined with attorneys’ fees, will fall between $146 million and $170 million. Uber maintained it was sticking to its plans on how it classifies drivers. “Our business would be adversely affected if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors,” the company said. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry predicted that Uber will eventually have to raise ride prices, causing its customers to seek other options. Uber will be raising up to $9 billion in the offering being underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and other large banks. Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft, which has lost more than 15 percent of its value since its March offering. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to more than 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike or e-scooter to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/230093-softbank-group-earnings-report-2018/","title":"Tech fund drives SoftBank Group profit up 36%","date":"May 9, 2019 3:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Net profits for the financial year ending March at Softbank come  in at 1.41 trillion yen ($12.8 billion), up 35.8%.","body":" TOKYO, Japan –  Japan’s SoftBank Group on Thursday, May 9, reported annual net profit jumped more than a third, helped by gains from its investment fund which has plowed billions into some of the hottest names in the tech sector.

Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “UBER” sometime next month. “We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and ‘little brother’ to Uber,” Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is “paving a similar road” to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. Uber’s platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/228034-uber-sets-ipo-motion/","title":"Uber sets IPO in motion, seeks to ‘ignite opportunity’","date":"Apr 12, 2019 7:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contains no specific pricing or timing for the market debut for Uber, which according to media reports is expected to raise some $10 billion","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA –  Uber filed documents on Thursday, April 11, for its much-anticipated public share offering expected to be the largest in the tech sector in years, and a bellwether for other venture-backed startups eyeing Wall Street listing. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contained no specific pricing or timing for the market debut for Uber, which according to media reports was expected to raise some $10 billion. Uber’s valuation in its latest private investment round was more than $70 billion, but reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. The filing noted that Uber offers ridesharing in some 700 cities but has bolder ambitions to reshape how people and goods are transported with operations such as meal deliveries, freight, and electric bikes and scooters. “Our mission is to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion,” the document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We revolutionized personal mobility with ridesharing, and we are leveraging our platform to redefine the massive meal delivery and logistics industries. While we have had unparalleled growth at scale, we are just getting started.” Uber said it operates on 6 continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totaled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a “placeholder” amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. Trouble with Lyft The move comes after a lackluster market debut for Uber’s US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 10% of its value since its IPO last month. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over in 2017 as part of an effort to reform a corporate culture marred by misconduct and other scandals, said Uber has taken steps to restore its brand and credibility. “Taking this step means that we have even greater responsibilities — to our shareholders our customers and our colleagues,” Khosrowshahi said in a letter announcing the IPO. Uber and Lyft both are predicting that ride-hailing will gain even more traction with autonomous vehicles, allowing more people to give up private cars and freeing up more urban space. “We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies will enable a product that competes with the cost of personal vehicle ownership and usage, and represents the future of transportation,” Uber’s filing said. Challenges down the road Uber is the largest of the “unicorns” or venture backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the “sharing economy” which is based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Analysts have warned that Uber and Lyft face a difficult road to profitability amid challenges from regulators and established taxi operators around the world. Some question the business model of using independent contractors as drivers — a system which the companies say is more flexible and leads to entrepreneurial spirit. Uber’s revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. “Investors should be ready for a lot of volatility” in Uber, said Scott Rostan, a former investment banker who is currently an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina. “In my opinion if you are buying into Uber or Lyft you’re buying into a belief this is going to revolutionize transportation in the future. But a good business doesn’t necessarily mean a good investment.” Rostan added that both firms will be seeking to step up growth and that “i it turns into a market share fight between Uber and Lyft, profitability is going to be tough.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that the ride-hailing firms will face competition from other autonomous driving firms including the former Google car unit Waymo. “Lyft’s IPO was supposed to be a watershed moment for the highly anticipated 2019 tech IPO class,” Ives said in a research note. “With Uber, investors will soon have a second option to make a bet on the future of mobility and transportation with the clear market share leader, while competitor focus will likely also zero in on Waymo/Google.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/227919-uber-ipo-may-2019/","title":"Uber steers toward blockbuster IPO as road looks rocky","date":"Apr 11, 2019 12:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber's IPO could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber could become a $100 billion company with a massive share offering that will be a bellwether for tech startups looking toward Wall Street. Media reports said the ride-hailing giant is seeking to raise some $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year. That could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal said details of Uber’s initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May. The IPO comes after a lackluster response to last month’s market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber. Lyft shares rose on the first day of trade and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were down more than 10% from the $72 offering price. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said Uber recently provided documents showing a potential price range of between $48 and $55 a share, implying a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report. “Even a valuation in the $90 billion to $100 billion range would represent a healthy premium to the latest private valuation (some $76 billion) in August 2018,” said Matt Kennedy of the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “Uber will definitely be pegged to Lyft. So they can’t be too aggressive on valuation, given where Lyft is trading. Though it’s possible that some of the pressure on Lyft is related to investors looking to pick up Uber instead.” Analysts warn both Uber and Lyft will need strong growth to justify their lofty valuations, and face multiple challenges to their business model which has disrupted traditional taxi services and relies on drivers to be independent contractors. The ride-hailing firms are also investing in other “last mile” transport options such as electric bikes and scooters, and in the long run are looking to autonomous vehicles as a way to reduce dependence on private cars and reshape urban landscapes. Unicorn stampede Uber is the latest, and will be largest of the so-called “unicorns,” or venture-backed startups worth at least $1 billion, to look to Wall Street listings to expand their capital base. But some of the early enthusiasm about this unicorn herd has waned and there are hints that private investment rounds may have been priced too high. Pinterest, a virtual bulletin board that connects people with interests including food, fashion, travel and lifestyle, plans to trade under the symbol PINS on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinterest unveiled its IPO price range with an estimated valuation of some $11 billion, below the $12 billion in its most recent private funding round. Other big tech firms which could join the stampede include the business collaboration startup Slack and big data firm Palantir. (READ: After Lyft, here are 6 other tech companies planning for an IPO) Aswath Damodaran, a New York University business professor specializing in corporate valuations, calculated Lyft to be worth around $16 billion, below its the more than $20 billion at its IPO price. Uber released financial data earlier this year showing it lost $865 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. The San Francisco-based firm reported revenue of $3 billion, a 25% increase from a year earlier.

The San Francisco startup could be valued at more than $20 billion under the terms of the initial public offering unveiled Monday, setting a price per share of between $62 and $68. Lyft’s launch is the first of what is expected to be a wave of IPOs from venture-backed startups worth more than $1 billion, known in Silicon Valley as “unicorns.” Lyft’s listing comes ahead of a larger offering expected from Uber, which has a valuation of some $70 billion. Others expected to move to Wall Street this year include the business collaboration firm Slack, visual discovery startup Pinterest and possibly the big data group Palantir. Lyft is proposing to sell 30.8 million shares with an underwriters option for an additional 4.6 million, with shares on the Nasdaq listed under the symbol “LYFT.” No date was given for the listing, but the Wall Street Journal said Lyft shares could begin trading by the end of next week, when a final price will be set. Lyft and Uber are among the most prominent players in the “sharing economy,” representing a trend that moves away from ownership to on-demand services. The growth in these services is eroding sentiment for ownership of homes, cars and other goods, and is also shifting the concept of labor and employment, sparking fierce debates on whether the change is good or bad. Spending for “on demand” on services such as Uber and Airbnb and other digital platforms rose 58% in 2017 to $75.7 billion in the US, with more than 41 million consumers participating, according to a survey by Rockbridge Associates. Heavy losses According to documents filed earlier, Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Lyft said in its Securities and Exchange Commission filing it has completed over one billion rides since its inception in 2012 and had bookings last year of $8.1 billion. It has a 39% share of the US rideshare market, according to a survey cited in the filing. Lyft has also begun to move into other kinds of short-range transportation including bike- and scooter-sharing. Lyft is also betting on adoption of autonomous driving, claiming that self-driving taxis and rideshare services will help reshape urban landscapes by eliminating the need for private vehicles. “We believe that cities should be built for people, not cars,” Lyft says in its IPO filing. “Mass car ownership strains our cities and reduces the very freedom that cars once provided.” Both Lyft and Uber have faced criticism for disrupting traditional taxi services and for using the model of drivers as independent contractors. The rideshare firms claim that most drivers prefer the flexible work arrangement, even if it offers fewer benefits and less job security. Lyft said it will seek to maintain its policy that drivers are independent contractors while noting that any legal challenge to this could have “adverse” consequences. For the IPO, Lyft said some shares would be reserved for drivers who have completed at least 10,000 trips using the platform. The company will offer a bonus of $1,000 to $10,000 to eligible drivers by March 19 that may be used to buy shares at the offering price, although they may opt to pocket the cash. With a dual-class share structure enabling founders to maintain control, chief executive Logan Green will have some 29% of voting power and co-founder John Zimmer 19% after the IPO. Ross Gerber of the investment firm Gerber Kawasaki cautioned against getting too excited on Lyft. “Another very overpriced IPO which gives public shareholders no say,” Gerber said in a tweet. “Do not touch this dog. It will rally and then start the long road down.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/222722-messaging-startup-slack-to-go-public/","title":"Workplace messaging startup Slack to go public","date":"Feb 5, 2019 11:01 AM PHT","snippet":"Slack, which claims some 10 million users in 150 countries, has been valued at $7.1 billion, as reported in August 2018 after a round of funding","body":" WASHINGTON, USA – Workplace messaging startup Slack said Monday, February 4, it had filed a confidential registration for an initial public offering, becoming the latest of a group of richly valued tech enterprises to look to Wall Street.

Carmakers and tech firms are refining the systems for self-driving navigation and safety. But with full autonomy still likely years away, there is a growing interest in making cars a place to live, work, communicate and enjoy the ride. At the Consumer Electronics Show this week, exhibitors were showcasing technology for comfort, safety, entertainment and personalization. Byton, the China-based electric carmaker expected to launch its first vehicles late this year, showed its sedan with a 48-inch display panel, covering the width of the dash, where riders can watch movies, check messages and get other information — although the full array of services won’t be offered while someone is driving. The Byton car will use facial recognition to customize the experience for drivers and passengers, with personalized music and recommendations. The car would know who is inside and how long they have been traveling, and in one example cited by the company, make recommendations for restaurants along a particular route. “The car could become the most important device in your digital life,” said Carsten Breitfeld, co-founder and chief executive of Byton. Byton will offer the potential for partial autonomy, allowing riders to focus on other things such as watching movies, shopping with a voice assistant or browsing the internet. The vehicle will work through voice, touch, gestures or facial recognition. “It’s all about the customer experience,” Carsten told a media event at the Las Vegas show, while noting that more of the enhanced features will be used when the car is in autonomous mode or stationary. Empathy and emotion Gawain Morrison, co-founder of the British-based artificial intelligence startup Sensum, said the human factor is becoming more important in the automobile sector. “A lot of the technology up to now has been about moving from point A to point B,” he said. “The next generation is about how to interact with the humans. They need an understanding about the human state at any point in the journey.” Sensum and its auto-supplier partner Valeo showed what it called “empathic mobility tech” which can measure occupants’ emotional state and physiological comfort, and adjust its environmental settings accordingly. The South Korean automaker Kia dubbed its system “‘Real-time Emotion Adaptive Driving,” or READ with an emotional AI-based cabin which analyzes a driver’s emotional state by monitoring facial expressions, heart rate and electrodermal activity. “The system enables continuous communication between driver and vehicle through the unspoken language of ‘feeling’, thereby providing an optimal, human-sense oriented space for the driver in real-time,” said Albert Biermann, president and head of research for Kia parent Hyundai.  Warnings for drowsiness German auto equipment maker Continental was showing its monitoring system which can detect if a driver is distracted or drowsy, in line with recommendations from the European Union. “You may get a visual warning, or the seat will vibrate, or the steering wheel will vibrate,” said Continental executive Heinz Abel. “This is part of an effort to guide your attention back to the road.” Several equipment makers were showcasing what they called the “cockpit of the future” which could be available for conventional vehicles and adapted for autonomous mode. Visteon, a former Ford unit which makes automotive equipment, displayed its electronic control unit which integrates the driving and manages other system such as information and entertainment. Upton Bowden, the head of new technology for Visteon, said equipment makers will be offering a “transitional cockpit” which helps people understand what is happening in autonomous mode. “You want the occupants to trust the system,” Bowden told AFP. “When you get into an automated vehicle you have no knowledge of that system, so you have some level of discomfort.” The key to overcoming mistrust, he said, is to offer more transparency: “We can give you a real-time digital picture of what’s going on by taking the data and transforming it into a graphical user experience.” Bowden said these systems can be especially useful for autonomous rideshare vehicles, allowing personalization of the experience through cloud-based technology. “It would recognize who you were and handle payment through facial recognition,” he said. “It can instantly pair to your cloud account and bring in your favorite radio stations and other information.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/213076-slack-2019-ipo-report/","title":"Workplace messaging startup Slack eyes 2019 IPO – report","date":"Sep 29, 2018 12:30 AM PHT","snippet":"Citing unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal says Slack is aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) in the first half of 2019 that would value the California startup at well above the $7.1 billion it reached in its most recent funding round","body":" WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Workplace collaboration software firm Slack is actively preparing for a share offering in early 2019, which be the largest in the tech sector since Snap’s debut last year, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, September 28.

Called Micab, the service launched in 2012 in Cebu before expanding to a few other provincial markets. In April this year, it got the nod of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to operate in Manila.  Since Grab acquired chief rival Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March, the ridesharing market has practically operated in a monopoly. The arrival of Micab, and other upcoming ridesharing services such as Owto, Go Lag, Hype, and Hirna, is expected to restore some balance to the market. For consumers, the arrival of new players sparks hope that it will eventually be faster to book a ride, and that drivers will behave more fairly at the risk of losing customers to other players.  We talked to Eddie Ybañez, founder and CEO of Micab, on how they’ll be addressing issues that currently plague the ridesharing market. Micab’s primary edge against other competitors, says Ybañez, is that it won’t be charging booking fees and do surge pricing because the business is supported by its ad service, MiAds. Watch our quick video above for the rest of his answers or read the transcript below: Q: What’s your edge over the competition? Eddie Ybañez: At Micab, what we’re doing is we’re improving the taxi industry by providing safety, and a more convenient way to hail a ride. But the good thing with this is this promise comes very affordably. Because whatever the existing fare structure is, that’s what passengers have to pay. We don’t have a booking fee or surge pricing. I think that’s what our edge is compared to all the other players.  Q: How many taxis will Micab be able to bring to the ridesharing market?  EY: Our partners are capable of producing, in Manila alone, 15,000. That’s our target. That’s our target but the moment our other fleets sign on, we’ll have more taxis. Our target is about 30,000, maybe. Q: Now we’re at 5,000 in Manila? EY: 5,000 by June.   Q: When do we reach 15,000? EY: We’re targeting early next year to reach 15,000 in Manila. Nationwide, the 15,000-taxi goal is now doable, because they have already signed on.  Q: How are you addressing bad driver behavior?  EY: Before, there was no platform, no system for taxis. It was just the passenger and the driver who knew what was going on during the trip. If the driver did something, only the passenger would know – unless he posts it on Facebook or something.  But with Micab now, passengers have the power to report, to rate the driver, to commend the driver or file a complaint. The moment a 3-star rating is reported – even without details – our customer service will call the passenger and driver to investigate. Depending on the severity of the complaint, the drivers may be forced to go under re-training, or they will be taken off the platform, penalized by the operator, or if it’s a criminal offense, government agencies can step in, and impose penalties.   The driver’s license can get suspended for the next 3 months, 6 months or 1 year – that’s an existing ruling at the LTFRB. We’re actually sharing the system with the taxi operators and the government agencies.  Q: Will drivers see their passenger’s destination prior to accepting a trip? This has been seen as a reason why drivers are able to cancel on and pick passengers at will.  EY: Brainstorming on the decision whether to retain the driver’s ability to see passenger destination or not was tough. But eventually, the decision for us to allow the driver to see the destination won.  Why? As much as possible, we don’t want confrontations. We don’t want them to fight in the streets just because, say, a driver finds out that the destination is Bulacan. They might just end up fighting.   But since we’re allowing that, we’re limiting the number of times a driver can ignore or reject a request.  The moment a driver rejects 3 requests in one day, they will be blocked in the system for a day.  This will affect their rating. The moment they reach a 3-star average rating, they won’t be able to get passengers unless they do re-training.  Q: What happens when a passenger reports a driver who asks for additional fees?   EY: The operations team will investigate the incident. When they investigate, we’ll have access to their conversation on the app. So we can trace that. So passengers are actually protected. If a driver asks for a fixed contract rate for a trip, which is illegal, we can even report that to the LTFRB.  There’s a record of the conversation between passenger and driver. There’s evidence.   This is the big difference between now and then. Now there’s someone looking at them. The drivers themselves will behave better knowing that someone is monitoring them, like a parent to a child. Q: How fast can a passenger book a ride?  EY: Currently, we average 10 minutes, but we’re still ramping up in Manila. We haven’t even launched officially, but we’re operational already. The app is downloadable already. There are around an extra 1,000 cabs [about to be activated].  But we’re trying really that by the end of June, we have 5,000 cabs.  Hopefully, the moment more cabs get enabled – it’s just supply and demand, really – ride acceptance becomes faster. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/202086-uber-flying-car-prototype-photos-uber-elevate-2018/","title":"Uber’s ‘flying taxi’ prototypes shown off at Uber Elevate","date":"May 9, 2018 11:43 AM PHT","snippet":"Commercialization of the flying taxis may begin around 2023, and can be summoned on-demand just like a ridesharing car","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – It’s not a bird, nor a plane. But Uber’s new prototype vehicle, known as the eCRM-003, unveiled Tuesday shows off its vision of the future of transportation – a “flying taxi” that aims to alleviate urban congestion. A model of Uber’s electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle concept (eVTOL) – a cross between a helicopter and a drone – was displayed at the second annual Uber Elevate Summit in Los Angeles. “Our goal is to radically improve global mobility,” said Uber Aviation product chief Nikhil Goel. Goel said the all-electric flyer can achieve speeds over 300 kilometers (200 miles) an hour with a range of 100 kilometers (60 miles) on a battery charge. “We fly a lot so we can prove to the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and the public that these aircraft are safe,” he said. Uber has become a global force in transportation with its ridesharing service, but is also working on autonomous vehicles and other forms of transport. Uber plans the first demonstration flights for Los Angeles in 2020 and commercialization of the flying taxis in 2023, saying these could be ordered on demand just like a ridesharing vehicle. Eric Allison, who heads Uber’s Aviation programs, said the flying vehicles are part of an overall strategy allowing people to do without personal cars. “The rational choice for transportation will be less and less to own and drive a car,” Allison said. “We want to price it so low, it’ll be irrational to drive your car.” Here are 3 other concept vehicles seen at the event:    The first flying taxis will be designed with a pilot, according to Allision, but over time can be developed as autonomous vehicles. At the conference at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles, Uber showed films and models of a futuristic city with such vehicles, seemingly inspired by the film Blade Runner. The concept includes “skyports” that would serve as hubs for the aerotaxis. Several other companies along with Uber are trying to develop similar kinds of aerial devices.  Uber operations director Jeff Holen says the obstacles to  the new transport mode are mostly around regulations of air space, adding, “The technology exists… we can solve this today.” – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/197863-adb-design-davao-city-bus-system-out-2019/","title":"ADB hopes design of Davao City’s bus system out by 2019","date":"Mar 10, 2018 6:06 PM PHT","snippet":"While it has not yet moved to the National Economic and Development Authority board, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez says the $70-million plan 'is now in the pipeline'","body":" DAVAO CITY, Philippines – A top official of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the Philippines hopes to finalize by 2019 the design of Davao City’s dream plan to modernize its public transportation system.  “We hope it could be done in 18 months,” Kelly Bird, the country director of ADB in the Philippines, told reporters on Friday, March 9. Bird was referring to the city’s high priority bus system (HPBS) program, which is one of the local government’s top priority projects as it manages the city’s increasing transport demand. “It will involve bus terminals, bus stops, waiting stations, and bus lightings,” Bird added, referring to the design.

ADB was tapped to support the city’s bid to overhaul its transport services which were described as “poor” in terms of coverage area, operating hours, passenger comfort, and facilities. The project emerged during the administration of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo who, at the time, ordered the transportation department to reform the transportation sector by coming up with projects that helped lessen fossil fuel consumption. Increasing demand for transportation In 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority said the population in Davao Region and Davao City reached 4.89 million and 1.6 million, respectively. This means one in 3 people from Davao Region lives in the highly urbanized city. The city’s traffic problem has been among the pressing concerns of the local government, which recently amended its traffic code to include heavier punishment for residents who park illegally, as well as those who jaywalk. Tens of thousands of drivers were caught violating the code last year. The clamor for a better public transportation system in Davao City emerged during the time of former mayor and now President Rodrigo Duterte. In 2014, a Korean company conducted a feasibility study to determine whether a light rail transit system is a viable option to ease traffic congestion in the city. Talks regarding trains for the city were later replaced by the ADB-assisted project. Jeepneys remain to be the city’s largest public transport provider. Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio even sought for the city’s jeepneys to be exempted from the Department of Transportation’s modernization plan. Davao City also opted to do away with ridesharing services and urged taxi operators to form a mobile-based service now called HirNa, which taps existing cabs instead of adding more cars on the road. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/197763-uber-grab-deal-southeast-asia-operations/","title":"Uber selling Southeast Asia operations to Grab – report","date":"Mar 9, 2018 10:19 AM PHT","snippet":"Reports say the deal will also give Uber a 20% to 30% stake in Grab","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber is selling parts of its Southeast Asia operations to local rival Grab, getting a piece of the action in the process, according to US media reports. Grab is on the cusp of buying Uber’s business in some Southeast Asia markets in a deal that would give the California-based smartphone-summoned ride service a stake in its competitor, reported Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. The size of the stake could be around 20% or more than 30%, according to the reports, which cited unnamed sources. Uber did not respond to an AFP request or comment. The US ride share titan faces fierce competition in Asia, not only from Singapore-based Grab but from Ola in India, and Chinese rival Didi Chuxing. Japanese financial titan Softbank has invested billions of dollars in Uber, Didi, Ola and Grab, and is known for seeking synergies between companies in its portfolio. (READ: SoftBank seals deal for large Uber stake) Didi and Uber ended a ferocious battle in the surging Chinese market in 2016 with a tie-up along the lines of the reported deal with Grab. Southeast Asia’s top ride-hailing firm Grab launched services in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh late last year as it looked to lock down regional domination against main rival Uber. Grab, which launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding market, which is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore investment firm Temasek. While ridesharing giant Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, the US-based company has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe.

In a statement, SoftBank Group insisted no decision had been made, but acknowledged the listing was an “option.” “We are always studying various capital strategy options,” the company said. “The listing of SoftBank Corp. shares is one such option, but no decision has been made to officially proceed with this course.” The Nikkei economic daily, which first reported the plan, said the listing could bring in two trillion yen ($18 billion), one of the largest initial public offerings ever for a Japanese company. The report sent SoftBank shares up nearly 6% at the market’s open, though they later settled up 4%. The Nikkei said SoftBank hopes to apply to the Tokyo Stock Exchange in spring and begin trading on the bourse around autumn, offering around 30% of the shares in its subsidiary up to investors. It is hoping for an overseas debut at the same time, possibly in London, the daily added. SoftBank Group has been aggressively investing in technology ventures under its flamboyant leader, Masayoshi Son. In 2016, it announced the creation of its massive Vision Fund — a venture capital fund worth nearly $100 billion, set up with Saudi Arabia’s government and other investors. In December, SoftBank announced it was acquiring a large stake in the ridesharing giant Uber. Sources said it was acquiring 15 percent of the company in a deal totalling $7.7 billion. The Nikkei said the listing plans would further consolidate SoftBank Group’s status as an investment company and give its subsidiary greater autonomy. The listing could rival the record 2.2 trillion yen that formerly state-run Nippon Telegraph and Telephone raised in 1987. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/193497-ces-las-vegas-beyond-the-car-how-tech-firms-exploring-future-transport/","title":"Beyond the car: how tech firms are exploring the future of transport","date":"Jan 12, 2018 6:44 PM PHT","snippet":"A predicted shift away from owning and relying on cars will change the way urban planners design cities, say experts","body":"LAS VEGAS, USA – Carless commuting is cruising in the fast lane at the Consumer Electronics Show, with companies showing off electric bicycles, scooters, skateboards and more aimed at making the internal combustion engine a thing of the past. As the ranks of people around the world living in cities has grown, so too has the cost of car ownership as well as traffic congestion. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the annual tech gathering in Las Vegas where some 170,000 conference goers jammed the streets. “In a lot of big cities, cars aren’t tenable anymore,” said tech analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates. An AFP reporter testing the car-free concept through the week at CES by relying on a freshly released GenZe electric bicycle consistently sailed past clogged traffic near the convention center and on the famed Las Vegas Strip. Riders too tired or lazy to pedal meanwhile can twist a throttle to glide along at close to local street speed limits. GenZe spokesman Tom Valasek, a former auto industry marketing executive, said that several car makers had come to check out the company’s CES exhibit. “There is a lot of curiosity right now about where things are heading,” Valasek told AFP. “I know a lot of people in the auto industry who are quite worried that car ownership is going away.” Driverless cars The popularity of smartphone-summoned rides from services such as Uber and Lyft are playing into the trend, with technology giants investing heavily in self-driving capabilities that could soon see automated vehicles available on-demand. “We believe car ownership makes no sense in the future,” Lyft chief executive John Zimmer said at a CES dinner event. Zimmer doubted that his daughter, now a young child, will want to own a car when she is of age. Instead, he said: “She’ll want access to transportation.” A boom of autonomous cars would likely prompt vehicles to evolve to be more akin to rooms on wheels: sleeper cabins in trains, or private offices, Zimmer added. A shift away from owning and relying on cars was also expected to result in traffic and parking becoming less of a priority in urban design. GenZe, a US-based division of the Mahindra Group in India, this week announced its e-bikes will be added in April to a Ford GoBike ride-share program in San Francisco. The e-bikes should “help to make San Francisco more livable and reduce congestion,” Metropolitan Transportation Commission deputy executive Alix Bockelman said in a release. Leading online social network Facebook has a fleet of 100 GenZe bikes for employees to get around its Silicon Valley campus, and they are also used by delivery services DoorDash and Postmates, according to Valasek. Scoot, Skate, Ride  Despite negative publicity about hoverboards a few years ago – centered on their tendency to explode – the manufacturer Swagtron was at CES with some of those devices along with skateboards and bicycles boosted with electric motors. “We are seeing with personal mobility that some people like to skate; some people like to scoot, and some people like to ride,” Swagtron chief operating officer Andrew Koven told AFP. Koven saw alternatives to cars as an “absolute necessity” that was part of a “systemic shift” toward getting around in ways that are economical as well as socially and environmentally responsible. “If I am commuting a short distance to work, do I really need a car?” analyst Gold asked rhetorically.  Cities are already eyeing autonomous shuttle services. A self-driving electric shuttle built by Navya was introduced here last year in a test that segued into a program providing rides on a route in downtown Las Vegas. Swiss-based Rinspeed also showed its autonomous shuttle, and Toyota introduced a boxy concept vehicle which could be used for ridesharing, deliveries, medical services or as an extension of retail stores. Plenty of new cars were shown at CES including a number of self-driving models. But some attendees said that the vehicle of the future may be something different. Automakers “have been building cars from the driver’s perspective,” said Ankit Jain, head of the Ola Play software platform for the India-based rideshare group. In future vehicles which may be autonomous, “the passenger is the one paying,” Jain said. “You have to fundamentally rethink the car.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/193207-ces-las-vegas-toyota-epalette-mobile-platform/","title":"Toyota’s new self-driving concept vehicle aims for customizability","date":"Jan 9, 2018 10:45 AM PHT","snippet":"Toyota says it's designing not just a vehicle but a mobile platform for use in e-commerce, ridesharing and medical services, among others","body":"LAS VEGAS, USA – Self-driving buses aren’t new, but Toyota’s concept vehicle unveiled Monday aims to be more than just that – a mobile platform for e-commerce, ridesharing and medical services, for a start. The Japanese auto giant’s president Akio Toyoda unveiled the new initiative at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, seeking to get ahead of rivals offering single-use autonomous transporters. The “e-Palette” vehicle platform features a boxy electric-powered minibus designed to handle deliveries or even bring retail services to consumers, but can also be used for ridesharing and other purposes. “It is a flexible platform that can be adapted to a range of services,” Toyoda said, including ridesharing, retail, medical services or entertainment. The media demonstration showed how the vehicle could deliver packages or even enable consumers to try on shoes or apparel. The new initiative is part of an effort to transform Toyota from an automaker to a multifaceted “mobility” company, Toyoda said.

SoftBank will acquire 15% of Uber’s equity at a discount of 30% from its most recent value, according to a source familiar with the terms of the deal. The new investment, which will be finalized in January, is part of an effort by Uber to move past a series of scandals and missteps and reform its board structure as it gears up for a 2019 public share offering. A source familiar with the deal said SoftBank had reached agreements with investors to achieve its target of a 15% share. The two firms did not provide details of the valuation but the source said the investment was based on Uber’s worth of $48 billion, down from $71 billion earlier this year. “We look forward to working with the purchasers to close the overall transaction, which we expect to support our technology investments, fuel our growth, and strengthen our corporate governance,” Uber said in an emailed statement. A separate statement from Rajeev Misra, chief executive of SoftBank Investment Advisers, said, “We are appreciative of the support from Uber’s shareholders in the successful tender offer and look forward to closing the overall investment in January.” “We have tremendous confidence in Uber’s leadership and employees and are excited to support Uber as it continues to reinvent how people and goods are transported around the world,” he added. The source said SoftBank’s total investment in Uber will amount to $7.7 billion including a $1 billion infusion announced earlier this year. $54 billion ‘blended’ value The earlier investment was made at the higher valuation and the share repurchases at a lower value, leaving a “blended” valuation for Uber at $54 billion, according to the source. The investment is part of the effort by SoftBank to become a major player in the global tech world with a massive $100 billion fund, much of it targeted for Silicon Valley startups. At Uber, new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has vowed to fix the company’s work culture and business practices, after taking over earlier this year from ousted founder Travis Kalanick. Even as Uber has seen unprecedented growth by expanding to dozens of countries, it has been hurt by missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic work atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. The SoftBank deal is expected to put an end to litigation among stakeholders and clear the way for new board members, further loosening Kalanick’s grip. Uber however still faces numerous challenges including rulings from regulators that it unfairly competes with taxi operators, with London authorities having pulled its license. Uber is also seeking to become a major player in autonomous cars, and has agreed to buy and adapt vehicles from Volvo to begin operating self-driving taxis. But it faces a trail from former Google car unit Waymo alleging Uber executives stole trade secrets. The ridesharing group’s website says it has operations in 616 cities in 77 countries and some 16,000 employees. In most cases Uber drivers are treated as independent contractors. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/data-stories/190406-rappler-traffic-parking-online-survey/","title":"Rappler readers share how they really feel about Manila traffic and parking issues","date":"Dec 5, 2017 1:39 PM PHT","snippet":"Traffic has not only affected our personal schedules, but also takes time away to spend with loved ones. This Rappler-led survey digs deeper into how traffic changes our lives every single day","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Aside from work, sleep and food, two things are also now a constant in our everyday life: enduring traffic and looking for parking. These may even dictate how we go about our day. We don’t just consider the time it actually takes to accomplish certain tasks; we’ve become conditioned to factor in the additional time that we waste in traffic or looking for parking. (READ: With emojis, hugot phrases, even Hangul, people shared how traffic made them feel) How deeply do these circumstances affect society, especially in a fast-paced city like Manila? To find out, Rappler conducted a survey from November 9 to 15 among its readers, in partnership with Uber. A total of 4,397 responses were gathered from Filipinos aged 18 to 44. The poll offers insight as to how FIlipinos value their own time, and how they believe the public issue of traffic can be solved or improved. Plans depend on traffic and parking time Have you ever declined an invite for dinner and drinks with friends on a Friday night? Or do you now often choose to stay in during payday weekend? This is becoming a common decision for Metro Manila residents who fear the worse-than-usual traffic on these days.  Among survey respondents, 44.91% always factor in traffic and parking time when making plans or fixing their schedules.  During a recent Twitter conversation that we conducted about traffic, netizens also expressed the same sentiment.   Many also voiced out dismay that traffic robs them of time for loved ones. In the survey, 34% said that they would rather spend time with friends and family if they can reduce the time they spend on the road or lined up in parking areas. Coming in as a 2nd priority was being more productive at work (26.66%).   Too many cars, or not enough parking slots? On top of traffic, survey respondents also revealed that looking for parking can be a massive waste of time as well.   For most respondents, the average waiting time for looking for parking is 5 to 10 minutes (38%). More than a third of respondents (37%) claimed that they spend an average of 20 minutes waiting for parking slots to free up.  A recent Uber study reported that right now, Metro Manila needs an additional car park that’s twice the size of Makati, just to serve all the cars plying its roads. Online, car owners complained that even sidewalks and actual roads are being converted into parking slots, further worsening the traffic issue.  The survey revealed an interesting split in perspectives when it comes to people’s thoughts on solving the parking issue. Almost half (49.65%) of respondents believe that there are not enough parking slots in Metro Manila. But 40.61% feel that it’s the reverse – that there are simply too many cars.  The survey mirrors what netizens raised during our Twitter conversation.     Seeking solutions When asked what they feel is the best solution to solve traffic, improving public transportation (47%) was the top choice, followed by upgrading road infrastructure (30%).  Among solutions of private sectors, ridesharing wins over parking. 15% of respondents believe that ridesharing is the best solution for traffic, vs. only 8% for parking. Ridesharing skewed slightly higher for age group 35-44 (20%), the second largest age group of the Philippine labor force. More often than not they have higher purchasing power among other age groups who are willing to spend on convenience and comfort that ride-sharing offers. So what’s the best solution to ease traffic and parking woes?  While long-term solutions aren’t available, ride-sharing allows more people to move with less cars on the road. Motorists now have the option to share trips instead of bringing one car for only one or two people. Less cars on the road mean less traffic and parking lines. Commuters can also enjoy safer, faster, and more comfortable trips.  Although not included in the survey, netizens are also open to other solutions such as working outside of Metro Manila and adopting shifting schedules in companies.     Even if heavy traffic and lack of parking spaces present daily problems, there are available solutions to help us move through the city, better.

This was among the findings of a recent survey conducted as part of a study called “Unlocking Cities,” done by global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The study, commissioned by ride-sharing platform Uber, looks at the impact of ridesharing in Southeast Asia. The accompanying survey was done from September to October, covering around 300 respondents from Southeast Asian cities. The survey places Metro Manila 3rd worst in the region, with an average of 66 minutes stuck in traffic daily. It comes after Bangkok, Thailand, which is said to have the worst traffic (72 minutes), and 2nd worst Jakarta, Indonesia (68 minutes). The best performers in terms of traffic are Singapore (30 minutes) and Hong Kong (35 minutes). In Metro Manila, on top of the 66-minute traffic experience, drivers also spend an average of 24 minutes per day searching for parking. Traffic woes as economy improves  The BCG survey results also indicated that traffic may worsen, as 84% of Metro Manila respondents said they plan to buy a car in the next 5 years. At the same time, however, 37% of Metro Manila respondents said they would be “highly willing” to forgo purchasing a vehicle if ridesharing can meet their transport requirements. As expected, travel time more than doubles during rush hour in the morning and in the evening, according to Metro Manila respondents.   ‘Silver lining’ A silver lining, according to the study, is that a portion of potential new vehicles could be used on ride-sharing platforms such as Grab and Uber which would, in theory, lessen the number of overall vehicles on the road at the same time.   The effect would be especially pronounced if half of those cars are used for carpool services, where users would choose to share a ride with others in exchange for a lower fare. Both Grab and Uber offer this. Assuming 50% of rides are carpool services, BCG estimates that ridesharing could potentially reduce a million private vehicles from Philippine roads. Regulatory woes, infra buildup The potential effects of ridesharing, however, assume the presence of optimal conditions which has been far from the case in the Philippines. Uber itself was recently suspended for a month in the country and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The US–based firm may face even more problems ahead as it confirmed that details of Filipino users were exposed in a data breach that has affected 57 million users worldwide. The LFTRB also recently ordered the closure of popular motorbike-hailing platform Angkas over questions of legality. Multilateral agencies have put forward the improvement of public infrastructure as a long-term solution to traffic congestion. The study echoes this, pointing out that Manila, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh have all announced plans to invest more than $60 billion in rail infrastructure by 2022. But according to the study, the “added capacity of rail transport alone will not be sufficient to meet growth in transport demand by 2022.” It continued: “We estimate that ridesharing adoption between 16% and 40% across these cities is needed in conjunction with public transport to maintain congestion levels today.” The Philippine government is trying to address the poor infrastructure situation with its Build, Build, Build campaign, which seeks to raise public spending on infrastructure from 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 7.4% by 2022. The clock is ticking, however, with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimating that traffic congestion would cost the country P6 billion per day by 2030 if problems are not fixed. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/bahasa-indonesia/189790-infografis-millenial-malas-punya-mobil-pribadi/","title":"Benarkah millenial malas punya mobil pribadi?","date":"Nov 28, 2017 4:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Banyak yang lebih memilih ridesharing ketimbang memiliki kendaraan pribadi","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia —Mereka yang hidup di Jakarta pastilah mengerti benar kesengsaraan dan penderitaan yang harus dilalui pengguna jalan raya setiap hari saat beraktivitas.

Two members of the Uber information security team who “led the response” that included not alerting users that their data was breached were let go from the San Francisco-based company effective Tuesday, according to Khosrowshahi. The Uber chief said he only recently learned that outsiders had broken into a cloud-based server used by the company for data and downloaded a “significant” amount of information. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Uber’s new boss Khosrowshahi learned of the incident. “You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later,” Khosrowshahi said. “I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it.” Khosrowshahi said that what he learned about Uber’s failure to notify users or regulators prompted corrective actions. Need to change Uber is notifying drivers whose license numbers were swiped, and offering them credit and identity theft protections. The company also said it is notifying regulators, and monitoring affected rider accounts for signs of fraud. “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,” Khosrowshahi said. “We are changing the way we do business.” Khosrowshahi inherited a litany of scandals and a toxic workplace culture when he replaced Kalanick. Kalanick’s brash style has been credited with driving Uber to the leading spot in the smartphone-summoned ride market, but also blamed for fostering an atmosphere of impropriety and rule breaking at the company. A planned tieup with Japanese tech giant SoftBank suggests the ridesharing giant is set to come of age in the business world, but it still faces a long road ahead. The deal would give Uber an additional $1 billion in capital and could allow SoftBank to acquire as much as 14% of Uber over time. While Uber has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, it is trying to move past scandals and missteps that have included executive misconduct, a cutthroat workplace, and potentially unethical competitive practices. One step toward the future was the hiring of Khosrowshahi earlier this year, which left founder Kalanick in the background. But Uber needs to clean up governance and other practices in order to meet its goal of a 2019 stock market debut that will open up the privately-held firm to greater scrutiny. Under Kalanick, Uber reached an eye-popping valuation of $68 billion, unprecedented for a private firm.  But at the same time, it has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators, and faces possible bans in cities for failing to live up to local rules. The deal with SoftBank is aimed at getting past the clashes between Kalanick and early investors like Benchmark Capital, which has sued the former CEO. SoftBank is expected to buy up shares from some investors by pumping in as much as $9 billion, in a so-called tender offer to Uber stakeholders. Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisors, said earlier this month that some details are not yet final. Uber called the SoftBank deal “a strong vote of confidence” in the company’s long-term potential. But Uber has other issues as well.

These statements peppered a pile of massive cardboard boxes that appeared along 5th Avenue, Bonifacio Global City last Friday, November 17. This wasn’t a hugot wall dedicated to unrequited love – these words and emojis were people’s thoughts about traffic in Metro Manila. The sentiment is unanimous – it’s a hassle, a waste of time, and money.  “Everyday I commute going to work, and like most people I get bombarded by jeeps here, cars there, taxis everywhere. It takes such a long time to go to work,” said David, 22. Together with his friend, he stayed for a while at the installation to try the cardboard cars similar to those featured in Uber’s film, “Boxes.”  Boxes depicted the chaos of a city overflowing with boxes – a hilarious yet realistic metaphor for the congestion we experience on our own highways here in Manila. {source} <iframe width=”640″ height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNyq2_92H0Y” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source} “Traffic is very time-consuming, especially for us students. Instead of us having the energy to do homework and review when we get home, we feel drained,” says Mae, a 20-year-old who studies at Far Eastern University. According to an independent study commissioned by Uber, Filipinos in Metro Manila spend up to 402 hours every year just stuck in traffic. All that wasted time is equivalent to almost P100,000 lost income. (READ: How much time and money do we waste sitting in traffic and looking for parking?) That’s why others are doing their best to stay optimistic about the situation – and to constantly seek solutions. 26-year-old Franz, who posted his response in Hangul, says that traffic helped him to learn the Korean language. “I stay in traffic a lot so I end up having more time to practice. Instead of channeling your frustration into something negative, you turn it into something positive,” he said.  Franz pointed out that improving public transportation is the best way to solve traffic in Metro Manila. But his friend, Michael, added that immediate solutions are just as important. “I would say urban planning (can solve traffic) but that would take a longer time and it’s too complex. So the fastest way is to use Uber – ridesharing – for the meantime. And even if urban planning has been improved, I think ridesharing is still a very valuable solution,” Michael said. Athlete Jeron Teng, who also dropped by, agreed that ridesharing services like Uber offer a much better alternative to wasting time on the road. “For an athlete like me, ridesharing is more convenient. Sometimes after practice I would rather relax and share a ride than drive or look for parking,” he said.  Aside from sharing their thoughts on traffic, participants in the installation also learned how they can do their part to ease congestion in the city, through ridesharing. They all agreed that less traffic on the road doesn’t just mean more time or money – it also empowers them to help our cities become better. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/188792-uber-unlock-manila-traffic/","title":"The way we move: How traffic and parking issues affect our lives","date":"Nov 17, 2017 5:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Traffic and parking issues have affected our lives in many different ways. What did people have to say about these problems and what we can do to #UnlockManila?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – It has come to a point where we factor in traffic and parking when we move around the city. Have you ever asked yourself: Will I go out with friends if there’s heavy traffic? How early should I leave my house to beat rush hour traffic? Is there parking where I’m going? These days, when we drive or commute even for a short distance, it takes us hours, when realistically, it should only take a few minutes. If only we had the luxury of not having bumper-to-bumper traffic and parking issues, then maybe life would be a little less stressful. And perhaps these problems wouldn’t dictate our everyday decisions.  During a recent Twitter conversation on Rappler, we asked how these two problems–traffic and parking–have affected our daily lives and productivity, and what possible solutions can be adapted.  Readers also shared their ‘horror’ stories on how much time they’ve spent on the road and what they wish they could’ve done with that time instead.  It’s very true that heavy traffic can take away time from loved ones. Missing birthdays or being late for important family events can be caused by road problems.  And there were those who talked about their everyday woes as they go to and from work.  Apart from their not so pleasant experiences on the road, people also shared what they think is causing traffic along Metro Manila roads and possible solutions.    Imagine how our roads would be if motorists stayed in their designated lanes, parked in proper parking spaces and followed traffic rules?  You can’t deny that Metro Manila is congested and because there are so many people who need to get around, the volume of vehicles on the roads have increased as well. Would it be possible to solve this with a more efficient public transportation system? How to #UnlockManila? Metro Manila has so much potential to become a great city to live and thrive in. But problems like heavy traffic and lack of parking can impede its growth and development.    That’s why we need to work together to #UnlockManila’s true potential. Available solutions such as ridesharing is a prime example of how people can work together in order to make a difference and be a part of the solution.    Fewer cars on the road and more people sharing rides with one another can bring us one step closer to improving the lives of motorists and commuters alike.    What other solutions come to mind when issues such as traffic and lack of parking are raised?

Having the choice to spend your time meaningfully can make you happier, as shown in a study conducted by researchers from the University of British Columbia.  But there’s one thing hindering us from having enough free time: traffic. Specifically, too many cars that cause congestion on our main roads and parking lots. With all the time (and money) that we waste stalled along EDSA or queued up for parking, we could be doing so much more. So it’s high time that we do something about it.

A recent independent study commissioned by Uber Philippines revealed that the average Metro Manila driver wastes an average of 23 days a year, enduring slow traffic or looking for parking. That’s way too much time spent being stuck stressed on the road. And it’s not just the problem of car owners – commuters are affected, too. It has reached a point that traffic dictates what time we leave our homes or offices (or if we even leave our homes at all). It influences how often we decide to set meetings or dinners. It makes us question whether it’s worth it to take the long drive or commute to a destination a few cities away. Consider how this affects not just thousands of drivers, but also millions of commuters in Metro Manila. It’s enough to make one ask, “can’t things be better?” Our right to free time Traffic robs us of time, money, and the opportunity to make our lives better. According to the same Uber study, drivers spend a daily average of 66 minutes being stuck in traffic, and an additional 23 minutes looking for parking. Those 89 minutes could’ve been spent relaxing at home, being with friends and family, or doing something more productive. We could’ve also used all that time to give our brains a break. Throughout the day, we spend so much effort multi-tasking and getting things done as fast possible. But we also deserve to enjoy doing nothing occasionally. Research suggests that daydreaming can make you more creative and that giving your brain some ‘downtime’ can improve mental health, especially at work. Imagine a city where there is less traffic. Commuters and passengers can spend more time being better individuals and citizens – helping build better cities. Help unlock Metro Manila How can we solve the problem of traffic and lack of parking spaces? We can clamor for the government to improve public transportation and beef up road infrastructure. But can’t we also do our own part to beat traffic and unlock Metro Manila from congestion? For example, if ridesharing were to become widely adopted in the city, it could help take off up to 1 million cars on our roads, according to the Uber study. It would save us from having to build more parking spaces that would cover approximately twice the size of Makati City, just to accommodate the current volume of cars plying Metro Manila. When we free up our roads and parking spaces, we create room for progress in our cities – and more breathing space for our lives. Isn’t that better than letting traffic dictate how we should live? – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/185647-electric-jet-startup-uber-in-the-sky/","title":"Electric jet startup could become ‘Uber in the sky’","date":"Oct 18, 2017 11:19 AM PHT","snippet":"Israel-based startup Eviation Aircraft is working on a self-piloting, electric aircraft that, in the future, may be summoned with a smartphone","body":" CALIFORNIA, USA – Eviation Aircraft chief executive Omer Bar-Yohay pictures a day not too far away when summoning a bargain plane ride with a smartphone will be as easy as hailing Uber. The Israel-based startup working on a self-piloting, electric aircraft was at the Wall Street Journal D.Live (WSJDLive) conference Tuesday with a vision of “Uber meeting Tesla in the sky.” Bar-Yohay spoke of a future in which people could take Uber to a regional airport, then use another smartphone application to summon an Eviation electric plane to whisk them inexpensively to destinations hundreds of miles away. “What would happen if Uber meets Tesla in the sky?” Bar-Yohay asked rhetorically in an interview. “I think it makes super-commuting not so super anymore; you just go. That is the vision.” Eviation was at the Paris Air Show earlier this year with a small-scale prototype, and is intent on returning with a full-scale electric aircraft capable of carrying passengers in 2019. Funding takeoff Co-founders were at the Wall Street Journal technology conference to rustle up funding, with a goal of about $20 million. The startup founded about two years ago has been paying its way out of pocket, with some help from the Israeli government, going through about $10 million to date, according to Bar-Yohay. The new infusion of cash will be used as fuel in a race to be first to market with an electric airplane, this one designed to carry up to nine passengers and two crew members. “We have been sprinting full-speed for the past two years,” Bar-Yohay said. “I don’t think it is going to be winner takes all, but it will be winner takes a hell of a lot.” In his eyes, the appeal was obvious.  Instead of spending hours in a car traveling hundreds of miles, an electric plane summoned on-demand to a regional airport would get passengers to far-away destinations quickly and inexpensively. Eviation is out to take advantage of small, typically underutilized regional airports, making them lift-off spots for on-demand flights. “It needs to cost like a bus ticket,” Bar-Yohay said of such a service. “If you build the plane electric, like a Tesla, the cost of operating becomes ridiculously low.” “Never break” Electric components for airplanes are a fraction of the cost of comparable parts for engines in traditional aircraft, and are more reliable, according to Bar-Yohay. “You need to build machines that will never break; electric components are naturally like this,” Bar-Yohay said. Eviation plane batteries are spread out in more than a dozen places, so “no matter what hits you, some part of the aircraft will have the power to keep you going,” according to Bar-Yohay. The expected range of the Eviation plane will be about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers). The vision is to have the aircraft be self-piloting, so it could be summoned by an app or be available as desired for people who pool resources to buy one. “The market can become transportation for the masses,” Bar-Yohay said. “We are already getting used to not owning everything.” He notes that while society may be grappling with trusting self-driving cars, self-piloting aircraft have been around for decades. “We are not here to steal clients from Cessna or other aircraft makers,” Bar-Yohay said. “We are here to steal clients from Ford, GM, Tesla… because we can be cheaper per mile.” He expected the first-generation Eviation aircraft to cost $2.5 million to $3 million. Bar-Yohay noted there is competition forming already, including rideshare leader Uber researching vertical-takeoff vehicles to fly passengers short distances. “It’s the next blue ocean out there,” Bar-Yohay said of the on-demand flight market. “There is going to be room for everybody.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/180694-new-uber-chief-sees-ipo-future-report/","title":"New Uber chief sees IPO in its future – report","date":"Aug 31, 2017 9:23 AM PHT","snippet":"Freshly hired Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi meets with employees, promising to fight for the company and hinting a stock market debut is in its future","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Freshly hired Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi met with employees on Wednesday, August 30, promising to fight for the company and hinting a stock market debut is in its future.

Born in Iran, Khosrowshahi immigrated to the United States with his family as a child and became a citizen here. Expedia shares have climbed more than five-fold during the 12 years Khosrowshahi has been in charge of the travel services internet firm. “I don’t doubt his skills and his background in finance and hospitality, which is going to be very important,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Silicon Valley technology analyst firm Creative Strategies. “The only thing we don’t know is his ability to navigate some of the difficult settings around internal disciplinary issues and code of conduct that he will inherit.” Need for discipline  Khosrowshahi will have to address conflicts with regulators and taxi operators, a cut-throat company culture, sexism and board members feuding with investors over Kalanick.  Kalanick was the driving force behind Uber, taking a spur-of-moment idea and turning it into the world’s most valuable venture-funded tech startup. But his brash personality and freewheeling management style, which some argue set a tone inside the company, made him a liability as well as an asset to the global ridesharing giant, and in June he stepped down as chief executive. Good chief executives typically ramp up discipline and accountability in employee ranks upon taking charge at companies, so that would likely be among steps taken by Khosrowshahi at the Uber helm, according to Bajarin. “He is going to have to be highly aggressive in disciplining the company to stay on message and, more importantly, to stick within whatever the codes of conduct are,” the analyst said. Khosrowshahi has consistently scored well at website Glass Door, where executives and companies are anonymously rated by employees past and present, suggesting he might able to parent workers without alienating them. And, since Uber’s board members including Kalanick need a consensus to offer him the job as chief, he could have backing if he butts heads with those resentful the founder was pressured to step down. Is it enough? Khosroshahi’s strong background in travel and transportation should be a benefit when it comes to guiding Uber through its next phase of growth, according to Bajarin. Khosrowshahi’s experience includes jobs managing finance and strategy, having worked in executive positions at IAC/InterActiveCorp and the investment firm of Allen & Company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Khosrowshahi, 48, was born in Tehran to a prominent family behind a conglomerate with interests in food, trade, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and more.  His family immigrated to the United States prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1978. He attended college here, earning a university degree in electrical engineering. Expedia is based in the city of Bellevue, near Seattle. “If Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing – he’s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure, it will be with my best wishes,” Diller said in a letter included with a filing notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that Khosrowshahi had been offered the job as chief of Uber.

Just a day after announcing that they will be “recruiting and activating drivers” to “provide service in the gap left by Uber’s abrupt withdrawal,” the service is already trading jabs with the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Arcade City says in an online press release: “We forgive the LTFRB for ordering Arcade City to ‘cease operations’ before they understood what Arcade City is and is not, specifically how Arcade City is different from Uber.” On August 16, the LTFRB issued a cessation order, where it said that it considers Arcade City as another transport network company (TNC) and told them to stop bookings on the platform.  {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fltfrb.citizen.enforcer%2Fposts%2F1932143470360905&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”676″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source}   Arcade City contends that it “does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company.” LTFRB’s memorandum on TNCs defines the term as an “organization whether a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an internet-based technology application or digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.”  Arcade City explains further that while drivers may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, “Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers.” Arcade City calls the system a new “peer-to-peer model of ridesharing” – both riders and passengers find one another on the app, but Arcade City doesn’t set the rates like Uber or Grab does. Instead, according to their press release, “drivers are free to set their own rates.” Essentially, Arcade City is an open market, where buyers (riders) and vendors (drivers) strike deals.  How does it make its money? Arcade City takes 10% of the rides paid through the app according to a May 2016 article by U.S. website Vice. It also described Arcade City as the “black market Uber that runs on Facebook.” For a time, Arcade City connected riders and drivers via the Facebook group “Arcade City Austin/Request A Ride” before it relaunched its app. The Facebook group is still online, where Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David (pictured below) is one of 3 administrators.  {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D648737088616589%26set%3Da.100507176772919.707.100004409100811%26type%3D3&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”444″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} “Let’s play,” David says in his re-posting of Arcade City’s statement to the LTFRB: {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMillennialChris%2Fposts%2F908150226008606&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”483″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} David is a former Uber driver in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, who has been vocal against his distaste for corporate authority.  In an interview with cyrptocurrency site Coin Telegraph, David said that while government regulation is definitely an issue for drivers, an even bigger issue has been “drivers being mistreated by the distant corporate HQ.”  “Uber and Lyft are run by nerds in San Francisco. To them, drivers are just numbers. The fares that determine drivers’ livelihood are just levers to push and pull to maximize profit. The driver uproar and mass protests following last week’s rate decrease tells me this is the perfect time to launch a decentralized alternative,” said David, making references to Uber fare decreases in 2016 and his decentralized alternative Arcade City.  Mirroring the current situation in the Philippines, Arcade City emerged in Austin, Texas after Uber and Lyft withdrew.

But Grab and Uber would later admit they continued to accept new drivers despite this order, citing strong passenger demand. “Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers… we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],” Grab country head Brian Cu would later say.     July 11, 2017, order For defying its order to stop accepting new drivers, the LTFRB imposes a fine of P5 million each on Uber and Grab. Both companies comply with the order.   The LTFRB also orders both companies to remove all drivers with expired or no permits. Grab stops activating new drivers only on July 17, while Uber stops on July 18.   July 26, 2017 order  The LTFRB orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered in their systems after June 30, 2017.  It also orders both companies to provide a master list of all their drivers as of June 30, 2017. At the time of the issuance of the order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says they have only received Grab’s list. Uber communications head Cat Avelino says they will submit theirs on July 27.   August 1, 2017 show-cause order On August 1, the LTFRB issues a show-cause order to Uber, after it finds the TNC has continued to accept new drivers into its system despite being ordered to stop doing so last July 26. The board says Uber may lose its accreditation because of its action. Uber’s accreditation expires in August, while Grab’s expired last July 3 but hasn’t been renewed. Uber, however, denies the findings of the LTFRB, saying it has already suspended activations since July 19.    August 14, 2017 suspension order Nearly two weeks after it issued a show-cause order, the LTFRB suspends Uber’s operations for one month.  The board cites Uber’s post on its Twitter account last August 1, where the company said that applications for vehicles were “being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.” “The Respondent’s official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,” the LTFRB says. Uber posted a clarification on its Twitter account on August 2, saying it was also unable to accept applications for new vehicles. In its order, the LTFRB says Uber has accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27. The suspension order takes effect on Tuesday, August 15. Uber also releases a statement on its suspension of operations starting 6 am. (READ: Uber apologizes to LTFRB for ‘misunderstanding’) The order affects some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living.  Some 52,000 Grab vehicles remain operational. Since the suspension In the aftermath of the suspension, Uber requested that the penalty be changed to a fine. The LTFRB will hear Uber’s new request on August 23. On August 17, the LTFRB allowed Uber drivers to transfer to Grab and U-Hop for the meantime. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/178706-ltfrb-suspends-uber/","title":"Uber suspended for 1 month","date":"Aug 14, 2017 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) This comes after the transport network company defied the LTFRB order to stop accrediting more drivers","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Monday, August 14, ordered Uber operations suspended for one month. This comes after the ride-hailing company defied the board’s order, which directed all transport network companies (TNCs) to stop accrediting drivers into their systems starting July 26, 2017. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) The order will take effect on Tuesday, August 15, halting the operation of some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living. The LTFRB said Uber was ordered to stop accepting drivers into their system to avoid raising false expectations that these drivers can engage in the public transportation service without the necessary permits from the board. But in a post on its Twitter account last August 1, Uber said that applications for vehicles are “being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.” “The Respondent’s official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,” the LTFRB said. The LTFRB also noted that Uber had accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27, one of which was a motor vehicle registered in the name of the board. While it acknowledged the concerns of the riding public, the board said it was confronted with the issue of striking a balance between innovation and laws governing public transport services. But the LTFRB said that Uber’s actions were “not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation, but it is about unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country, thereby compromising sound business practices.” Aside from imposing the one-month suspension, the LTFRB warned that Uber will be held responsible for all accredited vehicles found accepting passengers during the suspension period. It also “strongly recommended” that Uber gives financial assistance to its peer-operators who would be affected since the latter “would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions of respondent Uber.” The order was signed by LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III and board members Ronaldo Corpus and Aileen Lourdes Lizada.  In a text message to Rappler, Uber communications head Cat Avelino said they are “studying” the order. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/176536-grab-new-financing-didi-chuxing-softbank/","title":"Grab to raise $2.5B in new financing","date":"Jul 24, 2017 1:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The Singapore-based firm says it will use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay","body":" SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said Monday, July 24, it expects to raise $2.5 billion in financing, mostly from China’s Didi Chuxing and Japan’s Softbank, as it strengthens its lead over rival Uber. Didi, China’s ride-hailing leader, and mobile giant SoftBank will invest up to $2.0 billion while $500 million is expected to come from other new and existing investors. Grab said it amounts to the largest single financing in Southeast Asia. Both Didi and SoftBank are already investors in Grab. The Singapore-based firm said it would use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay. “We are delighted to deepen our strategic partnership with Didi and SoftBank,” said Anthony Tan, Grab’s group chief executive and co-founder. “With their support, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for Southeast Asia.” Grab said it has a market share of 95% in third-party taxi-hailing and 71% in private-vehicle hailing in Southeast Asia, far ahead of main rival Uber. Grab offers private car, taxi, motorbike and carpooling services in seven countries and 65 cities across Southeast Asia, a region of 650 million people. “Starting with transport, Grab is establishing a clear leadership in Southeast Asia’s internet economy based on its market position, superior technology, and truly local insight,” said Didi founder and chief executive Cheng Wei in a statement. “Both companies look forward to working together with communities and policymakers across Asia to fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities in the upcoming transportation revolution.” Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of SoftBank, described Grab as “a tremendously exciting company in a dynamic and promising region.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/175705-life-before-uber-roundtable/","title":"ROUNDTABLE: Life #BeforeUBER","date":"Jul 18, 2017 11:16 AM PHT","snippet":"What was life like #BeforeUBER?

Aquino made the call a day after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slapped a P5-million fine each on Grab and Uber for letting some of their drivers operate without permits. “We need to provide the commuting public with better options and alternatives to improve their daily commuting experience. The government must work with rideshare companies that share this mission and develop suitable standards and requirements for them,” Aquino said in a statement on Wednesday, July 12. “I urge the LTFRB to address this issue of penalties for rideshare companies. Then we can focus on passing legislation to develop the industry and to ensure these new transport networks are held accountable for offenses,” he added. Last year, Aquino filed Senate Bill 696 or the Rideshare Support Company Act, which seeks “to encourage new, affordable, and safe transportation options and ensure the safety of the riding public by imposing safety and financial responsibility standards and requirements.” “In any industry, increased competition often leads to improved quality, improved service, and lower prices for consumers. For the commuting public, this is a change they have long clamored for,” the senator said in his explanatory note to SB 696. The LTFRB said it considered public sentiment in dealing with the rideshare companies, as shown by its decision to impose hefty fines on Grab and Uber. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in LTFRB MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber’s operations should have been shut down. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Tuesday that the interest of the riding public “overrides” the provision. On Wednesday, Aquino renewed his push for SB 696 which seeks to institutionalize a regulatory framework for the new type of service. SB 696 clarifies the regulations governing transportation network companies or rideshare support sompanies (RSCs), and rideshare network drivers and vehicles. Under the proposal,  RSCs must obtain a certificate of accreditation from the LTFRB before getting an authority for a qualified rideshare network driver after a thorough background check and submission of required documents. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/175117-growing-chorus-denounces-sexist-silicon-valley-culture/","title":"Growing chorus denounces sexist Silicon Valley culture","date":"Jul 9, 2017 2:06 PM PHT","snippet":"Now increasing numbers of women are going public with complaints of gender-based discrimination – in some cases leading men to step down","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – A growing chorus of voices denouncing sexist culture is echoing through male-dominated Silicon Valley, knocking a number of internet industry executives from their perches. Accusations concerning the lack of women in tech jobs and unfair, or downright crude, treatment endured by some in the industry have simmered for years, occasionally reaching a boil. Now increasing numbers of women are going public with complaints of gender-based discrimination – in some cases leading men to step down. Uber’s embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick resigned last month, yielding to pressure from investors seeking to clean up the company’s allegedly toxic corporate culture. His departure capped a rocky period for the global ridesharing giant, which has been roiled by disturbing reports of cutthroat workplace conditions, harassment and discrimination. Before Kalanick’s departure, Uber said it had fired 20 people after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior and bullying. ‘Despicably unfair’ June also saw venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck take an indefinite leave of absence from Binary Capital in Silicon Valley in the face of allegations he made sexual advances towards female entrepreneurs interested in funding. “To say I’m sorry about my behavior is a categorical understatement,” Caldbeck said in released statement. “The power dynamic that exists in venture capital is despicably unfair.” In his statement, Caldbeck referred to the influence gap between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs as “frightening,” and called the environment “gender-hostile.” A few days later, tech sector investor Dave McClure confessed to being “a creep” for making “advances towards multiple women in work-related situations, where it was clearly inappropriate.” “I selfishly took advantage of those situations where I should have known better,” McClure said in an apology posted online. “My behavior was inexcusable and wrong.” The public apologies came in the wake of a New York Times article in which a dozen women in the technology world denounced what they saw as a culture of harassment, some pointing specifically at McClure or Caldbeck. “It’s important to expose the type of behavior that’s been reported in the last few weeks, so the community can recognize and address these problems,” Stitch Fix founder and chief executive Katrina Lake was quoted as saying in the Times story. Double-whammy Women in Silicon Valley face a double-whammy, said French entrepreneur Eliane Fiolet, because the tech companies as well as the world of finance here are male dominated. Fiolet – who settled here and co-founded successful technology website Ubergizmo – estimated that women represent a scant 10 percent or so of the tech sector. Concerns about a lack of diversity in Silicon Valley have caused tech giants to implement programs to cultivate richer gender and racial mixes on company campuses. Google told Agence France-Presse that in the past 3 years at Google, the proportion of women in tech roles at the company has grown from 17% to 20%, and that of women in leadership roles has risen from 21% to 25%.  Overall, women make up 31% of Google employees and nearly half of the management team, according to the company. “Improving the representation of women in technical roles is something the entire tech industry is working toward,” said Eileen Naughton, Google’s vice president of “people operations.” Google policies ban discrimination and harassment, with punishments including termination. New hires are also given “unbiasing training” during orientation at the company. “It’s important to foster a culture where women feel empowered to speak up when they’ve been discriminated against or harassed,” Naughton said. Blurred lines Katheline Coleman, who came to Silicon Valley from Canada in 2013, told Agence France-Presse she was struck by how much of a man’s world it was. “What is apparent now with all recent testimonies from female founders is that there is definitely a blurred line between business meetings and happy hours,” Coleman said, referring to after-work social gatherings that typically involve alcohol. “These dire happy hours have been a place of choice of rogue VCs and sexual predators.” Debate over gender equality in Silicon Valley flared up in 2012 when Ellen Pao sued over allegations of gender discrimination. Following a public trial in San Francisco a jury rejected those charges against a prominent venture capital firm, in a case seen as a proxy trial of Silicon Valley sex bias. But Fiolet reasoned that taking concerns public – even without pursuing cases in court – can be effective because it can prompt boycotts in an internet industry where public image is important to keeping users. A #DumpUber campaign, for example, gained traction after a former engineer there made a public grievance in a blog post – significantly adding to the pressure for change at the company. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/174701-road-revolution-commuting-with-tech/","title":"Road revolution: How Filipinos commute with tech","date":"Jul 4, 2017 8:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Technology has revolutionized road travel in the metro, making our everyday commute a little bit more bearable","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Traffic in Metro Manila is the bane of every commuter’s existence.

These options can be time-consuming and expensive. On bad days, say, the evening rush hour made even worse by a sudden downpour, one can spend hours on the road just driving or trying to get a ride. Today’s technology has made it possible for reliable transportation options in the city to be more accessible for anybody, anywhere at just a tap of a smartphone. Thus, Filipinos have embraced ridesharing services such as Uber, which offer easy access to rides, with the safety, reliability, and convenience that private cars offer (without actually having to acquire one). It’s especially useful for those who live in areas that aren’t along routes of major public transport options. Many have become so reliant on the app, especially since unlike other ridesharing services, Uber doesn’t reveal trip destinations or travel time to drivers before pick-up. This ensures that all riders have equal access to the service.  Rappler and Uber Philippines launched the #BeforeUBER campaign last June 21 to crowdsource stories about commuting life before the app arrived in the Philippines four years ago.  Uber riders and partners (as passengers and drivers are called) were eager to share their stories.

Kalanick’s resignation on Tuesday, June 20, was triggered by after pressure from the company’s top investors, the New York Times reported Wednesday, June 21. This was later confirmed by Uber to multiple US news outlets. The investors, the report said, made the demand to Kalanick in a letter entitled “Moving Uber Forward,” which said the company must have a leadership change and that he leave. “I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in a statement to the Times. The Uber board, meanwhile, said in a statement to the paper that Kalanick made a “bold decision” signifying his “devotion and love for Uber.” “By stepping away, he’s taking the time to heal from his personal tragedy while giving the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber’s history,” referencing the recent death of his mother in a boating accident last May. He will still remain part of the company’s board of directors, the report added. He had earlier announced on June 13 that he will be taking an indefinite leave of absence, as the tech company is embroiled in a series of controversies over its leadership and company culture. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination. It also faces questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Earlier this month the group, based in San Francisco, parted ways with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had reportedly been linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. A week earlier Uber said it had fired 20 people after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior and bullying. Uber also this month released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses. The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors”. – with reports from Agence France-Presse / Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/172876-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-leave-absence/","title":"Embattled Uber CEO Kalanick to take leave of absence","date":"Jun 14, 2017 2:16 AM PHT","snippet":"'If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,' the Uber CEO writes in an email to employees","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick announced Tuesday, June 13, he would take an indefinite leave of absence as the embattled ridesharing giant unveiled steps to reform a corporate culture marred by a series of embarrassing revelations. “It’s hard to put a timeline on this – it may be shorter or longer than we might expect,” the 40-year-old Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees. “If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.” Kalanick said one of the reasons for his stepping aside was the recent death of his mother, explaining that “I need to take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve” and “to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.” Uber simultaneously released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses. The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values because it is vital that they reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.” It said this should be based on “values that are more inclusive and contribute to a collaborative environment, including emphasizing teamwork and mutual respect, and incorporating diversity and inclusiveness as a key cultural value, not just as an end in itself, but as a fundamental aspect of doing good business.” The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination, and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. Uber has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture. It also faces questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/169134-grab-express-rider-killed-quiapo-blast/","title":"Grab rider was delivery boy killed in Quiapo blast, company says","date":"May 7, 2017 3:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab: 'We are deeply saddened the incident took the lives of two civilians, including one of our GrabExpress partners'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab said the unidentified motorcycle-riding delivery boy who died in the Quiapo explosion on Saturday, May 6, was one of their own.  “We are deeply saddened the incident took the lives of two civilians, including one of our GrabExpress partners,” Grab Philippines said in a statement on Sunday, May 7.  Two people died in a blast near the Manila Golden Mosque in Quiapo on Saturday. The casualties were the Grab driver and the man who received the package that contained the bomb, a certain Mohamad Bainga.  The company did not name the driver. Grab is a ridesharing company that partners with owners of vehicles, including motorcycles, who agree to drive for customers who book rides through a mobile application. GrabExpress is dedicated to the delivery of packages.  CCTV footage of the explosion obtained by Rappler showed the motorcycle rider appearing to be asking for directions before proceeding to an area along Norzagaray Street in Quiapo, where the explosion happened a few seconds later. Grab vowed to cooperate with authorities. “We are one with authorities in pursuing justice for those who needlessly lost their lives and were hurt. We pledge our full support and cooperation in the conduct of their investigation,” the company said. “Grab and our GrabExpress partners will remain vigilant and work with the police to take extra care in areas that may be identified as at risk for such incidences,” Grab added. A second blast occurred two hours later, very near the site where the two men died. It injured police officers deployed to process the crime scene. Saturday’s twin blasts happened a week after another bombing incident – along Quezon Boulevard, also in Quiapo – where 14 people were hurt.   – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/167086-asean-brands-that-have-gone-global/","title":"12 ASEAN brands that have gone global","date":"Apr 24, 2017 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Some familiar brands in the Southeast Asian region are making their mark around the world","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Jollibee, San Miguel Beer, Potato Corner – these are some familiar homegrown brands for Filipinos. But these proudly Pinoy brands are fast becoming known in Southeast Asia, with some even venturing beyond the region and bringing their products to the global market. Several brands from neighboring countries like Singapore and Malaysia are also making waves – from Grab, Malaysia’s ride-hailing service that rivals the US-based Uber, to Singapore bakery BreadTalk, with its signature open-plan kitchen that has established an international presence. Rappler lists down some regional brands in Asia that are making their mark around the world.  1. Grab (Malaysia) Grab – then known as GrabTaxi – was a gamechanger in the ride-hailing service industry when it first launched in 2012. Following in the success of the San Francisco-based Uber, the app makes it easy for passengers to hail taxis with just a few taps on their smartphones. The idea for Grab came about following a conversation between co-founder Anthony Tan and an Indonesian friend about the difficulty of hailing taxis in Malaysia. Tan, then a student at Harvard, worked with fellow Malaysian classmate Tan Hooi Ling to create a business plan for what would soon be launched in Malaysia as MyTeksi. The mobile app aimed to connect taxi drivers to passengers efficiently, making it easy for riders to get a ride and for drivers to be assured of their next passenger without aimlessly roaming around the city. (READ: GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes) Since its launch in Malaysia in June 2012, the app has launched in 6 more countries around the region: the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Manila saw the app’s launch in August 2013; it has since expanded to include other Philippine cities such as Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. Aside from booking taxis, the Grab app also offers booking of private cars, a ridesharing carpool service, and a motorcycle delivery service.  2. British India (Malaysia) Established in 1994, British India is a fashion label calling Malaysia – not Britain or India – as its home. It was founded by Pat Liew, who has more than 30 years of experience in the retail industry under her belt. Upon launching, the colonial era-inspired fashion brand had a cheeky tagline: “Presenting British India. An era of racism, oppression, injustice and nice outfits.” Within months since its launch, the brand came out with 4 outlets in Malaysia and 4 in Singapore by the mid-1990s. The Singapore launch, Liew said, was a testbed for the brand’s readiness for a global presence. Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the Malaysian brand has expanded into other countries in Asia, with more than 40 outlets in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.  3. BreadTalk (Singapore) BreadTalk entered the Philippine market in 2004, opening its first branch at Glorietta 4 mall in Makati City and enticing customers with its unique open-plan kitchen that offered a glimpse of how the bread was made. The Singapore-based brand was founded in April 2000, entering Singapore’s bakery industry with products that catered to traditional tastes as well as promoting and creating new varieties of bread. The bakery often has customized product offerings to fit the local flavors or preferences in their outlets in the region. They also launch new products to fit in with seasonal festivals and trends. The company opened its first overseas outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003. Since then, it has expanded to more than 900 outlets in 17 countries. Its brand portfolio also includes Toast Box, Food Republic, and Ramen Play. It manages the Singapore franchise of the Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung as well.  4. TWG Tea Company (Singapore) Luxury brand TWG Tea (which stands for The Wellbeing Group) was founded by Taha Bouqdib, Maranda Barnes, and Rith Aum-Stievenard in 2008, with Singapore as the launch base of the brand. The famous teashop, which brands itself as an upscale tea salon, offers more than 1,000 fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, as well as a variety of tea patisseries and delicacies. The “1837” in the company’s branding doesn’t refer to the date it was established, but refers to the year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore, when the island became a trading post for teas. The luxury brand quickly became well-known worldwide, with its teas being served in some of Singapore’s best hotels and in the front cabins of Singapore Airlines. Food chain Dean & Deluca also brought the brand to US markets, while Harrods brought the brand to London.   5. Potato Corner (Philippines) Known for its flavored french fries, this homegrown brand has been in the industry for 24 years, with more than 500 branches in the Philippines and several more in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Panama. Potato Corner opened its first kiosk outlet back in 1992. Two years since it started business, the brand opened 70 outlets across the country. It opened its first overseas outlet in 2006 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and entered the US market in 2012. By 2016, the brand had 800 stores and had begun operating in Thailand.   6. Jollibee (Philippines) Filipinos love Jollibee. And so does the rest of the world.  The fast food giant behind well-loved food products such as Chicken Joy and Yumburger traces its beginnings to 1975, when Filipino-Chinese founder Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice cream shop in Cubao, Quezon City. The ice cream shop would later become Jollibee’s first outlet, and would become the bedrock of the company’s rapid expansion for years to come. Jollibee boasts a presence of nearly 978 stores in the Philippines and 80 stores internationally to date. The company also operates other fast food chains including Chowking, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, and Red Ribbon. Jollibee has established an international presence in Canada, the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Brunei, Oman, and Qatar. The group caters not only to Filipinos working overseas but also to locals, who form part of the snaking lines that greet Jollibee’s store openings outside the Philippines. The company withstood the entrance of McDonald’s to the Philippine market in 1981 as it catered to distinct Filipino tastes, setting it apart from the international fast food giant.    7. URC (Philippines) Tracing its beginnings to as early as 1954, Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was started by Filipino businessman John Gokongwei, who learned to do business as a trade importer during World War II and the postwar years. The company started out as a corn mill under the name Universal Corn Products. This business would become the foundation for URC as it is known today – a household name in the snacks industry, agro-industrial operations, and commodities distribution. URC products are distributed under the company’s brands including Jack ‘n Jill, Robina Farms, Robichem, and Universal Corn Products. The company offerings include snacks, beverages, meat and poultry products, and commodities like sugar and flour. URC has expanded beyond the Philippines, distributing its products to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  8. San Miguel (Philippines) Established in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, San Miguel is Southeast Asia’s first brewery and the Philippines’ largest brewery to date. The Philippine brand is also part of one of the country’s largest conglomerates: San Miguel Corporation, which has businesses ranging from food, power, oil, and infrastructure to airlines, beverages, and packaging.   San Miguel has been under the control of prominent Filipino families such as the Zobel de Ayalas, Roxases, and Sorianos. It is currently largely owned and operated by Ramon Ang and Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. The company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Hong Kong, China, and Australia.  San Miguel exports its beer to major markets around the world and is consistently part of the top 10 bestselling beer brands worldwide. Its brands include Red Horse, Golden Eagle, and the company’s namesake beer products such as household brands San Miguel Pale Pilsen and San Miguel Light.  9. Integrated Micro-Electronics (Philippines) One of the Philippines’ oldest and largest conglomerates, the Ayala group has expanded its presence beyond the country, not only in the region but also globally. The group’s largest international operations is under the company Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated (IMI), a leading provider in electronics manufacturing services and power semiconductor assembly and tests services. Established in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins Incorporated, its services cater to a number of industries including telecommunications infrastructure, consumer electronics, solar energy, automotives, medical machines, and storage devices. IMI’s global presence includes manufacturing operations in China, Singapore, the United States, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Czech Republic. The company also has sales operations in Japan and Germany. The company recently marked its entrance into the aerospace industry and defense sector this year with its acquisition of STI Enterprises, a UK-based electronics manufacturing services company.  10. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) Another Filipino conglomerate, the Aboitiz group, has established an international presence with Pilmico Foods Corporation. Pilmico operates animal farms and also produces and distributes flour and animal feeds. The company was incorporated in 1958 as Central Philippine Milling Corporation by brothers Ramon and Vidal Aboitiz. In 1962, the company partnered with The Pillsbury Company of Minnesota, USA to establish operations in Mindanao. The company changed its name to Pilmico Food Corporation in 1990, upon the sale of all its shares to Aboitiz & Company. The company’s brand profile includes Wooden Spoon flours, Home Style, and Pilmico.  In 2013, Pilmico started exporting its products to the ASEAN market, prompting it to establish operations in Indonesia and Vietnam. At present, Pilmico flour is exported to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Hong Kong. Its feeds business also currently exports to Cambodia.  11. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (Malaysia) Founded by Chinese-Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts opened its first location in April 1971 in Singapore. Inspired by the legendary land found in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton, the Shangri-La group draws from the description of the land being an earthly paradise.  The group, now based in Hong Kong, operates 5-star luxury hotels and resorts in several locations and is famous for its world-renowned hospitality and services. According to its company website, the group’s brand portfolio includes Shangri-La, Kerry, and Hotel Jen and Traders branded properties.  Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts has a presence in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean islands, with over 40,000 rooms.    12. J.Co Donuts (Indonesia) The popular donut brand finds its roots in Indonesia, where it was established in 2005 by businessman Johnny Andrean. Known for its unique flavor offerings, the company opened its first outlet the same year.  In a little over 10 years, the company now operates over 214 stores in Indonesia and has expanded its presence to other countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  J.Co’s donuts are known for their high quality toppings like matcha green tea, premium dark chocolate, and roasted almonds. The brand is also popular for its playful product names and has expanded into other offerings such as frozen yogurt, beverages, and sandwiches. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/163184-secret-uber-software-steers-drivers-stings/","title":"Secret Uber software steers drivers from stings","date":"Mar 4, 2017 10:22 AM PHT","snippet":"'This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,' an Uber spokesperson says in an email reply to an Agence France-Presse inquiry","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber on Friday, March 3, acknowledged the use of a secret software program to steer drivers away from trouble, including sting operations by local authorities to catch law-breakers. In the latest in a streak of damaging news for the ridesharing giant, Uber came forward about its “Greyball” software after a New York Times report which said the program aimed to deceive authorities in markets around the world. According to an Uber statement, the tool was used in cities where it was not banned from operating, and the main intent was to protect drivers from disruption by competitors using the smartphone application to interfere instead of summon legitimate rides. “This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,” an Uber spokesperson said in an email reply to an Agence France-Presse inquiry. “Whether that’s people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret ‘stings’ meant to entrap drivers.” Uber said the program was used in locations where drivers feared for their safety, and “rarely” to avoid law enforcement. The New York Times report, which said Greyball was used in several countries, cited interviews with current and former employees whose names were cloaked. The report said Greyball was part of a part of a broader program created to reveal people trying to us Uber in “violation of terms of service” and had the blessing of the company’s legal team. According to the report, the program raised ethical and potential concerns, and had been a closely guarded secret in Uber’s toolbox as it expanded around the world, clashing with regulators and traditional taxi groups. Adding to Uber woes The “Greyball” disclosure comes as accusations of sexism, cut-throat management, and a toxic work environment have Uber trying to pull its image out of a skid as competition revs in the on-demand ride market. Uber chief Travis Kalanick this week apologized, acknowledging that “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” after a video showed him verbally abusing a driver for the service. The incident which circulated on social media was another hit for the image of the global ridesharing giant, which faces accusations of sexual harassment and a lawsuit contending it misappropriated Google’s self-driving car technology. In the message to employees later, Kalanick wrote “To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement.” Uber is one of the largest investor-backed start-ups with a valuation estimated at $68 billion, and has operations in dozens of countries and hundreds of cities, even as it battles regulators and an established taxi industry. Kalanick also faced criticism for agreeing to be part of a business advisory panel for President Donald Trump, but then quit the panel amid a campaign by Trump opponents to delete the application. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/163156-uber-self-driving-car-manila/","title":"Want your self-driving car in Manila? Book an Uber someday","date":"Mar 3, 2017 7:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber won't say no to a challenge but engineering manager Matt Sweeney says the technology has to get smarter first before it can be deployed in chaotic traffic","body":" CALIFORNIA, USA – There is no such thing as a crazy idea for Uber. The US-based ridesharing application that got thousands of car owners around the world to share their vehicles with strangers is now working hard to include self-driving vehicles to its fleet. “The way we think about it is we want self-driving cars to be deployed as part of a fleet of shared vehicles that operate for anyone to use,” Uber Transportation Policy and Research chief Andrew Salzberg told a summit attended by Rappler in San Francisco this week.  But will driverless cars come to Metro Manila roads? It will take some time, but Uber won’t say no to a challenge.  “We would absolutely love to,” a smiling Uber engineering manager Matt Sweeney told Rappler. He showed journalists from Asia and Latin America the self-driving trucks of Otto, the startup that Uber acquired to joing the push for self-driving cars.  But first, Sweeney said the new technology has to get smarter first. “We are very much at the beginning stage of this technology. We will focus on easier technical parts of this broader problem. The most complex, the most chaotic traffic cities are very challenging. The complexity ramps up from highway to a simple suburb to cities with relatively low congestion. But we want to bring it everywhere eventually,” Sweeney said. Uber is among those testing self-driving cars on US roads. There’s a lot of issues as expected with new technoogies and the Congress, regulatory bodies, and courts have been watching closely watching the developments. In San Francisco, self-driving cars stand out on the streets with silver cylinders rotating wildly on top of the cars serving as scanners to capture high-definition images of the streets. They’re fed to supercomputers, the brains of the self-driving car, that build 3D maps real time while sending instructions to the car.  Uber is testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, where it is teaching the technology to navigate during the four different seasons. Uber’s determination appears unaffected by the lawsuit filed by a Google subsidiary accusing Uber of stealing the technology. It is also working to get a permit to conduct tests again in California. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/163065-uber-movement-manila-traffic-woes/","title":"Uber gives PH gov’t access to tons of data on Manila traffic","date":"Mar 2, 2017 7:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Manila is one of 4 cities around the world where the company piloted its new program Uber Movement, where historical data on traffic will be made publicly available for free","body":" CALIFORNIA, USA – US-based ridesharing application Uber shared with the Philippine government its rich data on traffic in Manila, hoping to help ease the nightmarish clogging of its roads.  Rappler learned that Manila is one of 4 cities around the world where the company piloted its new program Uber Movement, where historical data on traffic will be made publicly available for free. The others are Boston, Sydney, and Washington D.C. Rappler was invited to the Future of Cities summit organized by Uber at its headquarters in San Francisco.  The country’s lead agency on traffic, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), is one of the few who have gained initial access to the program that was launched in January although product manager Jordan Gilbertson said they will roll out data on other cities soon.  “The root of problem is there is insufficient data to make informed decisions. The question that we put before the crew was: How can we prompt cities to make the types pf data-driven decisions using the resources that Uber has available,” said Gilbertson.  Uber head of transportation policy and research Andrew Salzberg said there’s a lot of interest in Manila because of the challenging traffic situation and the availability of reliable partners who can implement projects on the ground. In 2015, navigation app Waze gave Metro Manila the notoriety of having the “worst traffic in the world.” It was based on the rating of Waze users meaning Filipino drivers have the most complaints about the roads compared to other nationalities using the mobile application. Uber Movement aggreggates data collected every day to show how much time it takes to ply certain routes depending on several factors such as days of the week, time of the day, or activities undertaken in the area. “By delivering all these insights to cities, we can start to give back to communiites in a meaningful way while also solving these very real problems that are impactings the cities in which we operation. This has been the core of what has become Uber Movement,” said Gilbertson. Uber Movement can show how a baseball game, closures of certain routes, or maintenance operations, for example, affect total travel time to and from certain locations. Uber envisions this data could help governments make informed decisions when they draft transportation policies.  Salzberg gave assurances data that the privacy of Uber individual users are protected. Only aggregate data on travel times are shared and no demographics are revealed.  “We’re showing aggregated trips happening between two zones and the average time, bucketing them by hours. You cannot get individual trips here, which is important. If we show individual trips, there is a lot of privacy implcations to that and it’s not necessarily as easily useful for the kind of traffic planning pruposes we’re building for here.,” said Salzberg. Gilbertson said they were conscious to exclude collection of data that may violate data privacy laws. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/159997-starbucks-airbnb-pledge-support-migrants-immigration-ban/","title":"Starbucks, Airbnb pledge support for migrants after Trump ban","date":"Jan 30, 2017 6:24 PM PHT","snippet":"Starbucks says it planned to take on 10,000 refugees worldwide over the next 5 years in response to Trump's decree.

Trump’s measures suspend the arrival of all refugees for at least 120 days, Syrian refugees indefinitely, and bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 3 months, affecting many companies’ plans. (READ: Muslims barred from flights to U.S., as others detained) With lives plunged in chaos, Starbucks said it planned to take on 10,000 refugees worldwide over the next 5 years in response to Trump’s decree. “I write to you today with deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise,” Starbucks chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz said in a letter to employees posted on the company’s website Sunday. “We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question.”  Schultz, a Democratic Party supporter, said his company had been in touch with employees affected by the Republican president’s executive order signed Friday. The CEO said the refugee hires would be fleeing war, persecution and discrimination in the 75 countries where the company operates – with a particular focus on those who “have served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel,” alluding to Iraq and Afghanistan. Airbnb said it would offer free accommodation “to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US.” “Open doors brings all of US together,” tweeted company CEO Brian Chesky, asking those stranded by Trump’s ban to contact him for a place to stay. “Closing doors further divides US.” “Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right, and we must stand with those who are affected.” ‘Building bridges, not walls’ The company will utilise its disaster response program, which connects hosts willing to offer their space to displaced people. Some 80% of the online rental platform’s listings are outside of the United States. Airbnb also has measures in place to ensure housing for those in areas where no hosts are providing free shelter. Schultz of Starbucks also defended Mexico, which Trump has said will have to pay for a wall along its long and porous border with the United States to deter immigrants, perhaps by imposing a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports. “Building bridges, not walls, with Mexico,” he wrote, voicing support for the country that has provided Starbucks with coffee for three decades and where nearly 600 Starbucks coffee shops employ 7,000 people. “We stand ready to help and support our Mexican customers, partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions, immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of Americans. “But we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same.” ‘Unwavering commitment’  Other companies also expressed solidarity and pledged hard cash. Lyft, a US ridesharing company, said it would donate $1-million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has issued lawsuits against Trump’s measures. The company’s competitor Uber – which had come under fire on social media for continuing to operate during a New York taxi strike against the immigration ban – said it was committed to assisting drivers affected by the restrictions.

The LTFRB had reportedly gotten complaints about price surges ranging from P2,000 to P28,000 this holiday season. In the Philippines, vehicles using applications such as Grab or Uber are categorized as transport network vehicle services (TNVS). All vehicles must get permits from the LTFRB, which also grants and denies permits for taxis, buses, and the like. Grab had earlier announced it would put a cap to its pricing from December 14 to January 30. Pricing, permits Uber Philippines had recently changed its method of informing riders about the price of trips. Just before the holiday rush, Uber removed the surge notification – which tells passengers how much fares have increased from the norm – and replaced it with an “upfront” fare similary to Grab’s. But Uber’s upfront fare could still change, depending on several factors such as a route change, the addition of multiple stops, or the worsening of traffic during the trip. The LTFRB said Uber did not consult the regulatory body over the “upfront fares based on predictions.” In its statement, however, Uber said it has been in “frequent dialogues with the LTFRB” since TNVS applications were suspended in July 2016. Uber said it wanted “to find workable solutions to meet the increasing demand for ridesharing options and avoid price increases brought about by disproportionate supply and demand, longer wait times for riders, or having no available cars on the road.” “We have seen increasing demand for Uber rides this holiday season, yet vehicle availability remained stagnant. We are optimistic that the LTFRB will soon lift the suspension on new TNVS applications, allowing more people to enjoy safe, reliable and affordable rides in the Philippines,” the tech company said. It added: “In the meantime, we will continue working on making prices as affordable as possible in compliance with the LTFRB’s statement [on December 24].” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/156569-ltfrb-grab-cap-holiday-rates/","title":"Heeding LTFRB’s call, Grab puts cap on holiday rates","date":"Dec 25, 2016 3:41 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB, meanwhile, gives Uber 48 hours to follow suit","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In compliance with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order to stop “unreasonable” price surging, ride-hailing company Grab is putting a cap on its ride rates until January 30. “To ensure that the riding public will get the best service and rates during this season, Grab is voluntarily placing a cap in compliance with the LTFRB, on our rates starting December 24 to January 30,” Grab said in a statement. This is after the land transport regulator warned transport network companies Uber and Grab they face suspension or cancellation of their accreditation should the “unreasonable surges” in rates persist this holiday season. The LTFRB said it received several complaints about Uber and Grab surges ranging from P2,000 to P28,000 this holiday season. “For our passengers, may we request that you double check your pickup and dropoff points before confirming your booking. We are ready to refund rides, upon verification, should they be charged for any incorrect rate caused by a system error,” Grab said without disclosing the maximum price for ride rates. Last 2 days for Uber On Sunday, December 25, the LTFRB acknowledged Grab’s immediate action on the warning and called on Uber to follow suit immediately. “Calling Uber, your 25 December 2016 statement does not heed LTFRB’s directives. Please be reminded that LTFRB is your regulatory body. LTFRB is giving you 48 hours to comply,” the land transport regulator said in a statement. In its statement, Uber did not make any promises about limiting the price surge this holiday season. (READ: Only 1 in 20 trips affected by fare shock – Uber PH) “Uber shares LTFRB’s mission of providing safe, reliable, and affordable transport solutions for the benefit of the riding public.

Uber cited the suspension of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications since July as a reason for the price surge. “Since the suspension of TNVS applications in July, we have been in frequent dialogues with the LTFRB to find workable solutions to meet the increasing demand for ridesharing options and avoid price increases brought about by disproportionate supply and demand, longer wait times for riders, or having no available cars on the road,” Uber said.

Uber taking its autonomous cars off San Francisco streets ended a clash between the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the on-demand ride service. “We have stopped our self-driving pilot in California as the DMV has revoked the registrations for our self-driving cars,” San Francisco-based Uber said in a statement emailed to AFP. “We’re now looking at where we can redeploy these cars but remain 100%committed to California and will be redoubling our efforts to develop workable statewide rules.” Self-driving Uber cars were being tested here in defiance of a state order to halt the program. The ridesharing giant disputed the interpretation by the DMV that the cars require a special permit, saying they had the same autonomy capabilities as Tesla cars which have an optional “autopilot” feature. Anthony Levandowski, Uber’s vice president for advanced technologies, said last week that as with the Teslas, the cars driven by Uber still have a driver capable of assuming control at any time. “We respectfully disagree with the California DMV’s interpretation of autonomous regulations, in particular that Uber needs a permit to operate in San Francisco,” Levandowski told a conference call with journalists. “While these are considered state of the art today, they still require monitoring by a vehicle operator at all times.” He argued that statewide rules regarding self-driving cars were being unevenly applied. Levandowski said at the time that Uber hoped to convince the DMV that its autonomous cars were no different from Tesla’s, which allow a driver to turn over many operations to an onboard computer but still need a human behind the wheel. “We have a person sitting in the driver’s seat, and there’s also a person next to them looking at the system and trying to confirm that everything is going well,” he said. “They are able to override and take control of the vehicle at any time.” State regulators countered that the testing program lacked an autonomous vehicle testing permit required to protect public safety. During Uber’s brief standoff with the DMV, reports hit that one of the cars had failed to stop for a red light, and that the vehicles were not giving proper deference to bicycle lanes when making turns. Backers of autonomous vehicles say the technology can reduce more than 90% of accidents, which mostly are due to human error. Since its debut in 2010, Uber has grown into a worldwide phenomenon despite regulatory hurdles and resistance from traditional taxi operators.  In its latest funding round, Uber was valued at more than $60 billion, but has racked up losses at it expands and takes on competitors such as Lyft. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/146229-uber-driverless-car-service/","title":"Uber launches groundbreaking driverless car service","date":"Sep 14, 2016 6:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Four of the Ford Fusion hybrids with their ungainly rooftop load of technology will be deployed to select customers on Wednesday, with the company showing at least a dozen more ready to put on the streets","body":" PITTSBURGH, USA – Uber launched a groundbreaking driverless car service on Wednesday, September 14, jumping ahead of Detroit auto giants and Silicon Valley rivals with technology that could revolutionize transportation.  In an ambitious experiment, a fleet of cars equipped with lasers, cameras and other sensors – but with no one’s hands on the wheel – were to be deployed by the web-based ride service on the challenging roads of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, steering themselves to pick up regular Uber passengers who are used to being fetched by cars driven by humans. Four of the Ford Fusion hybrids with their ungainly rooftop load of technology will be deployed to select customers on Wednesday, with the company showing at least a dozen more ready to put on the streets. The cars and their supporting technology have been trained on the city’s complicated grid for less than two years, but demonstration rides ahead of the launch showed them very able to handle most situations — as able as many drivers. Still, the first riders will be joined by two company technicians to make sure everything goes right, one sitting behind the wheel, with hands at the ready to take over in sticky spots, while the other monitors the car’s behavior. The move has put Uber ahead of the rest of the auto industry in getting such cars out for the general public. The major automakers all have driverless car development programs, as do tech giants Alphabet (Google) and Apple.  What allowed Uber to get to the front of the pack was not auto engineering but rather its ability to accumulate and crunch massive amounts of data on road and driving conditions collected from the billions of miles driven by Uber drivers. “We have one of the strongest self-driving engineering groups in the world, as well as the experience that comes from running a ridesharing and delivery network in hundreds of cities,” said Uber founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick in a blog post Wednesday. The introduction of driverless cars challenges Uber’s image as an app-based service of the “gig economy” that gave millions of car owners around the world the chance to make money ferrying passengers without taxicab licenses or other permits.  Uber’s vision now suggests a world of taxis on call by app with no drivers at all.  “Self-driving is core to Uber’s mission,” Anthony Levandowski, Uber’s vice president of engineering, said. That would be far away, Uber officials stress. Kalanick says the main aim is to create safer roads.  “Self-driving Ubers have enormous potential to further our mission and improve society: reducing the number of traffic accidents, which today kill 1.3 million people a year; freeing up the 20 percent of space in cities currently used to park the world’s billion plus cars; and cutting congestion, which wastes trillions of hours every year,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/134321-volkswagen-toyota-ridesharing-firms/","title":"Volkswagen, Toyota partners with ridesharing firms","date":"May 26, 2016 11:42 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":" Toyota and Volkswagen announced separate partnerships with rideshare companies Uber and Gett, in the latest such moves by major carmakers. The deal between Japan’s Toyota and ridesharing titan Uber will create new leasing options enabling car buyers to lease their vehicles from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments with what they make as Uber drivers.

The deal includes a strategic investment by the Toyota Financial Services Corporation and its Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership, although no figure was disclosed. The partnership will create new leasing options enabling car buyers to lease their vehicles from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments with what they make as Uber drivers. Toyota and Uber are also exploring collaboration on developing in-car apps and setting up a program to sell Toyota and Lexus vehicles to Uber. “Toyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide and we look forward to collaborating with Toyota in multiple ways going forward,” said Emil Michael, Uber’s chief business officer. Separately, German auto giant Volkswagen said it had made a $300 million strategic investment in Uber competitor Gett, which has a presence in more than 60 countries worldwide including London, Moscow, and New York. “The ride-hailing market represents the greatest market potential in on-demand mobility, while creating the technological platform for developing tomorrow’s mobility business models,” it said in a statement.

The announcement comes as Apple faces headwinds in China, where it has seen huge drops in sales of its popular electronics, but is working to expand its mobile payments service and is even believed to have ambitions for driverless cars. Didi, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, is China’s largest ridesharing service, and the tie-up may serve as a way for Apple to get to know the Chinese market ahead of a long-rumored expansion into the transportation sector. “We decided to make the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including the chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,” chief executive Tim Cook told the official news agency Xinhua. Apple is thought to be one of a number of tech companies, including Google and Chinese search giant Baidu, that are developing driverless cars. The move may also be intended to help Apple expand its Apple Pay service, which faces strong Chinese competition, analysts said. The twin prospects may help soothe investors nervous about Apple’s prospects in the Middle Kingdom. The company’s shares have dropped more than 13% since April 26, when it reported its first ever fall in iPhone sales, largely due to waning interest from Chinese consumers. On Thursday, May 12, the stock closed down 2.4%, losing its coveted spot as the world’s biggest publicly traded company to Google parent company Alphabet. The fall from grace, blamed on the company’s failure to expand into the lower-priced handsets popular in developing markets, came amid a string of bad news from China. Last month, authorities shut down Apple’s movie and book services. Adding insult to injury, it was revealed to have lost a court case over the use of its iPhone trademark. Hoping for a turnaround, Cook will travel to Beijing later this month to lobby senior leaders. ‘Burning through cash’ Didi, which also has backing from Chinese Internet behemoths Tencent and Alibaba, likely hopes to use the deal to strike a death blow to US-based Uber, its main competitor for the Chinese ridesharing market. Apple’s injection was the “single largest investment the company has ever received,” said Didi, which dominates the car-hailing sector in China and says it has almost 90% of the market. Uber, which has received funding from Baidu, along with state-owned Citic Securities – is a small, but scrappy competitor. Didi and Uber both have deep pockets and have been locked in a war of attrition for riders. In February, Uber said it lost $1 billion annually in China as it competes for market share and Didi is thought to be dropping similar amounts as both companies subsidize users’ rides, which are much cheaper than regular cab fares. Last September, Didi’s president Jean Liu said the company was “burning through cash”, according to a report by Bloomberg News. ‘Large user base’ Though Apple’s investment in Didi is large, the deal seems more notable for its strategic rather than financial significance. There are “lots of opportunities for closer cooperation between the two companies,” Cook told Xinhua. One area they are likely to explore is mobile payments, according to Chinese analysts who say the investment could be a good opportunity for Apple Pay. The service was recently launched in China but has to contend with well established existing competitors owned by Alibaba and Tencent – now its fellow shareholders in Didi. Didi says it has more than 300 million passengers registered and provides over 11 million rides a day – numbers that provide an excellent opportunity for Apple Pay, according to an article on Chinese web site Huxiu. “It is undoubtedly a good value for Apple to tie up with an app that has a large user base and where frequent payments are made,” it said. It is technically illegal in China for private cars to offer rides for payment, and authorities occasionally stage stings to arrest drivers, but regulations are not often enforced, creating an opening for ridesharing services to flourish. Didi invested in Uber’s US rival Lyft last year, along with Alibaba and Tencent, and announced last month that it would cooperate with it to compete with Uber on its own turf. – Ben Dooley, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/131925-uber-policy-board-ride-sharing/","title":"Uber assembles international insights in policy board","date":"May 5, 2016 9:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The new board will provide 'candid advice and insights' as ride-sharing grows worldwide","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber on Wednesday, May 4, introduced a newly formed policy board that includes a former vice president of the European Commission, as the ride-sharing service navigates regulatory roads around the world.

For example, we may require a subpoena, court order or search warrant before providing different types of information.” The report, which covered only the United States, said Uber received 408 rider account requests related to 205 drivers. Uber said it provided at least some data requested in 84.8% of those cases – “full” compliance in about a third of the cases and partial compliance in about half.

In testimony at a Senate hearing, representatives of General Motors and auto-equipment maker Delphi touted numerous safety and environmental benefits of autonomous vehicles. Chris Urmson, who heads the Google self-driving car project, said a consistent regulatory framework is important to deploying those technologies, and that conflicting rules in US states could limit innovation. “The leadership of the federal government is critically important given the growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars,” he said. In the past two years, 23 states have introduced legislation that affect self-driving cars, “all of which include different approaches and concepts,” he noted. Five states have passed such legislation, all with different rules, Urmson said. “If every state is left to go its own way without a unified approach, operating self-driving cars across state boundaries would be an unworkable situation and one that will significantly hinder safety, innovation, interstate commerce, national competitiveness, and the eventual deployment of autonomous vehicles,” Urmson said in his prepared testimony. He also cited government statistics showing 38,000 people were killed last year in US road accidents and that “94% of those accidents involve human error.” Joseph Okpaku, vice president of government relations for the ridesharing group Lyft, echoed those comments, saying consistent rules would be important for the planned deployment of self-driving cars by Lyft and GM. “We are on the doorstep of another evolutionary leap in transportation and technology, where concepts that once could only be imagined in science fiction are on the verge of becoming a reality,” he said. “The worst possible scenario for the growth of autonomous vehicles is an inconsistent and conflicting patchwork of local, municipal and county laws that will hamper efforts to bring AV (autonomous vehicle) technology to market,” Okpaku added. “Regulations are necessary, but regulatory restraint and consistency is equally as important if we are going to allow this industry to reach its full potential.” GM vice president Michael Ableson said the auto giant “enthusiastically supports policy initiatives to accelerate the development and adoption of safe, high-level vehicle automation.” Delphi vice president Glen De Vos added that “uniform rules that allow for the safe operation of driverless vehicles in all 50 states will be critical.” Not so fast But the Senate panel was told to exercise caution by Mary Cummings, who heads the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. Cummings said it’s not yet clear that self-driving cars can safely operate in all situations. “We know that many of the sensors on self-driving cars are not effective in bad weather, we know people will try to hack into these systems,” she told the panel. Cummings said it is possible to “spoof” a car’s GPS to send it off course, or to use laser devices to trick a vehicle into sensing objects which are not there. She said a Rand Corporation study said that self-driving cars would need to drive 275 million miles (442 million kilometers) to show they are as safe as human-operated vehicles. Cummings said the federal government needs to ensure that testing is done in a rigorous way to ensure safety. “I am wholeheartedly in support of the research and development of self-driving cars,” she said. “But these systems will not be ready for fielding until we move away from superficial demonstrations to principled, evidenced-based tests and evaluations.” The activist group Consumer Watchdog warned meanwhile that the federal government should not take shortcuts on safety by “rushing new technology to the roads.” “Federal regulators have a process for writing rules to keep the public safe,” Consumer Watchdog’s John Simpson said in a statement. “Congress shouldn’t skirt those rules just because tech industry giants like Google ask them to.” – Rob Lever, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/122282-uber-funding-emerging-markets-push/","title":"Uber gets another $200M for emerging markets push","date":"Feb 13, 2016 12:17 AM PHT","snippet":"San Francisco-based Uber, which allows individuals to offer rides via a smartphone application, expands to hundreds of cities worldwide and more than 60 countries, drawing protests from the taxi industry and regulators","body":" WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Global ridesharing service Uber said Friday, February 12, it had raised $200 million in additional funding to help its push into emerging markets.

Facebook added, “With the ability to request, track and pay for a ride in Messenger, we’re making transportation as simple as sending a message.” The new service will also allow users to get a free ride of up to $20 with Uber, just by linking an existing Uber account to Messenger or setting up a new account within Messenger and asking for a ride.

Actor and model Jet Rai, who recently founded startup BikerX, thinks differently. Manila’s road space problems Rai founded startup BikerX in the hope of helping alleviate the traffic congestion in Metro Manila. “It banks on the idea of utilizing biker clubs and private individuals to maximize the potential of underutilized motorcycles and to effectively deal with road space problems,” Rai said. Motorcycles can be hailed via BikerX for individual rides, as with the case of other transport apps already operating in the Philippines, as well as “hatid-sundo” (drop-off, pick-up) arrangements and motorcade participation. It can also be used for parcel delivery in the same way that most motorcycles in the city are traditionally utilized.  For these various offerings, BikerX is priced based on such variables as distance of travel and peak hour costs, in addition to any promos that they may be offering. No matter the service, BikerX is an interesting solution for the ‘road space problems’ that Rai mentioned. To put it simply, motorcycles take up a less space than motor vehicles and thus may be a more city-friendly option over vehicles with only a single passenger. Still, while Filipinos may feel comfortable using motorcycles for logistics, they may not necessarily be accustomed to using it for their own personal transportation. Rai argued that motorcycles can be a fun way to travel, and with BikerX’s GPS tracking system, this form of transport can also be a safer and more efficient way of commuting.  As a new platform, Rai is still focused on growing BikerX to offer more services. “We are also in the verge of finalizing various partnerships with different brands and companies to create a better experience and have a good set of perks for our riders,” he said. The Uber of motorcycles To get Filipinos to try out BikerX and remain with the platform, Rai is banking on a rewards program for both ends of its marketplace. “BIkerX is developing different incentives both to its riders and users that would work through the course of their loyalty and use of the app,” he said, adding that they also plan to offer free rides to show the convenience and efficiency that their motorcycles can offer.  Though some may peg BikerX as the “Uber of motorcycles,” Rai does not believe his startup is a direct competitor of the Silicon Valley giant, nor even of GrabTaxi. He said that BikerX caters to a more diverse market segment that is not just limited to ride sharing, because it can appeal to the corporate industry with its delivery offerings. Though Uber is quickly foraying into logistics with UberRUSH, which is live – as of this writing – in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, and GrabTaxi has had parcel delivery available in Manila via GrabExpress for some time, BikerX is arguably different in that it’s focusing on logistics from its inception and its entire fleet is composed of motorcycles, which may be better suited for delivery. Rai cited safety and the need to secure their parcel delivery as the biggest challenge facing BikerX. “We have overcome this ordeal through having a unique tracking system for our riders,” he said, adding that they also have a screening and verification program to make sure that their riders are trustworthy to ride with.   Following the launch of BikerX, Rai’s immediate goals are to help both sides of the platform. “Our vision is not just providing an alternative method for transportation for commuters, but to also become a platform for collaborative uses of motorcycles that would help our transport industry,” he said. In trying to achieve this goal, BikerX would seem to have more in common with other ride-sharing apps – they need the government’s support to get there. On this front, Rai called on the Philippine government to be more collaborative. “The government could support the ridesharing industry by being more cooperative and supportive in terms of regulations and policies and to find a middle ground for everyone,” he said. “Because at the end of the day, we are all after one thing, and that is the safety of our commuters.” – Rappler.com Rappler Business columnist Ezra Ferraz brings you Philippine business leaders, their insights, and their secrets via Executive Edge.

Mereka diminta untuk mengantri, tapi jumlahnya yang sangat banyak membuat mereka susah diatur. Apa tujuan mereka datang ke sana? Menjadi sopir Go-Jek. Bagi yang belum familier, Go-Jek adalah salah satu startup Indonesia yang pertumbuhannya paling cepat dan paling terlihat di publik. Jasa transportasi, kurir, dan belanja ini melegitimasi ojek yang biasanya bersifat tidak formal dengan memberikan sopirnya seragam jaket dan helm hijau, serta mengatur mereka melalui aplikasi mobile yang memungkinkan penggunanya memesan ojek. Acara yang kita sebutkan di atas tadi adalah acara perekrutan massal, sebuah gerakan agresif dari Founder Go-Jek Nadiem Makarim untuk tetap mengimbangi persaingan dari kompetitor lokal GrabBike yang merupakan salah satu layanan yang ditawarkan startup transportasi asal Malaysia GrabTaxi. Tapi meskipun menjadi cukup terkenal di Jakarta, Founder dan CEO Go-Jek Nadiem Makarim sulit ditemui. Di acara perekrutan itu sendiri, ia muncul di tenda pers untuk menjawab beberapa pertanyaan, kemudian kembali hilang meskipun banyak reporter yang mengejarnya. Akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk datang ke kantornya di wilayah Kemang. Area kantor Go-Jek yang luas penuh dengan jaket hijau dan berbagai macam aktivitas. Nadiem menghentikan pekerjaannya saat itu dan menyambut kami sembari merokok di ruang khusus.  Sebagai reporter, saya harus mengakui bahwa CEO Go-Jek ini tahu bagaimana cara bersikap dengan media. Kebanyakan percakapan kita tidak bisa dipublikasikan, dan ketika Nadiem benar-benar tidak mau membeberkan informasi, ia hanya tersenyum dan berkata “Menurut lu gimana Bro?” Setelah merokok, ia mengingat kembali perkembangan Go-Jek dalam waktu setengah tahun ini. Ia sangat menekankan bahwa kesuksesannya di Jakarta terjadi karena faktor “ada di tempat dan waktu yang tepat”: Setelah lulus di jurusan bisnis internasional di Brown University, Nadiem bergabung dengan perusahaan riset dan konsultasi global McKinsey and Co. cabang Jakarta. Sebagai orang asli Indonesia, ia memang ingin kembali ke tanah air, tapi ia sendiri mengakui bahwa McKinsey adalah satu-satunya pilihan yang ia miliki saat itu. Ia terus bekerja di McKinsey selama tiga tahun, dan mengambil semua manfaat dan belajar banyak hal. Ia melakukan pekerjaan untuk beberapa perusahaan milik pemerintah, lalu memulai sebuah inisiatif bernama Young Leaders for Indonesia. YLI adalah program untuk mempersiapkan mahasiswa di tahun ketiga untuk masuk ke dunia kerja. Nadiem mengatakan bahwa proyek ini adalah salah satu alasan utama yang membuatnya bisa masuk ke Harvard Business School pada 2009.  Sebelum keluar, Nadiem memiliki sebuah ide — masalah yang ingin ia selesaikan di Jakarta. Idenya adalah masyarakat bisa menghubungi call center dan meminta sopir ojek untuk menjemput mereka sesuai pesanan dan mengantar mereka ke tempat tujuan. Nadiem kemudian mulai menjalankan proyek perdana Go-Jek di tahun tersebut. “Saya mulai dengan sebuah call center, dan merekrut 20 supir. Kemudian mereka akhirnya menjadi orang yang merekrut supir lainnya,” jelasnya. “Saya memasarkan hanya ke teman-teman dan keluarga, dan proyeknya mulai berkembang dari sana, secara organik dan perlahan.” Selagi mengikuti program MBA Harvard, Nadiem berteman baik dengan seseorang yang ternyata menjadi saingan bisnis utamanya sekarang. Yap, ia kebetulan bertemu dengan Anthony Tan, yang sekarang adalah Co-Founder dan CEO GrabTaxi. “Ia adalah salah satu teman baik saya. Kami selalu saling berkonsultasi mengenai bisnis kami. [Rencananya] Motor [atau ojek] akan menjadi bagian saya, dan dia akan mengambil [sektor] taksi.” Nadiem tidak mengungkap kondisi hubungannya dengan Anthony atau berkomentar mengenai persaingan Go-Jek dan GrabBike. Tapi, ia mengaku bahwa GrabTaxi adalah salah satu katalis kesuksesan Go-Jek 4 tahun kemudian. Tapi, hingga saat itu, Go-Jek beroperasi di Jakarta di bawah kepemimpinan co-founder sementara Jurist Tan dan Brian Cu.  Setelah Harvard, Nadiem bertemu dengan pria berkebangsaan Jerman bernama Oliver Samwer. Karena sudah kenal dengan Rocket Internet, ia tidak perlu bertanya banyak. Oliver menyukai Nadiem karena latar belakang Harvard dan pengalaman McKinsey-nya. Ia meminta Nadiem untuk membantu membangun Rocket Internet di Indonesia. Secara resmi, jabatan Nadiem adalah managing director di Zalora Indonesia. Tapi, saat itu, ia dan tim awal Zalora juga membantu Lazada Indonesia. Nadiem mengatakan bahwa Rocket adalah tempat yang menyenangkan karena jumlah dana yang ia miliki. “Saya melihat Rocket sebagai jalur cepat universitas untuk bisnis online,” katanya. “Saya bisa menggunakan banyak uang dan merekrut orang-orang terbaik di industri ini […] Rocket juga adalah tempat saya bisa belajar bagaimana cara mengembangkan bisnis. Saya sangat beruntung punya pengalaman di Rocket Internet sebelum berfokus di Go-Jek […] Banyak hal yang bisa dipelajari di sana. Saya menerapkan apa yang saya pelajari tersebut di Go-Jek. Saya juga jadi tahu apa yang tidak boleh dilakukan.” Seperti banyak pegawai Rocket Internet lain, Nadiem memutuskan untuk berhenti setelah bekerja setahun di Zalora dan mencoba hal baru. Lingkungan kerjanya tidak cocok untuknya. Ini tidak mengejutkan, karena di Asia Tenggara, Rocket dikenal sering gonta-ganti pegawai. Banyak yang menganggap ini disebabkan oleh budaya perusahaan yang buruk. Meskipun sering disebut sebagai mantan pegawai Rocket, Nadiem tidak pernah menganggap dirinya sebagai salah satu pendiri Rocket di Indonesia. Ia berkata “Saya tidak pernah menganggap diri saya sebagai co-founder. Mereka menyebut saya itu, tapi sejujurnya, saya adalah CEO hasil perekrutan.”   Memanfaatkan fenomena Uber Setelah Rocket, Nadiem kembali bereksperimen dan mencoba proyek startup lain yang kebanyakan gagal. Tapi selagi melakukan itu, Go-Jek tetap berjalan meski tanpa pertumbuhan yang signifikan. Masih hidup, tapi tidak impresif sama sekali. Tapi, di pertengahan 2014, investor mulai menghubunginya dan berminat pada konsep ridesharing. Mereka mulai menanyakan potensi investasi di Go-Jek. Menurutnya, ketertarikan investor tersebut muncul karena masuknya Uber dan GrabTaxi ke pasar Indonesia. Saat itu, ia adalah chief innovation officer di perusahaan pembayaran lokal bernama Kartuku. Tapi ketika VC mulai menghubunginya dan membahas proyek berlandas passion yang ia buat beberapa tahun lalu, ia tahu bahwa ia harus kembali mengerjakan Go-Jek secara full-time. “Kemungkinan sukses di sebuah startup saja sudah 10 persen. Jika kamu tidak melakukannya secara full-time, kemungkinannya akan jadi nol […] kami beruntung karena selama beberapa tahun Go-Jek masih hidup, tapi jelas tidak bertumbuh.” Jurist dan Brian masih menjalankan perusahaan itu secara part-time. Nadiem mendapatkan investasi dari NSI Ventures dan menghubungi mereka kembali dengan sebuah penawaran. “Saya bilang ‘kalian bisa tinggal dan mendapat bagian saham kalian, tapi kalian harus bekerja full-time’ […] Sayangnya, mereka tidak bisa karena yang satu sedang kuliah S2, sedangkan yang satu lagi tinggal di Manila, jadi mereka tidak bisa tinggal. Kami akhirnya membeli saham mereka.” Nadiem mengundang Kevin Aluwi yang merupakan head of business intelligence di Zalora sebagai CFO Go-Jek. Nadiem mengklaim belakangan ini ia tidak pernah menggunakan mobil karena menggunakan produknya sendiri untuk hampir segala keperluan. Sambil tertawa, Kevin mengatakan ke Nadiem: “Itu benar. Kita melihat daftar power user, dan kamu adalah salah satunya.” Dengan munculnya layanan pesan makanan dari Go-Jek bernama Go-Food, startup ini membuat orang-orang ragu akan kemampuan mereka untuk berkembang secara efektif dengan mencoba masuk dan menangani lebih dari satu sektor industri. Nadiem menjawab bahwa justru variasi dari layanan Go-Jek inilah yang membuat startup ini bisa berkembang dengan cepat. “Logistik adalah kunci dari semuanya. Kunci untuk e-commerce dan juga makanan. Kami mengambil risiko dengan mencoba mengatasi masalah di dua sektor ini dengan cara yang berbeda,” katanya. Kevin menambahkan, “Pada dasarnya, dengan jaringan logistik seperti yang sudah kami buat, semua unit bisnis dan layanan yang berbeda ini ditumpuk. Kami hanya mencari yang aktivitas ekonominya paling tinggi untuk dimasukkan ke dalam jaringan. Jadi, kami tidak kehilangan jika fokusnya ada pada meningkatkan nilai aktivitas yang dilakukan di jaringan tersebut.” Keduanya juga mengatakan bahwa Go-Jek malah menyiapkan jutaan sopir ojek untuk meningkatkan rantai nilai tersebut ke depannya. Nadiem mengatakan bahwa jika suatu hari Indonesia mendapatkan sistem transportasi umum yang layak, Go-Jek pasti akan tetap ada dan menyediakan lapangan pekerjaan untuk sopir ojek, meskipun pekerjaan tersebut bukanlah mengantarkan orang ke berbagai pelosok kota. Go-Jek berencana untuk memperkenalkan layanan belanja personal bernama Go-Mart yang mirip dengan Instacart. Layanan ini akan bersaing dengan layanan delivery bahan makanan HappyFresh.  Dalam beberapa minggu terakhir, Go-Jek menjadi aplikasi gratis paling populer di iOS Indonesia. Setelah perekrutan massal di lapangan basket tersebut, Nadiem mengatakan bahwa Go-Jek sekarang punya lebih dari 30.000 sopir di Jakarta. Media mengatakan bahwa startup ini baru saja mendapatkan investasi dari investor internasional yang cukup terkenal. Tapi Nadiem dan Kevin menolak untuk berkomentar soal itu. Ketika ditanya mengenai metrik penting seperti jumlah perjalanan yang sudah dilakukan oleh Go-Jek hingga saat ini, Nadiem hanya tersenyum dan mengatakan “no comment”. Terkait entrepreneur teknologi generasi baru di Indonesia, Nadiem mengatakan bahwa mereka harus punya keberanian untuk mendapatkan banyak uang, menggunakannya dengan cepat, atau all out. “Saya rasa itulah komponen terpenting yang hilang dari founder Indonesia sekarang. Mereka hanya mencoba untuk mengoptimasi dan memvalidasi. Tapi jika ingin membuat sesuatu yang besar dan yakin akan pasar dan produk yang dibuat, jangan ragu melakukannya.” — Rappler.com Tulisan ini sebelumnya diterbitkan di situs berita teknologi dan startupTechinAsia.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/102899-uber-files-accreditation-lftrb-dotc/","title":"Uber files for accreditation with PH gov’t","date":"Aug 17, 2015 6:54 PM PHT","snippet":"'I believe the review process of the application takes a few days.

Cab companies say the new guidelines create an unfair playing field, since ridesharing drivers are not subject to the strict rules that they themselves have to follow. The operators are threatening to go to court to protect their industry. I agree that “Uber-like” services pose a real threat to the regular taxi industry, and I sympathize with any honest, hard-working taxi drivers who may be squeezed out by technology and innovation. But I have to wonder: Who’s really to blame? The way a taxi system is supposed to work is quite simple. You stand on the side of the road and wait for a passing taxi. The first cab that comes along stops, you get in, state your destination, and the driver silently begins to drive. Upon reaching your destination, the driver charges you the amount on the meter, you pay, and you get out. It’s all supposed to happen in that order. Every time. According to the law, there’s not supposed to be any negotiation about price, and the driver does not have a choice about whether or not to carry you. As a public service, and more importantly, as an integral part of the public transportation system, this is the way it’s supposed to work. In fact, this is the way it does work in many cities around the world. In Metro Manila however, the reality is quite different. For the average taxi passenger, difficulties start even before they board the vehicle. Despite a law that clearly prohibits the practice, taxi drivers openly choose which passengers they will stop for, driving right past others. And when a driver does stop, he expects (and often demands) passengers to state their destination and negotiate a price, even before allowing them into the vehicle. Most of the time, the driver just cracks the window a bit, forcing passengers to negotiate ever so politely through the crack. Other times, passengers are expected to lean in through an open door, and almost beg the driver for service and a fair price. In my observation, passengers have about a 50/50 chance of being accepted. But just as often the driver just shakes his head and drives away, leaving a helpless passenger standing in the street… sometimes even in pouring rain.  Once inside the taxi, it’s another gamble to see if the driver turns on his meter. Some do, but most don’t. Again, the law is clear but there doesn’t seem to be any serious effort to enforce it. Asking a driver to use the meter can lead to an argument, which most Filipinos prefer to avoid. In most cases, drivers just dictate the fare. If I want to complain, my only option is to physically go to a government office and swear out a formal complaint, and then attend one or more hearings. This is simply not realistic, does little to motivate compliance, and does nothing to solve my immediate problem of getting to my destination. And complaints to the taxi operator, made by calling the number posted inside most taxis, are even more frustrating. In most cases, drivers do not seem to be directly employed by the operators, and therefore operators have little ability to control or discipline them. Drivers are essentially just people who pay a “boundary”” to rent the cab for the day. I have, by the way, tried to ask a nearby policeman for help once or twice. The usual response? “Sir, you should just look for another taxi.” Enforcement? Doesn’t happen. Filipinos seem to accept all this, grudgingly, as the way it works. As a foreigner without a car, I find it maddeningly frustrating. How much I will pay, and even whether or not I will be allowed to get in the car, are entirely at the whim of a driver who is licensed by the state and required by law to provide transportation service, under a set of rules that are only minimally enforced. All in all, to call the Metro Manila taxi system a “service” is a real stretch of the definition. There are many hard-working, knowledgeable, courteous taxi drivers plying the streets of Metro Manila, but the problems I just described are the common experience of the average taxi passenger. As it currently operates, the Metro Manila taxi system is unprofessional, unfriendly, and quite often, uncontrolled. Drivers ignore taxi regulations, and worse, with impunity. With this kind of “service,” it’s not surprising that the riding public eagerly embraces new transportation options like Uber. It’s not only a matter of cost, or a question of dilapidated, old vehicles. People are clearly willing to pay more for the kind of service Uber and similar companies offer. The real issue is that ridesharing companies provide the professional transportation service that people want. Their drivers don’t pick and choose passengers, don’t argue about the fare, and don’t refuse to take passengers to their destination. This is what people want. The ridesharing concept has arisen in response to a demand from the riding public for better service. If the playing field isn’t level, it’s not because ridesharing companies are competing unfairly. It’s because taxi service, as it works today, is lousy. If taxi operators want to compete, they only need to do one thing — improve the quality of their service. Obey laws and regulations, treat passengers as valuable customers, and operate like a true public service. A little bit of technology, like booking apps, wouldn’t hurt either. Taxis outnumber ridesharing vehicles 10 to 1. It’s still easier to catch a cab than to wait for an online rideshare. There is still a place for regular taxis but not if they don’t change quickly. – Rappler.com Michael Brown is a retired member of the US Air Force, and has lived over 16 years in the Philippines.

On the streets of Manila, vendors can be found selling anything to motorists stuck in traffic – from washcloths, peanuts, water to things as random as coat racks and iPhone chargers. A recent article in Forbes featured a Filipino living in San Francisco, USA, named Gavin Escolar, who demonstrated just that quality. He is an Uber driver who uses his car as his mobile showroom for his jewelry business. For this, he is called an “ubrepreneur.” The writer discovered Escolar’s story when the Filipinio immigrant picked him up on an Uber booking. He writes: “Then it hits me: I’m not in Gavin’s car. I’m in his mobile showroom. He’s not just an Uber driver. Nor is he just an entrepreneur. He’s an Uberpreneur, using the ridesharing app to promote his jewelry business.” The same report said Escolar was able to earn over $250,000 – or about P10 million – in one year.  Escolar immigrated from the Philippines to start a jewelry company in San Francisco and became an Uber driver to make ends meet. He recalled of his early days as an Uber driver, “My passengers surprised me…. I thought they would be silent or on the phone. But most people wanted to talk. When I mentioned my jewelry, they asked for business cards, but I didn’t have any.” Then it struck him to go beyond business cards and actually sell the jewelry in his car. “I never solicit. I only keep subtle hints to spark conversation if they notice,” Escolar was quoted in Forbes. “If they don’t notice, they probably wouldn’t be my customer anyway.” Escolar designs all his jewelry himself. “As a child, I was intrigued by the technical watercolor renderings of jewelry that my father kept on his desk, and I have been fond of gemstones ever since,” he wrote on his website. And it turns out that the global ride-sharing app does not discourage their drivers from being entrepreneurial.  Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvell told Forbes, “One of the greatest things about the Uber platform is that it offers economic opportunity for a variety of drivers…in more than 260 cities around the world.” According to CBS News, there are now over 160,000 Uber drivers across the United States.

Uber was launched in the Philippines in February, and for two quarters, Pichay said “it should have started filing income taxes on a quarterly basis.” Asked about this, Uber public policy associate Vickie Cheng, said “we are working with counsels to comply with the relevant laws.” During the hearing, it was noted that Uber is still in the process of filing their license with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) despite already operating in the country for 9 months now. Companies registered with the SEC are mandated to detail their balance of income and expenditure over the preceeding period, thus opening their books to the public. A SEC registration is needed before companies proceed registering with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), where they are profiled for applicable tax obligations. Uber’s lack of government permits to transact business in the country also bars it from taking anyone into Philippine courts. But the US-based ridesharing service can still be sued here for “any kind of cases,” said Cyrus Richard Montesa, SEC’s securities review counsel. “Even if you’re not licensed to do business in the Philippines, a suit may be instituted against you before the Regional Trial Court,” he added, citing Section 133 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines. The particular section of the Code reads as follows: Section 133. Doing business without a license. – No foreign corporation transacting business in the Philippines without a license, or its successors or assigns, shall be permitted to maintain or intervene in any action, suit or proceeding in any court or administrative agency of the Philippines; BUT such corporation may be sued or proceeded against before Philippine courts or administrative tribunals on any valid cause of action recognized under Philippine laws. Members of the House transportation committee have been critical of Uber. Two days ago, they insisted that it cease its operations while government tries to figure out whether to regulate the car-sharing taxi service. The series of House inquiries were launched after the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) met with Uber to find ways on how the government could integrate the service as a transportation franchise unit. Government was compelled to do this after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB) fined one of Uber’s partner vehicles in October, causing negative reactions from many commuters who think the agency should run after abusive taxi drivers instead. But at Wednesday’s hearing, LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez asserted: “We can’t just let them perform their service beyond the jurisdiction of our government agency.” (READ: Is the LTFRB Uber-reacting?) Ginez insisted that for Uber to meet regulatory standards, it must only partner with vehicles that are licensed to operate for public transportation. In a statement on Wednesday, DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said that Uber should serve as a wake-up call to taxi companies. “Commuters say they feel safer taking these private vehicles-for-hire, that the fleet are newer, that app services are faster and more efficient,” Abaya said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/66807-jakarta-threatens-ban-uber-car-app/","title":"Jakarta threatens to ban Uber car app","date":"Aug 20, 2014 7:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Officials say the service Uber provides is just like a taxi service, but it doesn't have a license to operate as one in Jakarta","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – The Indonesian capital is threatening to shut down controversial smartphone car-hailing service Uber due to licensing issues a week after it officially launched in the city, an official said Wednesday, August 20. Jakarta authorities are just the latest to target Uber, an app that has sparked protests from taxi drivers in several countries as it allows customers to hail private rides via their phones. “In our opinion, the service Uber provides is just like a taxi service, but it doesn’t have a license to operate as one in this city,” Jakarta transport agency chief Muhammad Akbar told AFP. “Registered taxis in Jakarta have to meet certain standards, including some to do with safety, so if Uber wants to operate here, it must be held to the same standards – otherwise it’s not fair.” Authorities are concerned that Uber’s service will undercut the current market for taxis and that the company may evade tax if not registered legally, Akbar said. The agency is working with the ministry for IT and communications to have the app shut down, Akbar said, adding that it had invited Uber to a meeting a month ago but never received a response. Uber could not be immediately contacted for comment, but has fended off similar criticism in the past by explaining its service merely links customers looking for a ride with those who have a car, and does not own or operate its own fleet. Uber began by linking users of its apps to luxury car operators, but then decided to offer a broader selection of cars and include a ridesharing option. In Jakarta, it currently only links to services offering paid-for trips in upmarket cars. The California-based app, operating in 170 cities spread across dozens of countries, is the most prominent of several that are shaking up the traditional taxi landscape in cities around the world. Uber has already faced significant resistance from regulators in several countries, who accuse it of unfair competition and lack of standards.
