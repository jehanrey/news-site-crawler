Swat Mobility president Grace Ho told reporters the company would invest over $250,000 Singaporean dollars (P9.5 million) to triple the Philippine unit’s headcount and expand in new locations outside Metro Manila.  “We are seeing very good signals from customers, partners and investments from your government in infrastructure,” Ho said during a virtual briefing on Friday. “While we are headquartered in Singapore, we are on a very aggressive expansion agenda,” she added.  Swat Mobility, which operates in seven countries and has raised $20 million or about P1 billion to date, uses a propriety algorithm to provide “demand-responsive, ride-sharing services in high-capacity vehicles.” Ho said the Philippines was their third largest market behind Singapore and Japan. The company is also present in Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Swat Mobility entered the Philippines in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns in May 2020. It has provided about 1 million rides in the country and has 13,000 active monthly employee users, according to the briefing materials from the company. Ho said the company planned to grow its presence in Metro Manila while expanding in Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and Cebu. The country’s business process outsourcing and manufacturing sectors have been critical in its expansion, she added. Swat Mobility also provides logistics services. “As you can see, logistics and e-commerce are growing aggressively in the Philippines,” she said.  The Philippines currently accounts for 25 percent of the company’s total volume, Swat Mobility Philippines’ country business head Maria Theresa Busmente said in a separate statement. “In 2020, we ended the year with roughly 22,000 rides completed. Closing 2021 with more than 500,000 rides is really a milestone for us,” she added."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/282522/biggest-ride-sharing-firm-in-china-eyes-ph","title":"Biggest ride-sharing firm in China eyes PH","date":"06:01 AM November 04, 2019","snippet":"China’s biggest ride-sharing company DiDi Chuxing is in talks with a Filipino group in a bid to end Grab Philippines’ virtual monopoly in the country, the Inquirer learned.","body":"China’s biggest ride-sharing company DiDi Chuxing is in talks with a Filipino group in a bid to end Grab Philippines’ virtual monopoly in the country, the Inquirer learned. DiDi’s entry in the Philippines—potentially the latest in its global expansion—will bring down prices and offer more options for commuters, said Ilocos Sur politician Luis “Chavit” Singson, who confirmed negotiations with DiDi.  “We want to break the monopoly of Grab,” Singson said of the Singapore-based ride-sharing giant in an interview last week. Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement. DiDi is one of the world’s largest mobile transport platforms. It offers a host of services from on-demand cars to e-bike sharing and food deliveries to more than 550 million users across Asia, Latin America and Australia, its website showed. “We think this will help Filipinos,” said Singson, a former governor and now mayor of Narvacan. He also chairs LCS Holdings and owns a range of businesses such as bus operator Partas, car dealerships and more recently, the construction of cell towers. Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, owns stakes in Uber, Grab, DiDi and Ola, a ride-sharing service in India."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/691183/dotc-guidelines-on-ride-sharing-app-out","title":"DOTC guidelines on ride-sharing app out","date":"10:40 PM May 13, 2015","snippet":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services.","body":"The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) released on Wednesday a department order paving the way for the legal operations of smartphone ride-sharing applications in the Philippines—the first move by a country to create a framework to accommodate technology transit services. The development finally gives legitimacy to global platforms like Uber, GrabCar, Easy Taxi and Tripda, which are present in the Philippines but would likely hurt the traditional taxi cab operators, with one organization saying they were mulling a lawsuit against the DOTC.  All the apps had been operating in the Philippines without the guidelines as the government implemented a general policy of holding off on arrests until the rules were finalized. The department order outlines the new classifications, including that for so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) that the smartphone rider-sharing applications will fall under. He said this will allow Transportation Network Companies (TNC) “to exist within our regulatory framework.”  With the department order’s release, regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board can begin working to finalize its memorandum circular, which would outline specific regulations and requirements for the platforms and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them [traditional taxi cabs] to modernize and compete,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a press conference this week. “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS [cars].”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” Abaya added. Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, disagreed with the government’s view and said this would ultimately hurt their business. Among the options, he said, would be to sue the DOTC and LTFRB as the entities did not take into consideration the impact of letting TNCs operate. “We are now relegated to a second choice,” Suntay said, noting unfair advantages of these transit application platforms since they have not been operating their own cars. He said services like Uber, which has been providing a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, have been benefiting from fares not regulated by government. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models.  The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans or other similar vehicles will be allowed. “A maximum age limit of seven years will be enforced,” the DOTC said. Operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details need to be ironed out with LTFRB. Chief among these is on the regulation of fares, which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/920199/what-is-ride-sharing-congress-help-sought-to-settle-issues-vs-grab-uber","title":"What is ‘ride-sharing’?

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1418943/woman-raises-125000-for-safer-ride-sharing-service-amid-spike-of-anti-asian-american-attacks-in-us","title":"Woman raises $125,000 for safer ride-sharing service amid spike in anti-Asian American attacks in US","date":"04:36 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.","body":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States. On how she came up with the idea, Maddy Park admitted that it was out of fear for her safety whenever she commutes via trains in New York, as per WABC on April 6.  “Last week I took the train. It was a 30-minute commute and I realized every minute of that commute I was terrified,” she was quoted as saying. “I was scared that any moment in time someone might say a racial slur or attack me. Worst of all I thought that if something were to happen to me, nobody would stand up,” Park added.  Park, who admitted that while she could afford to take the taxi, many other Asian Americans cannot. So, she donated $2,000 of her own money to set up Cafe Maddy Cab on Instagram with her friends. Through the said initiative, Park and many other donors help out Asian American women, elderly persons, members of the LGBTQ+ community and low-income essential workers hail a cab for free.  To her surprise, her initiative inspired many others across the US to help the Asian American community during these dire times. “People who are donating are people from all across the nation, across all races, ethnicities and they just sent me messages saying, listen, we really want you guys to be safe too and we’re donating so that more people can take rides in the city,” Park was quoted as saying. “It really opened my eyes to how many people are actually supporting the Asian community in New York City,” Park added.   Park has raised $125,000 as of yesterday, April 13, nine days after she launched Cafe Maddy Cab. A total of 1,122 have so far been paid for by Cafe Maddy Cab. Those who want to avail themselves of the said services or donate to the initiative can go to this link provided by Park. Ian Biong /ra RELATED STORIES: K-pop idols, Asian American stars call to #StopAsianHate as hate crimes surge in US Hundreds rally in Atlanta to support Asian American community after fatal shootings"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/234273/economists-oppose-caps-ride-sharing-permits","title":"Economists oppose caps on ride-sharing permits","date":"02:29 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"","body":" A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.  FEF – an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms – said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) were doing the riding public a beneficial service that the regular public utility vehicles have been unable to provide. The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings as well as safety and peace of mind due to the thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and to the feedback and reviews of the riding public, FEF said in a press statement on Wednesday.  Thus, FEF said it’s “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services. “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anti-competitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis,” FEF said.  The group said these ride-sharing services had shown the way on how public transportation should be managed: through the use of technology and the market. “The market gives the riding public the power of choice. Technology gives the riding public information and matches demand,” FEF said. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. The group pointed out that surge prices during peak hours encourage drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. In the case of consumers, such surge in pricing are seen to encourage riders to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods.  “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels. In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel, and oversupply,” FEF said. The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” FEF chaired is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo. Its vice chair is Romy Bernardo while the president is Calixto Chikiamco. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister/Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles and his brother Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Rep. Jericho Nograles have filed House Bill 6009  to end the disagreement between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and the LTFRB.  The dispute has led to a crackdown on Uber and Grab vehicles that do not have franchises to operate. READ: LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise  The House Bill 6009, or the Transport Network Service Act, seeks to institutionalize TNC as an alternative mode of public transport, and to regulate the operations of these services “to ensure that the paramount interest of the public is protected and conserved, while encouraging free enterprise and economic development.” According to House Bill 6009, the TNCs would only be allowed to operate if they are able to comply with all the requirements and secure a permit from the LTFRB.  The bill defines these companies and their drivers as “common carriers” for purposes of determining the liability and degree of diligence so that the presumption of negligence in case of breach of contract of carriage may apply to both. READ: Uber, Grab failed to inform drivers of LTFRB requirements The bill would require these ride-sharing and -hailing companies to secure a permit from the LTFRB and to oblige the TNCs to ensure that their drivers would comply with all the requirements and obligations set by law. The bill would require an Uber and Grab operator the following: The TNCs are also expected to strictly adopt a zero tolerance policy for drug or alcohol use among its drivers, and must ensure that the vehicles are safe and comfortable.  READ: LTFRB: Uber, Grab to blame for ‘mess’ TNC vehicles are also prohibited from exceeding the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity in its ride-sharing activities, the bill said. The Uber and Grab vehicles should also be not more than 10 years old, and must be road-worthy and compliant with vehicle emission standards, the bill added. In a statement, Davao City Rep. Nograles said the tiff between the TNCs and LTFRB is a “classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal,” especially because Uber and Grab remained a favored convenient form of public transportation. “Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” Nograles said. READ: ‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB PBA Rep. Nograles in the same statement said there is still a need to regulate Uber and Grab because these are relatively new modes of public transportation. He lamented that the operation of Grab and Uber would not have been an issue if the country had an efficient mass transport system in the Metro Rail and Light Rail Transits System. “The concept of Uber and Grab is new to us so therefore new regulations must be set to ensure that they are properly managed. Unfortunately, we don’t even need to go through this kind of trouble if only we have an efficient public transport system and an MRT that doesn’t break down too often,” he said The PBA Partylist earlier challenged LTFRB to first tackle “colorum” public vehicles instead of cracking down on ride-hailing companies like Grab and Uber.

The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102598/experiencing-traffic-book-a-ride-sharing-flight-to-your-destination","title":"Experiencing traffic?

The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

The development finally gives legitimacy to global platforms like Uber, GrabCar, Easy Taxi and Tripda, which are present in the Philippines but would likely hurt the traditional taxi cab operators, with one organization saying they were mulling a lawsuit against the DOTC.  All the apps had been operating in the Philippines without the guidelines as the government implemented a general policy of holding off on arrests until the rules were finalized. The department order outlines the new classifications, including that for so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) that the smartphone rider-sharing applications will fall under. He said this will allow Transportation Network Companies (TNC) “to exist within our regulatory framework.”  With the department order’s release, regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board can begin working to finalize its memorandum circular, which would outline specific regulations and requirements for the platforms and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them [traditional taxi cabs] to modernize and compete,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a press conference this week. “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS [cars].”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” Abaya added. Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, disagreed with the government’s view and said this would ultimately hurt their business. Among the options, he said, would be to sue the DOTC and LTFRB as the entities did not take into consideration the impact of letting TNCs operate. “We are now relegated to a second choice,” Suntay said, noting unfair advantages of these transit application platforms since they have not been operating their own cars. He said services like Uber, which has been providing a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, have been benefiting from fares not regulated by government. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models.  The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans or other similar vehicles will be allowed. “A maximum age limit of seven years will be enforced,” the DOTC said. Operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details need to be ironed out with LTFRB. Chief among these is on the regulation of fares, which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/920199/what-is-ride-sharing-congress-help-sought-to-settle-issues-vs-grab-uber","title":"What is ‘ride-sharing’?

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1418943/woman-raises-125000-for-safer-ride-sharing-service-amid-spike-of-anti-asian-american-attacks-in-us","title":"Woman raises $125,000 for safer ride-sharing service amid spike in anti-Asian American attacks in US","date":"04:36 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.","body":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States. On how she came up with the idea, Maddy Park admitted that it was out of fear for her safety whenever she commutes via trains in New York, as per WABC on April 6.  “Last week I took the train. It was a 30-minute commute and I realized every minute of that commute I was terrified,” she was quoted as saying. “I was scared that any moment in time someone might say a racial slur or attack me. Worst of all I thought that if something were to happen to me, nobody would stand up,” Park added.  Park, who admitted that while she could afford to take the taxi, many other Asian Americans cannot. So, she donated $2,000 of her own money to set up Cafe Maddy Cab on Instagram with her friends. Through the said initiative, Park and many other donors help out Asian American women, elderly persons, members of the LGBTQ+ community and low-income essential workers hail a cab for free.  To her surprise, her initiative inspired many others across the US to help the Asian American community during these dire times. “People who are donating are people from all across the nation, across all races, ethnicities and they just sent me messages saying, listen, we really want you guys to be safe too and we’re donating so that more people can take rides in the city,” Park was quoted as saying. “It really opened my eyes to how many people are actually supporting the Asian community in New York City,” Park added.   Park has raised $125,000 as of yesterday, April 13, nine days after she launched Cafe Maddy Cab. A total of 1,122 have so far been paid for by Cafe Maddy Cab.

FEF – an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms – said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) were doing the riding public a beneficial service that the regular public utility vehicles have been unable to provide. The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings as well as safety and peace of mind due to the thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and to the feedback and reviews of the riding public, FEF said in a press statement on Wednesday.  Thus, FEF said it’s “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services. “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anti-competitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis,” FEF said.  The group said these ride-sharing services had shown the way on how public transportation should be managed: through the use of technology and the market. “The market gives the riding public the power of choice. Technology gives the riding public information and matches demand,” FEF said. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. The group pointed out that surge prices during peak hours encourage drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. In the case of consumers, such surge in pricing are seen to encourage riders to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods.  “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels. In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel, and oversupply,” FEF said. The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” FEF chaired is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo.

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles and his brother Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Rep. Jericho Nograles have filed House Bill 6009  to end the disagreement between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and the LTFRB.  The dispute has led to a crackdown on Uber and Grab vehicles that do not have franchises to operate. READ: LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise  The House Bill 6009, or the Transport Network Service Act, seeks to institutionalize TNC as an alternative mode of public transport, and to regulate the operations of these services “to ensure that the paramount interest of the public is protected and conserved, while encouraging free enterprise and economic development.” According to House Bill 6009, the TNCs would only be allowed to operate if they are able to comply with all the requirements and secure a permit from the LTFRB.  The bill defines these companies and their drivers as “common carriers” for purposes of determining the liability and degree of diligence so that the presumption of negligence in case of breach of contract of carriage may apply to both. READ: Uber, Grab failed to inform drivers of LTFRB requirements The bill would require these ride-sharing and -hailing companies to secure a permit from the LTFRB and to oblige the TNCs to ensure that their drivers would comply with all the requirements and obligations set by law. The bill would require an Uber and Grab operator the following: The TNCs are also expected to strictly adopt a zero tolerance policy for drug or alcohol use among its drivers, and must ensure that the vehicles are safe and comfortable.  READ: LTFRB: Uber, Grab to blame for ‘mess’ TNC vehicles are also prohibited from exceeding the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity in its ride-sharing activities, the bill said. The Uber and Grab vehicles should also be not more than 10 years old, and must be road-worthy and compliant with vehicle emission standards, the bill added. In a statement, Davao City Rep. Nograles said the tiff between the TNCs and LTFRB is a “classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal,” especially because Uber and Grab remained a favored convenient form of public transportation. “Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” Nograles said. READ: ‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB PBA Rep. Nograles in the same statement said there is still a need to regulate Uber and Grab because these are relatively new modes of public transportation. He lamented that the operation of Grab and Uber would not have been an issue if the country had an efficient mass transport system in the Metro Rail and Light Rail Transits System. “The concept of Uber and Grab is new to us so therefore new regulations must be set to ensure that they are properly managed. Unfortunately, we don’t even need to go through this kind of trouble if only we have an efficient public transport system and an MRT that doesn’t break down too often,” he said The PBA Partylist earlier challenged LTFRB to first tackle “colorum” public vehicles instead of cracking down on ride-hailing companies like Grab and Uber.

The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102598/experiencing-traffic-book-a-ride-sharing-flight-to-your-destination","title":"Experiencing traffic?

The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.

When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers.

Members of TopSpeed and Busypaps, two organizations comprising at least 250 Grab and Uber drivers, made the appeal as the LTFRB’s suspension order to temporarily stop receiving new TNVS applications was about to reach one year on July 21.  The new drivers who were prohibited to ply Metro Manila because of absence of a provisional authority (PA) from the LTFRB asked the regulatory body to lift the suspension order for them to be given permit and start earn a living. This development came after the LTFRB issued an order on July 21, 2016, suspending the acceptance of new applications for PA thus, prohibiting a number of drivers not to go out and pick up passengers for about a year now.  “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority (We are appealing to the good hearts of our LTFRB officials to heed our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues without provisional authority),” Bobby Coronel, founder of TopSpeed, said. According to Coronel, TNVS drivers have always wanted to fully comply with regulations but their applications were either not processed judiciously by the previous admin or did not make it to the cut off as a result of the suspension. Moreover, they cannot simply give up their livelihood, and LTFRB must understand their situation.  “Marami po sa amin, may binabayaran pa po na monthly amortization ng mga sasakyan (Many of us are still paying for the monthly amortization of cars),” TopSpeed lady driver Deseree Garcia said, while asking LTFRB to understand their situation. Meanwhile, other TNVS leaders also appealed to the LTFRB to act on the recently expired accreditation of transport network company, Grab. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3. In his Facebook post Monday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said it’s “business as usual” for the company and its partners. Cu added, they have submitted the requirements for the renewal of accreditation on time. But TNVS drivers said, they are still concerned with the current status of non-renewal of accreditation.

Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the  Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Ride-sharing services — typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis — are gaining popularity in Metro Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps — arguing they represent unfair competition.  But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse.  GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise license from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said.  “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCarPhilippines  said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the  Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar  Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorization. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The  Philippines  is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies. Previously, only local and city governments had regulated the services."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/963659/uber-joins-queue-to-hike-ride-share-fees","title":"Uber joins queue to hike ride share fees","date":"06:35 AM January 26, 2018","snippet":"Uber Philippines is seeking increased fare for its popular affordable vehicle category as drivers feel the pinch of higher fuel prices and new regulations.","body":"Uber Philippines is seeking increased fare for its popular affordable vehicle category as drivers feel the pinch of higher fuel prices and new regulations. The move came after rival Grab also sought to increase fare earlier this month.  Late last year, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed a new fare scheme for taxis, effectively increasing rates. Uber said on Thursday that it filed a petition in the LTFRB to increase fare per kilometer of uberX rides by 58 to 110 percent, depending on the time of the day.  Drivers’ costs In its petition, Uber sought to increase fare to P9 to P12 from the current P5.70 per kilometer. UberX base fare and time charge of P40 and P2 would not change, Uber said.  It said the petition for fare increase would help drivers recover part of their expenses. In a statement, Uber said aside from fuel price increases, drivers also have to bear the additional costs brought by new franchising guidelines and a requirement to improve safety and quality of service. The newly enacted Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act subjected gasoline to a higher excise tax of P7 per liter. Grab earlier this month sought LTFRB approval to increase fare per kilometer to P11 to P15. This was higher than the previous rates P10 to P14. It also sought an increase in per minute running charge from P2 to P2.10. Taxi fare hike  In October last year, the LTFRB approved a fare increase for the taxi industry. The new structure involved a flag down rate of P40 for taxis for the first 500 meters in Metro Manila and a per kilometer rate of P13.50. Taxis also charge P2 per minute of running time. The LTFRB, under the Duterte administration, launched a crackdown on the ride-sharing sector since it came to power in July 2016. More recently, it set a cap on the number of Uber and Grab cars to 45,000 vehicles from an estimated pool of 100,000 vehicles today."},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/32069/ride-sharing-giant-uber-set-to-utilize-drones-and-autonomous-cars","title":"Ride Sharing Giant Uber Set to Utilize Drones and Autonomous Cars","date":"03:49 AM June 13, 2019","snippet":"Uber said Wednesday it would begin testing food delivery by drone as it ramps up its Uber Eats service that partners with restaurants.

In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States.  Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars. The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China’s Geely, to produce “tens of thousands” of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some “easy” trips may be made autonomously."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/946745/in-cebu-motorcycles-seen-to-beat-gridlock","title":"In Cebu, motorcycles seen to beat gridlock","date":"06:08 AM November 22, 2017","snippet":"CEBU CITY — Mayor Tomas Osmeña wants the city government to take over the operation of a motorcycle-ride booking service whose operation was declared illegal by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).","body":"CEBU CITY — Mayor Tomas Osmeña wants the city government to take over the operation of a motorcycle-ride booking service whose operation was declared illegal by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Many people have been texting me about [the ride-sharing service] ‘Angkas.’ Since Angkas is providing a real service to the public, the city government will be studying how to take over [its] operations by hiring their administrative personnel. We will provide Angkas’ service, hopefully using the current app (application). We will do this for free,” said Osmeña in a Facebook post.  In a news conference on Monday, the mayor said the city would adopt the company’s management services and use its online booking system. Since the city government was not capable of running it, Osmeña said Angkas would have to provide the application.  As soon as Angkas could provide the city government with a proposal, he said it would act as “dispatchers” of the motorcycles. Should the city hire Angkas’ services, Osmeña said the company would no longer get a share from the driver’s earnings.  The drivers will get 100 percent of their daily earnings, he said. “We will hire their consultancy services but they (firm running Angkas) will not collect from the drivers. Nobody will collect from the drivers,” he said. In its previous arrangement, Angkas gets 20 percent from every booking of its riders. At least 2,000 motorcycle drivers are connected to Angkas, which in July started offering commuters faster trips through the city’s traffic jams. But Angkas suspended its operations here on Saturday, a little over a week after transportation authorities shut it down for operating without a permit.  As early as January this year, when Angkas started operating in Metro Manila, the LTFRB already issued the company a warning that its operation was considered “colorum,” since it did not have the necessary franchise to operate. Since then, Osmeña has been receiving appeals to help bring back the operations of Angkas in the wake of the worsening traffic problem in the city. “Many people are asking [authorities] to continue [the services of Angkas]. People have been pleading with me and I keep answering, ‘I’ll see what I can do.’ Maybe they think I am just paying lip service. No. I am serious. This is what the people want. This is what the people need,” he said. “Anything that has to do in providing services for the constituents of Cebu City, that is what I am concerned about,” he added. The mayor said he was also planning to legalize and regulate the operations of “habal-habal” (motorcycle-for-hire) drivers in the city. Ahmed Cuizon, LTRFB director in Central Visayas, said he had yet to get the full details of Osmeña’s plan to take over the operations of Angkas in the city but promised to ask guidance from their central office on the proposal. Cuizon, however, stressed that Angkas’ operation remained illegal. “Like [ride-sharing services] Uber and Grab, it (Angkas) needs authorization from the LTFRB. Without that, they could not operate. That’s how it works. From the start, we believe that they (Angkas) lack the authority to operate,” Cuizon said.

Germany’s Rocket Internet launched its carpooling platform in the Philippines called Tripda amid current regulatory issues hounding the ridesharing service Uber.  Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said in a statement that Tripda links up drivers who have empty car seats with commuters taking a similar route. The company said this would benefit both parties since they would split the fuel tab and bring down the transportation cost. The app only allows passengers to pay the drivers in cash.  Within five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and expand to other regions later on. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel, making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights.  In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets. The Brazilian-born startup already has tens of thousands of registered users and has facilitated rides for thousands of passengers, the statement said.

Police have arrested a 27-year-old man who worked as a driver in the eastern city of Wenzhou on suspicion of raping and killing a female passenger who used the app to hail a ride.  The company said it would suspend Didi Hitch — a service which pairs up commuters traveling in the same direction— beginning midnight on Monday. The announcement came a day after the company admitted it bore “responsibility” for the crime, failing to act on a complaint about the same driver from another passenger, who claimed he drove her to an isolated area and followed her in his vehicle after she left the car.  “The incident shows the many deficiencies with our customer service processes, especially the failure to act swiftly on the previous passenger’s complaint and the cumbersome and rigid process of information sharing with the police,” Didi said in a statement on Sunday. “This is too high a cost to pay.”  Local police said the driver, identified by the surname Chung, picked up the 20-year-old victim around 1:00pm (0500 GMT) on Friday. But she went missing an hour later after sending a friend a text message asking for help, prompting a manhunt which saw the driver arrested in the early hours of Saturday, police said. The killing has sparked fresh criticism of Didi — which muscled Uber out of the market following a bruising battle — as angry users voiced concerns about the safety of the service. “Since the company can’t regulate itself, get out of the market,” wrote one user on the Twitter-like Weibo. In a scathing commentary, the official Xinhua news agency on Sunday pointed out that Didi has been slapped with over 1 million yuan ($148,000) in fines over the past 10 months in Wenzhou alone.  “Despite repeated punishment, there has been recalcitrant behaviour and no change, a reflection of the company’s indifference to safety and social responsibility,” the commentary said, calling on Didi to be punished if it fails to put customer safety first. Didi said Sunday that the head of Didi Hitch and the vice president of customer service have been “removed” from theirpositions. In May, a 21-year-old air stewardess using the same Hitch service was killed by a Didi Chuxing driver, prompting criticism of the company’s security measures and a tightening up of its rules of use. This included limiting Hitch drivers to only picking up members of the same sex late at night and early morning, and enabling passengers to share their route with an emergency contact. Didi Chuxing calls itself the world’s leading mobile transportation platform, saying in March that it had 21 million drivers and more than 450 million users across its various services. /ee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1126444/taxi-park-in-jams-mexico-citys-zocalo-to-protest-ride-apps","title":"Taxi park-in jams Mexico City’s Zocalo to protest ride apps","date":"07:26 AM June 04, 2019","snippet":"MEXICO CITY – Taxi drivers snarled traffic in downtown Mexico City on Monday in their latest protest against Uber and other ride-hailing apps.","body":"MEXICO CITY – Taxi drivers snarled traffic in downtown Mexico City on Monday in their latest protest against Uber and other ride-hailing apps.

The improved security procedure involves requiring Uber drivers to periodically take profile pictures of themselves — or so-called “selfies” — to allow Uber to validate with its internal database whether the person driving the designated vehicle at any given time is the same one declared in the company’s records.  With the service called “Real-Time ID Check,” Uber said it would be able to reduce fraud, helping drivers protect their accounts from being compromised. This extra layer of protection can help ensure riders that the right person is behind the wheel. “We at Uber are constantly looking for ways to strengthen our technology-enabled security features,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a Taguig City on Monday. “We look into new solutions and test them to proactively use and maximize the capability of available technologies, and how these can be instrumental in our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and convenient rides.”  The new feature, which was launched initially in several countries where Uber operates, will require drivers to use a new feature on the company’s smartphone-based software that requires a selfie to be taken before they go online and accept rides. The photo taken by the driver is then compared to the one already on file with the account.  If the two photos don’t match, the account would be temporarily blocked while Uber representatives look into the situation, according to Cua. Following its initial release in the US last September 2016, Uber is rolling out the feature across 16 countries, namely South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, India, Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Cua said the number of complaints in the Philippines regarding situations where the identity of the driver does not match declared identity has been “extremely small,” most of which have been caused by previous drivers failing to log out of their Uber accounts before turning over the vehicle to another driver. Cua explained that the security feature would improve the peace of mind of Uber riders knowing that the identities of their drivers have been carefully monitored by the company.  SFM/rga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919650/number-of-uber-grab-vehicles-shocks-ltfrb","title":"Number of Uber, Grab vehicles shocks LTFRB","date":"01:11 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.","body":"Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chair Martin Delgra III on Wednesday said he is “shocked” to learn of the number of Uber and Grab vehicles plying the roads of Metro Manila which the transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) companies earlier did not reveal.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that.

Dado noted the lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms involved in the transactions being offered, “compromising” rider safety.  She also pointed out members of a ride-sharing group, numbering up to 200,000, are not allowed to post negative feedback about the rides. They are also required to delete their request each time they are able to get a ride, Dado added. Transport Watch coconvener George Royeca warned that since there are no records of the trips, commuters have no recourse should they get involved in a road accident or fall prey to criminals during the ride.

Lizada added that these motorcycles would also be included in anticolorum operations of the newly created interagency group, “Task Force Kamao.” But Royeca said shutting down the Facebook pages won’t make the problem go away, as officials should understand that the use of habal-habal has become popular throughout the country due to the lack of transport options. Hence, it has become the only alternative especially in poor commuters. Unless Congress comes out with new legislation amending the law that bans the motorcycle as a public utility vehicle, Lizada stressed that it is illegal to use it as a public transport as its safety could not be assured. Dado said Transport Watch was in talks with at least four lawmakers to revisit the country’s “antiquated” transport laws to address the need for inclusive mobility and resolve issues that mostly affect the poor."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/208283/angkas-and-the-business-of-sharing","title":"Angkas and the business of sharing","date":"December 16,2018 - 09:46 PM","snippet":"","body":"If the objection to Angkas, the motorcycle ride-sharing transport network whose operation has recently been ordered suspended, is that the service it offers is not safe and secure, then we may as well ban riding tandem itself, and revoke the licenses that had been given to other ride-sharing networks. Let’s unpack these objections carefully. First, do two-wheel motor vehicles pose more danger to their riders and passengers than four-wheel vehicles? The answer may seem obvious: Two wheels don’t have the same stability as four wheels, and, therefore, are more dangerous. But, as a motorcycle rider myself, I have to disagree. I think a lot depends on driver experience, and on the inculcation in the general public of a road-sharing ethic. Angkas riders who are trained to carry passengers on a regular basis are surely no less experienced than the average biker in negotiating Metro Manila’s crowded streets. Indeed, I imagine they would be safer drivers than the typical solo biker who might occasionally take a friend or family member as passenger. On the other hand, the objection regarding security (e.g., the danger of being held up or abducted) would equally apply to ride-sharing networks that use cars instead of motorbikes. In fact, such danger also lurks more or less equally in taxis, jeepneys, or buses. Come to think of it, it’s probably easier to jump off a motorcycle than from a taxi or a jeepney if one’s security is threatened. Lastly, the law prohibiting the use of two-wheel vehicles as public utility vehicles may be there, but we have yet to hear of habal-habal drivers being arrested or prevented from plying their routes in remote upland areas where these modified motorbikes (that can take a dozen passengers) are the only means of public transport available. Here we go citing laws that were crafted long before the concept of a “sharing economy” entered the world of business. If we could reinterpret those laws to accommodate entities like Uber and Grab, which, strictly speaking, are not public transport companies that own and operate fleets of vehicles, why can’t the same adaptation be made to allow the local ride-sharing network Angkas to operate legally?  I believe that what’s important, in the final analysis, is that someone can be held accountable when accidents happen. If they have the same driver and passenger insurance provisions as those found in the other transport networks, there should be no further reason to stop Angkas riders from offering their services to the commuting public. That said, I believe it’s important to revisit the original idea that inspired the formation of the successful pioneering entities in the sharing economy — like Airbnb and Uber. This may help guide our legislators in designing new laws that would prevent the idea of sharing from being totally engulfed by the commercial twin with which it made its appearance in the market economy. The idea was simple enough. Some people have things that are in excess of what they personally need — living space, space in their vehicles, time on their hands, books and similar resources they have accumulated, etc. They may not be prepared to donate these to the government or any public entity, but, given the opportunity to do so, they might gladly share these with others, expecting almost nothing in return. Thus, we have carpooling, where neighbors take turns bringing and picking up their children to and from school, instead of each parent waking up every day to bring their child to school, or paying for school bus service. Outside the campus of every big university in the United States and Europe, one would often find the most marvelous secondhand bookshops. Rather than gather dust and use up precious space in cramped student apartments, these books are sold to booksellers for a pittance, and are in turn sold back to other students for just a little more. That, too, is a form of sharing, but with a small difference — someone, in this case, the secondhand bookseller, manages the exchange."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/85024/option-for-commuters","title":"Option for commuters","date":"12:52 AM May 19, 2015","snippet":"THE MOVE of Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya to legalize the operations of so-called ride-sharing firms such as Uber and GrabTaxi is a boon for the riding public.

Earlier targeted by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for allegedly using colorum vehicles, these firms offer a much safer ride to commuters than many of the cabs plying Metro Manila. Abaya is correct in observing that technological innovation can drive progress, especially in transportation where it can provide safer and more convenient options to commuters. Noting that app-based transport services—referring to software applications downloadable to one’s smartphone—help address the increasing demand for mobility, the Department of Transportation and Communications created last week the Transportation Network Vehicle Service classification to allow transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and GrabTaxi to exist within the Philippines’ regulatory framework.  But there is growing apprehension over the LTFRB’s plan to regulate these ride-sharing firms. It currently regulates traditional cab operators, yet the news media are replete with horror stories of cabbies robbing, raping or even killing passengers. Colorum cabs abound, especially at night. Many cabbies also turn away passengers heading to certain destinations, particularly during rush hours, or demand extra charges if there is heavy traffic along the way. And anything left in a regular taxi is more often than not considered lost. Contrast this with the operations of ride-sharing firms. The service lets commuters book through their mobile phone a private vehicle to take them anywhere within Metro Manila. Passengers who book a ride on Uber, for example, can check within minutes on their mobile phone app what kind of vehicle is coming and who the driver is. Payments are charged to a credit or debit card; no cash is involved. The company also conducts a background check on the driver/vehicle owner before being accredited. Passengers are required to open an account where they have to disclose personal details and register a valid credit card. At the end of the service, both driver and passenger can leave feedback for each other.  It’s unfortunate that traditional taxi operators are threatening to sue the DOTC. Instead of complaining, shouldn’t they improve their services to be at par with ride-sharing firms? And this is not the only potential roadblock to ride-sharing. The LTFRB also wants to impose restrictions and requirements that, as the bureaucracy is sadly known for, can end up discouraging prospective ride-sharing participants. The most worrisome is the plan to require a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for all ride-sharing vehicles, which is reportedly not required in other countries where the concept is flourishing. Just how difficult is it to obtain a CPC? Judging from LTFRB requirements, it can take forever. Among the requirements are: copies of verified application forms; operator’s data sheet; route measured capacity certification from the DOTC; evidence of Filipino citizenship; authenticated birth certificate; evidence of financial capability; certificate of average daily balance from a bank; certificate of business name issued by the Department of Trade and Industry; certificate of registration and official receipt of authorized vehicles from the Land Transportation Office; photograph of units being applied for (front, back and sides of the vehicles, and the photo should include the front page of a newspaper to show the date when the picture was taken); location map and picture with dimension of garage with a transfer certificate of title or tax declaration or contract of lease for the specific garage area; and proof of publication of notice of hearing to be submitted during the actual hearing at the LTFRB. An applicant is also required to personally appear during the submission of an application. Whew!  Transportation regulations should facilitate, not hamper, convenient, safe and reliable services to the public. That’s according to Abaya himself. Smartphone-based transportation companies have transformed the way people move in many cities abroad with a safer, more reliable and efficient option. They are about to do the same in Metro Manila. In ensuring passenger safety, ride-sharing firms are way ahead compared with the traditional taxis. Regulatory authorities would do well to keep this in mind."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/206004/gm-debuts-car-sharing-personal-mobility-brand","title":"GM debuts car-sharing, ‘personal mobility’ brand","date":"10:37 AM January 22, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON, United States—General Motors said Thursday it was launching a US car-sharing service under a new “personal mobility” brand dubbed Maven.","body":"WASHINGTON, United States—General Motors said Thursday it was launching a US car-sharing service under a new “personal mobility” brand dubbed Maven. GM said Maven, which will compete with services such as Zipcar, was operating in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with the initial focus on serving the University of Michigan campus.  It will be expanded to major US cities later this year, GM said in a statement. The US auto giant said Maven will be a key part of its strategy to meet evolving transportation needs in a more tech-connected society.  GM this month previously announced an investment in ride-sharing service Lyft, and the acquisition of assets from another sector rival, Sidecar. “GM is at the forefront of redefining the future of personal mobility,” said GM president Dan Ammann.  “With the launch of our car-sharing service through Maven, the strategic alliance with ride-sharing company Lyft, and building on our decades of leadership in vehicle connectivity through OnStar, we are uniquely positioned to provide the high level of personalized mobility services our customers expect today and in the future.” GM said Maven will launch car-sharing services for Chicago residents in the first quarter of 2016 and is expanding its existing program in New York which had been dubbed Let’s Drive NYC. On the Maven website, GM was offering mid-size vehicles for $8 an hour or $56 a day, including fuel costs. As with similar services, customers use smartphones to unlock and lock the cars. The automaker also has initiatives for peer-to-peer car-sharing in Germany, China and on US college campuses. “Maven provides on-demand access, choice and ease of use,” said Julia Steyn, GM vice president for urban mobility.  “With more than 25 million customers around the world projected to use some form of shared mobility by 2020, Maven is a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.” RELATED STORIES First trial against GM over faulty ignitions begins in NY General Motors to sell Chinese-made cars in the US—report"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/212237/dotr-halts-new-uber-grab-applicants-in-metro-manila","title":"DOTr halts new Uber, Grab applicants in Metro Manila","date":"12:26 PM July 22, 2016","snippet":"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) launched a review of existing rules covering on-demand ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab, halting the processing for thousands of applicants seeking to operate in Metro Manila.","body":"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) launched a review of existing rules covering on-demand ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab, halting the processing for thousands of applicants seeking to operate in Metro Manila. The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab. READ: Legal questions ain’t over for Uber “It’s the right decision to stop the issuances and review,” Suntay said in an interview. “We can coexist together with this industry, but what we’re after is a level playing field.” The development also comes as the DOTr, along with other government agencies, move to combat the “crisis” in Metro Manila.

The council has 10 days to send the approved law to City Hall. Mayor Fernando Haddad will then have two weeks to approve or veto the bill. In its first vote on June 30, the council voted 48-1 to prohibit the use of ride-sharing services such as Uber.  Rio de Janeiro’s city council has banned Uber, but Mayor Eduardo Paes must still ratify it. Uber has been banned in Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, the only other two cities where the service is present.  If the measure goes into effect, Sao Paulo Uber drivers who ignore the ban can be fined 1,700 reals ($447) and have their cars confiscated. The service has drawn increasing use since last year’s World Cup of soccer, with many of its cars cleaner and newer than those of regular cabs. Cab drivers complain Uber is unfair competition because its drivers don’t have to pay city fees or undergo official inspections. To prevent the expansion of Uber elsewhere in the country, city councils in at least another 13 state capitals have laws pending approval to ban the service. In Maceio, capital of the northeastern state of Alagoas, city councilman Galba Netto recently told reporters: “We are trying to prevent a future problem, because the arrival of Uber in our city would be a disaster.”  On its Facebook page, Uber said people “who cross the city every day have the right to choose how they will travel the streets of Sao Paulo.” RELATED STORY Brazil cabbies ambush Uber driver — report"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/952036/news-ltfrb-angkas-habal-habal-ride-sharing-job-fair","title":"LTFRB holds job fair for Angkas and ‘habal-habal’ drivers","date":"01:43 PM December 13, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday held a whole-day job fair for drivers of “habal-habal” (motor taxi) and suspended motorcycle-ride hailing app Angkas.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday held a whole-day job fair for drivers of “habal-habal” (motor taxi) and suspended motorcycle-ride hailing app Angkas.

Poe, chairman of the Senate committee on public services, recently met with the heads of the LTFRB and Uber in a bid to iron out issues that had caused inconvenience to Uber drivers and the riding public.  After the meeting, Uber committed to pay “millions of pesos” worth of fine to the LTFRB so it would overturn its earlier decision to suspend the ride-sharing firm’s operations for a month.

READ: Uber offers to pay P10-M fine instead of serving suspension  “You try to multiple that. They (Uber) said they have about 66,000 drivers, then they will have to do the algorithm and formula for this based on how active you are. Something like P100 per day for lost wages but other drivers can receive as much as P1,200 a day depending on how active they are so that will equate, when we were computing how much they will actually write in the pleading, to more than a P100 million,” Poe said. The P10 million that will go the LTFRB will not go to the agency, but to the national treasury according to LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III, said Poe. “It’s P10 million being offered to the LTFRB for the damages for the violations, which will not really stay with the LTFRB, chairman Delgra clarified that will go the national treasury,” she said. But the remaining amount of over P100 million, Poe said, would only be 5 percent of what Uber is earning in a year. “Uber makes money of at least P5 million a day from their drivers; so how much is that, P5 million times 30 days, let’s say so that’s P150 million in a month, something like that,” Poe explained.  “That’s more than how many percent of what they’re earning in a year that’s about maybe 5 percent or more of what they earn in a year so it’s more than a slap on the wrist but since this is very new, it should also send a signal to others,” she said.

Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Deputy Commissioner Nelson Aspe said new guidelines would be issued to spell out the tax responsibilities of all parties in the Uber system.  Apart from the issuance of receipts, the BIR said it expected owners of cars used for Uber rides to file tax returns. Uber drivers who don’t own the cars they use will also be considered employees, hence appropriate taxes should be withheld from their salaries. Uber rides will also be subjected to value-added tax (VAT), which will add 12 percent to total costs. Aspe said the BIR would charge it retroactively.  “All of these taxes are in the present law,” Aspe told reporters at the sidelines of a financial services forum hosted by accounting firm Punongbayan & Araullo. “We’re telling everyone what the law provides… It’s just a reiteration of what they should pay.” Uber drivers who own the cars they use would have to issue receipts as self-employed individuals, like doctors and lawyers. Uber drivers who work for car owners, meanwhile, should issue receipts on behalf of their employers.  Aspe said BIR would dig through information from credit card companies, which are required to make regular reports to the government on all transactions. This will ensure that the tax liabilities of drivers, owners and Uber itself are computed accurately. Uber passengers are charged online using their credit card information. The same rules will apply to other ride-sharing services like GrabTaxi, which offers a similar service called GrabCar, the revenue official added. Unlike Uber, however, GrabTaxi’s business is entirely cash-based, which, according to Aspe, is more difficult to track. The guidelines on Uber rides, which Aspe said would not create new rules but define how existing laws should be applied, would be issued before the end of the year. The requirement for receipts is the latest legal hoop faced by Uber and other ride-sharing service providers. Earlier this year, the Philippines became the first country in the world to issue formal regulations for ride-sharing services, which allow passengers to book rides using smart phone apps. Uber vehicle owners and drivers were required to get licenses from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), much like regular taxis.

But a new study on San Francisco has found the opposite may in fact be true: far from reducing traffic, the companies increased delays by 40 percent as commuters ditched buses or walking for mobile-app summoned rides.  Published Wednesday in Science Advances, the study went back to 2010, before the advent of so-called transportation network companies (TNCs), and compared journey times and road conditions with 2016, by which time they had become a common sighting.   San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are headquartered, grew from 805,000 inhabitants to 876,000 during that period, as 150,000 jobs were added and the road network updated. The authors, from the University of Kentucky and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA), accounted for these changes via a computer model that asked: what would things look like if ride-hailing companies had not come on the scene?  Greg Erhardt, an assistant professor of engineering at the university, told AFP his team had found “some substitution” from private cars to TNCs as well as a slight increase in carpooling. “But the net effect is that two-thirds of TNCs are new cars added to the roadway, that would otherwise not be present,” he said. They also found that weekday vehicle hours of delay — defined as the difference in travel time in congested versus free-flow conditions –- increased by 62 percent between 2010 and 2016. By contrast, in the simulated model without ride-hailing companies, delays went up by only 22 percent — meaning that the TNCs were responsible for 40 percent of the increase. Deadheading and disruption  The findings were challenged by Lyft, which said the study had failed to account for increased freight and commercial deliveries — an area in which Amazon and others have aggressively expanded in recent years, as well as tourism growth. “Lyft is actively working with cities on solutions backed by years of economic and engineering research, such as comprehensive congestion pricing and proven infrastructure investment,” the company said in a statement noting its investments in shared rides and bikes. Uber called for more widespread congestion charging, arguing that “while studies disagree on causes for congestion, almost everyone agrees on the solution.” The study came as thousands of rideshare drivers in major US cities staged a series strikes against pay and working conditions. It also came ahead of Uber’s keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. Lyft went public in March. Proponents of ridesharing often use the argument that the majority of journeys take place at non-peak times, such as when people have gone for a night out and are returning home from bars. But the study found peaks occurring at 7.00 am and 8.00 am and then again around 5.00 pm and 6.00 pm. Among the cars’ most disruptive activities on traffic flow were curbside pickups and drop-offs, especially on major arterial roads, it found. Another notable effect was so-called “deadheading,” which Erhardt explained as driving around in search of the next customer. “It doesn’t serve a purpose in terms of transporting a person. So that’s purely an addition to traffic.” Data scraping The study relied on background traffic speed from GPS data obtained from a commercial vendor, but when the researchers approached the companies to share their own trip data, they were denied access.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); They were forced then to rely on a method of data scraping developed by Northeastern University that uses the companies’ public apps to learn about vehicle movements. Elliot Martin, a research engineer at the University of California Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, who was not connected to the study, said its methodology was rigorous. “I think that they did a good job of trying to draw comparisons, to look at what would have happened in a world where TNCs didn’t exist versus where they did exist,” he said, adding the methodology was the “best available” given the amount of information. Despite the findings, ride-hailing isn’t all bad, said co-author Joe Castiglione of the SFCTA. “They are providing services like helping people move around in the evening when transit isn’t great, or assisting the visually impaired,” he told AFP. The trick, he said, was to determine “how (to) manage the positive benefits without the negative externalities” through new policies like congestion pricing or curbside regulation. Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart city solutions at Harvard, and the former mayor of Indianapolis, agreed. “There’s no love lost today between most cities and Uber, but there’s a lot of customer loyalty, which makes it difficult for cities to cut back too much.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/791018/will-pinoys-warm-up-to-uberpool","title":"Will Pinoys warm up to UberPOOL?","date":"04:15 PM June 16, 2016","snippet":"","body":" MANILA — Would car sharing be more fun in–and for—  the Philippines? Hopefully.  In one of its ways to reduce the alarming traffic congestion in the country, Uber Philippines – a transportation network vehicle service company – launched on Wednesday UberPOOL, the carpool version of Uber. Starting at 6 a.m. Wednesday, passengers from 16 cities and municipalities of Metro Manila availing of Uber service, can ride and reach their location with a 25 percent cheaper fare compared to the usual UBerX – by sharing a ride with their fellow Uber passengers who are headed in the same direction.  With the UberPOOL, people going to the same place at the same time can ride together at a cheaper price, thus reducing number of cars plying Metro Manila. In a press conference at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board office, Laurence Cua, general manager of Uber Philippines, said UberPOOL could help solve the country’s worsening traffic problem, at the same time, reduce carbon and greenhouse gases emitted by vehicles.  According to a 2015 Waze study, Metro Manila has the worst traffic situation on Earth. A Japan International Cooperation Agency study, meanwhile, has put the cost of traffic in the country at P2.4 billion every day. The number of cars is rising at a yearly average rate of 2.13 percent, another study shows. Outgoing LTFRB chair Winston Ginez was happy with the launch during the LTFRB’s 29th anniversary. The regulation on TNVS has been the LTFRB’s legacy, he added. “We and the Department of Transportation and Communication went through an eye in the needle in bringing change and reforms in an old-age public transportation system; we faced a lot of opposition,” Ginez said. In fact, the Philippines is the first country in the world to have a nationwide regulation – from Batanes to Jolo – on ride sharing. “This is not going to be a new franchise. All those authorized will be using the same authority, so no authority, no license shall be issued,” Ginez said when asked if UberPOOL would be an added competition to UV express drivers. As of Apr 6, of the 17,591 Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) units plying the roads of Metro Manila, 4,141 units are operated by Singapore-based GrabCar while 13,450 are operated by Uber, Inc.  Ginez, encouraging more TNVS applications, added that Uber drivers would benefit more from carpooling as it would result in continuous rides and less idle time for drivers. The main goal, he said, would be “to take off more cars on the road… More people, in fewer cars.” Traffic, Cua said, has been an indication of the increase in the Filipino’s purchasing capacity. “We are growing; people are having more money, and buying power; people keep on buying cars.” In fact, Philippines ranked second next to China in terms of vehicle sales worldwide, followed by India. In 2015, 300,000 new cars hit the road in the country, he added. Uber, as an additional option to car ownership, he said, has lessened problems for motorists such as lack of parking space and parking time. Cua said safety of passengers from holdup men and other criminals has been assured by Uber’s 24/7 support system and validation of every rider. Marjorie Dasco, an Uber user, found the idea of UberPOOL great and said she would like to try it out, considering the worsening Metro Manila traffic situation. “The time of waiting to pick another passenger may be from 5 to 10 minutes but in the long run, it’s not a big effort compared to the impact of this initiative on the traffic problem,” Cua told reporters. Since the launching of the app in September 2014, a total of 464 cities and 70 countries have been using Uberpool; and over 100,000 people have taken pooled trips in over 11 cities worldwide including New York, Los Angeles, Beijing and Shanghai. “Uber has revolutionized carpooling through technology in the country. This is much faster than organizing carpooling with officemates. This is real time, and practical, since, we found out that most of the passengers are going in the same direction,” Cua added. To use UberPOOL, a passenger should register first. Uber shall match a passenger with another who is headed in the same direction, and shall notify the passengers through the application the places where the Uber driver picks up another passenger. The passengers are also assured that “they are never taken more than a few minutes out of their way.” Payment is on a credit card basis. Passengers are expected to pay just like a normal Uber trip and will be given an electronic receipt after.  SFM"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/266576/bike-sharing-biz-heats-up-in-korea","title":"Bike-sharing biz heats up in Korea","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SEOUL — South Korea’s ride-sharing companies are expanding their business portfolios into electric bike-sharing, creating high expectations as municipalities scramble to introduce the service as an alternative to conventional transportation.","body":"SEOUL — South Korea’s ride-sharing companies are expanding their business portfolios into electric bike-sharing, creating high expectations as municipalities scramble to introduce the service as an alternative to conventional transportation. The country’s major messenger app company, Kakao, has entered the e-bike sharing business with a new service called Kakao T Bike. The company began its service on Mar. 6 in Incheon and Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province.  Socar, a Seoul-based car-sharing startup, also joined the foray by investing in a young e-bike sharing service provider, Nine2One. The company said it would launch the sharing service within this month. “We are hoping to provide various transportation options for consumers without cars,” Socar CEO Lee Jae-woong said when he announced the plan for launching the sharing service on Mar. 6. “We can resolve traffic problems by reducing the number of cars on the streets.”  The bike-sharing business is the focus of intense competition across the country, whether the bicycles are conventional or electric. The country has allowed electronic bicycles to run on the lanes alongside ordinary vehicles since March last year. Inspired by the success of a similar endeavor in Seoul, some of the surrounding municipalities such as Seongnam and Suwon have been joining hands with global bike-sharing platforms.  Seoul has been operating a bike-sharing service since 2015. The bicycles are available at designated places scattered around Seoul. Currently, about 20,000 are being provided to the public by the Seoul government. “The number of bicycles (available for sharing service) is 20 per every 10,000 Seoul citizens,” Seoul city government said. “Most of them are located at least 20 meters away from the subway and bus stations.” In Suwon, about 5,000 bikes are being used as part of the sharing service since the program was launched in January last year. The municipal government is working with Singapore-based bike-sharing company O-bike. Seongnam has also introduced a similar bike-sharing service in cooperation with Kakao. About 600 electric bikes are part of the service. Some 400 Kakao bikes are operational at Songdo, Incheon. The Korean ride-sharing companies said their businesses would ride high, as bike-sharing has gained popularity as a form of environmentally friendly transportation amid growing concern over air pollution.  “Although we make money out of the car-sharing business, our ultimate goal is to reduce the number of cars,” Socar CEO Lee Jae-woong wrote on Facebook last week. “It is the only way to make our business sustainable.”  Automobile exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major contributors to worsening air pollution in South Korea. Some vehicles with harmful pollutants can be restricted from operating in Seoul when the city  government declares emergency measures to reduce the level of fine dust. The companies also stressed that their service is much more user-friendly than those provided by the municipalities, as the users don’t have to be bothered looking for parking spaces after borrowing the bicycles. For example, Kakao users are able to check out where the bicycles are placed via its Kakao T apps before using them. The borrowed bicycles can be returned to any places that the users see fit — except for the places such as motorways, underground parking places and the building’s entrances. “For those seeking to travel a short distance, we can provide alternative to traditional transportation,” Kakao Mobility CEO Jung Joo-hwan said on March 5 when the company launched the bicycle sharing service in Yeonsu-gu, Incheon. Kakao Mobility is seeking to provide about 3,000 bicycles for nationwide sharing service after achieving the success of its service in Incheon. About 1,000 electronic bicycles are operated in Incheon, with most of them being manufactured by Samchuly and Alton Sports. After investing into Nine2One, Socar is planning to launch its own bicycle-sharing service in Seoul by the end of this month. The company said it will provide 350 bicycles as initial service and expand the number to 2000 for nationwide service."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/925898/ltfrb-uber-tncs-transportation-network-companies-public-transportation-grace-poe-aileen-lizada","title":"LTFRB lifts ban, orders Uber to pay P190-M fine","date":"07:10 AM August 27, 2017","snippet":"Uber welcomed the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) cutting short its suspension in exchange for a P190-million fine, but the ride-sharing giant kept silent on Saturday as to when it intended to settle the penalty.","body":"Uber welcomed the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) cutting short its suspension in exchange for a P190-million fine, but the ride-sharing giant kept silent on Saturday as to when it intended to settle the penalty. The LTFRB ordered Uber to pay the huge fine instead after lifting its one-month suspension, imposed on Aug. 14, that sparked public outrage and forced 36,367 vehicles off the streets.  “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” said Cat Avelino, Uber’s head of communications, in a statement. On its Twitter account, Uber said it hoped to resume service  “this coming week.”  The transport agency said late on Friday that it would grant Uber’s petition to resume operations in exchange for the P190-million fine — much stiffer than Uber’s P10-million offer. It also required the company to pay about P20 million a day in financial assistance to its drivers for lost earnings.  Sen. Grace Poe welcomed the lifting of Uber’s suspension but nevertheless expressed disappointment at the timing of the decision. Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, pointed out that Uber would be unable to comply with the LTFRB order at once because the banks are closed on weekends. The LTFRB handed down its ruling right before the start of a three-day weekend, thus depriving Uber the chance to immediately resume service. “I am quite disappointed that the LTFRB decision was issued late Friday afternoon, effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties,” Poe said in a statement. “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around Metro [Manila] with their families,” she added.  Because the country is commemorating National Heroes Day tomorrow, the earliest that Uber can only comply with the board’s order is on Tuesday. In its eight-page order, the LTFRB said that Uber’s fine was “commensurate to the penalty of suspension.” It added that based on the data submitted by Uber, the company earned between P7 million and P10 million daily from about 150,000 trips. “[The P190-million fine] is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the order read. Uber was suspended for defying an LTFRB moratorium on the acceptance of new drivers as the agency studied how to regulate the growing ride-sharing industry. Uber’s rival Grab followed the directive. After filing a motion for reconsideration on Aug. 15, Uber resumed operations, only to stop on the same day when the LTFRB board denied its petition. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance [to Uber drivers] remitted,” the board resolution said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Uber should continue to provide assistance to its drivers until it had settled the fine. She added that for Uber to resume operations, it should provide proof of compliance from its bank, indicating that the drivers had indeed received the amount due them. The board explained that Uber’s P190-million fine is only about a third of what it would have spent if it fully served its suspension. Uber would have also shelled out about P597 million in financial aid to its drivers for a month. But Poe said the LTFRB could have offered relief to a lot more people had it given Uber the chance to comply with the ruling at once. “If the LTFRB had allowed Uber to operate right away, then this could have served as a great relief to our people, most of whom rely on TNVS (transport network vehicle service) due to the comfort, reliability and safety they provide,” she said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The P190-million penalty, she also said, “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” Commuters had voiced out their disappointment in the suspension of Uber, saying services like these offered a convenient alternative, especially with problems with irascible and choosy taxi drivers who overcharged fares. Uber said this month it was accepting new applications for vehicles but was not processing them pending its discussions with the LTFRB. It also urged the government to simplify the accreditation process, with a representative telling Poe’s committee: “We cannot impose 1900s regulations on today’s technological innovations.” —With a report from AFP"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978847/after-grab-uber-merger-ltfrb-says-3-new-tnvs-to-enter-ph","title":"After Grab-Uber merger, LTFRB says 3 new TNVS to enter PH","date":"04:32 PM March 28, 2018","snippet":"Ride-hailing platform Grab’s imminent monopoly of the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) sector may be short-lived as the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced on Wednesday the upcoming entry of three new ride-sharing applications—Go Lag, Owto and Hype.","body":"Ride-hailing platform Grab’s imminent monopoly of the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) sector may be short-lived as the Land Transportation Franchise and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced on Wednesday the upcoming entry of three new ride-sharing applications—Go Lag, Owto and Hype. LTFRB Board Member Atty. Aileen Lizada said three local ride-sharing companies Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their accreditation before the agency.  “So if you say that there is no competition, soon there will be, and any competition is good for any industry because it benefits the riding public,” Lizada said in a press conference at Grab’s processing center at Mega Tent in Libis, Quezon City. The announcement came days after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move that secured the Singapore-based company’s dominance in the region’s TNVS industry.  Lizada also allayed concerns that the merger would result in higher fares as public utility vehicle operators have to first secure the LTFRB’s approval before increasing their fares. “Grab on its own, just like any other public utility vehicle, cannot increase its fare on its own,” she said.  “We also have monitoring. We know ano yung range nila, and if there are complaints, we see them and read them sa Twitter as well as our Facebook account, LTFRB Citizen Enforcer, and @ltfrb for Twitter,” she added. Lizada said that with the Grab-Uber merger, the LTFRB would “all the more” be strict in implementing transportation rules and regulations. “We will not allow any infractions, any violations especially so with this merger. All the more that we will be strict in monitoring,” she said. Lizada explained that before approving any petition for fare increases, the LTFRB conducts public hearings where the agency’s board members, including representatives from the National Economic and Development Administration, deliberate on the petition.      /muf READ: Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/206358/ride-hailing-app-grab-commits-to-ease-manilas-traffic-amid-regulatory-woes","title":"Ride-hailing app Grab commits to ease Manila’s traffic amid regulatory woes","date":"12:10 AM January 30, 2016","snippet":"SINGAPORE—Grab, a regional ride-hailing tech giant that allows passengers to book taxi rides and private cars on their smartphones, will continue to work with the Philippine government in helping solve traffic congestion in Metro Manila despite facing regulatory hurdles.","body":"SINGAPORE—Grab, a regional ride-hailing tech giant that allows passengers to book taxi rides and private cars on their smartphones, will continue to work with the Philippine government in helping solve traffic congestion in Metro Manila despite facing regulatory hurdles. Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/905563/uberboat-launches-on-the-croatian-coast","title":"UberBOAT launches on the Croatian coast","date":"10:00 PM June 14, 2017","snippet":"Users of the ride-sharing and private driver app heading to Croatia this summer will be able to island-hop with Uber’s on-demand boat service UberBOAT, connecting coastal destinations in the country.","body":"Users of the ride-sharing and private driver app heading to Croatia this summer will be able to island-hop with Uber’s on-demand boat service UberBOAT, connecting coastal destinations in the country.

Travelers will be able to share the ride with other tourists to split the cost of the journey between Split (or Divulje, where the nearest airport is located) and the famous island of Hvar. The reverse journey is also possible. The transfer costs €352 (a little less than $400) for eight people or €440 (roughly $500) for 12 people.  As well as offering speedboat connections, Uber will be trying its hand at tourist services with boat trips. Vacationers will be able to book full or half day trips to visit the coast from Hvar, Dubrovnik or Split. Average pricing will be €980 (around $1100) for eight people for a day trip.

It’s that simple. So my advice to taxi operators: Modernize, innovate and improve your systems and services,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a statement on Wednesday.  “Commuters say they feel safer taking these private vehicles-for-hire, that the fleet are newer, that app services are faster and more efficient. So why put a stop to what is clearly for their benefit? Poorer services should be upgraded to match their competition—not the other way around,” he added. Abaya’s statement was the latest effort by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to show that it was open to new technology solutions after the arrest last month of a private vehicle owner who had partnered with Uber. The incident drew intense criticism, mainly from Netizens.  The DOTC’s stance, however, also comes at a time when Uber is facing negative publicity worldwide. It is currently under fire overseas for comments reportedly made by one of its executives on how the firm can finance smear campaigns against journalists critical of it and how Uber personnel can access customers’ private travel information.  “We have not, do not and will not investigate journalists. Those remarks have no basis in the reality of our approach,” an Uber spokesperson said in an e-mail to Inquirer, referring to statements reportedly made by Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice president of business, at a private event. The incident was first reported by Buzzfeed. Uber further clarified its privacy policy in a Nov. 18 blog post. “Uber has a strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver’s data. The only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes. Our policy has been communicated to all employees and contractors,” it said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to hold a hearing on Nov. 24 in line with a plan to update its rules to accommodate technology solutions like Uber, a ride-sharing service available in several countries. The LTFRB has identified the existing “vehicles-for-hire” category as the likely classification for Uber vehicles, it said. While considered “colorum” since these vehicles are operating without a transport franchise, the LTFRB has not taken any further action since the DOTC signaled its intention to work with the service. Ginez earlier said that the arrest in Manila stemmed from complaints filed by various groups, including the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association.  Uber has been facing challenges and even protests in other parts of the world, mainly by taxi operators, who say it and other similar apps allow the operation of illegal public transportation services which are regulated and require a government franchise or permit. During a recent hearing, congressmen criticized the LTFRB for allowing Uber to operate in the country despite the fact that its vehicles may be considered colorum."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/896698/ltfrb-nixes-2-new-uber-ride-offers","title":"LTFRB nixes 2 new Uber ride offers","date":"01:13 AM May 15, 2017","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has warned a transport network company (TNC) not to implement two new features it wants to offer to commuters, citing safety and fare issues that have yet to be approved by the agency.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has warned a transport network company (TNC) not to implement two new features it wants to offer to commuters, citing safety and fare issues that have yet to be approved by the agency. According to Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, Uber cannot roll out UberMoto in Cebu and UberXL in other parts of the country as these are not compliant with the agency’s terms and conditions for TNCs.  UberMoto allows commuters to book a motorcycle through the app while UberXL can accommodate up to six passengers at a time. Uber said that UberMoto was in response to Cebu City’s planned release of an ordinance to “level up the operation of habal-habal (motorcycle-for-hire) drivers.” UberXL, on the other hand, was the result of passenger demand for six-seater cars which it said would encourage ride-sharing, thus easing traffic.  “Everybody has a good idea. But if you allow everybody with a good idea to implement it, we would be disorganized,” Lizada said. She added that the LTFRB had disallowed another TNC, Grab, from operating its motorcycle ride-sharing feature, pointing out that encouraging more motorcycles on the road would go against the government’s vision of a modern public transport. “We are promoting high-capacity transport like buses and P2P (point-to-point) service. You are going against the thrust of the government. You will flood the roads with motorcycles,” Lizada said.She warned that peer operators who would offer the features may be apprehended for operating without a valid franchise.  As for UberXL, Lizada said that six-seater vehicles under Uber and Grab have yet to be approved by the LTFRB. Aside from possibly affecting the operations of other public utility vehicles like tourist vans, the new feature’s fare structure has yet to be discussed with the agency, she pointed out. According to the company’s computation, UberXL passengers will be charged a base fare of P60 while P8.55 will be added for every kilometer and P3 for every minute. “They better stop this UberMoto and UberXL. There has to be a sense of regulation at their end. If they are not able to comply, they better bring their business elsewhere,” Lizada said, quoting LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III’s stern warning to Uber. The LTFRB is set to hold a meeting on May 23 in which Uber’s compliance will be discussed. Lizada said that if the TNC fails to comply, they may cancel or suspend its accreditation with the agency. “You have a good program, marketing, but you can’t just implement it without even telling us.

They now use “Para,” a tricycle booking app developed by Jovan Ortega, president and chief operating officer of Para Software Inc.  Around 1,700 tricycles ply the streets here but only 140 have joined the network at its initial launch on Nov. 28, said Sean Sarmiento, projects officer of the city government. In neighboring San Juan town, 40 tricycles are part of the Para network, he said.  Technology Ortega, 28, an information technology professional, said his group began developing the app in 2015, believing that the provinces needed to benefit from the technology.  No rules governing apps and sharing platforms are enforced in the provinces, but only local governments regulate tricycles, according to Jojo Guadiz, Ilocos regional director of the Land Transportation Office. According to Ortega, the company operates like any other business entity in this city and San Juan, where they have to get business permits and pay taxes. Sarmiento said he paid P40 for a trip from the City Hall to Poro Point, using the app, a distance that would cost him P30. Like the ride-sharing company that uses a booking app, Para requires clients to enter their destination to be informed as to how much the trip costs. Knowing the cost is convenient for passengers who sometimes deal with exorbitant fare charged by tricycle drivers, said Joe Hipol, an employee of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.  Demand “With the growing population, the demand for tricycles as the most commonly used mode of transportation had surged as not all people have cars of their own and majority still opt to commute daily. Para offers a solution,” said the Para website. But unlike other apps, Para signs up tricycles operating legally. “Our app is basically a communications line between tricycle drivers and passengers,” Ortega said. Tricycle drivers using the app are screened to ensure passenger safety and to protect the company. In Binalonan town, Pangasinan province, ride-sharing firm “Grab Taxi Holdings” launched its “Grab Trike” on Oct. 26, with 40 units of “tuktok” vehicles taking part in the tricycle-hailing network. Tuktok is the local name for electric tricycles. The town government said Grab Trike would address exorbitant fares, complaints about arrogant tricycle drivers and those who only ferry passengers to specific destinations.

The development marks the opening of the Naia terminals to popular ridesharing platforms which allow passengers to book rides in taxi cabs and private cars using their smartphones. The Philippines was the first country in the world to release regulations covering ride-sharing, legitimizing the business amid protests by traditional taxi operators. These rules, however, left it to MIAA to decide whether or not to allow ridesharing operations at the four Naia terminals.  “MIAA wanted to keep track of the vehicles picking up passengers, as well as the identity of the drivers,” Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board chair Winston Ginez said in an interview on Monday.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/923358/bill-compels-govt-officials-to-take-public-rides-during-rush-hour","title":"Bill compels gov’t officials to take public rides during rush hour","date":"07:06 AM August 17, 2017","snippet":"Government officials, including lawmakers and Cabinet members, may be forced to put themselves in commuters’ shoes under a new bill that would compel them to use public transport during rush hour at least once a month.","body":"Government officials, including lawmakers and Cabinet members, may be forced to put themselves in commuters’ shoes under a new bill that would compel them to use public transport during rush hour at least once a month. As outrage mounted over a host of transportation issues, especially the suspension of the ride-sharing company Uber a lawmaker has filed a bill that would force officials, including those of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, to “empathize” with the riding public.  Weekday rush hours Under the proposal of Aangat Tayo Rep. Neil Abayon, officials and employees of national and local government offices will be required to habitually ride buses, commuter trains, light rail, taxis and transport network vehicle service, public utility jeepneys and tricycles.  They will be required to do so “at least once every calendar month during weekday rush hours using each of the various modes” of public transport, according to the bill filed on Tuesday. Flying economy  Public servants will also, by default, have to fly economy “regardless of rank,” under Abayon’s bill. Officials covered by the bill will include those with the rank, or its equivalent, of division chief all the way to department secretary. Though not explicitly stated in the bill, members of Congress are covered. “The personal, firsthand experience of riding public transportation will enable legislators to gain real world perspectives and inputs in aid of legislation,” Abayon said in his bill’s explanatory note. But there are exceptions, including those with physical handicap or serious medical conditions. The President, Vice President, the Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court may also be exempted for security reasons. “However, these particular constitutional officials may voluntarily set aside the exception” provided they are accompanied by a personal security team under terms determined by the Presidential Security Group and the Philippine National Police, it adds.  No punitive provisions The bill, however, has no punitive provisions, meaning there are no consequences for noncompliance. In his explanatory note, Abayon said public service “requires empathy and concerns for the people being served.” “Public service improves when it is rendered with empathy and compassion. Public service requires living modestly and does not mean entitlement to perks such as business-class and first-class accommodations with airlines,” he said. ‘Publicity gimmick’ Transport and commuter groups assailed the bill. “It’s just a publicity gimmick. What we need is for the government to come up with more good transport programs, such as having a publicly owned, efficient modern mass transport system,” said George San Mateo, president of Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide. Maricor Akol, president of the National Center for Commuters’ Safety and Protection, noted government officials needed security. Their battalion of aides and security would just cram an already packed transport system and elbow out the legitimate commuters. —With a report from Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/923443/uber-fine-transport-network-company-tnc-fined-ltfrb-suspension-pay","title":"Uber offers to pay P10-M fine instead of serving suspension","date":"01:19 PM August 17, 2017","snippet":"Transport network company Uber on Thursday offered P10 million rather than have their services suspended.","body":"Transport network company Uber on Thursday offered P10 million rather than have their services suspended. “We thank the Senate Committee on Public Services and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board for the productive meeting yesterday.

After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282346/grab-to-implement-addtl-safety-measures-in-car-services-vs-covid-19-spread","title":"‘New normal’ ushers in Grab’s ‘no-touch policy’ in car services","date":"02:07 PM May 28, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”. Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

Both are also, to Filipinos, the most familiar forms of the so-called “sharing economy,” along with their smaller variants. It’s the age of smartphones and creative apps (techspeak for application software) that has made all this possible. It’s all about a business model built on the sharing of resources, making it possible for consumers to access goods without the need to own them. The model works for items that are costly to buy and own, and widely owned by people who do not make full use of them. Cars and bedrooms have become the most common examples. One can also rent driveway space (as parking spaces) in Canada, camping spaces in Sweden, and even washing machines in France. It’s all about customer interface, or providing a convenient way to connect people who need a product or service with people who have such products or services to share—or, more accurately, rent out.  Uber, the “ride-sharing” app that has upset the taxi industry wherever it does business, was reported to be operating in 300 cities in 58 countries as of midyear. In Metro Manila, it has become the preferred choice of tech-savvy commuters who see it as a safer and more reliable alternative to taxis. It gained wide attention last year when the Land Transport Franchising and Regulatory Board began cracking down on Uber car drivers, for supposedly providing transport services illegally. The concept behind Uber, as in other “sharing economy” business models, is an appealing one: Anyone who can share the use of his/her car can readily hire it out to someone needing a ride, using the app. Member owners/drivers are screened by Uber, while both users and drivers may rate each other so that they can see who have good or not-so-good records as drivers or passengers. Airbnb (Air Bed & Breakfast), a platform by which people can rent out space in their homes for short-term stays, now has over 1.5 million listings in 34,000 cities and 190 countries. I know many who are avid users, and are able to save significantly over normally much higher costs of comparable hotel accommodations. There is the added bonus of a wider choice of locations and facilities to suit a traveler’s particular needs and tastes. Like in Uber, renters can rate the facilities they hire, while owners can also rate their customers, helping provide information to both sides that could minimize their risks of dissatisfaction. Founded in August 2008, Airbnb has gone well beyond simply renting out air beds and shared spaces that it started with, on to a wide variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, castles, boats, manors, tree houses, tepees, igloos, private islands and other properties.  Uber and Airbnb are but two of a growing field of Internet platforms that have turned the concept of sharing into a profitable business model. Apart from the “sharing economy” tag, other terms are used to describe the arrangement, such as “access economy,” “collaborative consumption” and the more technical “peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.” Such models offer a number of benefits, both to individuals and to society as a whole. For one thing, it is argued to promote greater inclusiveness through improved access to goods for people who otherwise can’t afford buying them. Proponents also cite increased independence, flexibility and self-reliance for both consumers and providers. For example, it has been cited that homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage after losing their jobs to recession have been able to save their homes with incomes due to Airbnb rentals. Economists recognize how it promotes greater and wider competition through decentralization and removal of entry-barriers. Development advocates like the way it enhances stronger communities and increased participatory democracy. And environmentalists welcome how it helps reduce adverse environmental impacts, save costs through borrowing and recycling, and promote more sustainable consumption and production patterns in cities worldwide.  But there are downsides as well. The taxi and hotel industries are obviously aggrieved by the surge in popularity of Uber and Airbnb, and one must worry about the welfare of workers in these industries as well. In Metro Manila, it is suspected that the “Uber phenomenon” may be contributing to already bad traffic congestion. I’ve heard of an instance when a friend who tapped into the app was surprised to find that more than 200 Uber cars were within reach of his office in Makati. Because it has turned out to be so lucrative (some report earning tens of thousands of pesos a month from one car), enterprising Filipinos have been purchasing fleets of cars with the sole intent of operating them with hired drivers via Uber—a departure from its original concept of ride-sharing. There is also concern that the dominant firms, while promoting more competition within the products of which they facilitate the sharing, are themselves becoming dominant monopolies as tech platforms in their respective areas. As first movers, they have managed to leverage that advantage into massive financing running into tens of billions of dollars, which in turn can scare away potential competitors. It is thus time for an appropriate legal framework that will maximize and widen the benefits of the sharing economy, while providing necessary safeguards to protect overall public interest. * * * cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/930533/ltfrb-only-3-cars-per-uber-grab-operator","title":"LTFRB: Only 3 cars per Uber, Grab operator","date":"06:24 AM September 14, 2017","snippet":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday.","body":"Ride-sharing services providers under transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber will be limited to a fleet of not more than three vehicles, Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LFTRB) chair Martin Delgra told senators on Wednesday. At a Senate briefing on the Department of Transportation budget, Delgra told Sen. Grace Poe that the LTFRB would issue a memorandum circular on this new requirement in “moving forward to solve this issue” on regulating the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS).  “We have to go back to the original concept of ride-sharing. We cannot allow that there are TNVS operators operating more than 20 or 30 units,” he told Poe who asked him whether the LTFRB would limit the number of vehicles to be owned by TNVS operators. Asked by Poe what would happen to operators with 10 or more units, Delgra replied: “We know we cannot simply drop them.”  He said he was aware that a large number of TNVS operators had gone to the extent of borrowing money from banks to “get a car so they would be able to put it in Uber or Grab.” According to Delgra, there will be a “transition period” for those who will be affected by the new requirement and they will be offered options.  “Considering the fact that they are actually maintaining a fleet already; they own 20 units under one name [so] they can go [into] taxi service. Second, they can also go into [the] shuttle service if they want. And third, they can also go into tourist transport,” Delgra said. The LTFRB earlier said it would come out this month with new regulations governing the app-based transport industry such as extending the validity of franchise given to drivers.

In a statement, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering a review of the deal regardless if the transaction falls under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. The Uber app, which has provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, will no longer be functional starting on April 9.  “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anti-competitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives on Monday. It was not clear if the statement preceded or followed their meeting.  The acquisition would likely have a “far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it is looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.” During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-sharing services, and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways – through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met – one of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable.  As of press time, PCC said that it does not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978678/ltfrb-higher-fares-unlikely-with-grabs-takeover-of-uber","title":"LTFRB: Higher fares unlikely with Grab’s takeover of Uber","date":"05:08 AM March 28, 2018","snippet":"With Grab soon the dominant ride-sharing app in the country, commuters should not worry about exorbitant rates as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it would continue to monitor and check the transport network company’s (TNC) compliance with its fare structure.","body":"With Grab soon the dominant ride-sharing app in the country, commuters should not worry about exorbitant rates as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it would continue to monitor and check the transport network company’s (TNC) compliance with its fare structure. On Monday, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada allayed fears that Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations would result in an undue fare hike and a monopoly of the ride-hailing industry.  Farfetched scenarios Both scenarios were unlikely as the LTFRB was familiar with Grab’s formula in computing its fares while there were three other TNCs seeking accreditation with the transport board, Lizada said.  Grab has a pending fare hike petition with the LTFRB to cushion the impact of the government’s TRAIN law. While it will retain its P40 base fare, it has sought an increase in its current per kilometer rate of P10-P14 to P11-P15. It also wants its per-minute rate of P2 to be raised to P2.10. The LTFRB will hear Grab’s petition on April 3.  In a statement sent to its users on Monday, Uber said it would transfer its services to the Grab app by April 8, adding that commuters could still use its app in more than 80 countries where it continued to operate. Lizada said that Uber drivers need not worry about the transfer as the franchise issued by the LTFRB to app-based drivers were now generic. “Unlike before, it was exclusive to either Grab or Uber. With the system in place now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accreditations,” she explained. All incentives given to Uber drivers “will be addressed and honored by Grab,” Lizada added. Grab’s assurance  According to Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu, their acquisition of Uber meant that passengers and drivers alike could be assured of “improved ride-sharing services.” “With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” he said. Sen. Win Gatchalian asked the Philippine Competition Commission to keep a close eye on “any possible anticompetitive practices that will take advantage of this situation.” “We believe that this buyout is not favorable to Filipino commuters as it will lessen choices for all of us,” he said in a statement. —With a report from Christine O.

The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand.

The much-awaited Uber launch in Cebu was scheduled on Dec. 3 withannouncements  posted online for a 20 percent discount from Dec. 3 to 9.  It said “Uber partners will be ready to take your ride requests. Experience the 5-star service Uber has become known for — to and from anywhere in Metro Cebu: from Consolacion to Talisay, and all of Mactan.” Cebu Daily News e-mailed Uber’s online support team for comment but got no reply yesterday. “We’re coordinating with the LTFRB and our lawyers for our next steps,” said Grab Philippines spokesman Lorelei Olalia in a text message.  Grab Philippines operates only one of its formats, GrabTaxi, in Cebu. GrabCar, which is similar to Uber, operates only in Manila. On its Facebook page, Grab Philippines said it will “continue to operate as usual” until they receive a copy of the court order. “We are hopeful that we will get (government) support to be able to provide safe and convenient GrabCar rides in the country. Our commitment towards providing the highest quality of service remains,” the company said. Judge Santiago Arenas of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court has stopped for 20 days the accepting, processing and approval of permits to operate Uber and GrabCar operations under Transportation Network Vehicle Service without a certificate of public convenience (CPC). The 20-day restraining order halts  implementation of Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) and LTFRB issuances on accreditation, conditions and implementing guidelines to operate TNVS. LTFRB board member Antonio Enrile Inton, Jr., in a text message to CDN, said they respect the  court’s stoppage order. About 7,000 units applied for the TNVS and there is already “cutthroat competition among them (applicants),” he said. The court order was based on the petition of the Angat Tsuper Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator ng Pilipinas Genuine Organization Transport Coalition (STOP and Go), Inc., represented by Pascual Magno, which claimed that the income of taxi and Utility Vehicles (UV) Express drivers has decreased because of the ride-sharing services."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/915254/we-are-operating-at-a-loss-grab-tells-ltfrb","title":"‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB","date":"03:43 PM July 19, 2017","snippet":"Contrary to Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board’s (LTFRB) claim that  ride-sharing firms were earning  millions of pesos,  Grab Philippines said it has been “operating at a loss.”","body":"Contrary to Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board’s (LTFRB) claim that  ride-sharing firms were earning  millions of pesos,  Grab Philippines said it has been “operating at a loss.” “Grab Philippines does not make a single peso from its 20% commission on rides.

Grab explained that all payments for transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications go to legal fees and filing, including the fees of thousands of its drivers and   operators, who have been granted   Provisional Authority (PA). The firm then released  the  breakdown of the  fees  for the processing of new TNVS applications,  which amounts to a total of P5,600 per unit.  “Aside from this, there are a good number of PA grantees that never got to pay their fees and these costs were subsequently shouldered by Grab,” it said. Despite this, Grab said  it is  still on “investment mode.” The LTFRB earlier estimated  that Grab Philippines was earning P60 million monthly from its 20-percent share of its drivers’ income.

Normally, the 21-kilometer ride should just take him at least 40 minutes by bus or UV Express shuttle. But the construction of the Metro Rail Transit Line 7 along Commonwealth Avenue, which started in March, has since been forcing him and thousand of others to endure hours in traffic bottlenecks.  The fumes and the noise, the unbearable heat, the draining experience of taking public utility vehicles have begun to take their toll on his health, which is why he started using ride-hailing apps like Grab to reach his destination with his composure and sanity still intact. But while app-based vehicles offer comfort and alternative routes, nothing still beats having an efficient public mass transport, he said. “I have found a very convenient option. But we can have a more viable, long-term solution if the entire system is improved and properly managed.”  Over the past two years, since they first hit the streets in the last few months of the Aquino administration, vehicles operating on the platforms of transport network companies (TNCs) have provided a convenient—albeit costlier—choice for commuters to get from A to B in the heavily congested capital. They have proven to be a game-changer in the Filipino riding experience, a welcome disruption amid the scarcity of public rides during rush hour and the added aggravations of encountering with choosy, rude or cheating taxi drivers.  At present, a total of six TNCs are authorized by the government to operate, with Grab remaining as the dominant player, having acquired the Southeast Asian operations of rival Uber in April this year. The five other companies were later accredited by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) supposedly to prevent a monopoly of the sector. As described in industry parlance, they “maximize transport resources” through ride-sharing, as in the case of Grab and Hype, or tap an existing pool of taxi drivers as way to revitalize their industry, like in the case of Hirna, GoLag and Micab. The sixth accredited player, Owto, works on an app that arranges one trip per booking and has yet to offer carpooling services (multiple passengers, multiple stops) similar to that of Grab and Hype. Great equalizer For Willie Bercasio, GoLag spokesperson, ride-hailing platforms see themselves “filling in the demand for mass transport… and helping set the direction for the transport sector.” “Until such time when the total transport infrastructure for public commute is completed, this will be the role that TNCs have to play,” Bercasio said.  “We like to believe that the solution to traffic congestion is innovation,” added Coco Mauricio, Hirna president. “This is where ride-hailing apps come in as a technology-based solution… It’s the great equalizer.” Of the players currently in the market, Grab and local apps Hype and Owto offer TNVS or transport network vehicular services (a ride classification coined by the LTFRB). This means that the booked vehicle is privately owned either by the driver or by another person listed as the operator. All three companies offer incentive schemes and commission rates to entice more people to drive for their platform. “It’s a way for them to earn sustainable income,” said Jennifer Silan, Hype spokesperson. “The beauty of this lies in creating more jobs and providing affordable and convenient rides for our countrymen.” Opportunity Shortly after Grab took over local Uber operations, the former found itself being swamped by as many as 600,000 to 800,000 bookings a day. The situation presented an opportunity for new players like GoLag (short for Go Laguna), Hirna (mainly based in Davao City) and Micab (based in Cebu). But instead of tapping private vehicles or adding to their road-choking volume, they encourage taxi drivers already plying the streets to use their app to get more rides. “There’s no shortage in demand; the problem is the supply,” Micab chief executive officer Eddie Ybañez said. “By reviving the taxis through app-based platforms, we could unite the taxi sector into providing better services for the passengers.” These province-based TNCs also address the dearth of taxi cabs in their respective areas, where passengers mostly have to rely on jeepneys and tricycles. Having taxis in these locations would make it easier for travelers to cover their so-called “last mile”—or the last stretch from the bus or airport terminal to their homes, Bercasio said. Fare structures(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Each TNC has its own fare structure approved by the LTFRB, while TNVS share common fare components: a booking fee of P40, a P13 to P15-per-km rate, a P1.25 to P2-per-minute travel rate, and, when demand shoots up, an allowable price surge of up to two times the regular fare. Those using taxi-hailing apps, on the other hand, follow the recalibrated fare structure currently being implemented by the LTFRB: P40 base fare, P13.5 per km rate, and a P2-per-minute travel rate. The last few months have seen protracted arguments between Grab and the LTFRB over how much freedom can be given to TNCs in setting their own fares. But all agree that having a uniform fare matrix would help keep fares affordable for the riding public. There’s also a “problem” arising from the current state of affairs wherein the majority of the 50,000 drivers on LTFRB’s master list are partnered with the leader Grab. With Grab offering substantially better incentives compared to those from smaller, homegrown competitors, it could “corner the market” not just in terms of riders but drivers as well, Bercasio said. Hype thus filed a petition in the board in August to oppose the renewal of Grab’s accreditation for allegedly deceiving its drivers with “unsustainable” incentives and for flouting LTFRB regulations. The Inquirer sought Grab’s comment on the petition but has yet to receive a response as of writing. “It’s really difficult to go head-to-head against a giant like Grab,” added Owto founder Paolo Libertad. “That’s why it’s important for the government to nurture local firms like us, to help us not to get bullied, by providing measures that protect us.” Long-term solution? Like Marcelo, the weary commuter from “Farview,” traffic expert Dr. Primitivo Cal said TNCs should not be considered the long-term solution to Metro Manila’s traffic problems. For one, TNVS can’t even be used for paid transport under Republic Act No. 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, explained Cal, executive director of the University of the Philippines Planning and Development Research Foundation.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The law, he said, contemplates a system where all motor vehicles must be registered under clear classifications. TNVS units that operate under Grab, Hype and Owto fall under “private passenger automobiles,” which by law “cannot be used for hire under any circumstances and shall not be used to solicit, accept, or be used to transport passengers or freight for pay.” Though the Department of Transportation has issued Order No. 2015-11 recognizing TNVS as a new form of service “to address the large demand… in expeditious and responsive ways,” Cal said it cannot supersede RA 4136. He added that the government should have fixed the legal framework so as “not to cloud its true character — TNVS is not a public utility.” The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority has also cited the rise of TNVS as a major—if not the newest—cause of road congestion especially on Edsa. Data from the Land Transportation Office showed that the dawn of ride-hailing apps had seen a surge in the number of newly registered private vehicles, which raised the total to 186,000 in Metro Manila alone. The carpooling services offered by TNCs “do not have a significant impact on solving the traffic problem,” Cal stressed. “Ride-sharing is a good idea in that it deals in optimizing resources. But (it) cannot really address the full requirement and cannot take the place of mass transit.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1011810/ltfrb-hype-overcharging-too-p2-minute-rate-unauthorized","title":"LTFRB: Hype overcharging, too; P2/minute rate unauthorized","date":"06:25 AM July 19, 2018","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered another transport network company (TNC) to explain why it was overcharging passengers.  In a show-cause order issued on July 13, the LTFRB questioned why Hype Transport Inc. was charging passengers a P2-per-minute travel rate without the board’s approval. Hype was one of the five TNCs accredited by the LTFRB earlier this year, along with Hirna, Owto, GoLag and MiCab. Their entry was seen as a challenge to Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing industry following its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  If found to have violated the LTFRB’s rules on fare regulation, Hype could face the same fate as Grab which was fined P10 million last week for making a unilateral move to charge the same fee. Submitted fare schedule  In its original fare component schedule submitted to the LTFRB, Hype declared a base fare of P40 as well as a P13.50- to P14-per-kilometer rate for both its HypeTaxi and HypeSedan. The TNC also declared a surge rate of up to 1.5 times during peak hours, but there was no mention of a P2-per-minute travel rate. However, travel receipts issued by Hype to passengers who complained to the Lawyers for Commuters’ Safety and Protection (LSCP) showed that the breakdown included the P2-per-minute travel fee on top of base and distance rates. It was unclear whether Hype started charging the rate before Department Order 2015-11—which allowed TNCs to impose their own fare structures subject only to LTFRB oversight—was rescinded in June. Before it was fined, Grab argued that the department order authorized it to set its own fares. However, Grab was overruled when the LTFRB said it was the only one that could “determine, prescribe and fix rates” under Executive Order No. 202 and Commonwealth Act No. 146.  The order penalizing Grab was signed by LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra and Board Member Ronaldo Corpuz.Aileen Lizada, the other board member, dissented, upholding that TNCs indeed had the right to set their own fares under the department order. Same punishment sought Ariel Inton, former LTFRB board member and LCSP chair, said that Hype should be punished “in the same way” as Grab should it be found to have overcharged passengers. In a statement, Hype said it was one with the LTFRB in the aim of providing quality choice for the riding public. “We assure the public that Hype is transparent and abides by the law, and rules and regulations concerning TNCs.”"},{"url":"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/266320/watch-4-donts-of-riding-tnvs-according-to-isabelle-daza","title":"WATCH: 4 dont’s of riding TNVs, according to Isabelle Daza","date":"02:51 PM March 19, 2018","snippet":"Before there were Grab and Uber drivers at our beck and call, we all had to live through the dark ages of waiting in line at taxi stands, only to get a rude taxi driver who had a “broken meter” and charged a fixed rate.

These days, it’s all about booking a Grab or Uber ride to get to one’s desired destination. And while these new transport systems aren’t perfect in themselves, the assurance of safe, comfortable rides outweighs the small amount of fee a passenger has to pay extra for the trip. But like with most things in life, we take things  for granted when we get used to their presence — and Isabelle Daza attests to this as she took to Facebook last Friday, to share a video she came up with, which most passengers might relate to.  In the video, Daza shared four top don’ts of ride-sharing to make sure everyone keeps themselves in check.  “When I take Grab, I always find myself chatting with the driver,” she wrote. “Their stories gave me an idea for a video to remind everyone on how to be good Grabbers. Check out the dont’s when you ride share. Don’t be a no-no!”   Next time you book a Grab or Uber, perhaps it wouldn’t hurt not to keep your driver waiting, or to remember to greet them a cheery “Hello!” or a grateful “Thank you!” once you arrive at your destination. A little tip goes a long way, too.

Last Feb. 23, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board dismissed all motions filed by transport groups against the operation of TNCs in the country, with its chair Winston Ginez explaining that “…the board decided to make a disposition that would promote better mobility and to the benefit of the riding public.” That the Department of Transportation and Communications has chosen to create space for TNCs in its regulatory framework suggests that the government (finally) acknowledges the need for change.  The convenience provided by such TNCs lies in how they can quickly connect a person needing a ride to one willing to share one, for a fee. It’s a popular application of the new “sharing economy” to transportation. Carpooling is not a new concept, after all, and has long been encouraged as a means to save fuel, decongest traffic, and reduce air pollution. Put simply, the service that TNCs offer can be seen as carpooling made easier. It’s a win-win-win situation, as both driver and rider are better off, plus the environment stands to gain, too, with reduced private car usage. It’s not without problems. Uber has faced much opposition, at times violent, from those in the traditional transport service industry. Some European markets have banned it outright. The Internet is filled with stories on the weaknesses of Uber, in particular. But the popularity of such services in the Philippines, specially among the young working population, highlights the shortcomings in our traditional transportation service system.  Rider comfort, safety, security and convenience have always been the primary reason riders have opted for the services of TNCs, or similar Internet-enabled transport services like GrabTaxi. There’s an assurance when a car is called that it will be there and that the rider will not be refused. The rider can wait in the comfort of his/her home or office while monitoring the location of their ride. Privately owned cars are often cleaner and better maintained than publicly used taxis. Payments can be made via credit card through the apps, so payments are exact. Transactions are recorded. The app always tracks the rider via the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Parents can hire a vehicle and check where their children are going without being physically with their child, all through the eyes of their smartphones. Riders can give feedback on the performance of their drivers, and vice versa. The feedback is easy to give and aggregated feedback of others is accessible, so both riders and drivers have an idea who they are dealing with. All together, riders obtain better service. There are important lessons that the traditional taxi industry ought to pick up here.  For one, TNCs improve accessibility of rides for hire, whereas taxi drivers are known to refuse short rides, or if the route goes through heavy traffic. And, assuming the riders do get picked up, they become prone to pressure from drivers to cough up more money (“dagdag dahil ma-traffic”). We tend to address problems like this by penalizing drivers for refusing rides through programs like “Oplan Isnabero”—but do nothing to incentivize and reward positive behavior. Most TNCs provide premiums to drivers to encourage them to pick up passengers even in areas with slow-moving traffic. Systems like surge pricing and heat maps, to Grabtaxi’s institutionalized tipping, when properly regulated, can be a good incentive for drivers without having them resort to predatory pricing. Singapore’s variable taxi fares, which allow for surcharges during peak hours or holidays, puts the same principle in action within the traditional system—and yet, Singapore cab prices are considered relatively “cheap” given that country’s cost of living. Another lesson concerns the feedback system. In this age of social media, an easy-to-use review and feedback mechanism should be easy to set up. The LTFRB does have a feedback mechanism through an online complaint form, but it only captures complaints and there is no feedback on the feedback. That is, how does the rider know that the complaints are being dealt with? How do other riders know about the complaint? And what if the feedback is a positive one? Our feedback mechanism is tailored for hunting down bad drivers, but there is no system in place for finding the good ones we would want to ride with. And that is the power that many consumers wish to have: the power to make sure that the next ride will be a good one. Last Feb. 10, a new Uber service, UberHOP, was launched in the Philippines. It allows several riders from different points along the route to share the same Uber car. Metro Manila is reportedly only the third city in the world to have this new service. That a new product is being tested here is a clear indication that the Philippine TNC market has become a significant one. There is clearly a need that these TNCs fill that our public transport system does not. As a “disruptive technology,” the ride-sharing app shakes up the transport industry just enough for everyone to see where its holes are—and as such, is a disruption most of us probably welcome. * * * cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/297177/rocky-road-ahead-for-sharing-economy-platforms-amid-pandemic","title":"Rocky road ahead for ‘sharing economy’ platforms amid pandemic","date":"11:50 AM May 13, 2020","snippet":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit.","body":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit. These companies are now bleeding more cash than ever, shedding workers and scaling back expectations for profitability amid heightened uncertainty about consumer trends and the economic outlook.  The sharing platforms had “tremendous momentum” in industries like transport and tourism and even apparel-sharing prior to the pandemic, said consumer markets analyst Steve Barr of PwC, which had previously predicted the sharing economy to generate $335 billion in revenue by 2025. “I think there’s going to be a very significant shift in consumer behavior,” Barr said.  One factor could be a move away from urbanization in dense cities — a major force driving the sharing economy. That could dampen the sharing economy “lifestyle” that had been building for people who opted to shun ownership, Barr noted.  Uber said in its quarterly update that it lost nearly $3 billion and its rides business was down some 80 percent in April, prompting cuts to 14 percent of staff. The rideshare giant said it has seen some “green shoots” in the recent weeks and is seeing strong revenue growth for its food delivery operation UberEats. However, an IBM survey released this month found more than half of those who used ridesharing apps planned to reduce or stop using these services completely. “Riders are to continue to have a strong aversion to getting in a vehicle with a stranger for fear of infection which will not be allayed until there is a vaccine,” said analyst Richard Windsor on his Radio Free Mobile blog. Arun Sundararajan, a New York University professor who researches the sharing economy, said he nonetheless sees some room for optimism for ride-hailing firms.  “I think we’ll see a shift to greater personal space control,” Sundararajan said. “A lot of people will move away from mass transit in densely populated areas.” This could bring more business to ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber or to “micromobility” platforms for bicycles and scooters, which the two companies also offer. The researcher said, however, that it may take more time to see a rebound for “pool” rides with multiple passengers, and that the health crisis might slow the trend in which people give up their personal vehicles for shared rides. Leading home-sharing platform Airbnb has cut 25 percent of its staff with the travel industry crushed, with some estimates of bookings down 50 percent from earlier this year. Sundararajan says things may not be so bleak for Airbnb, which has over the years learned to build consumer trust and allow people to host or stay with strangers. The startup has already unveiled a new sanitary protocol and guidelines on leaving spaces vacant between bookings. “As people start to travel again, they will be oriented toward spaces where they feel they have control,” he said. “They may not want to pass through crowded hotel lobbies or stay in places where they don’t know who was there before.” He said Airbnb might be better positioned than some hotel operators “because it doesn’t rely on an extremely high rate of occupancy to make its business model work.” As in other sectors, the sharing economy firms will need to rebuild consumer trust to get consumers back. Sundararajan said these firms have an advantage because they have been working for years on helping change consumer habits.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The platforms are better-situated to deal with this uncertainty and rebuilding trust because that’s what they’ve been doing for a decade,” he said. But behavioral economist Lucas Coffman of Boston College said trust can be difficult, pointing to the “reputational” system of rating developed by online platforms. “You also need to trust everyone who rode in your seat before you,” Coffman said. Some segments of the sharing economy may emerge stronger, PwC’s Barr says, such as corporate jets or high-end black car rides. “Safety is going to be the new experience,” he said. Saif Benjaafar, director of the University of Minnesota’s Initiative on the Sharing Economy, said the platforms have been part of a lifestyle trend to on-demand, collaborative services that are extending to new areas such as medicine and education. “There has been a shift in the traditional way of delivering products and services, and I think that will continue,” Benjaafar said. “I think people are getting used to the idea of going to an app and getting things whenever they need it.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

That a new product is being tested here is a clear indication that the Philippine TNC market has become a significant one. There is clearly a need that these TNCs fill that our public transport system does not. As a “disruptive technology,” the ride-sharing app shakes up the transport industry just enough for everyone to see where its holes are—and as such, is a disruption most of us probably welcome. * * * cielito.habito@gmail.com"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/60050/millennials-dont-identify-online-identity-risks-says-study","title":"Millennials don’t identify online identity risks, says study","date":"04:05 PM March 19, 2017","snippet":"A SureID study conducted at this year’s SXSW finds that 18-to-37-year-olds place a premium on time and this could leave them exposed online, particularly when using sharing economy services.","body":"A SureID study conducted at this year’s SXSW finds that 18-to-37-year-olds place a premium on time and this could leave them exposed online, particularly when using sharing economy services. When asked, 79 percent of respondents said that they would be less likely to buy from someone, whether on- or offline, if that person couldn’t prove their identity. However, when questioned about two of the main foundations of the growing gig economy—ride sharing and food delivery services—91 percent of those polled over the course of the event said that they presumed the person they’re interacting with has already been vetted and their identity verified by a third party.  “Technology is enabling us to interact perhaps too comfortably with strangers for modern conveniences. These findings point out the growing demand for people in the gig economy to prove they are who they say they are, to create a higher level of trust,” said Justin Oberman, vice president of identity strategy at SureID. In June, SureID polled regular dating site and ride-share service users and found that 88 percent of dating app users want a way of independently verifying the identity of the person they could soon be dating. And, within this SXSW study, when asked about themselves, 96 percent said that they would welcome a means of verifying and managing their own identify online for greater security.  “Proving identities is the secret ingredient in the successful evolution of the sharing economy,” said Steve Larson, CEO and founder, SureID. “Safety and convenience are not mutually exclusive and must work hand in hand.” JB/rga"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/197586/global-investors-infuse-350m-into-grabtaxi-for-expansion","title":"Global investors infuse $350M into GrabTaxi for expansion","date":"02:19 AM August 21, 2015","snippet":"GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., operator of Southeast Asia’s biggest ridesharing smartphone application, raised another $350 million in a new funding round that would give it added resources to expand in the region, including the Philippines.","body":"GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., operator of Southeast Asia’s biggest ridesharing smartphone application, raised another $350 million in a new funding round that would give it added resources to expand in the region, including the Philippines. The development comes as the Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board begins regulating ride-sharing apps and as competition with one of its biggest rivals, Uber, heats up.  In a statement, GrabTaxi said on Thursday that the money was raised from global investors such as US-based Coatue Management, L.L.C., China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp. and Didi Kuaidi, “apart from support from existing shareholders.” This brings GrabTaxi’s total funding to about $700 million, making it one of the best funded startups in Southeast Asia.  GrabTaxi launched in Manila in July 2013 and later expanded into Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod and Baguio. It is also present in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. GrabTaxi said the money would be used to further develop its technology offering as it continues to invest in expanding its engineering offices.  GrabTaxi also plans to expand its private hire vehicle booking service, GrabCar, to as many as two more major cities in the Philippines this year, Natasha Bautista, head of Grabcar in the Philippines, said in a previous interview. Figures provided by the company showed that GrabTaxi operates across six countries, with 101,000 registered drivers serving about 10 booking per second in Southeast Asia. “We exist to solve the region’s transportation challenges. Diversifying into private cars and motorbikes has allowed us to touch people of varying income levels and commuting needs. We are the only app in the region that has such an extensive network and range of transportation choices,” Tan said in the statement. GrabTaxi has diversified its offerings beyond taxis to include private cars and motorbikes. GrabCar is a private hire vehicle service available in all countries where GrabTaxi is available. GrabExpress is an on-demand, same-day delivery service that is currently available in Manila. Both GrabCar and GrabExpress are available through the same GrabTaxi mobile app."},{"url":"https://motioncars.inquirer.net/50961/think-tank-scrap-limit-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"August 03,2017","snippet":"","body":""},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/25736/lyft-ipo-sets-rollout-for-ride-hailing-sharing-economy","title":"Lyft IPO Sets Rollout for Ride-Hailing, Sharing Economy","date":"04:34 AM March 30, 2019","snippet":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share.","body":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share. Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest. Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/245707/public-display-affliction","title":"Public display of affliction","date":"05:28 AM February 10, 2018","snippet":"My friend LC, a middle-aged working woman, has a grievance: She now waits more than 30 minutes to get an Uber or Grab ride, when she only used to wait for about 10 minutes.","body":"My friend LC, a middle-aged working woman, has a grievance: She now waits more than 30 minutes to get an Uber or Grab ride, when she only used to wait for about 10 minutes. That may sum up the effect on the riding public of one bold unflinching decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Recently, LTFRB imposed a maximum limit on the number of Uber and Grab cars, impossibly called TNVS (transport network vehicle service), to 45,000 at most plying Metro Manila, home to more than 13 million people. Just exactly how LTFRB churned up the number, nobody knew for sure. The fact remains that both Uber and Grab reported to LTFRB that their requests for rides ran by the millions every month.  Anyway, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III said the magic number was the result of studies, careful to point out that it was … well, “not arbitrary.” Well and good! It’s just that he forgot to release those studies to the public.  While the guys down here in my barangay could believe LTFRB about the studies, the public would never know whether or not those studies were wrong. Some four years ago in 2014, ride-sharing became an alternative to driving ourselves to work or taking a cab. We would get a chauffeur-driven car at the push of a button on the cellphone, and we would get the service right at the doorstep exactly when we needed it. Based on a paper done by Uber, about 1.5 million people in Metro Manila actively use Uber at present, including tourists from some 79 countries. Uber claimed that, in a month, it only registered about 30,000 active units, and only about 16,000 of them took at least one trip every day. In short, there was a shortage of units.  Statistics gathered by Uber showed that in July last year, it was able to fulfill 80 percent of requests for rides, which went down to a pathetic 40 percent last month, or less than half of the requests. Stop right there. In fact, in the last Christmas season, the figure even dropped miserably to just 20 percent! No wonder, in the real world, people like my friend LC could feel the lack of rides that LTFRB perhaps forgot to study. The Uber data also showed the public has started to use the ride-pooling option (meaning, more than one passenger per trip), which now accounts for about 40 percent of the trips. In actual figures, some 670,000 individuals who use Uber were willing to share their rides with others. Thus, ride-sharing could be one way of easing the public affliction called traffic. Consider for a minute that, based on data compiled by the Metro Manila Development Authority, more than 80 percent of the cars plying the streets of Metro Manila only had one passenger—the driver. People would rather buy their own cars, drive themselves to work and bear the high cost of parking, if they could find a vacant slot, precisely because of our inefficient public transportation system. Another survey also showed that some 88 percent of Filipinos would be willing to forego buying a car, if they could have a reliable ride-sharing transport. Anyway, despite the claims of the chief of LTFRB about having studied the situation, his need to control the number of Uber and Grab vehicles still had some huge holes.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For example, LTFRB forgot to say just exactly how the different TNVS would share the 45,000 units. Nobody, but nobody had any idea who would get what number. Moreover, the entire TNVS sector reportedly already had more than 100,000 units among themselves. Question: Which one among them would LTFRB remove? And nobody, but nobody still had any idea what the criteria could be. Controlling the supply of anything, just like price control, would always have bad effects (although the limit set by LTFRB would benefit taxi operators). What is LTFRB so worried about? So what if the metropolis would have too many Uber or Grab cars? It would actually be good for the riding public—which, by the way, according to Sen. Grace Poe, LTFRB did not consult before it arrived at its decision."}]}
