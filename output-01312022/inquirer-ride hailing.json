The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday assailed Arcade City for its continued defiance of the cease-and-desist order against it, as the agency pointed out that the app is encouraging the establishment of illegal transport network companies (TNCs), as well as the activation of unregistered transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Arcade City’s business model promotes illegality by espousing that TNCs no longer have to be accredited to be able to operate in the country. Arcade City also claimed that its drivers need not apply for a franchise from the government for them to ferry passengers.  Lizada said this is why when Arcade City app goes online on Monday, enforcers from the LTFRB, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, Land Transportation Office and the Philippine National Police’s Highway Patrol Group will be implementing the power the law against the unregistered ride-hailing app. Lizada warned that members of the law enforcers will be operating undercover as they themselves would avail Arcade City’s services to apprehend drivers and impound their vehicles.  “We cannot afford any more irregularities such as this. We need to protect the riding public,” Lizada told the Inquirer. After Arcade City was ordered this week to cease operations for the second time, it taunted the LTFRB by saying that the board does not understand how its technology and model work. “Arcade City does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company. Driver entrepreneurs may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, but Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers,” it said in a statement. Based on its website, the app would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens.” These tokens could either be sold or used within Arcade’s ecosystem for services and bonus features. Lizada said that on top of apprehending Arcade drivers for “colorum” operations, the LTFRB will also coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications Technology and the US Embassy to “protest” the actions of the company’s founder and CEO, Christopher David.  “He is making a mockery of our rules and regulations,” Lizada said of David, who packages his company as a supposed alternative to Uber. Uber ceased operating as a TNC by Monday, running counter to the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order for it to remain in operations while a review on the deal of its acquisition by Grab is being conducted. The PCC feared that Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry gives Grab a monopoly of the industry. The LTFRB, however, pointed out that it is already fast-tracking the accreditation of three new TNCs—Lag Go, Hype and Owto—which would compete with Grab. /jpv RELATED STORY 3 new TNCs accredited by June, says LTFRB"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061236/2-new-ride-hailing-firms-get-ltfrb-accreditation","title":"2 new ride-hailing firms get LTFRB accreditation","date":"05:42 AM December 08, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has accredited two new ride-hailing apps to break Grab’s virtual monopoly of the market.

The measure would prevent “surge pricing” if increased rates are higher than the maximum fare set by the city. Honolulu attorneys will review the measure before it goes to Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who would have 10 days to sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature or veto it.  Uber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the rules that would impose “outdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.” Oahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers. Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.  Uber has been told the city hasn’t received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company’s senior operations manager for Hawaii. Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40 percent cheaper, she told council members Wednesday. Surge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.  If Uber and Lyft rides are cheaper, then why do they need to use surge pricing, asked Robert Deluze, owner of Robert’s Taxis, who said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business. Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that U.S. Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as $221 to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was $44. As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being “price gouged.” Uber said in a fact sheet that surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability. Riders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis aren’t as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies. Uber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six. During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it’s based on supply and demand.  Uber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “When demand for rides is greater than the number of drivers on the road, passengers may pay an extra percentage on top of the base ride amount,” Lyft said in a statement explaining its “Prime Time” pricing. A $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it “only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.” Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won’t pay an “unreasonable price.” He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, “predatory pricing” — within limits. The measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: “Other cities are struggling with this as well.” The city’s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It’s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said. Uber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk. /jpv"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/263417/ltfrb-rejects-application-of-indonesias-ride-hailing-firm-go-jek","title":"LTFRB rejects application of Indonesia’s ride-hailing firm Go-Jek","date":"04:31 PM January 11, 2019","snippet":"JAKARTA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the request from Indonesian ride-hailing company Go-Jek to operate in the country because of local regulation on corporate ownership.","body":"JAKARTA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the request from Indonesian ride-hailing company Go-Jek to operate in the country because of local regulation on corporate ownership.

The service, which was launched last week, also welcomed back to the Grab platform thousands of hatchback drivers who were removed en masse by the transport network company in June at the behest of transport regulators.  GrabCar Hatchback allows passengers to book the compact vehicles whose trunks occupy the same area as the passenger seat. A maximum of three passengers can ride at the same time. The hatchback service would be slightly cheaper than the GrabCar option. According to the approved fare matrix of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the base fare for hatchbacks would be P30 (P10 less than GrabCar).  Selected areas only Their routes, however, would currently be limited to the central business districts of Makati, Taguig and Pasig.  The LTFRB earlier maintained that hatchbacks were not safe for public transport, prompting displaced drivers to file a complaint before the Anti-Red Tape Authority over the board’s “irregular” application process for transport network vehicle services (TNVS). In August, the Department of Transportation signed Department Order No. 2019-13, permanently allowing hatchbacks and subcompact units to be used as TNVS units."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1139335/tnvs-strike-fails-to-paralyze-ride-hailing-services","title":"TNVS strike fails to paralyze ride-hailing services","date":"05:01 AM July 09, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) drivers staged an unprecedented “transport holiday” on Monday to protest the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) policies on granting franchise applications, although its effect seemed minimal.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) drivers staged an unprecedented “transport holiday” on Monday to protest the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) policies on granting franchise applications, although its effect seemed minimal. There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.  Different TNVS groups will conduct a much-awaited dialogue with the LTFRB regarding their concerns today. These include charges that the agency was constantly adding new requirements and changing the process for acquiring the provisional authority that TNVS drivers needed to go online."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1186202/dont-kill-off-local-ride-hailing-firms-group-asks-govt","title":"Don’t kill off local ride-hailing firms, group asks gov’t","date":"03:59 AM November 06, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/276753/pcc-says-ride-hailing-sector-still-uncompetitive","title":"PCC says ride-hailing sector still uncompetitive","date":"05:12 AM August 14, 2019","snippet":"The antitrust body will renegotiate the conditions that Grab Philippines had previously agreed to, a year after the same conditions paved the way for the approval of the company’s deal to buy Uber out of the market.","body":"The antitrust body will renegotiate the conditions that Grab Philippines had previously agreed to, a year after the same conditions paved the way for the approval of the company’s deal to buy Uber out of the market. These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999719/grab-philippines-brian-cu-ltfrb-regulation-of-tncs","title":"Grab head welcomes LTFRB regulation of ride-hailing firms","date":"05:40 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country.","body":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country. “The new Department Order, which we welcome, strengthens Grab’s position that the fare structure with the P2 per minute component is legal,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement.  “Since the [issuance of] DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr [Department of Transportation] and the LTFRB,” he added.

Uber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the rules that would impose “outdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.” Oahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers. Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.  Uber has been told the city hasn’t received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company’s senior operations manager for Hawaii. Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40 percent cheaper, she told council members Wednesday. Surge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.  If Uber and Lyft rides are cheaper, then why do they need to use surge pricing, asked Robert Deluze, owner of Robert’s Taxis, who said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business. Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that U.S. Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as $221 to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was $44. As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being “price gouged.” Uber said in a fact sheet that surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability. Riders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis aren’t as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies. Uber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six. During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it’s based on supply and demand.  Uber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “When demand for rides is greater than the number of drivers on the road, passengers may pay an extra percentage on top of the base ride amount,” Lyft said in a statement explaining its “Prime Time” pricing. A $6 ride would become a $9 ride during Prime Time pricing of 50 percent, the statement said, adding that it “only adds a percentage to the ride subtotal, which is calculated before any other fees or additional amounts.” Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won’t pay an “unreasonable price.” He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing — or as he prefers to call it, “predatory pricing” — within limits. The measure would set precedence nationwide, he said: “Other cities are struggling with this as well.” The city’s Department of Customer Services would be tasked with setting the maximum price. Deputy Director Randy Leong told council members that the department opposes setting the threshold but will do so if it becomes law. It’s difficult to dictate to businesses what they may charge, he said. Uber released a statement after the vote saying that, if implemented, the bill will limit consumer choice and put the availability of Uber service on Oahu at risk. /jpv"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/263417/ltfrb-rejects-application-of-indonesias-ride-hailing-firm-go-jek","title":"LTFRB rejects application of Indonesia’s ride-hailing firm Go-Jek","date":"04:31 PM January 11, 2019","snippet":"JAKARTA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the request from Indonesian ride-hailing company Go-Jek to operate in the country because of local regulation on corporate ownership.","body":"JAKARTA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has rejected the request from Indonesian ride-hailing company Go-Jek to operate in the country because of local regulation on corporate ownership.

GrabCar Hatchback allows passengers to book the compact vehicles whose trunks occupy the same area as the passenger seat. A maximum of three passengers can ride at the same time. The hatchback service would be slightly cheaper than the GrabCar option. According to the approved fare matrix of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the base fare for hatchbacks would be P30 (P10 less than GrabCar).  Selected areas only Their routes, however, would currently be limited to the central business districts of Makati, Taguig and Pasig.  The LTFRB earlier maintained that hatchbacks were not safe for public transport, prompting displaced drivers to file a complaint before the Anti-Red Tape Authority over the board’s “irregular” application process for transport network vehicle services (TNVS).

There was no official count of participants in the mass action although leaders of the TNVS community gave estimates ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. But since some of those who took part were drivers who were deactivated last month, the strike did not paralyze ride-hailing services.  Ninoy Mopas, president of TNVS group Thug Philippines, sought to differentiate the holiday from a conventional strike, saying a sizeable number of drivers had continued operating. “We gave our members and groups the choice to stay online to provide service to the riding public. The ones who are here are probably the ones who were deactivated, operate at night and those who were dismissed,” Mopas said during a dialogue between various agencies.  “This transport holiday did not burden the commuters. If you found it hard to book, honestly, it is harder to book on Mondays because there are only a few drivers,” he added. Grab, the largest employer of TNVS drivers, also said the strike had no discernible impact on its operations. At8 a.m., two hours after TNVS drivers had said they would go offline, Grab’s platform was “pretty normal,” according to communications manager Fiona Nicolas.  Different TNVS groups will conduct a much-awaited dialogue with the LTFRB regarding their concerns today. These include charges that the agency was constantly adding new requirements and changing the process for acquiring the provisional authority that TNVS drivers needed to go online."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1186202/dont-kill-off-local-ride-hailing-firms-group-asks-govt","title":"Don’t kill off local ride-hailing firms, group asks gov’t","date":"03:59 AM November 06, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Following a report that China’s biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, was in talks to break Grab’s monopoly in the Philippines, a commuter advocacy group has urged the government to support local ride-hailing apps instead of opening the market to more foreign-owned platforms.

The nine local TNCs are Owto, GoLag, Ryde, uHop, Hype, Hirna, SnappyCab, e-Pick Me Up and Micab. “Homegrown TNCs should be supported rather than killed by allowing giant foreign-owned app-based ride-hailing firms to come in,” Morillo said.

Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock — estimated at more than $2.5 billion — and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.  “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement. Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and how they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn’t find a taxi.  But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits. Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. Before his ouster as chief executive, Kalanick acknowledged he needed to “fundamentally change and grow up.”  His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes “adult supervision” in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in. In one of the Uber’s biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment. A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss — not Kalanick — had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations “abhorrent” and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick’s responsibilities. After multiple investigations, Uber fired 20 employees accused of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who complained. This month, the company paid $4.4 million to settle a federal investigation over workplace misconduct. The problems went beyond employee relations.  Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber’s self-driving car division. Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check. During Kalanick’s tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber’s software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. “Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors. Kalanick, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed Tuesday. Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing. Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer “pedo guy” — short for “pedophile.” Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the workplace-sharing company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan. After Kalanick’s ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber’s chief executive to clean up its image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber’s stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since. “Let’s call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates,” Ives said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Kalanick had been one of Uber’s biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO. Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research, said it was not surprising Kalanick sold his stake. “He, like everyone else, probably realizes now that Uber and its competitors are unlikely to reach sustainable profitability in the foreseeable future,” Abuelsamid said. “Automated vehicles are not the savior for ride hailing and won’t be mainstream for many years. With that in mind, his Uber stake is probably as valuable as it will get for a long time, if not forever.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/276753/pcc-says-ride-hailing-sector-still-uncompetitive","title":"PCC says ride-hailing sector still uncompetitive","date":"05:12 AM August 14, 2019","snippet":"The antitrust body will renegotiate the conditions that Grab Philippines had previously agreed to, a year after the same conditions paved the way for the approval of the company’s deal to buy Uber out of the market.","body":"The antitrust body will renegotiate the conditions that Grab Philippines had previously agreed to, a year after the same conditions paved the way for the approval of the company’s deal to buy Uber out of the market. These conditions, which are called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hopes that they would improve market conditions in a way that would feel as if Uber were still a competitor.  The voluntary commitments, which included keeping Grab’s fares close to how they were when Uber was still a competitor, were supposed to expire last Aug. 10. But instead of disclosing how Grab met or failed its yearlong commitments, the PCC said in a statement on Tuesday that the voluntary commitments would remain in effect for 71 days, or from Aug. 11 to Oct. 20. This will give time for the competition watchdog and the biggest player in the ride-hailing market so far to decide on new or amended commitments that will be effective for another period to be agreed upon.  The PCC said that the new commitments might include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its price surges, driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. “Exactly a year after PCC rendered a Commitment Decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority finds that the dominance of the merged firms remains unchallenged and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market,” the statement read.  The market remains uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. It was not clear, however, why the PCC chose to take this route despite noting that the market still has not recovered. Last year, PCC officials warned that failure to comply with these commitments would have been met with a fine of P2 million per breach, “or even the unwinding of the transaction” —a threat that might now seem unlikely for some given the long time since Uber’s exit. On one hand, the commitments could keep Grab in check from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, said PCC Chair Arsenio M. Balisacan. “On the other hand, we also advocate for allowing smaller players to grow or formidable new competitors to enter the market, which will be more beneficial to the riding public.” But this is not the only issue that faces the ride-hailing industry. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which regulates the ride-hailing industry, also faces charges under the Ease of Doing Business law, according to the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta).  This is in light of how the LTFRB handled the accreditation of transport network vehicle services (TNVS), which left an unnecessary long backlog that inconvenienced drivers, including Grab drivers who even held a protest against it. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Arta Director General Jeremiah Belgica said that some applicants even waited for their approval for a year, even though their applications have already been completed. He said that LTFRB board officials, including Chair Martin Delgra III, could be liable for not following the prescribed timeline of the law in processing applications and for imposing additional requirements. Whether or not Arta will push for this is not yet sure. Also on Tuesday, Arta said it has issued an order to automatically approve the TNVS applications that have been completed, duly paid and duly heard from July 7 last year to July 24, 2019. The Arta directed the LTFRB to submit a list of these TNVS applications three days after the agency received a copy of the order. Arta also recommended to remove some of the additional requirements such as a bank certificate of conformity."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999719/grab-philippines-brian-cu-ltfrb-regulation-of-tncs","title":"Grab head welcomes LTFRB regulation of ride-hailing firms","date":"05:40 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country.","body":"Grab Philippines welcomed the signing of an order that allows the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate the ride-hailing firms in the country. “The new Department Order, which we welcome, strengthens Grab’s position that the fare structure with the P2 per minute component is legal,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement.  “Since the [issuance of] DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr [Department of Transportation] and the LTFRB,” he added.

After Uber’s exit, Vietnamese apps TaxiGo, Vivu, T.net, Xelo and Vato were set up to compete with Grab. But they have failed to attract as many passengers, mostly due to lack of advertising and promotions.  After Uber left, Grab’s rates increased, especially during peak hours, holidays or during bad weather, according to many passengers in HCM City. Tran Thi Kim Hong, 50, of HCM City’s District 4, who uses Grab to go to work every day, said: “They no longer offer discounts as much as before, with prices rising 10-20 per cent, and even 50-80 per cent during peak hours.”  The peak period now is one hour longer compared to the past period. “The rates also went up during non-peak hours, especially in areas where there are fewer cars,” she said. Grab drivers have complained about high commission rates, nearly 20 per cent for veteran drivers, and more than 28 per cent for new drivers.  Some drivers said they were working more hours but earning less money, while others who took out loans to buy a car said they were driving 10-12 hours a day so they could pay back their loans. Local apps Despite complaints from drivers and some passengers about Grab, the company still retains the most market share. Vietnamese companies have invested less in advertising and have had fewer promotions. In addition, since many of them do not have enough cars and drivers, passengers often have to wait for a long time. In some areas, for example, passengers have complained that it was difficult to get in touch with Vato, which received a US$100 million investment from Phuong Trang Tourism Service and Transport JSC in a bid to compete with Grab.  Although the prices for T.net and Xelo are reasonable, passengers have also complained that it was difficult to reach them by phone. To attract drivers, many Vietnamese businesses have exempted the commission rate for drivers during the initial period, and then later take a low commission rate of no more than 15 per cent. However, due to a limited number of passengers, the local businesses cannot find enough drivers. Drivers for the Vietnamese businesses have also complained about changing policies. As soon as revenue increases, the company’s commission rate usually goes up as well, they say. As of the end of 2017, Grab had attracted US$2 billion worth of investment from partners to serve the Southeast Asian market. In May, Toyota raised $1 billion for Grab. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese ride-hailing app businesses must rely on their own resources, and have not called for investors. Nguyen Xuan Thuy, of the Division of Transport under the Ministry of Transport, said: “What they (Vietnamese passengers) need is good service at a reasonable price.” “The more competitive the market is, the more customers will benefit. It’s important that Vietnamese businesses recognize their shortcomings to improve their services,” he said. Economist Bui Quang Tin said Vietnamese ride-hailing apps should take advantage of Uber’s exit to expand their market share and offer more choices for local commuters. “Those who provide the best service will be the winners,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As of April 8, all Uber rides had shifted to the Grab app, which meant that former Uber drivers had to either join Grab or stop working.

In a statement, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra promised to look into allegations of price-gouging this week as he reminded transport network companies (TNCs) to adhere to the approved fare matrix: P40 as base fare, P10-15 per kilometer, P2 per minute travel charge and a surge cap of 2x depending on the flow of traffic.  Although Delgra did not name the specific TNCs, commuters have been complaining lately about the high surge rates charged by Grab, which has a virtually monopoly on the ride-hailing industry in the country. Reached for comment, Grab said it had not yet received the official invite from the LTFRB although it promised to take part in the discussion.  In a Twitter thread, journalist Janvic Mateo posted some of the receipts for his Grab rides during the holiday season and noted that the surcharges for some trips took up nearly half of his total fare. In one trip that cost P777, for example, the surge charge was at P328.00, or 42 percent of the fare.In just two weeks, Mateo paid over P2,000 in surge charges, which were sometimes almost as expensive as the actual fare.  “I wish I don’t have to travel as often as I do. [I] wish we have a better public transport system,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian also asked the LTFRB to take another look at the fare matrix of Grab to make sure it was following the rules of surge pricing.Grab had attributed the higher rates to the increased demand for vehicles and the limited number of available drivers. “The high fare is killing the festive mood of many Filipino commuters. We don’t want to let Grab play the Grinch who stole Christmas from Juan de la Cruz because of high fare,” Gatchalian said in a statement. He noted that based on the fare matrix approved in August, transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units should charge a flag down rate of up to P40 for sedans, up to P50 for premium Asian utility vehicles/sport utility vehicles (AUV/SUV) and up to P30 for hatchbacks/subcompact vehicles. This was on top of a P15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, P18 for SUVs and P13 for hatchbacks—aside from the P2 charge per minute of travel. TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charges through surge pricing.  But Gatchalian said Grab should also explain why it was imposing surge pricing even in the wee hours of the morning when there were fewer bookings and less traffic on the road. There should be more competitors for prices to go down, he added although he noted that while there were other TNVS companies, these were small players who could not go head-to-head with the current industry leader. “Without competition in the hail-riding industry, our poor commuters will always be at the mercy of high fares,” Gatchalian said. “This is why we are supporting the entry of other players in this industry, such as the TNVS GoJek, so that commuters would have choices and would not have to endure the high rates of Grab,” he added —With a report from Leila B.

No ride-hailing apps accepted the request for vehicle except for one with a driver whose picture looked very familiar. The app says the driver has a blue Suzuki Vitara and the fare is P200. The driver pulled over the driveway of the CDN building in Barangay Mabolo 15 minutes later. As his first passenger entered the vehicle, the driver looked away. When the second passenger came, this reporter who covers the Cebu City Hall beat, the driver lets out a laugh. “Nakakita man mo sa akong picture sa app no?” he says.  (You saw my picture on the ride-hailing app, right?) Behind the wheels of the car is Cebu City Councilor David “Dave” Tumulak, who earlier told City Hall reporters that he has applied to be driver for a ride-hailing app. That Friday afternoon, Tumulak says he just came from M.J Cuenco Avenue after a meeting. There is no more work for the day at his office at the Cebu City Hall so he decided to pick up passengers. That was when he received the request for a vehicle from the CDN Digital employee. ‘Driver for hire’ While he jokes about his government salary to be insufficient to pay for gas, Tumulak turned serious when asked why he decided to become a driver. “Sayang kaayo ang oras mag-drive from one meeting to the next. Daghan kaayong pasahero mag-atang. (Hours are wasted driving in getting from one meeting to the other) It is a waste of time and gasoline to drive alone. So may pa mag-driver ko aron makabayad ko sa gas (So I decided to become a driver so my earnings can pay for gas),” he tells CDN Digital. Tumulak reveals that he has been part of the ride-hailing app for two weeks. He applied in early December 2019 and was approved after two days. On Thursday, December 19, he earned P1,700, which is enough to have his tank filled with gasoline. And he is not even a full-time driver. His main mission in doing in being a driver is related to his role as a public servant. He enjoys driving around the city which also gives him the first-hand experience to see what is really happening on the road. It gives him the platform to better understand the plight of the drivers, whose livelihood are affected by the city’s worsening traffic situation. In these drives, he personally witnesses the experiences of motorists, pedestrians and commuters. Being a driver is his way of getting information, which he utilizes in formulating ordinances or legislations that will help the city government serve its constituents better. WATCH: David Tumulak answers questions from CDN Digital on the road  Passengers “Kun driver diay ka ba, madunggan man diay nimo tanan bisan og naa sila sa likod,” he shares with an amused voice. (When you are a driver, you can hear everything that your passengers talk about even when they are seated at the back.) He has since learned informative lessons and hilarious realities from his passengers. “Naay pasahero nga sabaan, medyo hugawan, sigeg panglibak, sigeg pagwapa,” says Tumulak. (There are passengers who are talkative, who are quite messy, who likes to gossip, or who uses the time on the road to put on make-up.) Some passengers have recognized him and when it happens, he gladly converses with them. Road issues That Friday, around 4 p.m. on the way to SM Seaside City Cebu, Tumulak pointed out that trucks were plying Sergio Osmeña Road on North Reclamation Area when there is an existing truck ban around that time. He points out the need to enforce measures such as the truck ban to make sure that efficient flow of traffic is observed with the expected holiday rush this month, December 2019. As the car moved forward to its destination, Tumulak noticed a light traffic situation at the South Road Properties (SRP) tunnel that afternoon while CDN Digital was on board his car. There were sacks, which might have fallen from a delivery truck, that were left unattended on the road. To resolve the situation, he called an official from the Cebu City Transportation Office in removing the sacks. He says this is one of the advantages of being a councilor-driver. Sitting as the Cebu City Council’s chairperson for the committee on disaster risk reduction and management, Tumulak is also able to conduct his own research that he can report to the body. He can easily respond to any incident while he is on transit. He gets to converse with his passengers, people from all walks of life, on the issues and challenges they face. As he receives the P200 payment for the drive, Tumulak showed off the money to this reporter. “Makapa-gas nako!” he says sounding victorious from a recent feat. (I can fill up my gas tank.) For Tumulak, being a driver is no different than being a councilor. Just like a councilor, a driver provides service to the public with the ultimate goal of providing convenience to passengers, a small but significant contribution to make their lives better. / dbs & celr"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999683/tugade-signs-order-giving-ltfrb-authority-to-regulate-ride-hailing-firms","title":"Tugade signs order giving LTFRB authority to regulate ride-hailing firms","date":"04:33 PM June 11, 2018","snippet":"Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade has signed an order allowing the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and transport network companies (TNCs).","body":"Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade has signed an order allowing the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and transport network companies (TNCs).

Lizada said fares will be determined by the LTFRB after the conduct of a public hearing or consultation with the TNCs and TNVS.  LTFRB Chariman Martin Delgra III also assured the public that the agency is processing applications to make sure that no colorum vehicles would go out on the streets. “The LTFRB has been engaging with TNCs and TNVS operators and drivers far more often than any other group over the past year. It is because we see their value, and because we believe that if done right, they will make a big difference and our commuters will ultimately benefit,” Delgra said in a statement.  Tugade, for his part, said that putting TNVS and TNCs under LTFRB regulation would benefit all parties concerned. Moreover, he said competition will be fair as it will be a level playing field. According to Lizada, the department order, which was drafted last April, is effective immediately. In the past, fares were set by TVNS and TNCs. Under Department Order 2015-11 issued by then-Transport Secretary Joseph Abaya, the LTFRB only has an oversight function and can only step in to set fares during emergency situations. The LTFRB, however, disputed the validity of the order because it was implemented without their knowledge. /ee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1188169/indonesias-gojek-to-enter-phs-ride-hailing-market","title":"Indonesia’s Gojek to enter PH’s ride-hailing market","date":"04:04 AM November 11, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Makati City Rep.

The five TNCs are expected to compete against ride-hailing giant Grab which has dominated the local market following its March buyout of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. Grab hit by complaints In the past weeks, however, Grab has been deluged by complaints from passengers, mostly about canceled bookings, prompting the TNC to sanction almost 500 drivers. The LTFRB also ordered Grab to stop collecting a P2 per minute travel charge which was implemented without first securing the transport board’s approval.

But a Grab official warned that allowing that  many players without the government allowing more app-based vehicles to operate could actually spell more hassles than benefits for commuters.  Grab country head Brian Cu said only “two to three TNCs could survive” at the current cap of 66,750 set by the LTFRB. The number refers to the maximum number of vehicles that can use ride-hailing applications. “If you have too many TNCs that the TNVS (transport network vehicle services) need to attach themselves to, that supply will spread out. It would result in more difficulties in booking a car,” Cu said in an interview on Wednesday.  Uneven densities Because the cap fixes the number of app-based drivers on the road regardless of platform (Grab, Uber, for example), more TNCs would mean uneven “densities” of drivers as their networks thin out, he said.  “For example, if I book a car using Owto and it has 1,000 cars, it’s very unlikely that those cars are in a constricted area. Those cars would be all over Manila because that is where the demand would bring them. If the supply (of drivers) is spread out and the density is very low on a per TNC basis, people will find it harder to get a car.” Cu’s remarks follow the LTFRB’s accreditation of Micab, a Cebu-based taxi hailing app, on Monday. Alongside Hype, Hirna, Go Lag and Owto, this fifth TNC is expected to challenge Grab’s dominance in the country since its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. While stressing that he was not worried about Grab’s competitiveness in the market, Cu warned that the entry of several new players could actually cause an “overall network deficiency.” “If the current cap is concentrated within two or three TNCs, that’s OK. But once you get to five or six, the concentration becomes fragmented,” he said. Complaints vs Grab  Asked whether the regulatory agency would reopen discussions to adjust the cap for TNVS, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said they would first observe how the TNCs would be drawing from the current pool of available TNVS. Grab has come under fire of late amid mounting complaints from passengers, mostly about canceled bookings and difficulty in booking cars. This prompted the TNC to impose sanctions on almost 500 drivers. However, the company maintained that the root problem was the severe lack of app-based vehicles authorized to service passengers. To explain the undersupply, Cu said Grab received at least 600,000 booking requests every day but had only 35,000 vehicles in its fleet to serve riders. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles prior to the Grab acquisition, only 11,000 moved to Grab. At least 6,000 were not allowed to continue operating as TNVS as they were not part of the LTFRB’s masterlist, Cu said. Cu said the company had appealed to the LTFRB to allow the 6,000 drivers to be absorbed by Grab. “With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of riders,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1082612/go-jek-strengthens-grip-in-indonesia-as-fresh-funds-pour-in","title":"Go-Jek strengthens grip in Indonesia as fresh funds pour in","date":"10:59 AM February 07, 2019","snippet":"JAKARTA — The rivalry between homegrown ride-hailing company Go-Jek and Singapore-based Grab has reached the next level, with the former having received its latest round of funding for its regional expansion from global tech giants.","body":"JAKARTA — The rivalry between homegrown ride-hailing company Go-Jek and Singapore-based Grab has reached the next level, with the former having received its latest round of funding for its regional expansion from global tech giants. Go-Jek announced last week that it had received series F funding from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. and China-based conglomerate Tencent Holdings, with Mitsubishi Corp. and Provident Capital joining as investors.  Go-Jek did not disclose in its press statement the amount it raised, but sources quoted by Reuters said the value was at around US$1 billion. The funds raised would be used to help Go-Jek penetrate the market in Indonesia and strengthen its position in other countries, including Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand, the company wrote in the statement.  “As we expand internationally, we are excited to extend our vision to more countries and at the same time put Indonesia on the map as a regional hub for tech innovation,” said Go-Jek group CEO Nadiem Makarim in the statement. Go-Jek and its affiliates now operate in five countries in 204 cities and regencies across Southeast Asia, with a network of over 2 million driver partners and 400,000 merchants.  According to Go-Jek, its local brand in Vietnam, Go-Viet, gained an estimated 40 percent of the country’s two-wheeled transportation market share within three months of its launch in August 2018. The Indonesian unicorn opened its beta app in Singapore last month, while in Thailand, it launched its two-wheeled ride-hailing service by partnering with licensed motorcycle taxis. At the same time, ride-hailing app Grab has been stepping up its game in Indonesia and neighboring countries after its acquisition of the Southeast Asia operations of Uber, which decided to pull out from the region. Grab Indonesia managing director Ridzki Kramadibrata said Indonesia remained the company’s biggest market as its services were present in 222 cities, while Southeast Asia would continue to be a region of focus. Grab claimed it held a 60 percent market share of two-wheeled transportation and 70 percent of four-wheeled transportation in Indonesia.  Just like Go-Jek, Grab has continued to receive funding from big investors, including Japan-based conglomerate SoftBank Corp, Chinese tech giant Didi Chuxing and the venture capital arm of Japanese car maker Honda, among others. Donald Wihardja, deputy chairman of Venture Capital and Startup Indonesia Association (Amvesindo), said Go-Jek had the opportunity to compete with Grab in the regional market after successfully dominating the local one. “Foreign investors from the tech and real sectors believe that Go-Jek can dominate the Southeast Asian markets,” he said, adding that Go-Jek, after the latest funding round, was catching up with Grab in terms of company valuation. According to sources, Go-Jek’s company valuation is now at around $9 billion, while Grab is valued at $11 billion. Donald projected that the competition between Go-Jek and Grab would be long-term, and that the winner would be the one that would continue to raise funds for expansion. The founders of Go-Jek said in the statement that they would continue to influence decision-making and direction of the company, while maintaining its long-term vision and pushing for business expansion. As quoted in the Go-Jek press statement, Caesar Sengupta, general manager of payments and vice president leading the Next Billion Users initiative at Google, expressed his company’s confidence over Go-Jek’s vision. He said Google was “committed to supporting [Go-Jek’s] innovation and contribution to economic growth”."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/953019/owto-tncs-ltfrb","title":"LTFRB warns new ride-hailing app OWTO to get accredited before launch","date":"05:40 PM December 16, 2017","snippet":"Upcoming ride-hailing app OWTO is reportedly set to hold a press conference next week for its launch, but the government has warned the firm not to push through or it would be dealt with accordingly.","body":"Upcoming ride-hailing app OWTO is reportedly set to hold a press conference next week for its launch, but the government has warned the firm not to push through or it would be dealt with accordingly. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Saturday issued a cease-and-desist order against OWTO as it had not yet been granted an accreditation to operate as a transportation network company (TNC).  OWTO, which presents itself as a “fair,” “safe” and “Filipino” TNC, should first consult with regulating bodies about the requirements for accreditation, according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada. “Before anyone offers anything to the general public, particularly these TNCs, they must present their business design to the regulatory body. That is the LTFRB,” Lizada told reporters on Saturday.  “They need to know what are the things and the requirements na dapat makita ng mga riders sa app. They cannot just do it on their own without consulting the proper government agency,” she stressed. Lizada said that the accreditation of TNCs are still open, but processing of applications for Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) providers are still suspended.  The new TNC was reported to have scheduled a press conference on Dec. 18 at Amo Gastropub on Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City. Lizada said the firm should postpone the conference. “To the organizers of OWTO, it is best that you coordinate with the LTFRB before you do any press conference, before you do any packaging, before you do any marketing, because you need to know the basic requirements the law requires,” Lizada said.

Go Jek’s rejection further cements Grab’s hold on the Southeast Asian market, particularly in Manila, where the Singapore-based firm has captured 90 percent of the market, according to local anticompetition officials.  LTFRB Resolution No. 96 signed on Dec. 20 denied Go Jek’s application through its local subsidiary, Velox Technologies Philippines, for violating Section 11, Article 12 of the Philippine Constitution. According to the law, a public utility franchise should be issued only to companies that are 60-percent Filipino-owned. Velox Technologies’ articles show that it remains 99 percent owned by Singaporean citizens.  Under Department Order No. 2018-13, transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab are treated as public utilities because of their role in mass transport. Because of this, transport network companies like Go Jek must comply with the constitution which limits foreign equity to 40 percent, according  to communications director Goddes Hope Libiran of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  While Grab hails from Singapore, its local subsidiary, MyTaxiPH, complies with the foreign ownership requirement. Should Go Jek reconstitute its ownership and board composition, it can appeal for reconsideration, Libiran said. Go Jek statement In a statement, Go Jek said the company “continues to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines.” With Go Jek facing a roadblock, the Philippine ride-hailing industry remains split among 10 players: Grab, u-Hop, Micab, Hype, e-Pick Me Up, Owto, Hirna, GoLag, Ryde and SnappyCab. Grab and u-Hop have yet to renew their accreditations. Grab’s s most serious competitor, motorcycle-hailing app Angkas, was edged out of the market last year after the Supreme Court stopped a lower court from preventing DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas drivers."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282346/grab-to-implement-addtl-safety-measures-in-car-services-vs-covid-19-spread","title":"‘New normal’ ushers in Grab’s ‘no-touch policy’ in car services","date":"02:07 PM May 28, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”. Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

Grab, which has been downloaded on 11 million smartphone devices and has expanded to six Southeast Asian countries since its launch in 2012, would continue to collaborate with regulators, including the Philippines that passed landmark ride-sharing regulations in 2015, co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said on Thursday.  Grab was formerly GrabTaxi. “We want to find even better ways to help solve local traffic problems like in C-5 and Edsa. These are things that we think about a lot,” Tan, referring to two of Metro Manila’s most congested thoroughfares, said in a media event here where the company announced its rebranding.  Metro Manila’s multihour traffic jams have made headlines in the Philippines and abroad. The metropolis suffers from the effects of urban congestion, with its population of 12 million and ageing and inefficient mass transport systems like the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 that runs along Edsa. More recently, critics of the ride-sharing sector said these platforms were contributing to the traffic situation, citing passenger car sales that the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said jumped almost 29 percent to 116,381 units in 2015.  Grab, which mainly competes with US-based Uber and traditional taxi services, has been rolling out new solutions to combat traffic but has faced challenges along the way. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) this week said it ordered the company to halt the operations of its popular GrabBike service, which ferries passengers using motorcycles. The LTFRB argued it has yet to issue guidelines allowing this service. Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for regional marketing, said the company would continue discussions with the LTFRB on how to move regulations forward since GrabBike offered a solution to road congestion such as it did in other parts of the region like Indonesia. “Traffic in the Philippines is not a joke. But Indonesia is a monster. It has the worst traffic jams,” Goh told Manila-based media on the sidelines of the same event. “Winning in Southeast Asia means you have to convince governments. We need to work with them, you cannot be at war with them.” “Legislation needs to move [forward]. This is something that, through discussions, is possible,” she added.  Grab is also offering new features in line with its rebranding effort apart from the establishment of engineering centers, one each in Seattle, US, Beijing, China and Singapore. Grab, which is present in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, said it has about 200,000 drivers on its network servicing some 1.5 million bookings per day. The company claims to control about 95 percent of the market share in the third-party taxi booking app business and over 50 percent for private car booking in Southeast Asia. Apart from car and bike bookings, it offers last mile delivery via GrabExpress and GrabHitch, a carpooling service not yet available in the Philippines."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1208559/grab-users-dismayed-by-measly-refund","title":"Grab users dismayed by measly refund","date":"05:48 AM January 03, 2020","snippet":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated.","body":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated. In the past year, he had used the app almost every day. He estimates that he has spent thousands of pesos on the premium hailing service for a faster commute in Metro Manila.  But on New Year’s Eve, he was surprised to see a refund of only P27 split in three tranches: P15, P9 and P3. “It was frustrating,” he said. “Obviously I had spent much more than what I got.”  He’s not the only one. Millions of Grab passengers on Tuesday had also received almost the same amount, as Grab rolled out the P19.4-million penalty imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for charging beyond the acceptable fare-in-range during two separate monitoring periods. Each peso a user received stands for every P1,200 (for those who used the app in February-May) or P400 (May-August) he spent on the app.  PJ’s P27 rebate means he spent anywhere between P10,800 and P32,400 for the ride-hailing service. Beyond that, however, Commuters of the Philippines founder Julius Dalay said the recent rebate rollout was symptomatic of the government’s lax regulation of transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab, leaving passengers vulnerable to overcharging fares. While Grab maintains that it abides by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)’s fare matrix, the variables in the fare (P2-minute travel fee and surge rate) means it sometimes go beyond the acceptable fare-in-range set by the PCC. “This is more a symptom of regulation not being strengthened,” Dalay said in an interview. “Both the LTFRB and the PCC need to coordinate and put in place a system where they can better monitor if Grab is overcharging its passengers.” The LTFRB earlier launched an initial investigation into Grab’s alleged price-gouging practices and found that a large number of the complaints it filtered were not instances of overcharging, but the result of severe traffic doubling the time rate of the fare matrix.  A large part of this is the surge component, which is computed by adding time and distance and multiplying it to up to 2x. Grab uses an estimated travel time to compute its fares upfront, which could make other fares seem like “overcharging.” The two sample fare breakdowns shown by the LTFRB to reporters illustrated as much. In one of the sample fares that cost P478, covering 12 kilometers under 49 minutes, Grab had “overcomputed” the distance rate at P187.80 (P12x15 should have been P180) and the time rate at P122 (P49x2 should have been P98), but had adjusted the surge rate by P181. Another trip that cost P439, which took 43 minutes covering 10 km “undercomputed” its time rate: P62 (should have been P86). It then “overcomputed” its distance rate by P1.20. It’s why the initial results are inconclusive, said LTFRB technical division chief Joel Bolanos. For the LTFRB to charge Grab of overcharging, it must have proof that the excess computations are systematic, not outliers. Dalay added that there was also an issue with the way the rebates were rolled out. Passengers have no way of knowing if the rebates matched their actual expense. “The way that the rebates were computed is not transparent. There’s no counterchecking. While Grab can claim they have a system in place, people should still have the capacity to know how the rebates was obtained,” he said. Moving forward, he also urged Grab and other TNCs to be more transparent with their fare breakdowns so commuters can verify for themselves if they are being overcharged. “This is not only for the benefit of the passengers but also for them. So that when the time comes and regulators again question discrepancies, they can easily pinpoint where overcharging has taken place,” he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/254610/ghost-tale-ride-hailing-newbie-micab-encounters-problems-expanding-ph","title":"A ghost tale? Ride-hailing newbie Micab encounters problems in expanding in PH","date":"05:16 AM July 27, 2018","snippet":"Ride-hailing newcomer Micab is struggling to expand operations this year, saying its drivers have been hesitating to take ride requests due to over 29,000 phantom bookings it had alleged to Grab Philippines.","body":"Ride-hailing newcomer Micab is struggling to expand operations this year, saying its drivers have been hesitating to take ride requests due to over 29,000 phantom bookings it had alleged to Grab Philippines. Micab CEO and cofounder Eddie Ybañez said the company had received enough commitments from taxi operators to scale their current pool of drivers to 15,000 in September from the current 6,500.  The problem, however, is that its entry has been mired by so-called phantom bookings that began in June. Rides are booked, but later cancelled. As a result, drivers became less willing to activate the Micab app because of the phantom bookings, which nearly doubled in two months’ time, from 15,000 in June to more than 29,000 this month, he said.  Micab, one of the few transport network company (TNC) entrants accredited in April, was part of the promise to keep the market competitive. It was supposed to give consumers a choice, after Grab became a monopoly through a regional takeover of rival Uber. Micab first recognized these phantom bookings by looking into passenger accounts that have cancelled at least three times in short intervals.  But before the company could stop these phantom bookings, its drivers would have already wasted time and fuel, an unnecessary cost just when the prices of basic goods are increasing. “They’ll switch on the meter only when the passenger finally gets in. So the risk actually is that the driver goes there and then there is no one there,” he said, noting there were no refunds in these cases. Most of these bookings were then followed by a call recruiting the Micab driver to switch to Grab, he said. The person on the other line would even give a counteroffer. These calls came from cellphone numbers that have “sequential” last digits, suggesting the accounts were bought in bulk, the official said. “Our conclusion is this is just one entity. It’s like a campaign,” he said. To address the issue, Ybañez said the company had recently used an algorithm automatically banning phantom bookings after three cancellations done in short intervals.  He said they were still monitoring the results. The problem, however, is that people behind this campaign can register new numbers. Asked if Micab has already reached out to authorities, he said a legal team was still examining options. If the issue is not resolved by the app’s algorithm, the best they could do is to “minimize” the number of incidents, he said. Nevertheless, the Cebu-based cofounder is only asking for fair play. “We just want this to stop,” he said."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/264192/passenger-in-cebu-shares-hilarious-ride-hailing-experience","title":"Passenger in Cebu shares hilarious ride-hailing experience","date":"October 15,2019 - 01:38 PM","snippet":"","body":" CEBU CITY, Philippines— Have you ever tried booking a ride but your driver arrives at your destination first before you even hop aboard?

While bike-hailing is a fairly straightforward process, MoveIt has installed extra features to guarantee the safety of and continuous feedback from its drivers and passengers, said Eric Torres, operations mana­ger of the ride-hailing platform.  For one, passengers can share their live location with friends and family who can track them while they’re on the ride, Torres said. MoveIt has also added a feedback mechanism in which drivers and passengers can rate each other.  “That way,” Torres said, “we know how we perform, and we have a record also of how the customer was.” All the raw data will be fed directly to the multiagency Technical Working Group (TWG) during the three-month pilot test, which will run until March 23.  “That’s the difference between the first and the exten­ded pilot test,” Torres said. The three-month test run is aimed at determining whether motorbikes are safe for public transport. There is big demand for motorcycle taxi service in Metro Manila where commuters often spend three to fours hours daily on the road while taking traditional public transport to get to work and home due to severe road congestion. As the names of its two competitors appear on the news, MoveIt busies itself with the prospect of entering a market long accustomed to and remarkably protective of Angkas, the country’s first motorcycle taxi service. The other newbie is JoyRide. “Of course, we need to make ourselves known to the riding public,” Torres said in an interview with the Inquirer. “The challenge like any other, is getting the right number of riders to run your fleet and then getting a good share of the customer base to take on your services.” Right now, around 1,414 drivers have joined MoveIt’s platform, which began initially as a parcel delivery service.  Operating a fleet of motorcycle taxis has been among MoveIt’s goals since Trans-Serve Corp., its parent company, began in 2015, Torres said. But the firm had to shelve the service as bikes-for-hire are still banned under Philippine laws. So when the Department of Transportation announced the first pilot run in May, Torres said, MoveIt had expressed its intent to join. “But the department expressed pre­ference for one player for easier monitoring. We just respected that and we just focused on enhancing the app and preparing for parcel delivery.” Torres was confident that MoveIt, despite being a startup, could keep pace with its two other competitors, one of which has been in the running since 2017. The equalizer is the TWG guidelines, which provide a strict set of rules that the companies must follow. Of the guidelines, perhaps the most important requirement is to make sure that the drivers undergo a rigorous training process that not only assesses their navigation skills but also their ability to transport a “backrider” (passenger). For this, MoveIt has tapped Honda Safety Training Center, perhaps the only certified motorcycle training center in the country. There, drivers are taught the basics of road and traffic conditions, and undergo a separate vehicle inspection to test their bike’s safety and integrity. Applicant drivers can avail themselves of this training for free and for as many times as they need, said Torres. But it’s a careful process. “Not all who apply are accepted. So you see, even if the process itself is simple, we’re very careful especially when both the go­vernment and the public are watching.” Apart from the training, MoveIt’s riders are also given safety gear and service merchandise for which they must pay a “performance bond.” This bond acts like a deposit, which is refundable once they permanently leave the platform. “Under the new amended guidelines, the TWG will be gi­ven access to our database and dashboard,” Torres said. “They can now monitor our real-time operations.” The amended guideline is crucial if the TWG wishes to wrap up the test by March. During the first leg of the study, the group had to wait for Angkas’ monthly data before it could validate and assess the results.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); That, in part, caused the current confusion between Angkas and transport re­gulators, who are disputing the number of riders on the platform of the motorcycle taxi-service provider. Angkas claims to have 27,000 drivers, but the TWG only has over 2,400 drivers on hand. Drivers welcomeWill MoveIt be willing to accommodate some of the 17,000 Angkas drivers who will fall outside the 10,000 cap set by the TWG? “Of course,” Torres said. “We will try to fill up our slots as much as possible. We welcome all, even ‘habal-habal.’ But they’ll still have to go through the process to be fair to all applicants.” MoveIt would ensure that its rates are competitive to entice more riders on its platform, according to Torres. Riders, for one, can benefit from an 80-20 sharing scheme in their favor and from state-mandated insurance. Ultimately, MoveIt is looking to help make the three-month study successful. And the sooner the study is terminated, “the better for everyone involved,” Torres said. “If you just keep on extending the study, it could mean we’re not getting anything from the study,” he said. “The aim really should be to have meaningful data and analysis to send to Congress so that it can craft a law at the soo­nest possible time. The sooner they’re able to enact the law, [the] better not just for the motorcycle [drivers] but for the already troubled commuting public as well.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1211444/weight-check-all-about-safety-implementation-still-being-studied-angkas","title":"Weight check ‘all about safety’; implementation still being studied – Angkas","date":"07:02 PM January 10, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing firm Angkas on Friday clarified the addition of the “Weight Safety Check” in its booking application, and stressed it’s “all about safety.”","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing firm Angkas on Friday clarified the addition of the “Weight Safety Check” in its booking application, and stressed it’s “all about safety.” Angkas said the decision was based on discussions with the Department of Transportation (DOTr) back in June 2019.  “You can find this specific provision already referenced in the passenger safety cards carried by our bikers and the materials posted online,” the ride-hailing firm said in a statement.

Grab Philippines country chief Brian Cu has expressed his support for the investigation into the death of Maquidato, who was hailed by their company as one of their best drivers last October 2016, for providing a free ride to a passenger who was about to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Cu said they would provide a reward of P100,000 to anyone who could give any leads on Maquidato’s killing.  He also moved to institutionalize additional security measures to verify the identity of passengers booking rides. “We support the plan to institutionalize in the system of Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) additional security measures that would help verify the identity of the passengers, especially those contracting ride-hailing services at night. This should be done, of course, with the understanding that the information would be kept confidential,” Poe said. As the Senate public services committee drafts the law on app-based riding services, Poe said they would take into account and include provisions that would not just ensure the safety of the riders but the drivers as well. “It is lamentable that in the past months, the TNVS community has become the target of lawless elements, victimizing its driver-partners. They need protection, as well,” the senator said. “Swift justice is the least we could give to Junjie, who is known to be a good samaritan among his colleagues and passengers for his generous deeds,” she added. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1202866/senate-inquiry-into-alleged-abuse-poor-service-of-grab-ph-sought","title":"Senate inquiry into alleged ‘abuse, poor service’ of Grab PH sought","date":"04:19 PM December 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Senator Imee Marcos is pushing for an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service” of ride-hailing company Grab Philippines. Marcos filed on Wednesday Senate Resolution No. 283 urging the appropriate Senate panel to conduct an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service of Grab PH and its effective monopoly of ride hailing services.”  “Various reports state that Grab prices (are) increasing to exorbitant amounts during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, with commuters experiencing more than double their usual fare,” the resolution read. “In addition to the high fares during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, Grab commuters also experience difficulties in booking a ride, with reports of booking times reaching about an hour, if they get a booking at all,” it added.  Under the mandate of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) as defined by the Philippine Competition Act, Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines was subjected to “quality and pricing standards in clearing the transaction which were part of the voluntary commitments signed by Grab to address the competition concerns raised by the antitrust authority,” Marcos noted in her resolution. “Commuters using Grab services have consistently complained that fares are becoming more expensive now, after Uber sold its business to Grab, leaving them with no other ride-hailing company to choose from,” she added.  The PCC recently imposed a P16.15-million fine on Grab Philippines for overpricing and cancellation of users’ rides.

Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

Signed on Tuesday, the board’s Memorandum Circular No. 2018-19 also ordered all TNCs to issue electronic receipts showing the fare breakdown.  The order would take effect 15 days after its publication in a national newspaper, according to LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III. The memorandum is applicable only to TNCs with transport network vehicle services (TNVS) or private vehicles that can be booked for solo or carpooled rides. Of the six ride-hailing apps accredited by the LTFRB, only Grab and local players Owto and Hype offer TNVS.  Fare components The others — GoLag, Micab and Hirna — are taxi-hailing TNCs which already have the P2-per-minute travel fee integrated into their fares following the recalibration of their meters, a process which started in July.  At present, all TNCs share the same fare components: a P40 base fare, a P10- to P14-per-kilometer rate, a price surge of up to two times the regular rate, and the now-authorized travel rate. The LTFRB memorandum also meant that Grab, which was earlier ordered to pay a fine of P10 million for unilaterally imposing the P2-per-minute travel fee, could now reinstate it. Drivers complain Grab drivers earlier complained that since the suspension of the travel charge in April, their income had dropped considerably due to rising fuel prices. The memorandum was issued on the same day the board reversed a July 9 order directing Grab to reimburse passengers who were charged the travel fee through rebates for future rides.  However, the LTFRB stood firm on the P10-million fine it imposed on the company. In reaction, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said the TNC would file an appeal in connection with the stiff penalty, this time in the Department of Transportation. The board’s decision authorizing the travel rate partly stemmed from calls made by House transportation committee chair and Catanduanes Rep. Cesar Sarmiento, Muntinlupa Rep. Ruffy Biazon and Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo on behalf of the drivers.

At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement.   Grab Philippines on Monday said its new policy is aimed at reducing unreasonable cancellations for drivers and passengers.  “Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” he added. Grab said the cancellation fees incurred will go directly to the driver to compensate them for fuel and effort they have spent travelling to the location of the passenger.  The cancellation fee and no-show fees, however, will not be applied to passengers if the ride is cancelled within five minutes of getting an assigned a driver, if the driver is not moving towards the pick-up point, if the driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival, and if the driver indicates that he has arrived when he or she has not. The ride-hailing company said it is willing to refund any fees that were charged wrongly within 48 hours. The updated policy is effective on Monday, April 29, but Grab said is doing a staggered toll out to both passengers and drivers, which will be completed by the end of May. Among the other policies the ride-hailing company put in place to further discourage cancellations include: For drivers:  For passengers: Meanwhile, passenger’s accounts could be suspended for 24 hours should they cancel a ride twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations in a week, Grab said. Drivers will also be penalized or locked out of the platform if they excessively ignore or cancel passenger bookings without proper reason and for being selective of passenger destinations.

But in one way it has been good for investors who snatched up the newly public companies’ stock: The losses have scared off the competition, giving the leaders a duopoly in almost every American city.  READ: Uber, Lyft drivers protest, go on strike across the US, overseas The two San Francisco companies have already lost a combined $13 billion. And with no clear road to profits ahead, no one else has much of an incentive to mount a challenge using the same model relying on people driving their own cars to pick up passengers that summon them on a smartphone app, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  Even if another rival dared enter the market, it would likely be difficult to raise enough money to pose a viable threat after Uber and Lyft spent the past decade pulling in billions of dollars from venture capitalists. And in the past six weeks, they raised an additional $10.4 billion in their recently completed initial public offerings of stock. “There’s only a duopoly because both companies have enough capital to compete with each other and no one else does,” said Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey.  It’s likely to remain that way until any of dozens of companies trying to create self-driving cars refines their technology so they can launch a network of robotic taxis that removes human drivers from the equation. That breakthrough could enable them to slash their fares below the prices currently being charged by Uber and Lyft. Google spin-off Waymo has made no secret of its intention to muscle its way into the ride-hailing market with a fleet of self-driving cars built on technology that it has been working on for the past decade. Waymo launched a ride-hailing service with robotic vans in the Phoenix area five months ago, but only 1,000 people are currently allowed to use it. Besides being on the leading edge of bringing robotic vehicles to market, Waymo also is backed by more money than Uber and Lyft have combined. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., which is sitting on $113 billion in cash. In its IPO document, Uber listed Waymo as a potential threat along with Tesla, General Motors’ Cruise Automation and Apple. Lyft also cited Waymo and Apple among the companies that could undercut its position as the second largest ride-hailing service. But most experts believe it will still be many more years before self-driving car technology reaches the point that it can support a large fleet of robotaxis.  Until then, the U.S. duopoly is likely to continue, giving Uber and Lyft the luxury of focusing on growth rather than turning a profit, analysts said. That means ride-hailing fares in the U.S. are likely to remain below the actual cost of providing the service, a boon for consumers. “These subsidies will continue as long as each company believes they will be gaining new customers by having a lower price,” says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost. “The story now is growth, but growth is expensive.” Eventually, though, investor pressure will mount on the companies to make money, and doing that almost certainly will require higher prices for their rides. On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted that it will be three to five years before the company pivots to a focus on profit. That timetable hasn’t been well received on Wall Street so far. Lyft’s stock has fallen 29% below its IPO price of six weeks ago, and Uber flopped in its stock market debut Friday as its shares slipped by almost 8% percent. Markets with only one or two dominant players often create situations for companies to abuse their power or attempt to stifle competition. Regulators and legislators around the world argue that’s already happened in many corners of technology, with Facebook having a seemingly impenetrable stronghold in social networking, Google dominating search and Amazon controlling a wide swath of online shopping. That has stirred calls to break up some of the companies, especially Facebook, whose own co-founder, Chris Hughes, recently argued his former company has become too powerful for society’s good. For now, Uber and Lyft have been drawing upon all the money that they have raised from investors to keep prices relatively low, creating a barrier for smaller-scale competitors without the capital to sustain massive losses. Take Austin, Texas, for instance. In 2016, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city after voters approved regulations on ride-hailing companies, including fingerprint background checks for drivers. Four competitors stepped in to give rides in tech-savvy Austin, including two local companies. But the following year, Texas legislators passed a looser state law that superseded Austin’s, and Uber and Lyft came back. Shortly after their return, three of the competitors, Boston-based Fasten, locally owned GetMe and Phoenix-based Fare stopped operations, and the remaining one, nonprofit RideAustin, lost thousands of its riders. “It was a matter of a couple months and those three companies were gone,” said Chris Simek, an associate research scientist with the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, who co-authored a study of Uber and Lyft’s impact on ride-hailing in Austin.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Uber hasn’t been as successful thwarting competition outside the U.S. It has waved a white flag during the past three years in Russia , China and parts of Southeast Asia by selling its services in those parts of the world to stronger rivals.Lyft has not expanded outside North America yet, so it faces few other competitors besides Uber in the U.S. Via has managed to carve out a niche by running a pooled ride system in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and it contracts to provide transit in about 70 cities worldwide. It competes most directly in New York, where Uber and Lyft also offer pooled services that transport multiple riders. Via specializes in carrying up to six passengers at a time, largely in vans, and is growing because it can do a more efficient job carrying more people, said spokeswoman Gabrielle McCaig. Still, the company is losing money as it invests in growing the business, she said. And so it remains, at least for now, that Uber and Lyft will occupy the ride-hailing industry’s driver’s seat. “It is hard to see a third or fourth player coming in at this point,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White. “I think we are looking at a duopoly in North America.”"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/179300/tugade-signs-order-ltfrb-regulate-ride-hailing-firms","title":"Tugade signs order for LTFRB to regulate ride-hailing firms","date":"June 11,2018 - 09:34 PM","snippet":"","body":"TRANSPORT Secretary Arthur Tugade has signed an order allowing the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to regulate transport network vehicle services (TNVS) and transport network companies (TNCs).

But with public transportation still insufficient to ferry all commuters going back to work, bike-hailing companies like Angkas are lobbying to allow anew backriding although with even more additional safety precautions.  During a press briefing on Friday, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca unveiled their prototypes for a “backpack shield,” or high-density acrylic shields strapped to the back of the driver, to isolate them from passengers. The design is similar to the ones introduced by Jakarta’s bike drivers when it, too, laxed travel restrictions to revive its economy. They’re low-cost, drag-resistant, and deliberately sourced to minimize additional injury to the riders in cases of accidents.  “It’s not a question of whether we want to resume operations, but how we can help out in this crisis,” Royeca said. Since March, Angkas and the two other bike-hailing companies in the country, JoyRide and MoveIt, have been forced to pivot to food and item deliveries to help their drivers cope with the pandemic.  “Now that most people are allowed to return to work, our riders are excited to ferry passengers again, since that’s really what constitutes much of their income,” he added. For former Quezon Rep. Winnie Castelo, the times call for the need “to be more creative under this crisis.” The backpack shields are still in their prototype stage, as Angkas continues to study its aerodynamics and material to minimize physical harm to the riders. Castelo suggests to modify the speed limit for bikes to reduce the chances of road accidents. For Dr. Jun Belizario, dean of the University of the Philippines-College of Public Health, the shields are not a 100-percent guarantee against contracting the virus, “but it can help.” “We cannot wait for a vaccine to come before motorcycle taxis are allowed to operate again,” Belizario added. “We are suffering because of a lack of opportunities to earn a living compounded by the lack of public transport opportunities during the quarantine.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1019383/new-york-moves-to-cap-uber-app-ride-vehicles","title":"New York moves to cap Uber, app-ride vehicles","date":"07:52 AM August 09, 2018","snippet":"NEW YORK – New York’s city council on Wednesday dealt a blow to Uber and other car-for-hire companies, passing a bill to cap the number of vehicles they operate and impose minimum pay standards on drivers.","body":"NEW YORK – New York’s city council on Wednesday dealt a blow to Uber and other car-for-hire companies, passing a bill to cap the number of vehicles they operate and impose minimum pay standards on drivers. It makes New York the first major US city to limit the number of app-based rides and to impose pay rules, with authorities under pressure to act over pollution and worsening congestion.  The financial capital of 8.5 million is the biggest app-ride market in the United States, where public transport woes and astronomical parking costs have helped fuel years of untamed growth by the likes of Lyft and Uber. But that growth has brought New York’s iconic yellow cabs to their knees and since December, six yellow-cab drivers have committed suicide.  Those deaths have been linked to desperation over plummeting income. The increased competition has slashed the value of yellow cab taxi licenses from more than $1 million in 2014 to less than $200,000 today. The bill stipulates a 12-month cap on all new for-hire-vehicle licenses, unless they are wheelchair accessible, as well as minimum pay requirements for app drivers – regulated by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).  The TLC, which regulates taxis and is a powerful force in New York politics, commissioned a study recently in a bid to underscore the chaos and push city authorities into taking action. That report recommended a guaranteed income of $17.22 an hour for drivers – the city’s $15 minimum wage is due to come into effect at the end of 2018 – plus a supplement to mitigate against rest time. Uber hit back Wednesday, saying the 12-month pause would threaten one of the city’s “few reliable transportation options” – a swipe at a burgeoning subway crisis – “while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion.” “Uber will do whatever it takes to keep up with growing demand and we will not stop working with city and state leaders… to pass real solutions like comprehensive congestion pricing,” a spokesperson said. ‘Workers prevailed’  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, vowed to sign the bill into law, claiming that it would “stop the influx of cars contributing to the congestion grinding our streets to a halt.” “More than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation,” De Blasio said. It comes after the city was forced to shelve plans in 2015 to cap the number of vehicles operated by Uber, after the multibillion-dollar corporation fought tooth and nail against the legislation in a slick ad campaign. The Independent Drivers Guild, which represents more than 65,000 app-based drivers such as those from Lyft and Uber, on Wednesday celebrated. “Workers and New York leaders made history today. It’s not easy taking on Silicon Valley behemoths, but we kept on fighting for what we know is right and today the workers prevailed,” said executive director Ryan Price. Most drivers in New York work full time and are often immigrants without higher education. They get into heavy debt to buy their vehicle license and have little other means of generating income. Around 85 percent earn substantially less than the equivalent of a $15-an-hour minimum wage, according to the TLC-commissioned study. Around 80,000 drivers work for at least one of the big four app-based companies in New York, compared to 13,500 yellow cab drivers, it found. Last year, London’s transport authority stripped Uber of its license over safety concerns, but the corporation appealed the decision and was allowed to continue operating while the case was heard. In June, a British judge overturned the earlier decision and granted the ride-hailing app a 15-month permit.   /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1364257/angkas-allowed-to-resume-ops-under-extended-motorcycle-taxi-pilot-study","title":"Angkas allowed to resume ops under extended motorcycle-taxi pilot study","date":"02:41 PM November 24, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas is now allowed to operate back on Metro Manila roads under the extended motorcycle taxi pilot study.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas is now allowed to operate back on Metro Manila roads under the extended motorcycle taxi pilot study.

After imposing a P5-million fine on ride-sharing companies Grab and Uber, the LTFRB said that by July 26, drivers face P120,000 in fine and their vehicles would be impounded for at least three months if found to be operating without a certificate of public conveyance or provisional license from the agency.  The LTFRB action came after agency officials met with representatives of the ride-hailing companies Uber, Grab and U-Hop on Tuesday. During the meeting, Grab and Uber representatives admitted they listed thousands of accredited drivers in their databases despite these drivers not having franchises to operate from the LTFRB.  In its new order on Tuesday, the LTFRB told the ride-hailing company representatives to “cease with dispatch” the operations of these drivers by July 26. Drivers claiming to be affiliated with Grab and Uber but without LTFRB franchises would be apprehended.  Aileen Lizada, LTFRB board member, said drivers with expired franchises but had applied for renewal would be allowed to continue using their cars as public conveyances. Lizada said they ordered the ride-hailing companies to submit before the end of the month their updated list of accredited drivers. Based on the LTFRB records, only more than 3,700 app-based drivers had been authorized to operate. But representatives said Grab and Uber had accredited at least 56,000 drivers. The LTFRB had wanted to revoke the accreditation of Grab and Uber because of several violations. Among these was the failure of the ride-hailing firms to screen drivers before endorsement to the LTFRB and the accreditation of drivers who don’t have franchises to use their cars as public conveyances. But because Grab and Uber serve a significant segment of the commuter population, the two were just fined P5 million, according to Lizada.  Also because more and more vehicles are packing Metro Manila’s already congested roads, the LTFRB asked the ride-hailing firms to help set a limit on the number of privately owned cars that should be allowed to be used as public conveyances. Of the 9.25 million registered cars in the entire country, 2.4 million are in the metropolis. —Jovic Yee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1505516/lyft-records-more-than-4000-sexual-assault-cases-in-long-overdue-safety-report","title":"Lyft records more than 4,000 sexual assault cases in long-overdue safety report","date":"05:05 AM October 23, 2021","snippet":"Lyft Inc received reports of more than 4,000 instances of sexual assault on its ride-hailing platform between 2017 and 2019, it said, detailing the data in a safety report it had promised to publish about two years ago.","body":"Lyft Inc received reports of more than 4,000 instances of sexual assault on its ride-hailing platform between 2017 and 2019, it said, detailing the data in a safety report it had promised to publish about two years ago. The company report, issued late on Thursday, showed sexual assault reports on its platform had increased from around 1,100 in 2017 to some 1,800 in 2019. But it said bookings increased at a higher rate during that time, resulting in a 19% drop in the overall incident rate.  Lyft said more than 99% of its journeys had occurred without any safety incident. “While safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many. Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can,” Jennifer Brandenburger, head of policy development and research, said in a company blog post.  The company said it has invested in safety features, employed rigorous driver background checks, and consulted sexual assault experts. Lyft had committed to releasing its report at the end of 2019, when its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc provided the ride-hailing industry’s first detailed safety report.  Uber at the time disclosed it had received some 6,000 reports of sexual assault related to 2.3 billion trips in the United States in 2017 and 2018. Lyft, which services significantly fewer trips than Uber, did not disclose the total number of rides it completed in its Thursday safety report, but at 0.0002% the incident rate was the same as Uber’s. Unlike Uber, Lyft did not disclose what share of incidents resulted in drivers being harmed. Uber’s report showed riders accounted for roughly half of the accused in sexual assault reports."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1138334/cebu-drivers-wont-join-metro-manila-tvns-strike","title":"Cebu drivers won’t join Metro Manila TVNS strike","date":"07:10 PM July 05, 2019","snippet":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8).","body":"CEBU CITY–Drivers in Cebu of cars enrolled in ride-hailing apps will not join their counterparts in Metro Manila in a strike on Monday (July 8). Cebu drivers said while they sympathized with their Metro Manila colleagues, they didn’t want to inconvenience commuters.  “A lot of passengers will be affected,” said Michael Malaque, a spokesperson for a group of drivers enrolled in Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) companies. Malaque said not only passengers but also drivers’ incomes would be hurt by the strike. “So what we will do is just ask the government to hear us out,” he said.  Malaque said his group wrote instead to President Rodrigo Duterte and Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade seeking an increase in the number of certificates of public convenience (CPC) for vehicles enrolled in TVNS apps without requiring their owners to obtain franchises. The drivers said they are appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to shorten the process of issuing the certificates.  Drivers currently wait up to six or more months for the certificates. At least 3,000 vehicles enrolled in TVNS apps currently ply Cebu. Majority have no certificates of public conveyance. Only 500 vehicles had been issued certificates. In their letter, the drivers appealed for the issuance of at least 3,000 certificates. The LTFRB earlier announced that at least 1,500 vehicles were at risk of being deactivated by ride-hailing app firm Grab for lack of papers. In a separate interview, LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III said the number of certificates for Cebu would stay at 1,500 which had all been taken already. Informed of the Cebu drivers’ appeal, Delgra said he has yet to receive a formal request.  “If there is a problem, let us talk,” Delgra said. “Let us not inconvenience the public by staging a transport holiday which is similar to a transport strike,” said Delgra, who is in Cebu for the launch of a government driver scholarship program.

According to the DOTr, “the best recourse [to convert] motorcycle taxis [into] public transport” is for Congress to amend Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  In a statement on Sunday, the DOTr also urged the public to wait for the report of the technical working group (TWG) it had created to study the feasibility of motorcycle taxis. In a Jan. 31 Senate hearing, Senators Ralph Recto and Grace Poe again suggested that the DOTr issue a department order regulating motorcycles for hire pending the passage of a law amending RA 4136.  When Uber — a ride-hailing app that offers rides in private cars — came to the Philippines in 2015, the then-Department of Transportation and Communication issued Department Order 2015-11 to categorize transport network vehicle services (TNVS) — or private cars — as a form of public transport. Recto said that issuing a similar order covering motorcycle ride-hailing apps like Angkas would allow the DOTr to regulate such services while waiting for Congress to amend RA 4136.  Not for hire However, the DOTr pointed out that RA 4136 specifically classified motorcycles as vehicles that were “not for hire.” “According to Republic Act 4136, passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (for hire), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification,” it said. A department order, it added, would also violate the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court in December that in effect halted Angkas’ operations. “The DOTr wishes to reiterate that it does not intend to antagonize Angkas. In fact, [it] has welcomed motorcycle groups in TWG discussions to thresh out the requirements and other contingent issues.

He said “loopholes” in the act allowed local government units to have different interpretations of the law. “Motorcycles have always been discriminated on, lagi nilang ginagawang cash cow. Itong mga discrepancy sa law na ito, may plaka, maliit na plaka, malaki na plaka, sa daan pagtitripan lang yung driver, pagtitripan lang ang biker,” Royeca added. The law requires motorcycle riders to have new plates and that it should be big enough to be read from at least 15 meters away. However, motorcycle groups said the size of motorcycles vary and the law would not be applicable to all. Royeca also claimed that out of 14 million motorcycle riders in the country, only seven million were registered with the Land Transportation Office which has yet to issue millions of license plates. “We will fight for our rights. We will not be discriminated upon. And we have the right to have a dignified livelihood and to be on the road just as much as everyone else,” Royeca said. “Putting a large metal plate in front is a ridiculous and stupid idea and should not be a law,” he added. Among the rider’s groups that participated in the Unity Ride were Road Guardians of the Philippines, KRG, Cavite Eagle Riders, Motorcycle Rights Organization, Bull Riders Club Philippines, Arangkada Riders Alliance, Philippine Advocates Road Safety, and Bulacan Motorcycle Rider Federation. /cbb RELATED STORY LOOK: Thousands ride against bigger motorcycle plates"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/982389/arcade-city-faces-getting-colorum-tag","title":"Arcade City faces getting ‘colorum’ tag","date":"07:28 AM April 15, 2018","snippet":"Transport authorities would launch a nationwide crackdown against new ride-hailing app Arcade City should it continue to defy the government and push through with its Philippine operations on Monday.","body":"Transport authorities would launch a nationwide crackdown against new ride-hailing app Arcade City should it continue to defy the government and push through with its Philippine operations on Monday.

The partnership – a first for Asia – will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab, said in a joint press statement with Citi. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as away for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region enabling credit card holders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions — in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depends on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam – markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes.

TV footage showed long lines of taxis and three-wheel minicabs blocking a central expressway, men setting tires alight and jumping on vehicles that refused to join in the protest. An Associated Press reporter witnessed drivers surrounding one taxi, forcing its terrified female passenger on to the road with her luggage.  It is the second major protest by taxi drivers in Jakarta this month. They say competition from ride-hailing apps, which don’t face the same costs and rules as regular taxis, has severely reduced their income. Many come to Jakarta from other parts of Indonesia and support their families as taxi drivers. Driver Jeffrey Sumampouw said his earnings have slumped more than 60 percent since Uber and other apps starting getting popular in Jakarta about a year ago.  “The government must defend us from illegal drivers who have stolen our income,” he said. “We almost cry every day because it’s difficult to get passengers.” Smartphone-based apps such as Uber have turned the public transport industry on its head worldwide. In the U.S. and Europe, the apps have been acclaimed by urban customers tired of struggling to find cabs, while taxi companies accuse the mavericks of running unlicensed services.  Uber has been making a big push into Asia, intensifying competition in a region where there already was a slew of ride-hailing apps such as Malaysia-based Grab, which operates in several Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia. An Indonesian startup Go-Jek, which hails motorcycle taxis, has also exploded in popularity in the past year. The demonstrations Tuesday elicited little if any sympathy from commuters in a city that already suffers massive congestion. “This protest is so terrible. They really are rude and overbearing. I was very hurt,” said Dewi Gayatri, who missed her flight for a business trip to Makassar in eastern Indonesia. “I still like Uber, and hope the government protects Uber, because it’s so easy to order and cheaper,” she said. Officials have given mixed signals recently about how ride apps would be regulated. Indonesia’s president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has previously defended the Go-Jek app in particular as making life easier for Jakarta residents and refused calls to ban it.  Haryono, a driver for the Blue Bird taxi company who goes by one name, said he wanted to keep on working but couldn’t avoid the protest. “I was forced to stop and join with them,” he said. “I cannot do anything because they look angry. It would be dangerous for me, my passenger and my vehicle if I denied their request.” READ: Brazil taxi drivers protest against Uber"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1318150/1000-angkas-drivers-to-provide-free-rides-for-health-frontliners-in-metro-manila","title":"1,000 Angkas drivers to provide free rides for health frontliners in Metro Manila","date":"02:45 PM August 07, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas has assigned its 1,000 riders to transport medical frontliners in Metro Manila to their workplaces and on their way home for free, amid the suspension of mass transport in Metro Manila and nearby provinces under the modified enhanced community quarantine.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas has assigned its 1,000 riders to transport medical frontliners in Metro Manila to their workplaces and on their way home for free, amid the suspension of mass transport in Metro Manila and nearby provinces under the modified enhanced community quarantine.   Under the Free Motorcycle Ride Project for Medical Frontliners program of the ride-hailing service, the 1,000 Angkas riders who will provide free rides to health workers will be assigned near the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, and Ospital ng Sampaloc in Manila; East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City; and Tala Hospital in Caloocan City. Based on an agreement between the Joint Task Force COVID Shield and Angkas, some Angkas riders will also be on standby at the National Kidney Institute, Quezon City General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Quirino Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City, and in Ospital ng Maynila and Fabella Hospital in Manila.  Task Force Commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said Friday that medical workers on their way home may approach the Angkas riders and present their identification cards to avail of a free ride. Aside from this initiative, Angkas also turned over 1,000 protective barriers to the task force, which will help facilitate the distribution of the materials to qualified riders.  Eleazar said the barriers will be forwarded to various police stations in Metro Manila for distribution to qualified recipients. He said motorcycle riders who regularly ferry their spouses, live-in partners, relatives, and friends who work as medical frontliners will be prioritized in the distribution. According to Eleazar, this initiative from Angkas is “a clear manifestation that the spirit of bayanihan is very much alive and continues to be a defining value of Filipinos especially in this time of global pandemic.” “We in the JTF COVID Shield believe that there are a lot of people out there who continue to extend assistance to their troubled kababayans as revealed by the countless good deeds that we regularly see in the social media since the entire country was placed in community quarantine,” he said. The government has earlier allowed motorcycle pillion riding for essential workers or authorized persons outside of residence under MECQ, provided that they install protective barriers in the motorcycles and follow minimum health protocols. The motorcycle that should be used should also be privately-owned and not for hire. Previously, only married couples and live-in partners were allowed for motorcycle pillion riding, a limitation set in place to help prevent the further spread of the coronavirus disease. The quarantine status in Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal were reverted back to MECQ following the appeal of the medical community for a “timeout” amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases under eased quarantine guidelines."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1301046/navotas-grab-team-up-to-provide-jobs-to-trike-drivers","title":"Navotas, Grab team up to provide jobs to trike drivers","date":"05:08 AM July 03, 2020","snippet":"The local government of Navotas has signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with ride-hailing app Grab that will see around 500 displaced tricycle drivers and residents employed as delivery service providers.","body":"The local government of Navotas has signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with ride-hailing app Grab that will see around 500 displaced tricycle drivers and residents employed as delivery service providers.

Lyft went public last month and its stock price fell 21% from its initial offering price of $72, and was selling for about $57 on Friday.  “With Lyft’s IPO being down more than 20% in a market that’s hitting new highs every day, that’s a dynamic that probably has been factored in as well,” said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. Uber is part of a wave of technology companies that are going public, and Pinterest and Zoom both saw their stock prices climb substantially after their IPOs this month. Slack and Postmates are also waiting for their turn.  Over the coming weeks Uber is likely to revise those figures as it launches its so-called road show, where it pitches the company and gets feedback from potential investors. It is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month. Uber also disclosed that PayPal plans to buy $500 million in stock at the IPO price, and that the companies will explore future commercial payment collaborations, including the development of Uber’s digital wallet. Uber gave potential investors a first look at its finances this month, revealing nearly $8 billion in losses over a decade. That mirrors the challenges faced by Lyft. But Uber also showed impressive growth. Its revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, which was a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and far above its $495 million in revenue in 2014. That rapid growth has continued this year. On a preliminary basis, revenue rose to a range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion during the three months that ended March 31, compared with $2.6 billion a year ago.  However, the company estimated losses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Uber chalks them up to operational expenses as the company continues to invest in its core platform, including spending on incentives and promotions. In the first quarter of 2018, Uber posted a one-time profit of $3.7 billion, helped by the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, which brought in $3.2 billion, and an unrealized $2 billion gain from Uber’s investment in Didi, the transportation network company in China. Both Uber and Lyft face an uncertain path to profitability as they deal with intense competition, high costs to pay drivers, increased regulation by cites and a long, uncertain road to the development of autonomous vehicles.“We know that companies with large losses tend to be problematic for IPO investors,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and IPO exchange traded funds. “There is no doubt that Lyft is a factor in Uber’s valuation.” While Lyft is primarily a domestic ride-sharing business, Uber is building a ride-sharing platform that it can also use to monetize its freight and food delivery businesses, Ives said. “Lyft doesn’t have that,” Ives said. “It’s more of a one-trick pony right now.” Uber also lost market share after a series of embarrassing revelations and has been working to repair its reputation. It disclosed earlier this month that it faces a criminal investigation from the U.S. Justice Department into a cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that took personal information of millions of passengers and drivers, among other legal challenges. Uber stockholders also will be selling 27 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase stock."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270155/rideshare-firms-have-snarled-up-san-francisco-study","title":"Rideshare firms have snarled up San Francisco–study","date":"04:13 PM May 09, 2019","snippet":"WASHINGTON — The ride-hailing era ushered in by Uber and Lyft once promised to complement public transit, reduce car ownership and alleviate congestion.","body":"WASHINGTON — The ride-hailing era ushered in by Uber and Lyft once promised to complement public transit, reduce car ownership and alleviate congestion. But a new study on San Francisco has found the opposite may in fact be true: far from reducing traffic, the companies increased delays by 40 percent as commuters ditched buses or walking for mobile-app summoned rides.  Published Wednesday in Science Advances, the study went back to 2010, before the advent of so-called transportation network companies (TNCs), and compared journey times and road conditions with 2016, by which time they had become a common sighting.   San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are headquartered, grew from 805,000 inhabitants to 876,000 during that period, as 150,000 jobs were added and the road network updated. The authors, from the University of Kentucky and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA), accounted for these changes via a computer model that asked: what would things look like if ride-hailing companies had not come on the scene?  Greg Erhardt, an assistant professor of engineering at the university, told AFP his team had found “some substitution” from private cars to TNCs as well as a slight increase in carpooling. “But the net effect is that two-thirds of TNCs are new cars added to the roadway, that would otherwise not be present,” he said. They also found that weekday vehicle hours of delay — defined as the difference in travel time in congested versus free-flow conditions –- increased by 62 percent between 2010 and 2016. By contrast, in the simulated model without ride-hailing companies, delays went up by only 22 percent — meaning that the TNCs were responsible for 40 percent of the increase. Deadheading and disruption  The findings were challenged by Lyft, which said the study had failed to account for increased freight and commercial deliveries — an area in which Amazon and others have aggressively expanded in recent years, as well as tourism growth. “Lyft is actively working with cities on solutions backed by years of economic and engineering research, such as comprehensive congestion pricing and proven infrastructure investment,” the company said in a statement noting its investments in shared rides and bikes. Uber called for more widespread congestion charging, arguing that “while studies disagree on causes for congestion, almost everyone agrees on the solution.” The study came as thousands of rideshare drivers in major US cities staged a series strikes against pay and working conditions. It also came ahead of Uber’s keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. Lyft went public in March. Proponents of ridesharing often use the argument that the majority of journeys take place at non-peak times, such as when people have gone for a night out and are returning home from bars. But the study found peaks occurring at 7.00 am and 8.00 am and then again around 5.00 pm and 6.00 pm. Among the cars’ most disruptive activities on traffic flow were curbside pickups and drop-offs, especially on major arterial roads, it found. Another notable effect was so-called “deadheading,” which Erhardt explained as driving around in search of the next customer. “It doesn’t serve a purpose in terms of transporting a person. So that’s purely an addition to traffic.” Data scraping The study relied on background traffic speed from GPS data obtained from a commercial vendor, but when the researchers approached the companies to share their own trip data, they were denied access.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); They were forced then to rely on a method of data scraping developed by Northeastern University that uses the companies’ public apps to learn about vehicle movements. Elliot Martin, a research engineer at the University of California Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, who was not connected to the study, said its methodology was rigorous. “I think that they did a good job of trying to draw comparisons, to look at what would have happened in a world where TNCs didn’t exist versus where they did exist,” he said, adding the methodology was the “best available” given the amount of information. Despite the findings, ride-hailing isn’t all bad, said co-author Joe Castiglione of the SFCTA. “They are providing services like helping people move around in the evening when transit isn’t great, or assisting the visually impaired,” he told AFP. The trick, he said, was to determine “how (to) manage the positive benefits without the negative externalities” through new policies like congestion pricing or curbside regulation. Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart city solutions at Harvard, and the former mayor of Indianapolis, agreed. “There’s no love lost today between most cities and Uber, but there’s a lot of customer loyalty, which makes it difficult for cities to cut back too much.”"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/45941/transport-ministry-in-indonesia-bans-ride-hailing-apps","title":"Transport ministry in Indonesia bans ride-hailing apps","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"INDONESIA—The transportation ministry has banned the operation of the country’s rapidly proliferating ride-hailing applications as it claims they do not fulfill the requirements for being public transportation, an official said.","body":"INDONESIA—The transportation ministry has banned the operation of the country’s rapidly proliferating ride-hailing applications as it claims they do not fulfill the requirements for being public transportation, an official said. The general director of land transportation, Djoko Sasono, said on Thursday evening that the ministry had issued a prohibition letter signed by transportation ministry Ignatitus Jonan on Nov. 9.  “Following the rise in the number of motor vehicles that are not official public transportation and carry people and goods based on internet applications, we took actions to prohibit them,” he said at a press conference on Thursday evening as reported by kompas.com. “Whatever the name, the operations similar to Go-Jek, Go-Box, GrabBike, GrabCar, Blue Jek, Lady Jek are all prohibited.”  He said that that the operation of application-based transportation did not meet the requirements of a 2009 law on traffic and public transportation and a 2014 government regulation on public transportation. The Ministry also sent the prohibition letter to the National Police and all local administrations and local police across the country.  “The requirements of public transportation are [that the vehicles] have at least three wheels, have legal standing and possess a public transportation business permit,” he said. Djoko said he did not mind start-up businesses. Still, he stressed that it would be a problem if private vehicles were used as unlicensed public transportation. Home-grown Gojek launched its application in Android and iOS in January and has been downloaded at least 5 million times as of Thursday. It competed directly with Malaysia-based GrabBike, which also provided service with automobiles as GrabCar. US-based Uber also found popularity among the Jakartans in the past year as its costs are cheaper than regular taxis. Online-based transportation has been serving people in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Bali and other big cities with more than 20,000 drivers.

The launch follows Singapore-based GrabTaxi’s debut, which began a trial run in the Southeast Asian country about six weeks ago.  Uber is one of the world’s largest on-demand transportation platforms. It is seeking an alliance with the government to smooth acceptance of the use of private vehicles for commercial transport. A taxi ride in Myanmar usually involves negotiating prices, no use of meters and a lack of air conditioning or seat belts. Using a ride-hailing app is still a relatively new concept, though the practice has been gaining in popularity.  Local travel services start-up Oway and Hello Cabs, a rival service run by a construction and auto dealership tycoon, also provide ride-hailing services. “I definitely want to try Uber,” said Nyan Zay Htet, a company worker who was haggling with a driver over a fare on a downtown street in Yangon. “I welcome having international companies come in because it can be more convenient for us if we don’t have to bargain over prices and can just hop in and go.”  Some taxi drivers, however, expressed alarm about other companies edging onto their turf. “My car is my livelihood,” said Tun Mya, who said he was already earning less because people were hailing fewer traditional taxis. “I am a bit worried … I don’t know what will happen yet, but we are watching,” he said. More than two-thirds of Southeast Asians are younger than 40 and the number going online to buy goods and services is soaring. A recent research report by Google and the Singaporean investment arm Temasek put the potential ride-sharing market in six larger regional markets at $13 billion by 2025, up from $2.5 billion in 2015. With more than 50 million people, Myanmar is growing fast and its public transport networks are not keeping up. Taxis are plentiful in Yangon, with local media reporting authorities estimate there are more than 50,000 on the city’s jammed roads. The industry is something of a free-for-all, with non-licensed drivers turning their cars into taxis as they please. But the government has said it intends to crack down on that. Incomes for most people are still low, so price competition may be key.  An online Uber fare estimator put the base fare in Yangon at 1,500 kyats (pronounced chuts) ($1.09) with a minimum charge of 1,800 kyats ($1.31). Uber has faced trouble from regulators in various markets, including China, France, Spain and Mexico. But generally they target services transporting paying customers using private vehicles that are not registered for public transport, not ride-hailing that uses smartphone apps to call licensed taxis. Phyo Min Thein, chief minister of Yangon Region, said the government was welcoming Uber and other ride-hailing companies into the market to improve transportation in the city."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283620/antitrust-body-fines-grab-p23m-orders-p5-m-refund-to-riders","title":"Antitrust body fines Grab P23M, orders P5-M refund to riders","date":"02:51 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) has slapped Grab Philippines with a P23-million fine and also ordered the ride-hailing company to refund P5 million to its passengers, citing breach in its pricing commitments. “The PCC has imposed a total fine of P23.45 million on Grab for breaching its pricing commitments during the 1st to 3rd quarters of the initial undertaking,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan said Monday.

Balisacan said drivers now have the choice to operate with any transport network companies (TNCs) and will not be tied to Grab “by way of any agreement, policy or incentive.” Grab, Balisacan said, must also improve passenger experience by setting standards for completion rates of drivers. For transparency, Balisacan said the company must also put in place a system-wide average fare cap to limit Grab’s ability “to unreasonably increase fares beyond pre-transaction levels.”  “While Grab’s commitments signal its willingness to behave within a competitive space and in accordance with the competition law, the PCC will keep a watchful eye on potential violations,” Balisacan said.

The LTFRB accredited Hype, giving app-based drivers as well as commuters an alternative to Grab, and eliminating Grab’s “virtual monopoly” of the industry that apparently followed after its acquisition of its rival Uber last month.  LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra III noted, however, that it would be up to Hype and other TNCs they would later accredit how they would market themselves to lure drivers and commuters to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  Bu LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said drivers would still need to obtain accreditation from their chosen TNC for accountability purposes. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to accrediation from the LTFRB, namely: Hirna, Go Lag, Micab, and Owto.  Delgra said they hope to accredit the other applicants once they have complied with the LTFRB’s requirements. For one, he said, these TNCs must show proof that they are able to accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry to the ride-hailing industry comes amid mounting complaints against Grab for its high fare and picky drivers. Brian Cu, Grab’s country head, has nevertheless assured the public that apart from passenger complaints mechanisms, they have in place in their system the ability to detect and determine if a driver is deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once they verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking, the erring driver would be summoned to their office for investigation and may be suspended or removed from their platform. /kga"},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/25736/lyft-ipo-sets-rollout-for-ride-hailing-sharing-economy","title":"Lyft IPO Sets Rollout for Ride-Hailing, Sharing Economy","date":"04:34 AM March 30, 2019","snippet":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share.","body":"The San Francisco-based firm was expected to begin trading as soon as Friday after it boosted the range of its offering price to between $70 and $72 per share. Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest. Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248514/grab-uber-deal-create-monopoly","title":"Grab-Uber deal to create ‘monopoly’","date":"05:13 AM April 03, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm Grab next week, the Philippine antitrust body has urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/214601/grab-citi-forge-deal-cashless-payments","title":"Grab, Citi forge deal on cashless payments","date":"03:31 AM September 07, 2016","snippet":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting.","body":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting. The partnership—a first for Asia —will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly, Citi announced in a statement from Singapore.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” said Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as a way for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region, enabling credit cardholders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions—in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depend on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam—markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes.  Grab is also testing new services such as social carpooling, as well as last mile and food deliveries."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270231/uber-shifts-into-lower-gear-prices-ipo-at-45","title":"Uber shifts into lower gear, prices IPO at $45","date":"06:41 AM May 10, 2019","snippet":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years.","body":"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years. The world’s leading ride-hailing service set the stage for its long-awaited arrival on the stock market by pricing its initial public offering at $45 per share late Thursday.  The price is at the lower end of its targeted range of $44 to $50 per share, a decision that may have been driven by the escalating doubts about the ability of ride-hailing service’s ability to make money since Uber’s main rival, Lyft, went public six weeks ago. Even at the tamped-down price, Uber now has a market value of $82.4 billion – significantly more than century-old automakers General Motors and Ford Motor.  Uber will face its next test Friday when its shares begin trading the New York Stock Exchange. No matter how the stock swings, the IPO has to be considered a triumph for the company most closely associated with a ride-hailing industry that has changed the way millions of people get around while also transforming the way millions of more people earn a living in the gig economy.  The IPO raised another $8.1 billion for Uber as it tries to fend off rival Lyft in the U.S. and help cover the cost of giving rides to passengers at unprofitable prices. The San Francisco company already has lost about $9 billion since its inception and acknowledges it could still be years before it turns a profit. That sobering reality is one reason that Uber fell well short of reaching the $120 billion market value that many observers believed its IPO might attain earlier this year. Another factor working against Uber is the cold shoulder that investors have been giving Lyft’s stock after an initial run-up. Lyft’s shares closed Thursday 23% below its IPO price of $72 in April. The jitters about an intensifying U.S. trade war with China also have roiled the stock market this week. Despite all that, Uber’s IPO is the biggest since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group debuted with a value of $167.6 billion in 2014. “For the market to give you the value, you’ve either got to have a lot of profits or potential for huge growth,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research.  And Uber boasts growth galore. Its revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3 billion while its cars completed 5.2 billion trips around the world either giving rides to 91 million passengers or delivering food. Uber might be even more popular if not for a series of revelations about unsavory behavior that sullied its image and resulted in the ouster of its co-founder, Travis Kalanick, as CEO nearly two years ago. The self-inflicted wounds included complaints about rampant internal sexual harassment, accusations that it stole self-driving car technology, and a cover-up of a computer break-in that stole personal information about its passengers. What’s more, some Uber drivers have been accused of assaulting passengers, and one of its self-driving test vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year while a backup driver was behind the wheel. Uber hired Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO to replace Kalanick and clean up the mess, something that analysts said has been able to do to some extent, although Lyft seized upon the scandals to gain market share. Kalanick remains on Uber’s board, although he isn’t expected to be on the podium to help ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to herald the company’s debut Friday. Instead, he is expected to be on the trading floor, perhaps savoring his newfound wealth. At $45 per share, Kalanick’s stake in Uber will be worth $5.3 billion. Hundreds, if not thousands, of other Uber employees are expected to become millionaires in the IPO. Meanwhile, scores of Uber drivers say they have been mistreated by the company as they work long hours and wear out their cars picking up passengers as they struggle to make ends meet. On Wednesday, some of them participated in strikes across the United States to highlight their unhappiness ahead of Uber’s IPO but barely caused a ripple. A similar strike was organized ahead of Lyft’s IPO to the same effect. Uber may be able to avoid Lyft’s post-IPO stock decline because it has a different story to tell other than the potential for growth in ride-hailing, says Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst with SharesPost. Uber, he said, has plans to be more than a ride-hailing company by being all things transportation to users of its app, offering deliveries, scooters, bicycles and links to other modes of transportation including public mass transit systems. “Whether or not that pitch will work kind of remains to be seen. It’s nearly impossible to tell now,” he said. “Obviously the risk to the company now is they have a lot more shareholders that they have to convince.” /kga"},{"url":"https://libre.inquirer.net/16432/netizen-ride-hailing-app-vs-the-lowly-jeepney-ride","title":"Netizen: Ride-hailing app vs the lowly jeepney ride","date":"12/18/2019","snippet":"","body":"VIRAL ngayon ang rant ni Angelo Ray with a Twitter handle of @artsybeaver as he compares the whopping fare difference between commuting using a ride hailing app and via jeepney.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) started by pointing out that a year after Uber left, ride-hailing has remained uncompetitive, referring to Grab as the very dominant player in this service. A virtual monopoly leaves the riding public with no alternative. Competition, on the other hand, forces players to improve efficiency and lower prices. The near-monopoly position of Grab explains the numerous complaints on fare surges even beyond rush hours, canceled bookings and other aggravations that riders have to endure since no alternative service exists.  At about the same time as the PCC announcement, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (Arta) called out the the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for sitting on the applications of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. The next day, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade directed the LTFRB to approve all complete but pending applications of these ride-hailing drivers. The Department of Transportation ordered the LTFRB to immediately release certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to qualified ride-hailing driver-applicants. Tugade also directed Transportation Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon and the LTFRB to comply immediately with Arta’s directive to automatically approve all pending TNVS applications and issue them the corresponding CPCs.  Arta’s action followed complaints from TNVS drivers alleging irregularities in the processing of their TNVS applications by the LTFRB. According to the complaints, their applications already had the complete requirements, but they could not operate as drivers and operators while waiting for the issuance of the CPCs. Aside from these developments, the PCC announced that it would also renegotiate the conditions that Grab had previously agreed to when it sought the PCC’s approval of the Grab-Uber deal, which resulted in the departure of Uber from Southeast Asia.  Those conditions, called voluntary commitments, took effect in August 2018 with the hope that they would improve market conditions, particularly the maintenance of reasonable fares that existed when Uber was still around. But those hoped-for improvements have not materialized. Exactly a year after PCC’s decision on Grab’s acquisition of rival Uber on Aug. 10, 2018, the competition authority lamented that the dominance of Grab (the surviving firm in the agreement with Uber) remains unchallenged, and competition has not improved in the ride-hailing market. It said the market continues to be uncompetitive despite the entry of a number of smaller transport network companies, which had big shoes to fill when Uber exited the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia. The PCC gave only a hint of what the new commitments would be, saying they would include adjusted metrics to hold Grab in check for its fare surges, instances of driver discrimination through booking cancellations and service quality. The commitments should be designed to prevent Grab from exercising its market power as a virtual monopolist, according to PCC Chair Arsenio M.Balisacan. They may also include measures that will allow smaller players to grow, or for formidable new competitors to enter the market for the benefit of the riding public. Last year, PCC officials warned that Grab’s failure to comply with the commitments would be met with a fine of P2 million per breach, or even the “unwinding of the transaction.” It’s really a puzzle why the LTFRB appears to be acting in a way that commuters feel is against their interest, with the regulatory agency throwing up all possible roadblocks to the approval of more ride-hailing companies that can compete with Grab, or more driver-applicants to increase supply and bring rates down. It’s a good thing the PCC and Arta are keeping an eye on such government agencies that, by their continuing failure to protect commuters and do their job with dispatch, openness and efficiency, are a huge disservice to the public."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/233826/grab-secure-historic-2-5-b-investment","title":"Grab out to secure historic $2.5-B investment","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings.","body":"PETALING JAYA, Malaysia—Grab, a Malaysian start-up that has amassed a dominant market share of the ride-hailing market in South-East Asia, is expanding into financial services with the latest round of fundings. The company is out to secure US$2.5billion in what will be the largest single financing in the history of South-East Asia for a start-up.  China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, both existing investors in Grab, will fork out US$2bil to lead the current round of funding. “We are already a clear leader in online transportation in South-East Asia with a 71% overall market share. We want to grow that further,” said Grab group chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder Anthony Tan to StarBiz.  SoftBank is Japan’s biggest Internet company that has a tech fund of over US$100bil that it has invested in other ride-hailing companies, including Didi and Brazil’s ride-hailing app provider, 99. “We have a long-time partnership with Didi, as we share the same commitment and leverage on each other’s technologies,” said Anthony.  “With the support of investors, Grab will achieve an unassailable market lead in ridesharing, and build on this to make GrabPay the payment solution of choice for South-East Asia,” said Anthony. He added that Grab was still looking for new and existing investors for the remaining US$500mil portion. The new round of funding is expected to be used to grow its payments platform, GrabPay, given the rise in demand for mobile payment methods and Grab having its own GrabPay function. Many are betting that Grab will transform GrabPay into a consumer technology firm that would be able to offer loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds. Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year. “We are always on the lookout for strategic investment opportunities in regional companies which have great technology and who share our vision to move South-East Asia forward. We want to invest in developing and expanding GrabPay to become the mobile platform of choice for South-East Asia,” he said.  Grab needs the funding to strengthen itself in South-East Asia to capitalize on the rising demand for ride-hailing services and also mobile payments. This comes on the back of competition from the world’s largest ride-hailing app provider, Uber Technologies. After facing a flurry of issues in global markets including Russia, China and the United States, Uber has turned its focus to South-East Asia and India. Uber recently began advertising its services in a bid to win confidence and also market share. Grab is now headquartered in Singapore. Anthony is group CEO of Grab and co-founder, and his partner is Tan Hooi Ling. Both were studying in Harvard when they decided to start Grab some five years ago. Anthony’s grandfather, Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, and his grand uncle Tan Sri Tan Kim Hor co-founded the Tan Chong group. His father, Datuk Tan Heng Chew, is the president of Tan Chong Consolidated. Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across seven countries in the region, with 1.1 million drivers. It recently entered the Myanmar market and has operations in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With this latest rounding of funding, it is said that Grab could be valued at about US$6bil. Grab has raised US$1.5bil since it started. Its previous investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, hedge fund Coatue Management LLC, venture capital firm GGV Capital and Vertex Venture Holdings – a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. It has six technology hubs, one each in Seattle, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangalore and Indonesia. Apart from Uber, Grab faces challenges from local taxis in most of its markets, and both in Indonesia and Thailand, it is also up against Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on demand. China’s Tencent Holdings Lte is said to have invested over US$100mil in Go-Jek."},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/290735/maxim-taxi-current-operation-only-for-app-rate-setting-testing","title":"Maxim taxi: Current operation only for app, rate setting testing","date":"February 27,2020 - 09:33 AM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Maxim taxi, a ride hailing app, clarified that their current presence in the country is still for testing their application and checking their rate settings.

Preparations are also being made to bring the app to Davao City in Mindanao and, finally, to Metro Manila, said MiCab chief executive officer Eddie Ybañez. In a phone interview, Ybañez said MiCab empowers big taxi operators who want to grow their brand by allowing them to compete with transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and GrabCar. Passengers can download the MiCab app from the Play Store on Android or Apple Store on iOS and book a Ken or Yoo taxi in Cebu or Light of Glory taxi in Iloilo for a minimal fee. MiCab partners with the taxi operators, distinguishing it from GrabCar or Uber, both of which partner with the drivers. “We only partner with a city’s premium taxi fleet operator who maintains particular standards on driver checks, random drug testing, employee benefits, training, and vehicle maintenance. We want to ensure that we give the taxi-riding public a safer and cleaner ride every single time,” Ybañez said in a statement.  In Cebu, MiCab’s exclusive partner is the operator of Ken and Yoo taxi brands. As of yesterday, Ybañez said more than 300 units may be hailed using the MiCab app. By April this year, he said they hope to equip all 600 Ken units with the MiCab app. In Iloilo City, where the app was launched Tuesday, MiCab has partnered with the operator of the Light of Glory taxi. Each of its 200 units has been equipped with a tablet. Ybañez said they were looking at about 500 taxi units in Davao and at least 2,000 units in Metro Manila to reach critical mass and succeed. “We already have partners there. They’re just waiting,” Ybañez said. Aside from the app, MiCab offers a patented advertising platform that allows companies to provide indoor and outdoor advertising in their taxi units. This revenue stream subsidizes the booking fees of passengers, Ybañez said. “We’ve deployed outdoor LEDs on top of the taxis. The tablets that the drivers use for the MiCab app will also run advertisements,” he said. “This enables companies to advertise to around 200,000 Ilonggos per month. Our system enables advertisers to schedule their ads, thus, targeting the right demographic, at the right time and at the right place,” he added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1544075/duterte-seen-signing-motorcycle-taxi-law","title":"Duterte seen signing motorcycle taxi law","date":"04:32 AM January 24, 2022","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to sign into law a bill that will legitimize motorcycle taxis before he steps down this year, a lawmaker said. “I’m hoping [House Bill No. 10572] will become a law in the next few months,” Samar Rep.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to Competition Chair Arsenio Balisacan. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anticompetitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted upon until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anticompetition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is uncertain. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber officials on Thursday to discuss interim measures that both PCC and the companies would have to agree on. “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” Balisacan said.  It is still unclear if the upcoming Grab monopoly would agree to PCC’s terms. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely,” the PCC earlier said in a statement. It said the deal would put Grab in a virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market and its review would determine whether the transaction would substantially reduce competition. The Philippines joins Malaysia, which said on Monday it would look into whether Uber’s move to sell its Southeast Asian business to Grab hindered competition. Earlier, Singapore also began a probe into the deal on similar concerns. Singapore had already proposed interim measures to require Uber and Grab to maintain their pretransaction independent pricing until the government has completed a review of the deal, arguing that it had “reasonable grounds” to suspect that competition had been infringed by the acquisition. Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network. Grab said it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/333811/transport-startup-deals-with-mobility-constraints","title":"Transport startup deals with mobility constraints","date":"05:02 AM November 05, 2021","snippet":"George Royeca is cofounder and chief transport advocate of DBDOYC Inc., better known for its Angkas ride-hailing bike service in the Philippines.

George was a recipient of The Outstanding Young Men awards in 2020. In this interview, he shared his thoughts on differentiation and strategy as a startup. George: Currently, transportation is our biggest service. We also have logistics, which is our padala service, and concierge service, which is our pabili service, both in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. Recently, we successfully completed pilot and we’re launching commercially the Red Cross partnership on home service for saliva RT-PCR (COVID-19 test).  In the future, health is going to be an important part of our content pipeline or service pipeline: providing home service for laboratories, blood work etc., even telemedicine. But also, in a very big way, we want to be able to really optimize or maximize deliveries and logistics for the country. George: The vision of Angkas is mobility on two wheels. We want to be able to do everything around the two-wheel ecosystem. Our stakeholders are, of course, our customers or passengers for both transport and logistics, and eventually for food.  Our other equally important stakeholders are our bikers in whom we create new entrepreneurs in two wheels. The hope is to be able to provide mobility and alternative transportation options for everybody. George: The key challenges in the Philippines right now are pandemic-related. I mean, the market is down and a lot of people are doing work from home, therefore there’s not a lot of people leaving their homes needing transport and mobility. Since majority of our services are passenger transport, this has really impacted us quite significantly. But just the same, we’re very confident that when the economy does start to go back, especially with the vaccinations happening, the need for public transportation will always be there.  The challenge right now is how to expand to various verticals that will make it efficient for the bikers to earn money throughout the day across transport, logistics and other services, such as health. George: I think that being the pioneer, we had a good head start. The brand of Angkas is very strong and we pride ourselves in safety. And we have the highest safety record, not just in the Philippines, but I believe across the region, with a 99.997 percent safety record (0.003 percent accident rate). We’re not a purely business endeavor, but also an advocacy that continues to fight for the rights of regular Filipinos to take care of his family using a motorcycle. This impacts millions of Filipinos nationwide, and I think that resonates with a lot of our customers. We’ve really built a community around it. So, if you’re using Angkas service, you somehow support our cause to generate meaningful and dignified livelihood for many low-income families. Safety has always been the most compelling aspect of our service and we’ve made sure that our standards are the highest across the board in terms of providing insurance, customer service and biker training. If we were a school, we’d be the biggest school for motorcycle safety training in the entire country. With over 150,000 bikers trained for free and passing only 30 percent, this shows that bikers of Angkas are among the best in the metro. George: Interesting enough, I may not change anything. The challenges of Angkas have also led to the strength of its brand. The way we persevered also inspired a very tight-knit community borne out of our collective struggle. So, I think that kind of feeds into both sides, the good and the bad, so to speak. Challenges created opportunities for us and without those challenges, those opportunities wouldn’t have been made available. If we weren’t so controversial, maybe we wouldn’t be as big or as relevant.  —Contributed Josiah Go is chair and chief innovation strategist of Mansmith and Fielders Inc.

The recent firings included both managers and lower-level workers, some of whom retaliated against employees after they complained about bad conduct at the ride-hailing firm, said Bobbie Wilson, a Perkins Coie partner involved in the investigation.  Uber Technologies Inc. retained the firm after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages. The Perkins Coie probe is separate from one being done by former Attorney General Eric Holder. He is likely to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber’s culture when his report is released publicly next week.  Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it has hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber’s chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company’s ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. After Fowler’s blog posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation.  The probe into Fowler’s complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn’t say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm “unfettered access” to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company’s size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation. The firings and hiring of Saint John are big steps in Uber’s trek toward repairing its image, which has been tarnished by Fowler’s blog and a number of management missteps so far this year. In its ascent to becoming the world’s most valuable startup, San Francisco-based Uber took Silicon Valley’s penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches.  For a while, this served it well. It’s the No. 1 ride-hailing company in the U.S. and is valued at nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber’s aggressive corporate culture and its 40-year-old CEO’s self-admitted need to “fundamentally change and grow up” has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It’s also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google’s autonomous vehicle arm. Uber’s former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering.

Stricter rules on private-hire cars, or e-hailing cars as they are called in Malaysia, and protests against Foodpanda by some riders and customers have sent shock waves through the country’s gig economy.  The government, in a bid to raise safety standards, wants all drivers of e-hailing companies to undergo written examinations on traffic laws, and health checks. They also have to change the status of their vehicles from individual private vehicles to e-hailing private ones in order to obtain e-hailing vehicle permits before the deadline this Saturday.  There are some 167,000 e-hailing drivers in Malaysia, but 22 percent of Grab drivers have quit to avoid complying with the stricter rules. Grab, the biggest player in a market of 31 e-hailing firms, warned customers yesterday that they may have to wait longer for their ride, especially during peak hours, after the deadline. Passengers now wait an average of six minutes for a ride.  Transport Minister Anthony Loke yesterday assured the e-hailing industry that it will be given time to comply with new rules, with no disruption to the system. Malaysia E-Hailing Drivers Association president Daryl Chong told The Straits Times: “We are very glad that there will not be any disruption to the system.” Meanwhile, dozens of riders for food delivery company Foodpanda are protesting against a new payment scheme that they claim would lower overall wages. The change affects riders working outside the Klang Valley. The company now pays those riders based on the number of deliveries made. Under the previous scheme, they were paid an hourly rate plus extra earnings based on deliveries made. But payment per order has been raised to between RM4.50 and RM7 (between S$1.50 and S$2.30) from between RM3 and RM5 previously.  The young riders’ complaints have been amplified by Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, who met the protesting group last week. Foodpanda has some 13,000 riders nationwide. Some users have begun a boycott, claiming the company is being unfair. In response, Foodpanda Malaysia managing director Sayantan Das said on Monday that initial data shows more riders actually earn more under the new scheme, which kicked in on Sept 30. The turmoil in the gig system reflects how the country as a whole is adjusting to the new ways of getting a cab and ordering food. Observers wonder if the gig economy faces an impending bubble. But government MP Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said: “It is important – and possible – for workers in the so-called gig economy to be paid living wages while such firms continue to thrive. All parties should realise that keeping wages low does nobody any good in the long run. Malaysian workers’ pay still lags behind other benchmark economies.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/290650/grabbike-prepares-to-deploy-15000-riders","title":"GrabBike prepares to deploy 15,000 riders","date":"04:06 AM February 17, 2020","snippet":"Grab Philippines wants to have 15,000 bike riders on the road under its motorcycle-taxi service, a move which will expand the reach of the ride hailing giant in congested urban cities.","body":"Grab Philippines wants to have 15,000 bike riders on the road under its motorcycle-taxi service, a move which will expand the reach of the ride hailing giant in congested urban cities.

But with perception over motorcycle-taxis changing over the last few years due to public outcry over unreliable mass transport and road bottlenecks, Grab said it was ready to provide solutions. “We’re getting ready on our end in case it opens up. We’re setting up our training facilities, the design of the jackets and materials that are needed, training the trainers, but we haven’t trained the drivers yet,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu.  Cu told reporters last week on the sidelines of the launch of GrabKitchen that the firm was willing to invest and train drivers, but they needed certainty on the fate of motorbikes. He said Grab intended to maximize the 15,000-rider cap set by the government. To do so, he said the firm would allow its current fleet of bikers, or the 20,000 GrabFood partners, to also use GrabBike.  Demand for GrabFood usually has a down time at certain points of the day, usually after lunch. The rider can then opt to switch to providing GrabBike services. Asked why the ride hailing giant would still venture into motorcycle-taxis, he said it was a “natural fit” for a firm operating in congested urban areas like Metro Manila. GrabBike is also present in other countries, such as Vietnam. If plans fall into place, the move will allow Grab Philippines to further expand its presence in the life of the commuting public, even at a time when the ride hailing giant has been flagged by regulators for alleged privacy and competition violations. For now, Cu does not consider motorcycle-taxis, such as Angkas or JoyRide, competitors of Grab’s four-wheeled ride hailing services. “I think it serves a different market. So if you’re saying we’re competing with Angkas, or JoyRide, or with motorcycle taxis, it’s as if you’re saying we’re competing with the UV express, with the jeeps, with the trains,” he said. INQ"}]}
