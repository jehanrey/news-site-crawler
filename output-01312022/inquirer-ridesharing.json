The announcement was made by Cat Avelino, Uber Philippines head of communications, on Friday as the company celebrated its fourth year of operations in the country.  The company, the local unit of San Francisco, United States-based Uber Technologies, currently operates in Metro Manila and Cebu, where it competes with main rival Grab. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines head of government relations and public policy, said there was growing demand in Pampanga, especially around the Clark Freeport Zone.  The Duterte administration has emphasized the development of Clark, which it sees as a solution to Metro Manila’s congestion woes. The Department of Transportation is currently expanding the Clark International Airport. It is also targeting to build a railway line linking Clark to Manila by 2022. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) earlier announced that the processing of driver applications would start on March 5. The moratorium was ordered since the LTFRB wanted a closer look at the ridesharing industry. It had been in place since July 2016.  Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular No. 2018-005, the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) was capped at 65,000 for Metro Manila. Metro Cebu would get 1,500 cars while Pampanga was allowed 250 cars. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, who was present during the anniversary celebration, said the 65,000 cap in Metro Manila was enough to serve about 75 percent of the demand. She said there were currently around 59,000 ridesharing vehicles in the capital district serving around 52 percent of available demand. The cap would be reviewed every three months, Lizada noted. “We want to see the churn rate, we want to see the blacklisting of drivers,” Lizada said when asked about factors the LTFRB would review. For riders booking either Grab or Uber, the optimal waiting time should be two to three minutes instead of the current 10 to 15 minutes, she said. This will also be considered in the LTFRB’s regular review, she said.

This is according to a report released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a global management consulting firm which conducted the survey in 10 cities in Southeast Asia including Metro Manila.  Titled “Unlocking Cities,” the report sought to assess the potential benefit of ridesharing in key Asian cities, namely: Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Surabaya, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Manila. One of the findings pointed to a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road during peak hours— from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 6 to 8 p.m. To come up with an estimate, BCG said it quantified the number of vehicles that could be taken off the road in a scenario where the mostly privately owned vehicles were substituted by ridesharing.  “In cities where private cars make up the majority of private transport, between 40 percent to 60 percent can be removed,” the report said, noting that this would be the case if ridesharing became the third, if not the second, most popular mode of transportation. Vehicle volume  There are about 2.4 million public and private vehicles in Metro Manila as of 2016, according to the Land Transportation Office. The BCG survey was conducted from September to October this year, covering approximately 300 commuters per city. This was around the same time Uber Philippines went back online after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board imposed sanctions on the transport network company for accepting new driver applications in spite of a government directive against it. The study covered ridesharing in general, which includes pooling and non-pooling. Among other benefits, the study said, ridesharing could also convince a good number of people not to own cars anymore. According to Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua, the company’s Uber Pool option—wherein rides are shared among people with common routes or destinations—accounts for 40 percent of their trips on average.

The moratorium was placed on the fast-growing ridesharing sector in July 2016, putting on hold thousands of new applications. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered the suspension, saying it needed to review existing guidelines. A year later, nothing has come out of that review.  In a briefing with reporters yesterday, Uber Philippines president Laurence Cua asked the government to lift the suspension, saying demand for ridesharing was only growing and more drivers were needed. “It will be a shame and lost opportunity for the many drivers who rely on Uber today,” Cua said. “Their livelihoods will be affected. Equally important are the passengers who use Uber.”  Cua said service quality had already been affected, with demand exceeding supply. He noted that some passengers have difficulty finding an Uber ride. Uber is currently present in Metro Manila, nearby provinces and in Metro Cebu. Demand has been going up over the previous year’s level. Uber tracks this interest through the number of times users open the app.  This interest was from all over the country, with most of the prospective demand from central Luzon and Visayas, according to data shared by Uber Philippines. “We continue to see a lot of people downloading and opening the app because they really are interested in a solution to their problems. People need to go from point A to Point B,” Cua said. He said Uber officially had some 7,000 driver serving more than 680,000 passengers. New driver applications numbered in the “thousands,” he said. —MIGUEL R.

The development finally gives legitimacy to global platforms like Uber, GrabCar, Easy Taxi and Tripda, which are present in the Philippines but would likely hurt the traditional taxi cab operators, with one organization saying they were mulling a lawsuit against the DOTC.  All the apps had been operating in the Philippines without the guidelines as the government implemented a general policy of holding off on arrests until the rules were finalized. The department order outlines the new classifications, including that for so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) that the smartphone rider-sharing applications will fall under. He said this will allow Transportation Network Companies (TNC) “to exist within our regulatory framework.”  With the department order’s release, regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board can begin working to finalize its memorandum circular, which would outline specific regulations and requirements for the platforms and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them [traditional taxi cabs] to modernize and compete,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a press conference this week. “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS [cars].”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” Abaya added. Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, disagreed with the government’s view and said this would ultimately hurt their business. Among the options, he said, would be to sue the DOTC and LTFRB as the entities did not take into consideration the impact of letting TNCs operate. “We are now relegated to a second choice,” Suntay said, noting unfair advantages of these transit application platforms since they have not been operating their own cars. He said services like Uber, which has been providing a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, have been benefiting from fares not regulated by government. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models.  The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans or other similar vehicles will be allowed. “A maximum age limit of seven years will be enforced,” the DOTC said. Operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details need to be ironed out with LTFRB. Chief among these is on the regulation of fares, which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249456/ltfrb-hype-transport-system-tncs","title":"LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab","date":"11:30 PM April 18, 2018","snippet":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount.","body":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount. With the LTFRB’s accreditation of Hype, app-based drivers as well as commuters now have an alternative to Grab, eliminating its “virtual monopoly” of the industry, which was feared by some quarters following its acquisition last month of the Southeast Asian operations of Uber, its former rival.  LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III noted though that it would now be up to Hype and the other TNCs that would later be accredited how they would market themselves so that drivers and commuters would migrate to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that the drivers would still need to have themselves accredited by the TNC of their choice for accountability. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to be accredited by the LTFRB. These are Hirna, Go Lag, Micab and Owto.  Delgra said that the LTFRB would accredit the other applicants once they had complied with the requirements. For one, he said that these TNCs must show proof that they could accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry comes at a time when Grab continues to be criticized for its high fare and its picky drivers. Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, assured the public on Wednesday that, apart from the passenger complaints mechanisms already in place, his company’s system could also detect and determine if a driver was deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking that driver would be called to the Grab office for investigation. The drive could then be suspended or even removed from the platform. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978259/poe-urges-ltfrb-to-ensure-ridesharing-services-wont-be-disrupted","title":"Poe urges LTFRB to ensure ridesharing services won’t be disrupted","date":"06:21 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should ensure that services of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to commuters would not be disrupted, Sen.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab. READ: Legal questions ain’t over for Uber “It’s the right decision to stop the issuances and review,” Suntay said in an interview. “We can coexist together with this industry, but what we’re after is a level playing field.” The development also comes as the DOTr, along with other government agencies, move to combat the “crisis” in Metro Manila. Ridesharing operators claimed their industry reduces road congestion since it discourages car owners from using their own vehicles or from buying cars./rga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/905332/embattled-uber-ceo-kalanick-to-take-leave-of-absence","title":"Embattled Uber CEO Kalanick to take leave of absence","date":"09:43 AM June 14, 2017","snippet":"Uber said Tuesday its chief executive Travis Kalanick would take an indefinite leave of absence as it unveiled steps aimed at restoring confidence in the scandal-plagued ridesharing giant.","body":"Uber said Tuesday its chief executive Travis Kalanick would take an indefinite leave of absence as it unveiled steps aimed at restoring confidence in the scandal-plagued ridesharing giant. The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination.  “If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,” the 40-year-old Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees. Kalanick said one of the reasons for his stepping aside was the recent death of his mother, explaining he needs time off “to reflect, to work on myself and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”  Kalanick said he would remain available as needed during his absence for “the most strategic decisions.” Uber simultaneously released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses.  Implementing the recommendations “will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” said Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.” The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.” The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. The company is facing questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Tone at the top The report said the reforms should focus on “tone at the top, trust, transformation and accountability.” It said the company should “review and reallocate responsibilities of Kalanick,” and that creating the job of chief operating officer, which was discussed in recent months, “should address this concern to some extent.” Uber should also consider installing an independent board chair, “to serve as an independent check on Uber’s management” and to show it is taking reforms seriously. The Holder report called for “an ethics and culture committee” to oversee Uber’s efforts to maintain ethical business practices. Uber should implement mandatory training for managers and key leaders, create a “robust” complaint process and take steps to ensure more minorities are hired, it added. An audio recording of Tuesday’s meeting released by Yahoo Finance indicated some tense moments. Board member Arianna Huffington referred to Kalanick as “the elephant in the room,” but she also called the change “a seminal moment” for Uber. When Huffington spoke of bringing another woman to the board, fellow board member David Bonderman commented that this would lead to “more talking.” Bonderman later apologized, according to a statement released to HuffPost. A statement released by early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor said they were encouraged by the “thoughtful and extensive” recommendations. Vivek Wadhwa, a Carnegie Mellon University fellow who follows the technology industry, welcomed the “solid recommendations” unveiled by the company.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Also commend (Kalanick) for stepping aside and doing what is right for company and employees. Expect he and company will be stronger and better,” Wadhwa tweeted. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The San Francisco group parted ways this week with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had been reportedly linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. Last week, Uber said it had fired 20 people following preliminary results of the investigation, after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and “physical security.” It remains to be seen what impact will be felt by the absence of Kalanick, who has been the driving force behind Uber despite a series of embarrassing missteps.

The moratorium was placed on the fast-growing ridesharing sector in July 2016, putting on hold thousands of new applications. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered the suspension, saying it needed to review existing guidelines. A year later, nothing has come out of that review.  In a briefing with reporters yesterday, Uber Philippines president Laurence Cua asked the government to lift the suspension, saying demand for ridesharing was only growing and more drivers were needed. “It will be a shame and lost opportunity for the many drivers who rely on Uber today,” Cua said. “Their livelihoods will be affected. Equally important are the passengers who use Uber.”  Cua said service quality had already been affected, with demand exceeding supply. He noted that some passengers have difficulty finding an Uber ride. Uber is currently present in Metro Manila, nearby provinces and in Metro Cebu. Demand has been going up over the previous year’s level. Uber tracks this interest through the number of times users open the app.  This interest was from all over the country, with most of the prospective demand from central Luzon and Visayas, according to data shared by Uber Philippines. “We continue to see a lot of people downloading and opening the app because they really are interested in a solution to their problems. People need to go from point A to Point B,” Cua said. He said Uber officially had some 7,000 driver serving more than 680,000 passengers. New driver applications numbered in the “thousands,” he said. —MIGUEL R.

The development finally gives legitimacy to global platforms like Uber, GrabCar, Easy Taxi and Tripda, which are present in the Philippines but would likely hurt the traditional taxi cab operators, with one organization saying they were mulling a lawsuit against the DOTC.  All the apps had been operating in the Philippines without the guidelines as the government implemented a general policy of holding off on arrests until the rules were finalized. The department order outlines the new classifications, including that for so-called Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) that the smartphone rider-sharing applications will fall under. He said this will allow Transportation Network Companies (TNC) “to exist within our regulatory framework.”  With the department order’s release, regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board can begin working to finalize its memorandum circular, which would outline specific regulations and requirements for the platforms and their drivers. “This is to merely offer better services to compel them [traditional taxi cabs] to modernize and compete,” Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said in a press conference this week. “People will get to choose whether they want to use the older taxis or TNVS [cars].”  “We shouldn’t look at this as added competition or to destroy the [traditional] taxi industry,” Abaya added. Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, disagreed with the government’s view and said this would ultimately hurt their business. Among the options, he said, would be to sue the DOTC and LTFRB as the entities did not take into consideration the impact of letting TNCs operate. “We are now relegated to a second choice,” Suntay said, noting unfair advantages of these transit application platforms since they have not been operating their own cars. He said services like Uber, which has been providing a platform for a passenger to link up with a private car driver, have been benefiting from fares not regulated by government. “We are a business entity, we have a big investment in our companies,” Suntay said, adding that they have asked the government to mitigate the impact on their business like limiting the types of cars TNCs can register to larger and more premium vehicle models.  The DOTC is also imposing certain standards for vehicle eligibility, such as the requirement of global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices for convenient and safer services. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans or other similar vehicles will be allowed. “A maximum age limit of seven years will be enforced,” the DOTC said. Operators will be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle to ensure accountability, the DOTC said. To promote passenger safety, drivers must be screened and accredited by the TNCs and registered with the LTFRB, it added. Representatives of ridesharing applications welcomed the news even as some acknowledged that several details need to be ironed out with LTFRB. Chief among these is on the regulation of fares, which some ridesharing applications currently dictate. Still, they underscored the current collaborative environment in the Philippines. “Today, the Philippines has officially become the first country to create a national dedicated framework for ridesharing,” David Plouffe, senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said in an emailed statement. “This first-of-its-kind order is a shining example of how collaboration between government and industry can advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity and put rider safety first,” he added. Representatives likewise said they were ready to compete. “We all agree that competition is healthy— it comes down to who will execute the best,” Natasha Bautista, deputy director general manager at Grabcar, said during the briefing."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249456/ltfrb-hype-transport-system-tncs","title":"LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab","date":"11:30 PM April 18, 2018","snippet":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount.","body":"Three days after Uber’s exit from the country’s ride-hailing industry, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited on Wednesday Hype Transport Systems Inc., a Filipino-owned transport network company (TNC) expected to rival the operations of Grab at a time when passenger complaints against it continue to mount. With the LTFRB’s accreditation of Hype, app-based drivers as well as commuters now have an alternative to Grab, eliminating its “virtual monopoly” of the industry, which was feared by some quarters following its acquisition last month of the Southeast Asian operations of Uber, its former rival.  LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III noted though that it would now be up to Hype and the other TNCs that would later be accredited how they would market themselves so that drivers and commuters would migrate to their platforms. Currently, the LTFRB implements a common supply base for app-based drivers. Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that the drivers would still need to have themselves accredited by the TNC of their choice for accountability. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to be accredited by the LTFRB. These are Hirna, Go Lag, Micab and Owto.  Delgra said that the LTFRB would accredit the other applicants once they had complied with the requirements. For one, he said that these TNCs must show proof that they could accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry comes at a time when Grab continues to be criticized for its high fare and its picky drivers. Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, assured the public on Wednesday that, apart from the passenger complaints mechanisms already in place, his company’s system could also detect and determine if a driver was deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking that driver would be called to the Grab office for investigation. The drive could then be suspended or even removed from the platform. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978259/poe-urges-ltfrb-to-ensure-ridesharing-services-wont-be-disrupted","title":"Poe urges LTFRB to ensure ridesharing services won’t be disrupted","date":"06:21 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should ensure that services of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to commuters would not be disrupted, Sen.

The move is part of a series of studies into current policies since the Duterte administration came to power at the start of July this year. The department was also studying existing public utility franchises, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said earlier this week.  DOTr spokesman Cherie Mercado said the ridesharing review was needed because of the “sheer volume of applicants.” She said the government also wanted to look into the fare scheme used by ride sharing app operators. Currently, the companies are allowed to dictate their rates, which they said were driven by supply and demand factors.  According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15, 2016. Of those, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber, the popular San Francisco, United States-based car hailing app. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review order was formalized via a memo from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, dated July 21, 2016. LTFRB said it would start reviewing policies on the issuance of franchises to Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) applications, which cover ridesharing apps.  READ: LTFRB member calls for limit to vehicles operating under Uber, Grab In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.” “The technical division is directed not to accept any TNVS application upon effectivity of this circular. All regional offices are likewise not to accept TNVS applications with proposed route to operate entering Metro Manila,” the LTFRB memo added. The DOTr was unable to immediately share figures on the existing volume of Uber, Grab and UHOP vehicles on the road. However, Jesus “Bong” Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, which had opposed the ridesharing sector given the added competition to the traditional taxi business and unregulated fares, estimated there were about 20,000 of these vehicles on the road today.  That compared with about 37,000 taxis nationwide, which Suntay said took about 60 years to reach against just two years for Uber and Grab. READ: Legal questions ain’t over for Uber “It’s the right decision to stop the issuances and review,” Suntay said in an interview. “We can coexist together with this industry, but what we’re after is a level playing field.” The development also comes as the DOTr, along with other government agencies, move to combat the “crisis” in Metro Manila.

The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination.  “If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,” the 40-year-old Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees. Kalanick said one of the reasons for his stepping aside was the recent death of his mother, explaining he needs time off “to reflect, to work on myself and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team.”  Kalanick said he would remain available as needed during his absence for “the most strategic decisions.” Uber simultaneously released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses.  Implementing the recommendations “will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,” said Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer. “While change does not happen overnight, we’re committed to rebuilding trust with our employees, riders and drivers.” The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors.” The Holder investigation was aimed at cleaning up a corporate culture marred by accusations of harassment, discrimination and cutthroat practices to thwart rivals and evade regulators. The company is facing questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Tone at the top The report said the reforms should focus on “tone at the top, trust, transformation and accountability.” It said the company should “review and reallocate responsibilities of Kalanick,” and that creating the job of chief operating officer, which was discussed in recent months, “should address this concern to some extent.” Uber should also consider installing an independent board chair, “to serve as an independent check on Uber’s management” and to show it is taking reforms seriously. The Holder report called for “an ethics and culture committee” to oversee Uber’s efforts to maintain ethical business practices. Uber should implement mandatory training for managers and key leaders, create a “robust” complaint process and take steps to ensure more minorities are hired, it added. An audio recording of Tuesday’s meeting released by Yahoo Finance indicated some tense moments. Board member Arianna Huffington referred to Kalanick as “the elephant in the room,” but she also called the change “a seminal moment” for Uber. When Huffington spoke of bringing another woman to the board, fellow board member David Bonderman commented that this would lead to “more talking.” Bonderman later apologized, according to a statement released to HuffPost. A statement released by early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor said they were encouraged by the “thoughtful and extensive” recommendations. Vivek Wadhwa, a Carnegie Mellon University fellow who follows the technology industry, welcomed the “solid recommendations” unveiled by the company.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Also commend (Kalanick) for stepping aside and doing what is right for company and employees. Expect he and company will be stronger and better,” Wadhwa tweeted. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The San Francisco group parted ways this week with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had been reportedly linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. Last week, Uber said it had fired 20 people following preliminary results of the investigation, after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and “physical security.” It remains to be seen what impact will be felt by the absence of Kalanick, who has been the driving force behind Uber despite a series of embarrassing missteps.

Swat Mobility, which operates in seven countries and has raised $20 million or about P1 billion to date, uses a propriety algorithm to provide “demand-responsive, ride-sharing services in high-capacity vehicles.” Ho said the Philippines was their third largest market behind Singapore and Japan. The company is also present in Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Swat Mobility entered the Philippines in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdowns in May 2020. It has provided about 1 million rides in the country and has 13,000 active monthly employee users, according to the briefing materials from the company. Ho said the company planned to grow its presence in Metro Manila while expanding in Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and Cebu. The country’s business process outsourcing and manufacturing sectors have been critical in its expansion, she added.

The Philippines was the first country in the world to release regulations covering ride-sharing, legitimizing the business amid protests by traditional taxi operators.

He added that there were also discussions with Grab’s rival, Uber “but the talks between Grab and MIAA were more advanced.”  Grab has been aggressively expanding in the country, either through new areas or product lines. It recently started operations in Cagayan de Oro, its seventh location in the Philippines, in addition to Metro Manila, Baguio, Bacolod, Cebu, Davao and Iloilo.

DiDi’s entry in the Philippines—potentially the latest in its global expansion—will bring down prices and offer more options for commuters, said Ilocos Sur politician Luis “Chavit” Singson, who confirmed negotiations with DiDi.  “We want to break the monopoly of Grab,” Singson said of the Singapore-based ride-sharing giant in an interview last week. Singson owns U-Hop Transportation Network Vehicle System Inc. (U-Hop), one of 10 Transport Network Companies (TNC) allowed to operate ride-sharing services in the Philippines.  U-Hop is renewing its accreditation before the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which last year issued a moratorium on the issuance of new TNC licenses. Singson was unable to provide further details on the group’s discussions with Didi.  A DiDi representative, however,  said in an email there were no current plans to expand to the Philippines. The email was sent on Nov. 5 in response to an Inquirer request for comment last Oct. 31. DiDi and Singson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. As a public utility, TNCs are bound by the 40-percent foreign ownership limit set by the Philippine constitution. Companies like DiDi will need to comply with the cap if it is to avoid the fate of Indonesia’s Go-Jek, which last year was denied a license by the LTFRB for failing to meet the local ownership requirement. DiDi is one of the world’s largest mobile transport platforms. It offers a host of services from on-demand cars to e-bike sharing and food deliveries to more than 550 million users across Asia, Latin America and Australia, its website showed. “We think this will help Filipinos,” said Singson, a former governor and now mayor of Narvacan. He also chairs LCS Holdings and owns a range of businesses such as bus operator Partas, car dealerships and more recently, the construction of cell towers. Singson said the ride-sharing opportunity was significant and that Filipinos would warm up to a new player amid complaints that fares have shot up in the wake of Grab’s March 2018 acquisition of the Southeast Asian operations of United States-based Uber.  More than a year since the transaction, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said the industry remained uncompetitive while Grab countered that price spikes were a sign of strong demand. There are at least eight other TNCs apart from Grab Philippines and U-Hop but none came close to Grab’s estimated 90-percent market share in the country. The PCC, which once called Grab Philippines a virtual monopoly, had fined Grab and Uber millions of pesos for violating conditions set by the antitrust body. Similar to Grab, DiDi also reached its current scale by acquiring Uber in China. DiDi is also an investor in Grab as it joined Japan’s Softbank in a $2-billion investment round in 2017. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, owns stakes in Uber, Grab, DiDi and Ola, a ride-sharing service in India."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/920199/what-is-ride-sharing-congress-help-sought-to-settle-issues-vs-grab-uber","title":"What is ‘ride-sharing’?

The call was made in a Senate hearing on Thursday by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), which noted that the two transport network companies (TNCs) had many partners operating fleets of vehicles like taxi operators.  “Ride-sharing should mean that if you own the vehicle, you are its driver. You have a day job … so you (spend only a certain number of) hours or probably your dayoff if you want to drive (a Grab or Uber car),” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada told reporters after the four-hour hearing. It was revealed during the hearing that one TNC partner, for example, operated 40 to 60 cars, Lizada said.  “That’s why we at the LTFRB raised this in the Senate and (House of Representatives). Can you please define ride-sharing when you craft your legislation. Because to us, ride-sharing means you own the car you are driving,” she said. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate transport committee which called for the hearing, said the definition of ride-sharing would be tackled by a technical working group created to address issues involving TNCs, whose services have rapidly gained wide acceptance since their entry into the country about two years ago.  In Poe’s view, a TNC partner should have a franchise for only two to three vehicles. “We should not agree to a ride-sharing that has a large fleet because it defeats the purpose of ride-sharing. Grab and Uber have agreed (to set a clear definition) and that they are doing this because we don’t have a regulation. And that is why taxi operators are angry,” Poe said. Poe also called on Uber and Grab to stop accepting new applicants—or comply with a July 26 LTFRB order—as she noted that the board was still swamped with over 15,000 pending applications for transport network vehicle service (TNVS). The senator said the two companies should not give new applicants “false hope.” “I told LTFRB to resolve this because there are people who have invested there, there are drivers expecting,” she said.  Also in the hearing, Grab and Uber officials disputed criticism that their business had aggravated traffic congestion in Metro Manila. Grab Philippines country head Brian Yu said there were about 5,000 to 8,000 TNVS on the road on an hourly basis but that 60 percent of their drivers are just part-timers who “go online during critical hours” in the morning and afternoon. Uber head of policy Yves Gonzalez, meanwhile, noted that 40 percent of Uber riders use the Uber Pool option, which means “there is only one car on the road instead of three.”"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/69017/less-cars-metro-manila-roads-people-use-ridesharing-app-study-uber-ride-sharing-app-commuting","title":"Fewer cars on Metro Manila roads if people use ridesharing app—study","date":"03:58 PM November 09, 2017","snippet":"Metro Manila would have a million less cars on the road during peak hours if a significant number of consumers use the ridesharing applications instead of taking individual cars, according to a survey commissioned by Uber.","body":"Metro Manila would have a million less cars on the road during peak hours if a significant number of consumers use the ridesharing applications instead of taking individual cars, according to a survey commissioned by Uber.

One of the findings of the report pointed to a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road during peak hours. Peak hours were pegged at 7 to 9 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.  To come up with an estimate, BCG said it quantified the number of vehicles that could be taken off the road in a scenario where the most widely privately owned vehicles were substituted by ridesharing. “In cities where private cars make up the majority of private transport, between 40 percent to 60 percent can be removed,” the report said, noting that this would be the case if ridesharing became the third, if not the second, most popular mode of transportation.  The BCG survey took place from September to October this year, covering approximately 300 commuters per city. This was around the same time Uber Philippines went back online after a spat with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board (LTFRB), which sanctioned the transport network company for accepting new driver applications in spite of a government directive urging against it. The study covered ridesharing in general, which includes pooling and non-pooling. Among other benefits, the study said ridesharing could also convince a good number of people not to own cars anymore. According to Uber Philippines General Manager Laurence Cua, the company’s Uber Pool option — wherein rides are shared among people with common routes or destinations — accounts for 40 percent of their trips on average. He did not clarify, however, whether or not this is on a daily or monthly basis. Since being introduced over a year ago, the demand for Uber Pool has been growing, he said, without giving more specific figures. “The demand is continuous there. We were surprised with the adoption (of Uber Pool) that a lot of people were actually willing to share (a car) with other riders,” he said.  Uber is present in Metro Manila and Cebu, he said. He said Uber is also exploring other options, such as penetrating the market in Pampanga. /jpv RELATED STORY Uber says growth strong as it gives a peek at earnings"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1418943/woman-raises-125000-for-safer-ride-sharing-service-amid-spike-of-anti-asian-american-attacks-in-us","title":"Woman raises $125,000 for safer ride-sharing service amid spike in anti-Asian American attacks in US","date":"04:36 PM April 14, 2021","snippet":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States.","body":"One woman in New York took it upon herself to help fellow Asian Americans feel safer when traveling by providing free ride-sharing services amid the recent rise in hate crimes in the United States. On how she came up with the idea, Maddy Park admitted that it was out of fear for her safety whenever she commutes via trains in New York, as per WABC on April 6.  “Last week I took the train. It was a 30-minute commute and I realized every minute of that commute I was terrified,” she was quoted as saying. “I was scared that any moment in time someone might say a racial slur or attack me. Worst of all I thought that if something were to happen to me, nobody would stand up,” Park added.  Park, who admitted that while she could afford to take the taxi, many other Asian Americans cannot. So, she donated $2,000 of her own money to set up Cafe Maddy Cab on Instagram with her friends. Through the said initiative, Park and many other donors help out Asian American women, elderly persons, members of the LGBTQ+ community and low-income essential workers hail a cab for free.  To her surprise, her initiative inspired many others across the US to help the Asian American community during these dire times. “People who are donating are people from all across the nation, across all races, ethnicities and they just sent me messages saying, listen, we really want you guys to be safe too and we’re donating so that more people can take rides in the city,” Park was quoted as saying. “It really opened my eyes to how many people are actually supporting the Asian community in New York City,” Park added.   Park has raised $125,000 as of yesterday, April 13, nine days after she launched Cafe Maddy Cab. A total of 1,122 have so far been paid for by Cafe Maddy Cab.

The latest cash injection, expected to close in the third quarter this year, came amid fevered anticipation of Uber’s public share offering which is expected to be the largest in the tech sector for years.   Toyota has already invested $500 million in Uber as the firm races Google-owned Waymo and a host of other companies, including major automakers, to develop self-driving vehicles.  The latest investment, which also involves Japanese parts maker DENSO, will go to Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group in a bid to “accelerate the development and commercialization of automated ridesharing,” the firms said in a statement. Toyota and DENSO are stumping up $667 million and SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment arm of Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, will pour $333 million into the venture. It is already the top shareholder in Uber, holding 16 percent.   The Japanese car firm said it would also contribute “an additional $300 million over the next three years to help cover the costs related to these activities.” Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said driverless cars would “transform transportation as we know it, making our streets safer and our cities more liveable.” His firm is aiming to go beyond car rides to becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share, instead of own, vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike, share a ride or take an e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey — all using an Uber app on a smartphone. Uber is also seeing growing success with an “Eats” service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. ‘Sharing economy’ Last week, Uber filed official documents for its much-anticipated public share offering. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said it operates on six continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totalled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a “placeholder” amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. The Wall Street Journal said earlier this month that Uber was seeking to raise $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Media reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. Uber is the largest of the “unicorns” or venture-backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the “sharing economy” based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Its revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. And some analysts have voiced caution over the forthcoming IPO given a relative lacklustre debut for Lyft, the main US rival. Khosrowshahi has promised greater transparency as he seeks to restore confidence in the global ridesharing leader hit by a wave of misconduct scandals. In October, Toyota and SoftBank announced the creation of a joint venture to create “new mobility service” including driverless vehicles for services such as meal deliveries. The new company — called “Monet”, short for “mobility network” — is majority owned by SoftBank. SoftBank started as a software firm but has increasingly been pushing into investments under tycoon Son, one of Japan’s richest men."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/270155/rideshare-firms-have-snarled-up-san-francisco-study","title":"Rideshare firms have snarled up San Francisco–study","date":"04:13 PM May 09, 2019","snippet":"WASHINGTON — The ride-hailing era ushered in by Uber and Lyft once promised to complement public transit, reduce car ownership and alleviate congestion.","body":"WASHINGTON — The ride-hailing era ushered in by Uber and Lyft once promised to complement public transit, reduce car ownership and alleviate congestion. But a new study on San Francisco has found the opposite may in fact be true: far from reducing traffic, the companies increased delays by 40 percent as commuters ditched buses or walking for mobile-app summoned rides.  Published Wednesday in Science Advances, the study went back to 2010, before the advent of so-called transportation network companies (TNCs), and compared journey times and road conditions with 2016, by which time they had become a common sighting.   San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are headquartered, grew from 805,000 inhabitants to 876,000 during that period, as 150,000 jobs were added and the road network updated. The authors, from the University of Kentucky and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA), accounted for these changes via a computer model that asked: what would things look like if ride-hailing companies had not come on the scene?  Greg Erhardt, an assistant professor of engineering at the university, told AFP his team had found “some substitution” from private cars to TNCs as well as a slight increase in carpooling. “But the net effect is that two-thirds of TNCs are new cars added to the roadway, that would otherwise not be present,” he said. They also found that weekday vehicle hours of delay — defined as the difference in travel time in congested versus free-flow conditions –- increased by 62 percent between 2010 and 2016. By contrast, in the simulated model without ride-hailing companies, delays went up by only 22 percent — meaning that the TNCs were responsible for 40 percent of the increase. Deadheading and disruption  The findings were challenged by Lyft, which said the study had failed to account for increased freight and commercial deliveries — an area in which Amazon and others have aggressively expanded in recent years, as well as tourism growth. “Lyft is actively working with cities on solutions backed by years of economic and engineering research, such as comprehensive congestion pricing and proven infrastructure investment,” the company said in a statement noting its investments in shared rides and bikes. Uber called for more widespread congestion charging, arguing that “while studies disagree on causes for congestion, almost everyone agrees on the solution.” The study came as thousands of rideshare drivers in major US cities staged a series strikes against pay and working conditions. It also came ahead of Uber’s keenly anticipated Wall Street debut. Lyft went public in March. Proponents of ridesharing often use the argument that the majority of journeys take place at non-peak times, such as when people have gone for a night out and are returning home from bars. But the study found peaks occurring at 7.00 am and 8.00 am and then again around 5.00 pm and 6.00 pm. Among the cars’ most disruptive activities on traffic flow were curbside pickups and drop-offs, especially on major arterial roads, it found. Another notable effect was so-called “deadheading,” which Erhardt explained as driving around in search of the next customer. “It doesn’t serve a purpose in terms of transporting a person. So that’s purely an addition to traffic.” Data scraping The study relied on background traffic speed from GPS data obtained from a commercial vendor, but when the researchers approached the companies to share their own trip data, they were denied access.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); They were forced then to rely on a method of data scraping developed by Northeastern University that uses the companies’ public apps to learn about vehicle movements. Elliot Martin, a research engineer at the University of California Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, who was not connected to the study, said its methodology was rigorous. “I think that they did a good job of trying to draw comparisons, to look at what would have happened in a world where TNCs didn’t exist versus where they did exist,” he said, adding the methodology was the “best available” given the amount of information. Despite the findings, ride-hailing isn’t all bad, said co-author Joe Castiglione of the SFCTA. “They are providing services like helping people move around in the evening when transit isn’t great, or assisting the visually impaired,” he told AFP. The trick, he said, was to determine “how (to) manage the positive benefits without the negative externalities” through new policies like congestion pricing or curbside regulation. Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart city solutions at Harvard, and the former mayor of Indianapolis, agreed. “There’s no love lost today between most cities and Uber, but there’s a lot of customer loyalty, which makes it difficult for cities to cut back too much.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/714914/uber-lauds-ltfrb-for-approving-accreditation-in-2-days","title":"Uber lauds LTFRB for approving accreditation in 2 days","date":"06:53 PM August 20, 2015","snippet":"Uber Philippines lauded the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for the quick approval of its accreditation under a regulatory framework that makes the country the first in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services.","body":"Uber Philippines lauded the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for the quick approval of its accreditation under a regulatory framework that makes the country the first in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services. “We are extremely proud of the result of our work with the government to lay the groundwork to pass regulations for app-based ridesharing services,” Laurence Cua, Uber Philippines general manager, said in a statement.  “We will continue to pave the way in the Philippines with new technology that will help commuting in Metro Manila safe and convenient for the community,” Cua said. He added that Uber, together with the local government, would help reduce traffic congestion.  The LTFRB held a sting operation against an Uber driver in October 2014, after receiving complaints from taxi operators regarding the lack of franchise of the private vehicles. Following consultations to modernize the regulation on public utility vehicles, the Department of Transportation and Communications created the new app-based transport category with the LTFRB issuing the memorandum circulars in May.  The LTFRB said it would start a crackdown on “colorum” vehicles on Friday (Aug. 21). Uber’s application for accreditation as a transportation network company was approved within 48 hours of submission, Cua noted. Uber submitted the required documents on Monday afternoon and was approved Wednesday morning. “We are proud to have worked closely with the LTFRB and the DOTC to make Philippines the first country in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services,” Uber said in a statement. “The accreditation will enable Uber to expand and bring safe, reliable and convenient rides to more cities in the Philippines,” it said.  “TNVS (transportation network vehicle service) applications are now being submitted on a daily basis to LTFRB,” Karun Arya, Uber communication lead for South Asia and India, said through email. “Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners’ TNVS application submissions,” Arya said on Thursday. He said Uber has been working with their partner-drivers to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB.

The government’s review of policies for the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which covered this sector, was due to the “sheer volume of applicants” and ridesharing fare-setting schemes that remained unregulated, DOTr spokesperson Cherie Mercado said.  Both US-based Uber, which has a wide global footprint, and Malaysia’s Grab, the biggest ridesharing company in the region, insisted that they provided a crucial service and that      their presence did not worsen Metro Manila’s traffic-strangled roads. “TNVs do not add to the congestion on the roads in Manila. In fact, we offer the solution by providing vehicles the technology that utilize GPS data to work around traffic and road hazards,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a statement.  “At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,” Cu added. Uber Philippines issued a similar statement, citing its carpool service to lessen vehicles on the road.  “This decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars. Fewer drivers on Uber leads to lower reliability of service for riders in Metro Manila, who have come to rely on Uber as a viable alternative to buying and driving their own private vehicles,” Uber said. According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15 this year. Of these, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review was formalized via a memorandum from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) dated July 21, 2016. In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/234273/economists-oppose-caps-ride-sharing-permits","title":"Economists oppose caps on ride-sharing permits","date":"02:29 PM August 02, 2017","snippet":"","body":" A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.  FEF – an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms – said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) were doing the riding public a beneficial service that the regular public utility vehicles have been unable to provide. The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings as well as safety and peace of mind due to the thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and to the feedback and reviews of the riding public, FEF said in a press statement on Wednesday.  Thus, FEF said it’s “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services. “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anti-competitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis,” FEF said.  The group said these ride-sharing services had shown the way on how public transportation should be managed: through the use of technology and the market. “The market gives the riding public the power of choice. Technology gives the riding public information and matches demand,” FEF said. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. The group pointed out that surge prices during peak hours encourage drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. In the case of consumers, such surge in pricing are seen to encourage riders to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods.  “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels. In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel, and oversupply,” FEF said. The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” FEF chaired is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo. Its vice chair is Romy Bernardo while the president is Calixto Chikiamco. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister/Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.

It was the second day of an “onboarding” session for Uber drivers in Manila after Singapore-based ridesharing giant Grab acquired the Southeast Asian operations of its main rival.  Should Grab Philippines succeed in luring all of Uber’s drivers, it would corner about 90 percent of Metro Manila’s ridesharing sector, capped at 65,000 units by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). That prospect has consumers worrying about higher costs and poorer services, following the notion that fewer competitors provide fewer incentives for private enterprises to do better.  Standing beside a row of Japanese compact sedans and AUVs, ridesharing’s most popular car models here, Uber driver Patricia was indifferent to a business deal that had only served to disrupt her main source of income. “I have no choice but to move. I borrowed money to buy my car and I need to pay it off,” she told the Inquirer.  In ridesharing, Patricia found a way to make money on her own terms by transporting passengers using Uber’s technology platform whenever she had the free time. In exchange, Uber takes a 25 percent cut. Patricia was among dozens of drivers, some with their young children in tow, gathered outside the Megatent on Wednesday. Near the entrance, a Grab staffer was reading out names from a so-called master list provided by the LTFRB. Only those people in the list would be allowed to move to Grab. Uber will cease to operate in Southeast Asia by April 8 this year. But Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu told reporters they would continue to process and accept Uber drivers even after that date.  “We will continue this until all Uber drivers on the master list of the LTFRB are activated on our platform,” Cu said. The mood was lighter inside the air-conditioned Megatent, which could accommodate at least 1,000 people. Migrating Uber drivers, welcomed inside as “Uberkads,” were seated while waiting to be called again to submit their requirements. It was noontime and pastries from a local bakeshop chain were being distributed to the waiting drivers. In another part of the hall, Grab staffers were holding mini orientation sessions for their former rivals. Inside, the Uberkads mused about the driver-friendly features of Grab, such as the ability to see a passenger’s destination before accepting a trip. This is not allowed by Uber. Grab also offers better incentives, they said. They noted that one drawback with Grab was that drivers would need to keep a minimum amount of money in its system to continue booking passengers. It is from this fund that Grab takes it commission. According to Cu, services are also expected to improve. He noted that when there were two big operators, drivers simply switched networks when penalized for bad behavior, such as frequently canceling rides. “Now, there is a bit more weight to following the rules,” Cu said. He added that the enlarged network of Grab would help control prices, given the supply-demand algorithms utilized by the ridesharing sector, and improved waiting times.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said in a press conference Wednesday that fare hikes would also be strictly regulated. Moreover, new competition is on the way with local companies Lag Go, Owto and Hype each seeking to operate as a transport network company, the formal category for businesses like Uber and Grab. “So if you say there is no competition, soon there will be,” Lizada said. Later addressing the drivers on queue, Lizada urged them to follow regulations, ridesharing being a public service. “Let us start on the proper footing,” she said. Getting started is the most important issue for Rex Restauro, who has been an Uber driver for eight months. Restauro, who owns a computer shop, uses ridesharing to make extra income in the evening. He said he has no qualms about switching to Grab. “I’m in this industry anyway so it’s a waste to stop it now.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/915519/2-solons-file-bill-that-hopes-to-end-row-between-ltfrb-ride-sharing-firms","title":"2 solons seek to end row between LTFRB, ride-sharing firms","date":"01:54 PM July 20, 2017","snippet":"Amid a conflict between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)  and the app-based transport services Grab and Uber, two congressmen have initiated moves to end the disorder affecting countless of commuters or riders.","body":"Amid a conflict between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)  and the app-based transport services Grab and Uber, two congressmen have initiated moves to end the disorder affecting countless of commuters or riders. Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles and his brother Pwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) Rep. Jericho Nograles have filed House Bill 6009  to end the disagreement between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and the LTFRB.  The dispute has led to a crackdown on Uber and Grab vehicles that do not have franchises to operate. READ: LTFRB to impound Uber, Grab cars lacking franchise  The House Bill 6009, or the Transport Network Service Act, seeks to institutionalize TNC as an alternative mode of public transport, and to regulate the operations of these services “to ensure that the paramount interest of the public is protected and conserved, while encouraging free enterprise and economic development.” According to House Bill 6009, the TNCs would only be allowed to operate if they are able to comply with all the requirements and secure a permit from the LTFRB.  The bill defines these companies and their drivers as “common carriers” for purposes of determining the liability and degree of diligence so that the presumption of negligence in case of breach of contract of carriage may apply to both. READ: Uber, Grab failed to inform drivers of LTFRB requirements The bill would require these ride-sharing and -hailing companies to secure a permit from the LTFRB and to oblige the TNCs to ensure that their drivers would comply with all the requirements and obligations set by law. The bill would require an Uber and Grab operator the following: The TNCs are also expected to strictly adopt a zero tolerance policy for drug or alcohol use among its drivers, and must ensure that the vehicles are safe and comfortable.  READ: LTFRB: Uber, Grab to blame for ‘mess’ TNC vehicles are also prohibited from exceeding the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity in its ride-sharing activities, the bill said. The Uber and Grab vehicles should also be not more than 10 years old, and must be road-worthy and compliant with vehicle emission standards, the bill added. In a statement, Davao City Rep. Nograles said the tiff between the TNCs and LTFRB is a “classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal,” especially because Uber and Grab remained a favored convenient form of public transportation. “Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” Nograles said. READ: ‘We are operating at a loss,’ Grab tells LTFRB PBA Rep. Nograles in the same statement said there is still a need to regulate Uber and Grab because these are relatively new modes of public transportation. He lamented that the operation of Grab and Uber would not have been an issue if the country had an efficient mass transport system in the Metro Rail and Light Rail Transits System. “The concept of Uber and Grab is new to us so therefore new regulations must be set to ensure that they are properly managed. Unfortunately, we don’t even need to go through this kind of trouble if only we have an efficient public transport system and an MRT that doesn’t break down too often,” he said The PBA Partylist earlier challenged LTFRB to first tackle “colorum” public vehicles instead of cracking down on ride-hailing companies like Grab and Uber.

Germany’s Rocket Internet launched its carpooling platform in the Philippines called Tripda amid current regulatory issues hounding the ridesharing service Uber.  Rocket Internet, which is partly owned by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., said in a statement that Tripda links up drivers who have empty car seats with commuters taking a similar route. The company said this would benefit both parties since they would split the fuel tab and bring down the transportation cost. The app only allows passengers to pay the drivers in cash.  Within five months, Tripda has successfully established itself in 12 countries around the globe including Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the US, Rocket Internet said. The platform will initially focus on trips within Metro Manila and expand to other regions later on. In other jurisdictions, the app can be used for longer-range travel, making it a viable alternative to buses, trains and short flights.  In terms of security, the platform verifies drivers and passengers in multiple ways. “The Philippines has thus far proved itself to be very open to what we are offering. Our growing community in the Philippines is giving us supportive and positive feedback, and we can really see Tripda taking off here,” said Pedro Meduna, Tripda co-founder and CEO for emerging markets. The Brazilian-born startup already has tens of thousands of registered users and has facilitated rides for thousands of passengers, the statement said. Philippine regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is in the process of revising its rules to accommodate technology-based transportation applications like Uber, which has met resistance from taxicab operators. Last month, the arrest of an Uber driver for operating without the necessary franchise drew flak from netizens, prompting the Department of Transportation and Communications to consider a more accommodating approach.  LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez could not be immediately reached for comment on Tripda Thursday.

The development comes as the Philippines’ Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board begins regulating ride-sharing apps and as competition with one of its biggest rivals, Uber, heats up.  In a statement, GrabTaxi said on Thursday that the money was raised from global investors such as US-based Coatue Management, L.L.C., China’s sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp. and Didi Kuaidi, “apart from support from existing shareholders.” This brings GrabTaxi’s total funding to about $700 million, making it one of the best funded startups in Southeast Asia.  GrabTaxi launched in Manila in July 2013 and later expanded into Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod and Baguio. It is also present in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. GrabTaxi said the money would be used to further develop its technology offering as it continues to invest in expanding its engineering offices.  GrabTaxi also plans to expand its private hire vehicle booking service, GrabCar, to as many as two more major cities in the Philippines this year, Natasha Bautista, head of Grabcar in the Philippines, said in a previous interview. Figures provided by the company showed that GrabTaxi operates across six countries, with 101,000 registered drivers serving about 10 booking per second in Southeast Asia. “We exist to solve the region’s transportation challenges. Diversifying into private cars and motorbikes has allowed us to touch people of varying income levels and commuting needs. We are the only app in the region that has such an extensive network and range of transportation choices,” Tan said in the statement. GrabTaxi has diversified its offerings beyond taxis to include private cars and motorbikes. GrabCar is a private hire vehicle service available in all countries where GrabTaxi is available. GrabExpress is an on-demand, same-day delivery service that is currently available in Manila. Both GrabCar and GrabExpress are available through the same GrabTaxi mobile app."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248826/grab-uber-deal-ltfrb-pcc-aileen-lizada","title":"LTFRB worried about continued operation of Uber despite deal with Grab","date":"07:13 PM April 07, 2018","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is concerned that the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order to Grab and Uber to continue to operate independently in the country, even if the latter has already shuttered its Southeast Asian operations, may adversely affect the riding public.","body":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is concerned that the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) order to Grab and Uber to continue to operate independently in the country, even if the latter has already shuttered its Southeast Asian operations, may adversely affect the riding public. “PCC is focusing on the competition aspect,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Saturday. “Our concern is how will the complaints, road crashes, if any, will be handled by Uber if they no longer have employees? Who will pay for the cost to operate?  In an order released on Saturday, the PCC said the two transportation network companies (TNCs) should “maintain the independence of their business operations” for the “entire duration” of the commission’s motu propio review on the deal. The PCC, however, did not state when it intends to conclude its review. The PCC order came a day before the Uber app is scheduled to go offline, which is on Sunday, April 8.  Early this week, PCC and LTFRB officials met to discuss what would become of the ride-sharing industry with Uber’s exit from the Southeast Asian region. Lizada said that they stressed in that meeting that safety measures have been put in place by the board “to prevent any monopoly by any TNC,” which the PCC fears would happen.  For one, she noted, there are currently four new TNCs that have sought accreditation from the LTFRB. Once these TNCs – Lag Go, Hype, Owto and Pira – satisfy the LTFRB’s requirements, they will take the place of Uber, affording the riding public more transport options. Also, she said that TNCs could not increase their fares on their own as they are required to follow the fare structure approved by the LTFRB. As for the app-based drivers, the franchises that are given to them by the LTFRB are not exclusive to any TNC, which means that they get to decide on who they want to drive for. Rather than unbundle the deal entered by the two TNCs, Lizada said that LTFRB should instead be “called [out] to fast-track the processing of the new players.” It remains unclear how the PCC intends to enforce its order on Uber, especially that its employees are already on a four-month garden leave. The Inquirer also learned that Uber has only around 10 employees left in the country who are part of the transition team.  The Inquirer sought both Uber and Grab officials for comment on the PCC’s order but has yet to receive a reply as of writing. On Friday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu assured the National Privacy Commission that there would be no migration to their platform of the personal data of the 1.2 million Uber users, which may include credit card details. He noted that the data which would be transferred to them are only those of the drivers, who would have to give their consent to Grab. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/297177/rocky-road-ahead-for-sharing-economy-platforms-amid-pandemic","title":"Rocky road ahead for ‘sharing economy’ platforms amid pandemic","date":"11:50 AM May 13, 2020","snippet":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit.","body":"WASHINGTON — “Sharing economy” firms like Uber and Airbnb were seeing surging growth and predictions they would reshape several economic sectors. Then the pandemic hit. These companies are now bleeding more cash than ever, shedding workers and scaling back expectations for profitability amid heightened uncertainty about consumer trends and the economic outlook.  The sharing platforms had “tremendous momentum” in industries like transport and tourism and even apparel-sharing prior to the pandemic, said consumer markets analyst Steve Barr of PwC, which had previously predicted the sharing economy to generate $335 billion in revenue by 2025. “I think there’s going to be a very significant shift in consumer behavior,” Barr said.  One factor could be a move away from urbanization in dense cities — a major force driving the sharing economy. That could dampen the sharing economy “lifestyle” that had been building for people who opted to shun ownership, Barr noted.  Uber said in its quarterly update that it lost nearly $3 billion and its rides business was down some 80 percent in April, prompting cuts to 14 percent of staff. The rideshare giant said it has seen some “green shoots” in the recent weeks and is seeing strong revenue growth for its food delivery operation UberEats. However, an IBM survey released this month found more than half of those who used ridesharing apps planned to reduce or stop using these services completely. “Riders are to continue to have a strong aversion to getting in a vehicle with a stranger for fear of infection which will not be allayed until there is a vaccine,” said analyst Richard Windsor on his Radio Free Mobile blog. Arun Sundararajan, a New York University professor who researches the sharing economy, said he nonetheless sees some room for optimism for ride-hailing firms.  “I think we’ll see a shift to greater personal space control,” Sundararajan said. “A lot of people will move away from mass transit in densely populated areas.” This could bring more business to ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber or to “micromobility” platforms for bicycles and scooters, which the two companies also offer. The researcher said, however, that it may take more time to see a rebound for “pool” rides with multiple passengers, and that the health crisis might slow the trend in which people give up their personal vehicles for shared rides. Leading home-sharing platform Airbnb has cut 25 percent of its staff with the travel industry crushed, with some estimates of bookings down 50 percent from earlier this year. Sundararajan says things may not be so bleak for Airbnb, which has over the years learned to build consumer trust and allow people to host or stay with strangers. The startup has already unveiled a new sanitary protocol and guidelines on leaving spaces vacant between bookings. “As people start to travel again, they will be oriented toward spaces where they feel they have control,” he said. “They may not want to pass through crowded hotel lobbies or stay in places where they don’t know who was there before.” He said Airbnb might be better positioned than some hotel operators “because it doesn’t rely on an extremely high rate of occupancy to make its business model work.” As in other sectors, the sharing economy firms will need to rebuild consumer trust to get consumers back. Sundararajan said these firms have an advantage because they have been working for years on helping change consumer habits.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The platforms are better-situated to deal with this uncertainty and rebuilding trust because that’s what they’ve been doing for a decade,” he said. But behavioral economist Lucas Coffman of Boston College said trust can be difficult, pointing to the “reputational” system of rating developed by online platforms. “You also need to trust everyone who rode in your seat before you,” Coffman said. Some segments of the sharing economy may emerge stronger, PwC’s Barr says, such as corporate jets or high-end black car rides. “Safety is going to be the new experience,” he said. Saif Benjaafar, director of the University of Minnesota’s Initiative on the Sharing Economy, said the platforms have been part of a lifestyle trend to on-demand, collaborative services that are extending to new areas such as medicine and education. “There has been a shift in the traditional way of delivering products and services, and I think that will continue,” Benjaafar said. “I think people are getting used to the idea of going to an app and getting things whenever they need it.” For more news about the novel coronavirus click here.What you need to know about Coronavirus.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.

But with regard to the accreditation of individual Uber partner vehicles, the company said this was still being done in batches. The LTFRB earlier said it would start apprehending unaccredited vehicles starting today.  “(The partners’) applications are being submitted on a daily basis to the LTFRB,” Karun Arya, Uber communication lead for South Asia and India, said through e-mail. “Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners’ TNVS application submissions.” TNVS stands for transport network vehicle services, the name given to partner vehicles of app-based TNCs or transportation network companies.  Uber is working with their partner-drivers to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB, Arya said. The LTFRB held a sting operation against an Uber partner driver in October last year after receiving complaints from taxi operators who, like their counterparts in several countries, cited unfair competition since Uber vehicles lacked a franchise yet were being allowed to operate like cabs. Despite protests and following consultations and public hearings, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) created a new transport category—the TNC and TNVS—for app-based services like Uber. The LTFRB later issued memorandum circulars on their regulation. Uber’s application for accreditation as a TNC was approved Wednesday within 48 hours of submission, Cua noted. “We are proud to have worked closely with the LTFRB and the DOTC to make the Philippines the first country in Asia to legalize app-based ridesharing services.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/767839/ltfrb-junks-all-cases-vs-uber-grab-transport-apps","title":"LTFRB junks all cases vs Uber, Grab transport apps","date":"09:17 PM February 23, 2016","snippet":"MANILA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has dismissed all motions filed by a transport group against the operations of vehicles under the ridesharing apps Uber and Grab.","body":"MANILA — The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has dismissed all motions filed by a transport group against the operations of vehicles under the ridesharing apps Uber and Grab.

It added that TNCs could practice surge pricing while PUVs have to seek LTFRB approval for any fare adjustment.  Uber said the DO should be  presumed valid until nullified by higher courts and the LTFRB had no jurisdiction to determine constitutionality. Uber and Grab also said 1-Utak had no legal standing to oppose the TNC’s application and accreditation. Ginez said, “PUV operators and transport groups should welcome the challenge and competition for better public transport service, which would serve the best interest of the public safety and convenience.”  Another transport group, Stop and Go, has a pending petition in the Quezon City Regional Trial Court against the DO for TNCs and TNVS.  SFM"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248487/pcc-says-grab-uber-deal-will-create-virtual-monopoly","title":"PCC says Grab-Uber deal will create a ‘virtual monopoly’","date":"05:55 PM April 02, 2018","snippet":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market.","body":"With Uber expected to fold under its rival ride-hailing firm next week, the antitrust body urged both companies to wait for a review before completing the deal that would give Grab a “virtual monopoly” in the market. In a statement, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering a review of the deal regardless if the transaction falls under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. The Uber app, which has provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, will no longer be functional starting on April 9.  “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anti-competitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives on Monday. It was not clear if the statement preceded or followed their meeting.  The acquisition would likely have a “far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it is looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.” During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-sharing services, and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways – through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met – one of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable.  As of press time, PCC said that it does not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/723465/legal-questions-aint-over-for-uber","title":"Legal questions ain’t over for Uber","date":"03:05 AM September 19, 2015","snippet":"THE POPULAR app-enabled ridesharing service Uber remains the target of legal scrutiny despite securing government accreditation last month.","body":"THE POPULAR app-enabled ridesharing service Uber remains the target of legal scrutiny despite securing government accreditation last month. This time, its pricing system came under fire from the party-list group 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-Utak), which called on a regulatory agency to take back Uber’s accreditation and deny the franchise applications of its partner vehicles.  In a petition filed early this week in the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), 1-Utak said the May 2015 department order that created the transportation network company (TNCs) as a new category of transport service was illegal for it granted such companies the power to set their own fares. The group cited what happened on the night of Sept. 8, when rates charged by Uber vehicles “dramatically increased” as heavy rains and flash floods paralyzed traffic and public transportation went scarce in many parts of Metro Manila.  “While other public utility services have to get LTFRB approval for any adjustment of fares or additional charges, TNCs and TNVS (transportation network vehicle service) can dictate and adjust their fares without any limitation,” said the petition signed by 1-Utak president Melencio Vargas and acting secretary general Joseph Florizel Cruz. The petition also argued that TNC member vehicles are not among those exempted from an “existing moratorium” on the issuance of certificates of public convenience for certain types of vehicles.  LTFRB chair Winston Ginez, who called for a meeting with Uber and GrabTaxi representatives regarding complaints on their pricing, “choosy” drivers, and other matters on Friday, noted that Uber’s fare indeed surged “about five times the usual rate” on Sept. 8. The board asked the two companies to submit their position papers “on when and how can LTFRB exercise its oversight function.” “We want to give them the opportunity to be heard. (The regulation) is important because we don’t want predatory pricing,” Ginez said. Under the May 2015 order of the Department of Transportation and Communications, which is cited by the 1-Utak petition, fares set by TNCs would be “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions of the market.” The LTFRB will hear the group’s petition on Sept. 23.  Donemark Calimon, the Uber representative in Friday’s meeting, said the surge in prices was “algorithmically dictated by the system based on demand.” He stressed that passengers are informed about it before they confirm the booking. Natasha Bautista of GrabCar, meanwhile, said the company would submit its position paper but she explained that surge pricing is not practiced under its current system. Cars or vans booked through TNC apps are called TNVS. According to board member Ariel Inton, the LTFRB has not yet issued a single TNVS franchise since the approved applications have only been given provisional authority."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1071617/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-in-ride-sharing-protest-suicide","title":"Second South Korea taxi driver in ride-sharing protest suicide","date":"04:13 PM January 10, 2019","snippet":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.","body":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.

Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102598/experiencing-traffic-book-a-ride-sharing-flight-to-your-destination","title":"Experiencing traffic?

The Singapore-based helicopter ride-sharing startup Ascent launched on Wednesday its helicopter services in Metro Manila. Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinal-Sinelnikoff said that this new mode of transport service aims to address the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region,” Sinai-Sinelnikoff said during the press launch held in Pasay City. “With the launch of Ascent in the Philippines, we hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant in the current times’ economic and productivity pitfalls caused by congested roads,” he noted.  According to the company’s executive, the country has lost P3.5 billion due to traffic congestion. He also said that central business districts (CBDs) in Metro Manila such as Makati and Taguig have an untapped transportation opportunity given its low utilization of available helipads. One of the helicopters to be used for the transport service is the BELL 429 that could carry up to seven commuters. The other helicopter is the Airbus H125. The second one is smaller compared to the first, and could only carry up to five commuters. “Through the Ascent platform, we aim to connect CBDs more easily and promote the country as an ideal destination to conduct business helped by urban air mobility,” he said.  The helicopter services of Ascent Flights will be operated by local air operator INAEC Aviation Corp. “Our expertise in ensuring safe and reliable air operations, combined with Ascent’s innovative technology offers perfect solution for the time-sensitive members of business community and individuals,” INAEC General Manager Aldi Dexter Ampong said.

FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many.

Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David said in an e-mail to reporters that the launch would go as planned in spite of a cease and desist order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  LTFRB told Arcade City on April 12 to stop from “operating as another form of transportation network company (TNC).” However, David, who is a former Uber driver himself, said Arcade City does not consider itself a TNC. “That’s because we are a platform to support local networks forming their own TNC/TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and all using one platform,” he said.  Available across the country This is not the first time that the LTFRB tried to block Arcade City’s entry into the country. In August last year, the agency issued the same order against the startup which was around the time the LTRFB temporarily suspended Uber operations.  David said the app would be available across the country, not just in Metro Manila. However, the availability of the service would be “dependent largely on how many drivers sign up where.” This is because the app prides itself on not having a corporate middleman which could pull out when profits start plunging, according to an explanatory video on its website. Instead, it would let the drivers in a local area run the app, including its rates, on their own terms. He said more than 20,000 drivers and riders have signed up in the country last year through an early version of the mobile app. Arcade City had pulled down that version but they would be e-mailing them again when the app goes live on Monday, he said. Incentive system Arcade City would incentivize the growth of its driver and rider network through a blockchain-based cryptocurrency called “arcade tokens,” according to its official website.  Riders and drivers could earn tokens through any action that gives “measurable value to the Arcade City network.” These actions could be providing a well-reviewed service, as well as recruiting more drivers and riders. The tokens, then, could either be sold for cash or used within the Arcade ecosystem for services and bonus features. This incentive system, David said, “will take another month or so to fully roll out.” The app was first launched in 2016 in Austin, Texas, where it had tens of thousands of members, according to media reports. It was considered the world’s first self-governing ride-sharing network. Uber’s exit, Arcade’s entry This developed days after the LTFRB gave Uber until April 15 to operate in the Philippines. Uber was scheduled to end its services on April 8, after the company’s Southeast Asia operations were acquired by Grab. The weight of this LTFRB order against Uber, however, remained unclear, given that it runs against an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Under PCC’s order, Uber is obliged to continue operations until the competition watchdog finishes its review of the Grab-Uber deal. The extension did not have a deadline. In either case, consumers would find themselves having less choices for convenient transportation — an opportunity which Arcade City wants to take advantage of. “Yes, we will continue launching the app as planned on April 16th. Hopefully the LTFRB spends more time processing applications of TNVS and drivers, less time on making threats to companies trying to help,” David said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/724660/transpo-group-claims-uber-grabcar-worsen-traffic-in-metro","title":"Transpo group claims Uber, GrabCar worsen traffic in Metro","date":"03:59 PM September 23, 2015","snippet":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila.","body":"A transport group composed of jeepney, taxi, and UV Express drivers is pushing for the suspension of the accreditation of mobile application-based ridesharing services Uber and GrabCar, as they claim these companies are contributing to the worsening traffic situation in Metro Manila. Staging a rally outside the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) main office in Quezon City on Wednesday, members of Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) said that thousands of GrabCar and Uber are on the road due to the relatively easy procedures for their accreditation.  ACTO President Efren De Luna said that the relative ease of the accreditation process of said transportation network companies (TNCs) violates their rights as “legitimate” owners and operators of public utility vehicles who have franchises. “[Uber and GrabCar] contribute to worsening traffic and minimize our profit. Their accreditation is a violation of out rights as legitimate public utility vehicle owners and operators who hold franchise and are following the prescribed procedures. However, our rights have been disregarded by the LTFRB,” De Luna said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.  “Our problem is that there are too many cars on the road. But why is the LTFRB still accepting the application of thousands of GrabCar and Uber drivers?” he added. Meanwhile, De Luna claimed that the accreditation of the TNCs has sparked a more aggressive stance of the regulatory agency regarding the “phase-out” of PUVs.  He said that while drivers of PUVs are willing to “modernize” so that their service will be at par with the ones being provided by Uber and GrabCar drivers,  the “phase-out” of cars which are 10 years-old or older will pose as a threat to their livelihood. Citing data collated as of Sept. 23, the LTFRB said that it has received 3,903 units from TNCs and has received applications from 2,982 drivers for accreditation. There were more drivers wanting to be accredited under Uber than GrabCar: with 1,808 applications for Uber compared to 1,174 for GrabCar. JE"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/844265/nebraska-senator-moonlights-as-driver-for-ride-sharing-uber","title":"Nebraska senator moonlights as driver for ride-sharing Uber","date":"11:40 PM November 14, 2016","snippet":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber.","body":"WASHINGTON — A Republican senator helped his constituents get around this weekend by moonlighting as a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248318/grab-buys-uber-pcc-sets-review","title":"Grab buys Uber; PCC sets review","date":"05:08 AM March 27, 2018","snippet":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network.","body":"Singapore-based Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-sharing company, snapped up main rival Uber’s business in the region, promising better services through its enlarged network. Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, said in a statement on Monday."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716594/colorum-taxi-under-ride-sharing-app-tripid-fined-p200k-impounded-for-3-months","title":"‘Colorum’ taxi under ride-sharing app Tripid fined P200K, impounded for 3 months","date":"08:57 PM August 26, 2015","snippet":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.","body":"A vehicle providing service through the ride-sharing app Tripid was apprehended on Tuesday for operating without a franchise, an official of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said.

The Japanese auto giant’s president Akio Toyoda unveiled the new initiative at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, seeking to get ahead of rivals offering single-use autonomous transporters. The “e-Palette” vehicle platform features a boxy electric-powered minibus designed to handle deliveries or even bring retail services to consumers, but can also be used for ridesharing and other purposes.  “It is a flexible platform that can be adapted to a range of services,” Toyoda said, including ridesharing, retail, medical services or entertainment.  The media demonstration showed how the vehicle could deliver packages or even enable consumers to try on shoes or apparel. The new initiative is part of an effort to transform Toyota from an automaker to a multifaceted “mobility” company, Toyoda said. Partners in the project, which is set to be deployed “in the early 2020s,” include Amazon, Uber, Pizza Hut and China-based Didi. Rival Japanese automaker Mazda will also participate in development. The company said it hopes to showcase the technology at the 2020 Olympics in Japan.

Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said.

Raymund Liboro, head of the National Privacy Commission (NPC), said only the users’ registered name, e-mail address, and phone number were compromised. In a statement, Liboro said Uber Philippines, the local arm of the ridesharing company, had confirmed on Thursday that the extent of the impact was limited to these bits of information.  However, the NPC chief also noted receiving a report of “irregular processing” that suggests other data may have also been compromised, an allegation that the commission would still have to confirm in order to establish its link to the 2016 data breach incident. “We were informed that around 171,000 Filipino citizens consisting of drivers and passengers were affected by the breach. We understand this to be based on the mobile phone numbers included in the registry,” he said. “We were also informed that the exposure of the affected data subjects was limited to their registered name, e-mail address and phone number.”  It remains unclear if specific Uber users would be informed that they were hacked. The company’s US office last month made an admission of the breach, noting that the personal information of tens of millions of users worldwide had been compromised by a hack that Uber kept secret for more than a year. Prior to Thursday’s disclosure, Uber Philippines could only confirm that Filipino users were also affected by the hack, without giving exact numbers. 1.3M active riders According to Liboro, Uber Philippines reported having 1.3 million active riders in the country. The number of Uber drivers, meanwhile, is still up for validation but Liboro gave an estimate of below 100,000.  Uber’s explanation of the hack could be read on its official website. There is also an option for users to alert Uber if they think they’ve been hacked. Reached for comment on Friday, Uber Philippines neither confirmed nor denied if the company would actively inform users if they were among 171,000 Filipinos whose personal information had been compromised. Instead, Catherine Avelino, head of communications of Uber Philippines, referred the Inquirer to Uber’s blog post about the hack, stressing it has “everything we’re doing and have done.” Liboro said the NPC is now looking into the processes and procedures that Uber said it had taken “to ensure that this matter never happens again.” “We are paying particular attention to the steps taken to ensure that in the future, data breaches of this magnitude will not be concealed from regulators and from affected data subjects,” he said, noting that concealment of data breaches is a criminal offense. Liboro also said further assistance to affected users could be included in NPC’s compliance order for Uber. Uber Philippines previously claimed having no knowledge of the incident prior to the recent public admission made by its US office. Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012, concealing security breaches that involve sensitive personal information faces a penalty that could reach up to five years of imprisonment and a fine of less than P500,000. The necessary penalties, according to the law, would be imposed on people who, after learning about the breach, decided to conceal the fact, regardless of whether it was done intentionally or by omission."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/911887/ride-sharing-drivers-appeal-to-ltfrb-to-lift-ban-on-new-application","title":"Ride-sharing drivers appeal to LTFRB to lift ban on new application","date":"06:41 PM July 07, 2017","snippet":"Transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) leaders on Friday appealed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to lift their ban on new driver applications.","body":"Transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) leaders on Friday appealed to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTRB) to lift their ban on new driver applications. Members of TopSpeed and Busypaps, two organizations comprising at least 250 Grab and Uber drivers, made the appeal as the LTFRB’s suspension order to temporarily stop receiving new TNVS applications was about to reach one year on July 21.  The new drivers who were prohibited to ply Metro Manila because of absence of a provisional authority (PA) from the LTFRB asked the regulatory body to lift the suspension order for them to be given permit and start earn a living. This development came after the LTFRB issued an order on July 21, 2016, suspending the acceptance of new applications for PA thus, prohibiting a number of drivers not to go out and pick up passengers for about a year now.  “Kami po ay umaapela sa mabuting puso ng ating mga opisyal sa LTFRB, sana po ay pakinggan nyo ang aming hiling na bigyang amnestiya ang aming mga kasamahan na wala pa pong provisional authority (We are appealing to the good hearts of our LTFRB officials to heed our request to grant amnesty to our colleagues without provisional authority),” Bobby Coronel, founder of TopSpeed, said. According to Coronel, TNVS drivers have always wanted to fully comply with regulations but their applications were either not processed judiciously by the previous admin or did not make it to the cut off as a result of the suspension. Moreover, they cannot simply give up their livelihood, and LTFRB must understand their situation.  “Marami po sa amin, may binabayaran pa po na monthly amortization ng mga sasakyan (Many of us are still paying for the monthly amortization of cars),” TopSpeed lady driver Deseree Garcia said, while asking LTFRB to understand their situation. Meanwhile, other TNVS leaders also appealed to the LTFRB to act on the recently expired accreditation of transport network company, Grab. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3. In his Facebook post Monday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said it’s “business as usual” for the company and its partners. Cu added, they have submitted the requirements for the renewal of accreditation on time. But TNVS drivers said, they are still concerned with the current status of non-renewal of accreditation.

READ: Legal questions ain’t over for Uber  According to the head of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the agency will allow premium taxis—a newly created category of vehicles for hire—to increase their fare during rush hour under a scheme similar to one used in Singapore. “We will implement that first on premium taxis. Let us see what the market reaction will be,” LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez told reporters on Friday.  Premium taxis are a new, high-end class of transport service created by the Department of Transportation and Communications. It was one of the four new categories listed under DOTC Order 2015-011 that was issued in May, along with transportation network companies or TNCs (like Uber, GrabCar), bus rapid transit and airport buses. Unlike regular taxis, premium taxis must have a 2000cc engine displacement or its electrical or hybrid equivalent, a global positioning system, an online or app-based booking facility, and an onboard electronic payment device for credit or debit cards, among other requirements.  Premium taxi operators must have a minimum of 25 vehicles per fleet, all of which must be brand new at the time of the franchise application. To date, however, the LTFRB has yet to issue guidelines for applicants.

The LTFRB chair himself noted that Uber fares went up five times the usual rate that night. He made mention of premium taxis when asked by reporters about the possibility that regular taxis would demand that they, too, be allowed to engage in surge pricing. “In Singapore, there’s an automatic 25-percent surcharge on the taxi meter during rush hour. We will include that in the memorandum circular that we will issue on premium taxis,” Ginez said.  Ginez disclosed the plan even after the LTFRB received a petition from the party-list group 1-Utak questioning Uber’s price surges. The petition asked why TNCs were given the authority to set its own fares whereas other public utility vehicles can’t just do that without government approval. An Uber representative at Friday’s meeting explained that the fares charged by its partner vehicles are “algorithmically dictated by the system based on demand.’’"},{"url":"https://usa.inquirer.net/59526/california-appeals-court-rules-uber-lyft-must-reclassify-drivers-as-employees","title":"California appeals court rules Uber, Lyft must reclassify drivers as employees","date":"INQUIRER.net U.S. Bureau","snippet":"A California appeals court on Thursday unanimously ruled against ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc, saying they must reclassify their drivers in the state as employees.","body":"A California appeals court on Thursday unanimously ruled against ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc, saying they must reclassify their drivers in the state as employees. While the ruling does not take effect before a Nov. 3 company-sponsored ballot measure that will give voters the chance to decide over the future status of gig workers, it narrows the companies’ options should their ballot fail.  The case emerged after California implemented a law, known as AB5, aimed at reclassifying ride-hail, food delivery and other app-based workers as employees entitled to benefits such as unemployment insurance and minimum wage. California in May sued Uber and Lyft for not complying with AB5. A California judge in August ordered the companies to reclassify their drivers as employees, a ruling the companies appealed under the threat of leaving the state altogether.  The appeals court on Thursday upheld the ruling. The judges said in a 74-page ruling that Uber’s and Lyft’s misclassification caused irreparable harm to drivers who as independent contractors miss out on employee benefits. Remedying those harms more strongly served the public interest than “protecting Uber, Lyft, their shareholders, and all of those who have come to rely on the advantages of online ride-sharing,” the ruling said. Lyft and Uber in a statement said they were considering all legal options, including an appeal. “This ruling makes it more urgent than ever for voters to stand with drivers and vote yes on Prop. 22,” Lyft said, referring to the Nov. 3 ballot measure, which would repeal AB5 and provide drivers with more limited benefits. “Today’s ruling means that if the voters don’t say Yes on Proposition 22, rideshare drivers will be prevented from continuing to work as independent contractors, putting hundreds of thousands of Californians out of work and likely shutting down ridesharing throughout much of the state,” Uber said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1056789/list-grab-ph-controversies-and-issues","title":"LIST: Grab PH controversies and issues","date":"04:56 PM November 24, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.","body":"Grab Philippines found itself embroiled in many controversies this year, ranging from legal issues to technical glitches.

De Guzman is in critical condition after an accident in a Grab ride, causing him to sustain “severe traumatic brain injury.” A viral Facebook post from Marko’s cousin, Steffi de Guzman, said Marko and his friend, Alia booked a Grab car last Oct. 26 along Taft Avenue, Manila. She said the Grab ride was allegedly running too fast and was driven by a sleepy Grab driver.  She then said the Grab car collided into another car before crashing into a Light Rail Transit (LRT) post. Marko, then sustained a fractured skull after the incident. With the incident, Grab said they are constantly communicating and offering financial assistance to Marko’s family. An investigation was also launched as both drivers affected were facing “court arraignment.” READ: Grab says it is ‘continuously reaching out’ to support critically hurt rider ‘System downtime’ The ride-hailing company also faced technical issues such as the recent glitch on its computation of fares.  Last Oct. 25, its application experienced a glitch, making the fares decrease to a minimum on all services regardless of the overall distance of the trip. GrabCar and GrabShare fares were at P80 pesos while its six-seater services were at P120. READ: Grab PH experiencing ‘system downtime,’ fare computation affected Grab’s system has resumed its normal operations but the company said it will continue to investigate on the cause of the glitch. READ: Grab PH probes cause of ‘system downtime’ glitch LTFRB penalty This year, the company also received a P10-million penalty as imposed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for overcharging its customers. The LTFRB revealed in a document that Grab must reimburse its passengers for the P2-per-minute travel charge through rebates. READ: LTFRB orders Grab to pay P10M for overcharging customers Grab then, filed a motion for reconsideration to reverse the LTFRB decision, claiming the decision was “contrary to law” as Grab followed the Department of Transportation Order (DO) 2015, which allows ride-hailing firms to set their own fares.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, after Grab changed their fare structure, a DO was released, DO 17, which states that transport network companies should have “pre-arranged fare as per the LTFRB.” Grab explained that the LTFRB failed to establish that DO 2015 “has been impliedly repealed by any subsequent issuances of DOTr.” READ: Grab appeals P10-M fine for overcharging customers P12-million fine vs Grab merger violations Aside from the LTFRB, the country’s anti-trust body, Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), also fined Grab in its merger with Uber for causing “undue difficulties” that prejudiced the review process of their controversial takeover deal. Last October, PCC imposed a P12-million fine against Grab after violating pre-merger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber was also fined P4 million for the same set of violations.

Grab denied the allegation, saying the message was not endorsed by its company. Grab Country Head Brian Cu said: “No that’s false. The message is not endorsed by Grab, it was probably crafted by a partner driver and shared among other drivers.” READ: Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila ‘Unjustified booking cancellations’ Last April, Grab Philippines punished nearly 500 drivers after an internal investigation on complaints that drivers inexcusably cancel passengers’ ride bookings.

During the hearing of its petition calling for the suspension of Uber’s accreditation over its pricing system, 1-United Transport Koalisyon (1-UTAK) party-list group alleged that it is “unfair” for other public utility vehicles to wait for LTFRB approval to adjust its fares while Uber and other  transportation network companies (TNCs) can set and adjust their fares.  1-UTAK Chair Vigor Mendoza is assailing the legality of the department order issued last May which created TNCs as a new transport service category, saying that it granted such companies the power to set their fares. Mendoza said that their petition before the regulatory agency boils down to a single demand: to have an equal playing field for TNCs like Uber and public utility vehicles in terms of pricing.  He also cited the need of having “reasonable and affordable” pricing for TNCs, citing what happened on Sept. 8 when heavy rains pushed for the five-fold increase of the usual rate of Uber vehicles. “What drivers are seeking is equal treatment. If the law states that fare adjustments should undergo public hearing, it should be abided. You cannot provide a service which is unreasonably priced, even if it is efficient. What our law states is that fares should be reasonable and affordable,”  Mendoza said.  On their part, Atty. Grace Ann Lazaro, counsel for Uber, claimed that they are allowed to set their rates in accordance to the the department order which provided their accreditation as a TNC. “When Uber applied for accreditation, we believe that the overall board has examined the fare structure we submitted,” Lazaro said. However, LTFRB Chairman Atty. Winston Ginez said that the regulatory agency has oversight functions to peg the rates set by Uber and other TNCs. “We have the power to adjust the fare to what we think will serve the interest of the public,” Ginez said. The LTFRB is yet to decide on the petition as it gave 10 days for each party to send their respective position papers."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1071617/second-south-korea-taxi-driver-in-ride-sharing-protest-suicide#!","title":"Second South Korea taxi driver in ride-sharing protest suicide","date":"04:13 PM January 10, 2019","snippet":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month.","body":"SEOUL – A South Korean taxi driver burned himself to death in protest against a ride-sharing service being introduced by the country’s largest mobile chat app, the second to do so in a month. The 64-year-old, surnamed Im, parked near the US embassy in central Seoul moments before his vehicle was engulfed in flames.  The driver remained conscious after he got out of the burning vehicle on Wednesday evening, witnesses said, and was taken to a nearby hospital but died hours later, according to police, who found melted fuel bottles in the car. Im left a suicide note, Yonhap news agency reported, calling for a ban on what he called “illegal car-pooling”.  He is the second cab driver in a month to have burned himself to death in protest at a ride-sharing service created by chat app Kakao. Ride-sharing firms have cut transport costs and increased services for passengers around the world, but are conspicuous by their absence in South Korea, where US giant Uber has only a minimal presence.  Uber closed its main ride-sharing service in 2015 amid an extensive backlash from cab drivers and now only offers taxi- and licensed-hire vehicle hailing. An opinion poll in November found 58.2 of South Koreans wanted to see ride-sharing introduced, with only 12.5 percent against. The Kakao Mobility scheme, which is currently operating on a trial basis, would allow drivers to provide only two rides a day. But taxi drivers have protested angrily, saying it would threaten their jobs and livelihoods. After the first driver suicide last month, Kakao delayed the formal launch of the service, initially scheduled for December 17, citing a need for social consensus on the issue. /kga If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727); (02) 7-989-USAP; or 1553 (landline to landline, toll-free)."},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/43050/grabcar-becomes-philippines-first-authorized-ride-sharing-app","title":"GrabCar becomes Philippines’ first authorized ride-sharing app","date":"07:18 PM July 09, 2015","snippet":"Philippine transport authorities authorized GrabCar as the first company to operate under new rules governing ride-sharing apps, state and company officials said Wednesday.","body":"Philippine transport authorities authorized GrabCar as the first company to operate under new rules governing ride-sharing apps, state and company officials said Wednesday. Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the  Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Ride-sharing services — typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis — are gaining popularity in Metro Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps — arguing they represent unfair competition.  But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse.  GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise license from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said.  “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCarPhilippines  said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the  Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar  Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorization. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The  Philippines  is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies. Previously, only local and city governments had regulated the services."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/714285/ltfrb-approves-uber-accreditation","title":"LTFRB approves Uber accreditation","date":"11:08 AM August 19, 2015","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transport Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has approved on Wednesday the application of online-based transportation service provider Uber as an accredited Transport Network Company (TNC).

Shares in Uber tumbled 10.75 percent to close at $37.10 on the second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  Valued at some $82 billion in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector, Uber’s debut Friday was a major disappointment, losing 7.6 percent. The two-day meltdown left the Silicon Valley star with a cumulative loss of more 17.5 percent while ride-hailing rival Lyft has plunged 33 percent since its March debut.  Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor of finance specializing in IPOs, said it was highly unusual for a high-profile company like Uber to fall so quickly.   “But it’s a very difficult company to value, and I expect that there will be big upswings and downswings in the future,” Ritter said. Still, Ritter said the rocky opening is not necessarily an indication of the long-term value of Uber. “If a year from now its value goes up to $100 billion people will be no longer talking about the first two days of trading,” he said. ‘Remember Facebook’ Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi urged employees to look past the rough patch on Wall Street and stay focused on better days ahead, according to an internal email obtained by AFP.  “Remember that the Facebook and Amazon post-IPO trading was incredibly difficult for those companies,” Khosrowshahi said in the message. “And look at how they have delivered since. Our road will be the same.” He noted that Monday was a tough day for the stock market overall, not just for the San Francisco-based ride-share company with visions of becoming the “Amazon of transportation.” Khosrowshahi acknowledged that there were versions of Uber’s future in which the company does not prosper as hoped, but warned against being distracted by pessimistic voices in the market. “Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months,” he said in the email. “We will be judged long-term on our performance, and I welcome that.” Troubled road ahead Richard Windsor, an analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog on technology, said Uber and Lyft have been pressured by their high valuations and intense competition. Uber and Lyft “are currently engaged in a life or death struggle to become the dominant ridesharing platform in the USA,” Windsor said. “Until this fight is settled, there is very little reason to invest in either company as while they slug it out rock bottom prices and incentives for drivers will continue to plague profitability.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Lyft shares Monday fell nearly six percent to $48.15, extending the steady decline for Uber’s smaller US rival. Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said he expected the “valuation digestion process” to take some time and that he remained upbeat on Uber despite competition with Lyft and the long path to profitability. “We believe there is a large enough ocean for two boats as the ridesharing market domestically in the US is roughly $1.2 trillion and $5.7 trillion globally,” Ives said. “We expect ridership, drivers, and the monetization opportunities for Uber to increase markedly over the coming years. A core tenet of our bull thesis on Uber is around the company’s ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine.” Uber and Lyft face additional troubles, highlighted by last week’s protests from some drivers in the US, and regulatory roadblocks in many parts of the world. Thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike last week over revenue-sharing formulas and working conditions. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/242468/uber-offers-traffic-tech-apps-govt","title":"Uber offers traffic tech apps to gov’t","date":"05:14 AM December 14, 2017","snippet":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline.","body":"Ridesharing giant Uber is opening up one of its technology solutions to the government to help in determining the traffic impact and benefits of the massive land infrastructure projects in the pipeline. Uber said it had made available data from its platform dubbed Movement to the Department of Public Works and Highways. Among its earliest recommendations was to support the proposed extension of San Miguel Corp.’s Naia Expressway (NAIAx) project to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.  “Movement uses the power of big data to help government officials and planners understand the impact to travel times of the infrastructure projects and programs they roll out,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a statement. The solution uses data from thousands of trips both months before and after NAIAx was opened in June last year. Uber said the expressway shortened average travel times in and around the areas it serves.  Based on Uber’s estimates, Cua said the NAIAx extension would cut travel time between BGC and NAIAx in Entertainment City or the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) complex to about 20 minutes from 40 minutes. Cu said the Movement platform could also help government planners determine improvements in travel times once the BGC-Ortigas Center link, the proposed bridge between Binondo and Intramuros and the Skyway Stage 3 were completed.  SMC, a food and drinks giant that has diversified into infrastructure, earlier revealed that complete detailed engineering plans for the extension of the 7.7-kilometer NAIAx project going to BGC have been submitted to the government. SMC said the project would decongest Magallanes and the Edsa-Pasay area. The NAIAx extension also aims to cut travel time between Coastal Road and SM Mall of Asia areas and BGC to just 10 minutes. The NAIAx, a private-public partnership project that SMC opened last year, is a key part of Metro Manila’s tollroad network. Serving some 80,000 vehicles per day, it provides access to all terminals of Naia from Skyway, Cavite Exprsessway and other major roads with its 14 on and off ramps.—MIGUEL R.CAMUS"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/221846/biz-buzz-2gos-woes","title":"Biz buzz: 2GO’s woes","date":"01:06 AM December 23, 2016","snippet":"The ongoing boardroom battle between the chief of logistics firm 2GO, Sulficio Tagud, and up and coming petroleum and shipping tycoon Dennis Uy seems to be headed toward more interesting times as no solution can yet be found outside the legal arena.","body":"The ongoing boardroom battle between the chief of logistics firm 2GO, Sulficio Tagud, and up and coming petroleum and shipping tycoon Dennis Uy seems to be headed toward more interesting times as no solution can yet be found outside the legal arena.

Recall that Davao-based Uyñthe man behind Phoenix Petroleum Corp. ñacquired a significant minority in Tagud-run 2GO by buying the stake of the firm’s Kuwaiti stakeholder. But Tagud is trying to block Uy’s entry into the board, claiming he had the right of first refusal over the shares involved. “I was trying to mediate. I wanted to bring them together, but so far nothing yet,” said Chua, who said he was an independent company chair.  But there could be an unexpected complication to the dispute, thanks to a recent Supreme Court ruling which affirmed an earlier rule requiring firms to stick to a 60:40 ownership structure when foreign owners were involved (with foreigners strictly restricted to the 40 percent cap). The Supreme Court stressed that firms should maintain a 60:40 ownership mix for all classes of shares, whether voting common shares or non-voting preferred shares.  2GO has a substantial foreign shareholder base in the form of the Kuwaitis and the China Asean Fund and, depending on whether their ownership is reckoned in terms of common or preferred shares, may or may not put the firm beyond the legal threshold, we were told. Uy’s lawyers are confident their side of the dispute is the winning side. Whether it will play out as they believe remains to be seen. Abangan! —DAXIM L. LUCAS While others are scrambling to leave the mining business amid an “unfriendly” regulatory regime, nickel miner Marcventures Holdings Inc.—under former banker Isidro Alcantara—sees the challenging times as an opportunity to bulk up and become a key player in the future. With a recent deal to buy two mining firms, Marcventures will scale up its nickel mining operations by about 33 percent and it will become the only Philippine firm extracting bauxite, a highly valued commodity used for the production of aluminum, used in the aerospace, transportation and construction sectors. Marcventures will merge with Asia Pilot Mining Philippines, which owns two mineral production sharing agreements (MPSAs) covering a combined 12,129 hectares of bauxite-rich mining site in Samar. It will also merge with the holding company of Brightgreen Resources Corp., which owns an MPSA for 4,860 hectares of nickel mining site adjacent to its current site in Surigao del Sur.  We heard that a mineral resource report by SRK Consulting has estimated the bauxite resource in Samar at more than 110 million metric tons. The merger will give Marcventure access to more than 20 million additional metric tons of nickel resource. By expanding its nickel mining capability, Marcventures seeks to stabilize its supply of nickel because in the next two years, it plans to invest in nickel-processing plants. This is in anticipation of the possible ban in the exportation of ore.Sources said Marcventures would invest some $150 million in a processing facility using rotary kiln electric furnace technology that will produce nickel pig iron, the raw material for stainless steel. Another $100 million will be invested in a vat leaching facility that will produce nickel hydroxide (said to be a cheaper technology than the high pressure acid leach perfected by the Sumitomo group).Marcventures is in serious talks with a Chinese group—one of its major buyers—that could be its technical and strategic partner for the processing facilities. —DORIS DUMLAO-ABADILLA Despite having a bumpy ride with regulators in its early days, it looks like the government is finally starting to look kindly on—and more importantly, appreciate—the local operations of global ridesharing giant Uber. Or if not the entire government, at least one important part of it. We’re talking about the Senate whose committee on public services recently recognized the value of ridesharing firms like Uber (and rival, Grab) and what they can do to reduce vehicular traffic congestion for long-suffering motorists and commuters, in Metro Manila and other growing urban areas around the country. Of course, you wouldn’t completely sense Uber’s elation at the positive first step going by their formal statement in reaction to the Senate’s positive move. “With Senate Bill 1284, the Senate Committee has recognized the value and contribution of ridesharing and carpooling as a viable solution to traffic congestion,” the company said. Of course, that’s just a preliminary victory for Uber and the ridesharing industry. There’s still a long way to go before they can rest easy. If only other regulatory agencies in the executive branch would open their minds and think of the welfare of commuters, instead of the welfare of aggressively lobbying traditional transport groups, right? —DAXIM L.

In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States.  Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars. The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group.

The LTFRB ordered Uber to pay the huge fine instead after lifting its one-month suspension, imposed on Aug. 14, that sparked public outrage and forced 36,367 vehicles off the streets.  “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” said Cat Avelino, Uber’s head of communications, in a statement. On its Twitter account, Uber said it hoped to resume service  “this coming week.”  The transport agency said late on Friday that it would grant Uber’s petition to resume operations in exchange for the P190-million fine — much stiffer than Uber’s P10-million offer. It also required the company to pay about P20 million a day in financial assistance to its drivers for lost earnings.  Sen. Grace Poe welcomed the lifting of Uber’s suspension but nevertheless expressed disappointment at the timing of the decision. Poe, who chairs the Senate committee on public services, pointed out that Uber would be unable to comply with the LTFRB order at once because the banks are closed on weekends. The LTFRB handed down its ruling right before the start of a three-day weekend, thus depriving Uber the chance to immediately resume service. “I am quite disappointed that the LTFRB decision was issued late Friday afternoon, effectively taking out any opportunity for Uber to pay the penalties,” Poe said in a statement. “It is frustrating to think that we have a long weekend ahead of us and people will have to suffer the inconvenience of having limited transportation choices in going around Metro [Manila] with their families,” she added.  Because the country is commemorating National Heroes Day tomorrow, the earliest that Uber can only comply with the board’s order is on Tuesday. In its eight-page order, the LTFRB said that Uber’s fine was “commensurate to the penalty of suspension.” It added that based on the data submitted by Uber, the company earned between P7 million and P10 million daily from about 150,000 trips. “[The P190-million fine] is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the order read. Uber was suspended for defying an LTFRB moratorium on the acceptance of new drivers as the agency studied how to regulate the growing ride-sharing industry. Uber’s rival Grab followed the directive. After filing a motion for reconsideration on Aug. 15, Uber resumed operations, only to stop on the same day when the LTFRB board denied its petition. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance [to Uber drivers] remitted,” the board resolution said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that Uber should continue to provide assistance to its drivers until it had settled the fine. She added that for Uber to resume operations, it should provide proof of compliance from its bank, indicating that the drivers had indeed received the amount due them. The board explained that Uber’s P190-million fine is only about a third of what it would have spent if it fully served its suspension. Uber would have also shelled out about P597 million in financial aid to its drivers for a month. But Poe said the LTFRB could have offered relief to a lot more people had it given Uber the chance to comply with the ruling at once. “If the LTFRB had allowed Uber to operate right away, then this could have served as a great relief to our people, most of whom rely on TNVS (transport network vehicle service) due to the comfort, reliability and safety they provide,” she said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The P190-million penalty, she also said, “should be enough to make Uber rethink its actions and reevaluate its strategy in testing the extent of government regulations.” Commuters had voiced out their disappointment in the suspension of Uber, saying services like these offered a convenient alternative, especially with problems with irascible and choosy taxi drivers who overcharged fares. Uber said this month it was accepting new applications for vehicles but was not processing them pending its discussions with the LTFRB. It also urged the government to simplify the accreditation process, with a representative telling Poe’s committee: “We cannot impose 1900s regulations on today’s technological innovations.” —With a report from AFP"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/801152/grab-suspends-probes-allegedly-rude-driver-in-viral-post","title":"Grab suspends, probes allegedly rude driver in viral post","date":"02:47 PM July 30, 2016","snippet":"Transport network vehicle service Grab Philippines has suspended the driver tagged in a viral Facebook post who allegedly abused a passenger on Saturday amid an ongoing investigation.","body":"Transport network vehicle service Grab Philippines has suspended the driver tagged in a viral Facebook post who allegedly abused a passenger on Saturday amid an ongoing investigation. “We do not tolerate any behavior that threatens the safety and well-being of our passengers and drivers and this incident is not an exception,” Grab said in an advisory posted on its social media pages.  The ridesharing company was referring to the complaint of one Angel Ramos, who claimed that the driver of the GrabCar she hailed going to Makati was unreasonably irate and even threatened her that he was a police and he shoots people. This was after Ramos asked if she can go back to get her wallet, and if the driver had smaller bills to her P1,000-bill.  Ramos identified the driver as Regino Silagan Taacon Jr., with plate number YR 0797. She took to Facebook to share their exchange:  “Me: Kuya may barya po ba kayo sa 1,000? Driver: Titignan ko, ba’t ba kasi sumasakay kayo wala kayong barya Me: Eh kuya naiwan ko yung barya ko (which is ‘yun nga yung nakalimutan) Driver: Dapat kasi nagdadala kayo ng barya!

Afraid that the driver would pull out a gun, Ramos said she asked to be dropped off even though she has not yet reached her destination. “Grab, Sana mabigyan ng action ‘yung nangyari sakin kasi sana hindi na sya nag DRIVER kung ganyan ugali niya (Grab, please take action on what happened to me; he should not have been a driver if his attitude is like that),” she said.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said that it was considering to review the deal regardless if the transaction fell under the current notification rules for mergers and acquisitions (M&As).  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the biggest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company. Grab said the Uber app, which provided an alternative to many Filipinos suffering from worsening public transportation services, would no longer be functional from April 9 onward. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-hailing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said.  PCC, which reviews business deals and sees which ones are anticompetitive, said that its officials were scheduled to meet with Grab and Uber representatives yesterday. It was not clear if the PCC statement preceded or followed that meeting. The acquisition would likely have a “far-reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services,” according to PCC. In light of this, the competition watchdog said it was looking into the deal “with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns.”  During the review, PCC would evaluate how certain factors would play out after the acquisition. These factors include price increases, quality of ride-hailing services and the likelihood of having other transport network companies (TNCs) compete in the market. PCC said the review could happen in two ways: Through both parties submitting the deal for review if certain requirements are met, and through PCC opening a review on its own, even if the notification requirements for M&As were not met. Notifiable transactions are M&As that meet a certain threshold in terms of value and assets. A notification is required when both standards are met: One of the companies in the deal is worth more than P5 billion, and the aggregate value of the assets of the acquired company exceeds P2 billion. Both ride-hailing firms could not act on the deal without PCC approval, assuming that the transaction is notifiable. As of press time, PCC said that it did not know yet the terms and conditions of the deal. But even if it was not notifiable, “Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns,” PCC said. Nevertheless, PCC called the consultation with the TNC representatives as a “sign” of willingness to comply to the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/118030/filipinos-joining-applicants-for-calif-drivers-license-for-undocumented","title":"Filipinos joining applicants for Calif. driver’s license for undocumented","date":"07:52 AM January 27, 2015","snippet":"SAN MATEO, California — No more pedaling the bicycle or ridesharing with relatives and friends to work or to bring the children to school.

This month, the Department of Motor Vehicles started issuing special licenses to people who cannot prove their legal presence in the country. So-called irregular Filipino immigrants are among the people joining the long lines of applicants for a California driver’s license at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Roughly, one in four Filipinos are undocumented in the US, said Joanna Concepcion, of the Filipino Migrant Center, “and it’s important that Filipinos are well-informed about how this new law could benefit them. “ Since January 1, when AB60 — the Safe and Responsible Driver Act — became law, thousands of undocumented immigrants have applied for driver’s licenses. California joins nine other states to grant undocumented immigrants access to licenses but with applicable limitations.  Immigrant advocates say some applicants who previously held licenses under Social Security numbers that were not their own have been told they will need to meet with a DMV investigator. Undocumented immigrants who fraudulently obtained a California driver’s licenses before it was legal won’t be able to a new car until state authorities review their driving records.  The DMV expects to field 1.4 million applications in the fist three years of the program aimed at boosting road safety and making immigrants’ lives easier. According to Seth Ronquillo, of Asian American Advancing Justice, more than 400,00 Asian American undocumented could be eligible for the program. “You’re always afraid to be stopped by police, “ Ronquillo said, “they can take you car. “Some had to ride bikes to work or share a ride with someone,” he added. Application requirements According to the DMV, applicants must submit proof of identity and state residency and pass a written test to get a driving permit.  Those who don’t possess foreign government-issued identification on a list of approved documents can be interviewed by a DMV investigator to see if they qualify. Immigrants must come back at a later date and pass a road test to get a license, which will be marked with the words, “Federal Limits Apply.” Jessica Gonzalez, a DMV spokesman, was quoted as saying that, “those who have licenses from other states are not required to take a road test again. “ Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have said the program will improve road safety because more drivers will be tested and insured. A DMV study of 23 years of crash data found unlicensed drivers were more likely to cause a fatal collision. Undocumented Filipinos apply Protected by the TRUST Act that took effect on January 1, enabling the undocumented to cooperate with police without fear of deportation, some undocumented Filipino immigrants, are now coming out into the open to apply for driver’s licenses in various DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) offices. Danilo (not his real name), a professional in the Philippines working now as caregiver, and who has been in the Bay Area for more than seven years, told INQUIRER.NET he was eager to obtain a driver’s license because he needs it “for peace of mind.” “My work includes driving anywhere for my client — from doctors to hospitals, to stores and pharmacies and more importantly, to car shows not only in California but other states, “ Danilo said. When he and his paraplegic client (name withheld) goes out of state to do bids for a car show, Danilo said he fears that he might get pulled over by police who would impound his boss’ vehicle. Worse, he might go to jail for lack of a document.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “I was just lucky to have gone this far, but when we went to Arizona the other week for a huge national car show, I was worried that there would be check points along the way because we had to pass through Las Vegas and Los Angeles, for a total trip of 2,500 miles back and forth, “ he said. Danilo is one among thousands of undocumented immigrants who are hiding in the shadows but would like to become legitimate. “ I paid my taxes using my ITIN (Income Tax Identification Number), too, each year. “ He is ready. “I am going to the DMV and bring my proofs of identity and residence along with a friend who will accompany me because I also borrowed his vehicle that is covered with insurance.” Danilo will take his chances in obtaining the important document “so that I could drive safely without fear and also get a sense of legitimacy.” Similarly, Hermie, another undocumented Filipino construction worker, said that for the past two years he spent $7,000 to retrieve his impounded car. Under existing laws, vehicles are impounded by police if the driver cannot show proof of license and insurance coverage. Danilo and Hermie are among the few Filipinos who will fall in line at the DMV for a driver’s license. Other Filipinos are still hesitant. Supporters and opponents “It’s something that you’re lucky to have, something undocumented shouldn’t be allowed to have that privilege,” ABC News quoted one opponent of the program. “It’s not something that they should get (because) it legitimizes illegal immigration in a way they give a government document to somebody who’s not legally in the US.” However, supporters of the law contend it’s about “safety on the roads because folks have to take the tests.” Police are backing this law for road safety considerations; many hit and run cases involve unlicensed drivers fleeing the scene of an accident.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); However, the driver’s license being issued to qualified undocumented immigrants is not for federal use, neither could it be used to board airplanes or get employment.

LTFRB should have approved or rejected applications faster,” Ejercito said over Twitter.  “TNVS on the other hand shouldn’t have allowed units which have no papers at all into their system,” he said. Ejercito and Senator Grace Poe met with the LTFRB and transport network companies in a dialogue on Wednesday.  Poe and Ejercito are the chair and vice chair of the Senate committee on public services, respectively. In a closed-door meeting, the heads of the LTFRB, Grab and Uber agreed to a compromise: Uber and Grab drivers can operate while an appeal against a ban is being heard.  “We cannot fault LTFRB entirely. It is just doing its job as a regulatory body. Their concern on accountability of TNVS is legitimate,” Ejercito said. The senator earlier chided the LTFRB for cracking down on Grab and Uber, which he said “offer far better and more convenient services than regular taxis.” Instead of banning TNVS, Ejercito said the LTFRB should take action first on the complaints against the taxi drivers. “Kung ganito kayo kaingay at kadesididong patawan ng service ban ang Grab at Uber, dapat ganito rin ang aksyon ninyo sa mga reklamo sa regular taxis!” he said. But the senator later pointed out that Grab and Uber also need to address issues regarding its ride-hailing concept and dynamic pricing.  “Concept of Uber and Grab supposedly for private car owners to own a little on their free time through ride sharing. Supposed to be part time,” he said. Ejercito noted that some enterprising people have acquired fleets of cars being used as TNVS. “This is not the concept of Uber and Grab the way I understand it,” he said. He said having a fleet of cars functioning as TNVS is “unfair to the “legitimate” regular taxis who have franchise.” Nonetheless, Ejercito said “this Uber and Grab vs. LTFRB issue should serve as a wakeup call to regular taxi operators and drivers to improve their services.” The senator said he hoped to work out a compromise through legislation by regulating and defining the operations and functions of the TNVS. “Convenience of the riding public will be the prime consideration as government provides and improves services,” he said.

Poe, chairman of the Senate committee on public services, recently met with the heads of the LTFRB and Uber in a bid to iron out issues that had caused inconvenience to Uber drivers and the riding public.  After the meeting, Uber committed to pay “millions of pesos” worth of fine to the LTFRB so it would overturn its earlier decision to suspend the ride-sharing firm’s operations for a month. The LTFRB has yet to decide on Uber’s offer which will be heard in a board meeting on Wednesday next week. READ: Uber willing to pay hefty fine as ‘rectification’ for mess with LTFRB  But in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Friday, Poe said aside from the P10 million Uber offered to pay to the LTFRB for violating certain policies, Uber will also give monetary assistance to its around 66,000 drivers daily. READ: Uber offers to pay P10-M fine instead of serving suspension  “You try to multiple that. They (Uber) said they have about 66,000 drivers, then they will have to do the algorithm and formula for this based on how active you are. Something like P100 per day for lost wages but other drivers can receive as much as P1,200 a day depending on how active they are so that will equate, when we were computing how much they will actually write in the pleading, to more than a P100 million,” Poe said. The P10 million that will go the LTFRB will not go to the agency, but to the national treasury according to LTFRB chair Martin Delgra III, said Poe. “It’s P10 million being offered to the LTFRB for the damages for the violations, which will not really stay with the LTFRB, chairman Delgra clarified that will go the national treasury,” she said. But the remaining amount of over P100 million, Poe said, would only be 5 percent of what Uber is earning in a year. “Uber makes money of at least P5 million a day from their drivers; so how much is that, P5 million times 30 days, let’s say so that’s P150 million in a month, something like that,” Poe explained.  “That’s more than how many percent of what they’re earning in a year that’s about maybe 5 percent or more of what they earn in a year so it’s more than a slap on the wrist but since this is very new, it should also send a signal to others,” she said.

Lyft will have a valuation of at least $20 billion with the initial public offering (IPO), one of the first from a wave of venture backed “unicorns,” or startups worth more $1 billion or more.   Its entry to the public markets comes ahead of a hotly anticipated offering from larger rideshare rival Uber, which is valued at some $70 billion, and other tech startups including the business collaboration firm Slack and visual discovery engine Pinterest. Both Lyft and Uber are promoting their moves as lifestyle-changing, which could wean dependence on private cars and help reshape urban landscapes. “Ridesharing has transformed our lives, making it easier and cheaper to get where we need to go, and it’s pioneering an undeniable trend toward transportation as a service,” said a research note this week from Gene Munster and Will Thompson of the investment firm Loup Ventures. These firms, which are stepping up moves to autonomous rides, have been expanding aggressively — with Lyft gaining market share in the United States and Uber in dozens of international markets. They have also sought to become broader transportation platforms that connect consumers to e-scooters, electric bikes and local transit systems. Uber and Lyft are among the most prominent firms in the  sharing economy, which also includes home-sharing platform Airbnb and highlight a trend away from ownership to services. Lyft says it aims to play a growing role in the $1 trillion US transport sector. But analysts point out that competition is growing and that any investment may be risky. Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Analyst Richard Windsor, who writes the tech blog Radio Free Mobile, argues that Lyft may not be ready for the scrutiny it will face as a publicly traded firm.   “Lyft is shooting itself in the foot by going public, as I continue to think that the company is not ready for the harsh glare of the public market and it is giving away a big edge that it could have had over Uber,” Windsor writes. “A big hit the share price can cause a loss of confidence in the product triggering a vicious death spiral. This ties the hands of the management in terms of the actions it can take and will make it harder to be nimble, flexible and to compete against Uber.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Lyft may benefit from the missteps of Uber, but that it may face a rocky road with the emergence of Waymo, the former Google car unit which is launch its autonomous taxi service. “Lyft is an attractive name to own to play this transformative ridesharing market opportunity,” Ives said in a note to clients, while adding that “we find it hard to be bullish on the name given the risk/reward we see for shares.”"},{"url":"https://technology.inquirer.net/78757/chinas-didi-suspends-ride-sharing-service-murder","title":"China’s Didi suspends ride-sharing service after murder","date":"05:12 PM August 26, 2018","snippet":"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said Sunday it would suspend its ride-sharing Hitch service after the rape and murder of a passenger, the second such killing this year.","body":"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said Sunday it would suspend its ride-sharing Hitch service after the rape and murder of a passenger, the second such killing this year. Police have arrested a 27-year-old man who worked as a driver in the eastern city of Wenzhou on suspicion of raping and killing a female passenger who used the app to hail a ride.  The company said it would suspend Didi Hitch — a service which pairs up commuters traveling in the same direction— beginning midnight on Monday. The announcement came a day after the company admitted it bore “responsibility” for the crime, failing to act on a complaint about the same driver from another passenger, who claimed he drove her to an isolated area and followed her in his vehicle after she left the car.  “The incident shows the many deficiencies with our customer service processes, especially the failure to act swiftly on the previous passenger’s complaint and the cumbersome and rigid process of information sharing with the police,” Didi said in a statement on Sunday. “This is too high a cost to pay.”  Local police said the driver, identified by the surname Chung, picked up the 20-year-old victim around 1:00pm (0500 GMT) on Friday. But she went missing an hour later after sending a friend a text message asking for help, prompting a manhunt which saw the driver arrested in the early hours of Saturday, police said. The killing has sparked fresh criticism of Didi — which muscled Uber out of the market following a bruising battle — as angry users voiced concerns about the safety of the service. “Since the company can’t regulate itself, get out of the market,” wrote one user on the Twitter-like Weibo. In a scathing commentary, the official Xinhua news agency on Sunday pointed out that Didi has been slapped with over 1 million yuan ($148,000) in fines over the past 10 months in Wenzhou alone.  “Despite repeated punishment, there has been recalcitrant behaviour and no change, a reflection of the company’s indifference to safety and social responsibility,” the commentary said, calling on Didi to be punished if it fails to put customer safety first. Didi said Sunday that the head of Didi Hitch and the vice president of customer service have been “removed” from theirpositions. In May, a 21-year-old air stewardess using the same Hitch service was killed by a Didi Chuxing driver, prompting criticism of the company’s security measures and a tightening up of its rules of use. This included limiting Hitch drivers to only picking up members of the same sex late at night and early morning, and enabling passengers to share their route with an emergency contact. Didi Chuxing calls itself the world’s leading mobile transportation platform, saying in March that it had 21 million drivers and more than 450 million users across its various services. /ee"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/880232/uber-tightens-security-to-reduce-driver-fraud-improve-safety","title":"Uber tightens security to reduce driver fraud, improve safety","date":"03:51 PM March 13, 2017","snippet":"MANILA — Ride sharing service Uber launched on Monday a new security feature meant to reduce fraud, help drivers guard against “compromised accounts” as well as provide passengers with an additional measure of safety.","body":"MANILA — Ride sharing service Uber launched on Monday a new security feature meant to reduce fraud, help drivers guard against “compromised accounts” as well as provide passengers with an additional measure of safety. The improved security procedure involves requiring Uber drivers to periodically take profile pictures of themselves — or so-called “selfies” — to allow Uber to validate with its internal database whether the person driving the designated vehicle at any given time is the same one declared in the company’s records.  With the service called “Real-Time ID Check,” Uber said it would be able to reduce fraud, helping drivers protect their accounts from being compromised. This extra layer of protection can help ensure riders that the right person is behind the wheel. “We at Uber are constantly looking for ways to strengthen our technology-enabled security features,” Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said in a Taguig City on Monday. “We look into new solutions and test them to proactively use and maximize the capability of available technologies, and how these can be instrumental in our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and convenient rides.”  The new feature, which was launched initially in several countries where Uber operates, will require drivers to use a new feature on the company’s smartphone-based software that requires a selfie to be taken before they go online and accept rides. The photo taken by the driver is then compared to the one already on file with the account.  If the two photos don’t match, the account would be temporarily blocked while Uber representatives look into the situation, according to Cua. Following its initial release in the US last September 2016, Uber is rolling out the feature across 16 countries, namely South Africa, Egypt, Russia, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, India, Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Cua said the number of complaints in the Philippines regarding situations where the identity of the driver does not match declared identity has been “extremely small,” most of which have been caused by previous drivers failing to log out of their Uber accounts before turning over the vehicle to another driver. Cua explained that the security feature would improve the peace of mind of Uber riders knowing that the identities of their drivers have been carefully monitored by the company.  SFM/rga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/720869/brazil-taxi-drivers-protest-against-uber","title":"Brazil taxi drivers protest against Uber","date":"08:30 AM September 10, 2015","snippet":"SAO PAULO — The Sao Paulo city council voted 43-3 on Wednesday to prohibit the use of smartphone-based ride-sharing-applications like Uber in Brazil’s largest city.","body":"SAO PAULO — The Sao Paulo city council voted 43-3 on Wednesday to prohibit the use of smartphone-based ride-sharing-applications like Uber in Brazil’s largest city. During the entire day, thousands of taxi drivers blocked several of the city’s streets and avenues to protest against Uber and pressure councilmen to vote in favor of the law that bans the service in this city of 12 million.  The council has 10 days to send the approved law to City Hall. Mayor Fernando Haddad will then have two weeks to approve or veto the bill. In its first vote on June 30, the council voted 48-1 to prohibit the use of ride-sharing services such as Uber.  Rio de Janeiro’s city council has banned Uber, but Mayor Eduardo Paes must still ratify it. Uber has been banned in Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, the only other two cities where the service is present.  If the measure goes into effect, Sao Paulo Uber drivers who ignore the ban can be fined 1,700 reals ($447) and have their cars confiscated. The service has drawn increasing use since last year’s World Cup of soccer, with many of its cars cleaner and newer than those of regular cabs. Cab drivers complain Uber is unfair competition because its drivers don’t have to pay city fees or undergo official inspections. To prevent the expansion of Uber elsewhere in the country, city councils in at least another 13 state capitals have laws pending approval to ban the service. In Maceio, capital of the northeastern state of Alagoas, city councilman Galba Netto recently told reporters: “We are trying to prevent a future problem, because the arrival of Uber in our city would be a disaster.”  On its Facebook page, Uber said people “who cross the city every day have the right to choose how they will travel the streets of Sao Paulo.” RELATED STORY Brazil cabbies ambush Uber driver — report"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978164/news-grab-uber-ride-sharing-southeast-asia-anthony-tan-internet","title":"Grab confirms buying Uber businesses in Southeast Asia","date":"01:09 PM March 26, 2018","snippet":"","body":" Private ride-hailing service Grab on Monday confirmed that it has acquired Uber’s operation in Southeast Asia.  In a statement, Grab said the deal was the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian internet company,” which reflects the company’s leadership position in the region. “Grab is acquiring Uber’s rideshare and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia, and integrating them into Grab’s leading transportation and fintech platform,” the statement read.  Grab said Uber would take 27.5% stake in Grab, which it said was “reflective of the companies’ respective market shares.” “The acquisition accelerates Grab’s path to profitability in its core transport business, as it’s the most cost efficient Southeast Asian platform,” it said.  The acquisition, it said, “reflects Grab’s transport market leadership in Southeast Asia.” Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab said the acquisition of Uber “marks the beginning of a new era.” “We are humbled that a company born in SEA has built one of the largest platforms that millions of consumers use daily and provides income opportunities to over 5 million people. Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” Tan said. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region. Together with Uber, we are now in an even better position to fulfil our promise to serve our customers,” he added. Their trust in us as a transport brand allows us to look towards the next step as a company: improving people’s lives through food, payments and financial services.  Aside from Uber’s rideshare, Grab has also acquired Uber’s food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia. “Grab will also take over the Uber Eats operations to immediately become a major player in food delivery services,” it said. Grab said the GrabFood service would expand from two existing countries to all major Southeast Asian countries by next quarter. “This will be another great use case to drive continued adoption of the GrabPay mobile wallet and support Grab’s growing Financial Services platform,” it said. /cbb"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282065/dotr-taps-paymaya-for-cash-free-payments-for-puvs","title":"DOTr taps PayMaya for cash-free payments for PUVs","date":"05:02 AM May 28, 2020","snippet":"The Department of Transportation has tapped PayMaya to provide digital payments for taxi cabs and ridesharing vehicles, formally called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) in the country.","body":"The Department of Transportation has tapped PayMaya to provide digital payments for taxi cabs and ridesharing vehicles, formally called Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) in the country.

The world we live in now is more mobile than we imagined it from a decade ago.","body":"Food delivery systems based on apps have gained popularity recently, similar to ridesharing apps like Uber ride. The world we live in now is more mobile than we imagined it from a decade ago. Uber Eats App gained popularity due to its world-famous ridesharing service. Doordash vs Grubhub is also gaining momentum and recognition in the New York Times on route to becoming the best apps to deliver food.  When comparing Doordash vs Grubhub, you’ll see how the rising digital fast-food industry has presented us with many affordable and convenient choices. Yet, too many options tend to get overwhelming as all the food delivery apps pack different features, functions, deals, etc. Let’s breakdown both the apps in-depth to gain a better overall understanding of these apps.  Costs and fees are the significant downsides to using food delivery services like Grubhub and Doordash. The apps require you to pay a subscription fee, a delivery fee, and a tip. Doordash asks you to pay a fee for both their service and the restaurant you have ordered. On the other hand, Grubhub does not include restaurant delivery service fees. Still, often it sets a limit on the minimum order food amount. However, you can enter custom tip amounts if you choose to. Grubhub has more national partners than Doordash that enables them to offer more competitive pricing. Furthermore, Grubhub also provides a broader range of special promotions.  If you go to the “Perks” page in the app, you can find the offers for cashing off and free delivery. If you switch to the “Earn” from the “Redeem” tab, you can also get rewards by spending a certain percentage at specific restaurants. Doordash offers daily promotions for several of their featured restaurants that offer $0 delivery on the first order or any order above $10. However, in the long-run, Grubhub provides more savings. If you prefer using Doordash and want to save more, try and get a Cash App credit card. The app offers several boosts, including one that gives a flat 10% off on Doordash orders. These boosts will add up.  Ultimately, costs become a matter of which restaurants you prefer and how you choose to use each of these apps.  Both the apps, Doordash vs Grubhub, are available on Android and iOS, so there is no distinction there. Both are on even playing fields. But Doordash offers a more impressive and convenient UI/UX compared to Grubhub. Moreover, Doordash’s promotions and special food ordering offers are all organized at the top of the app’s home screen. Whenever you open the Doordash app, you will instantly gain access to your favorite restaurants, the app’s national partners, free delivery offers, and much more. On the other hand, the Grubhub app shows your favorite local restaurants, partners, and offers. They are a little less accessible when you open the app. It’s because you will be scrolling down through the entire restaurant list to see these in a more split manner. What’s more, Grubhub shows you a consolidated view of your saved restaurants, deals, and more. The problem here is that it’s too easy for the users to assume that the page is account information, so it goes overlooked. Doordash, on the contrary, is more superior in features. The group ordering option allows you to send links to your friends who have the app installed, making the order more participative. Both you and your friends can add your items and their items to the complete order separately. Doordash even offers coupons and promotions specifically for group orders. All the group members will see the delivery status and the map once the order is finally placed. Related Article: 2021 March Madness Predictions   There are no availability issues for most restaurants through the Doordash vs Grubhub apps for major cities in the United States. However, if you live elsewhere, you can struggle, especially with Doordash. Even though Doordash’s reach is in all 50 states, Grubhub’s customer service area is much broader in range and is available at every time of day. Grubhub consists of over 300,000 restaurants, where 155,000 are its partners across 3,200 cities in the US. Grubhub is even available outside of the US, in London, for instance. Doordash pales in comparison as it is only available in the major cities of the US and Canada. Conversely, Gurbhub’s many years of presence in the industry, wider availability, and a higher market share make it a better alternative.  Grubhub currently has a subscription service and is directly competing with Doordash through that. The Grubhub+ offers unlimited free delivery and also a 10% moneyback. It starts with a 14-day trial period, and then you will be paying $9.99 each month. Doordash’s DashPass has been around for longer and offers more than just free delivery and 10% moneyback perks. The free trial is also twice as long as 30 days. Both of these apps provide free delivery for selected restaurants. Grubhub does have a higher selection of restaurants which is further increased if you subscribe to Grubhub+. The 10% off on Grubhub+ is good if you do not use the Cash App credit card to unlock the 10% off for Doordash. Otherwise, both of these services are pretty much the same. Yet, as Grubhub offers more perks overall, it’s eligible as a free delivery company, making Grubhub+ a superior choice compared to Doordash’s DashPass. Related Article: What is the Popularity with Online Grocery Shopping?  The feel of the Doordash app is more polished and intuitive as compared to Grubhub. If you choose any of these services based on their app design or UI/UX, Doordash is the clear winner. Grubhub and seamless (another food app) are more widely available for a quick summary than Doordash. Compared to DashPass, the Grubhub+ service is also better, assuming that you do not have a Cash App credit card. Yet, when it comes to how friendly the user interface of both these apps is and their features, Doordash’s app looks and feels better than Grubhub’s. Both of these apps have a very healthy competition among themselves.

The LTFRB said that despite its July 26 order for TNCs Grab and Uber to stop, Uber “willfully and contumaciously violate[d]” the directive. Uber was also given five days to submit a explanation why its accreditation should not be canceled.  The LTFRB is currently reviewing the accreditation of the TNCs. Grab’s accreditation expired last month and while that of Uber is set to expire this month. But in a text message to the Inquirer, Uber communications head Cat Avelino maintained the company had suspended new driver and vehicle activations since July 19, or eight days after the LTFRB issued an initial order for TNCs to stop accepting new applications.  “[W]e have not resumed since then. As a result, 14,000 riders are unable to book a ride every day,” Avelino said. Last month, the LTFRB ordered the TNCs to stop the operation of drivers who do not have a certificate of public convenience or a provisional authority to operate. But the crackdown on colorum vehicles was deferred after the TNCs filed a motion for reconsideration.  PH lagging behind Of the estimated 42,000 Uber and Grab drivers, only about 3,700 have permits to operate. In a press conference on Tuesday, the eve of the hearing, Uber regional and local officials noted how the country had fallen behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in appreciating the benefits of the ride-sharing industry. They also raised concerns over a recent proposal to impose a supply cap on Uber and Grab vehicles, while reiterating calls for the government to lift the year-old suspension on the acceptance of new member drivers. “One of the shames about the Philippines is that back in 2015, there was a real sense that there was a clear momentum in this country to have the first national ride-sharing regulations,” said Damian Kassabgi, Uber Asia Pacific head of public policy.  “But frankly, since then, you’ve seen countries around the region overtake (the Philippines) in relation to their understanding of the service, and the way they are putting a framework around it,” he said. Kassabgi noted that Malaysia recently passed legislation in support of ride-sharing without price controls or supply caps. Against core principles These are areas the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it wanted to regulate. In terms of caps, there was a proposal last week to put a limit on the number of ride-sharing vehicles on the road. The LTFRB also saw a need for their drivers to put in a minimum number of hours. Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said these proposals would go against the core principles of ride-sharing, which was flexibility for both passengers and drivers. “What I can tell you is that 60 percent of drivers use [Uber] on a part time basis,” Cua said, referring to drivers who work six hours or less. Citing fluctuations in supply and demand, Cua also warned that limiting the number of eligible ride-sharing applications that can be approved would be “damaging” to the industry. Uber Philippines alone has some 30,000 drivers and one million active users, Cua said. ‘Taxi way of thinking’ “Having these supply caps is very much a taxi way of thinking about the world,” Kassabgi, citing countries like Malaysia and Singapore which have tight controls on private car ownership. “We do not see this concept of supply caps because regulators [elsewhere] understand that this is a demand responsive service.” The LTFRB last month fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for continuing to add new drivers to their networks despite the moratorium imposed by the board in July 2016. The LTFRB at the time said it wanted to review existing policies covering such transport services. According to Cua, some 200,000 rider requests “go unfulfilled”  weekly because of the suspension."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1011810/ltfrb-hype-overcharging-too-p2-minute-rate-unauthorized","title":"LTFRB: Hype overcharging, too; P2/minute rate unauthorized","date":"06:25 AM July 19, 2018","snippet":"","body":" The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has ordered another transport network company (TNC) to explain why it was overcharging passengers.  In a show-cause order issued on July 13, the LTFRB questioned why Hype Transport Inc. was charging passengers a P2-per-minute travel rate without the board’s approval. Hype was one of the five TNCs accredited by the LTFRB earlier this year, along with Hirna, Owto, GoLag and MiCab. Their entry was seen as a challenge to Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing industry following its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  If found to have violated the LTFRB’s rules on fare regulation, Hype could face the same fate as Grab which was fined P10 million last week for making a unilateral move to charge the same fee. Submitted fare schedule  In its original fare component schedule submitted to the LTFRB, Hype declared a base fare of P40 as well as a P13.50- to P14-per-kilometer rate for both its HypeTaxi and HypeSedan. The TNC also declared a surge rate of up to 1.5 times during peak hours, but there was no mention of a P2-per-minute travel rate. However, travel receipts issued by Hype to passengers who complained to the Lawyers for Commuters’ Safety and Protection (LSCP) showed that the breakdown included the P2-per-minute travel fee on top of base and distance rates. It was unclear whether Hype started charging the rate before Department Order 2015-11—which allowed TNCs to impose their own fare structures subject only to LTFRB oversight—was rescinded in June. Before it was fined, Grab argued that the department order authorized it to set its own fares. However, Grab was overruled when the LTFRB said it was the only one that could “determine, prescribe and fix rates” under Executive Order No. 202 and Commonwealth Act No. 146.  The order penalizing Grab was signed by LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra and Board Member Ronaldo Corpuz.Aileen Lizada, the other board member, dissented, upholding that TNCs indeed had the right to set their own fares under the department order. Same punishment sought Ariel Inton, former LTFRB board member and LCSP chair, said that Hype should be punished “in the same way” as Grab should it be found to have overcharged passengers. In a statement, Hype said it was one with the LTFRB in the aim of providing quality choice for the riding public. “We assure the public that Hype is transparent and abides by the law, and rules and regulations concerning TNCs.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/248997/ltfrb-orders-uber-resolve-issues-april-15","title":"LTFRB orders Uber to resolve its issues by April 15","date":"05:07 PM April 11, 2018","snippet":"Two government regulatory bodies are now at loggerheads with each other as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to resolve its issues with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) by Sunday, April 15, after which it would cease to be recognized as a transport network company (TNC).","body":"Two government regulatory bodies are now at loggerheads with each other as the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to resolve its issues with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) by Sunday, April 15, after which it would cease to be recognized as a transport network company (TNC). “In the interest of all TNVS [transport network vehicle services] and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said during Wednesday’s special board meeting.  The LTFRB order comes just four days after the PCC told Uber and Grab to continue to operate independently in the country while it conducts its motu propio review on the deal, which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the board that while they intended to withdraw their petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC, they were constrained to do so because of the PCC order.  Earlier, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said that, under their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to extend their funding of the operations of the Uber app to April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. According to him, however, doing so would not only defeat the purpose of what PCC wanted, but would also put the riding public in danger since Uber would no longer have any back-end support in the country that would address complaints and take care of passengers in the event of an accident.  In issuing the order, Lizada said that, the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would adversely affect the riding public and the thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. “The soonest possible time that you [Uber] will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she said. Meanwhile, LTFRB also ordered Grab to “immediately” lower its surge pricing cap from twice the rate to just 1.5, as it processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. “This is to ensure that the fare will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said.  In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following Uber’s exit in the country. But Cu said they were not taking advantage of the situation as he pointed out that the price surge was due to the lack of drivers in their system. He explained that, while there had been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. Cu noted that the reason Uber’s fare was lower than theirs was because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was at P5, while theirs was at P11. He added that, if Uber would not exit the country, its rate would soon be similar to theirs as it sought the LTFRB an increase to P12 per kilometer. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/247018/p2fb-ride-hailing-drivers-in-us-earn-less-than-minimum-wage-study","title":"Ride-hailing drivers in US earn less than minimum wage, says study","date":"03:33 PM March 04, 2018","snippet":"A recent study has discovered that drivers from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are barely making any profit plying the streets of the United States.","body":"A recent study has discovered that drivers from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are barely making any profit plying the streets of the United States.

According to the small importers, they have played a big role in bringing down to around P197 per bag the current prices of cement thanks to “lively” competition. But these small players warned that prices may shoot up even higher than the P300-per-bag level seen in 2015 because of the DTI order.  Issued by DTI’s Bureau of Product Standards last March, DAO 17-02 as amended by DAO 17-05 mandated that cement sourced from abroad by small importers must also have an Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) aside from a PS (Product Safety) mark. The ICC requirement was described by the importers as “arbitrary and capricious”, saying it would cause them irreparable damage. They added it would violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution that guards against monopolistic trade practices. The importers slammed the DAO for running counter to Philippine treaty obligations, including the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement of 1994 and the Asean Trade in Goods Agreement (Atiga).  The small players are now asking the DTI some tough questions. Why did DTI issue an order that would result to the cement supply being cartelized once again by importer-manufacturers and cause cement prices to rise sharply?  Why is DTI “hijacking” President Duterte’s policy of simplifying government procedures especially for major projects like those in its “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program? As it is, even without the infrastructure program, 600 million cements bags are sold by importer-manufacturers, with another 120 millions bags being imported. Why then did DTI issue a DAO that would limit the number of cement players to the importer-manufacturers who have in the past constricted cement supply to drive prices up especially for the local cement they produce? Why require an ICC for importers when the giant importer-manufacturers—who are exempted from the ICC requirement—have the same foreign suppliers, meaning the quality of imported cement is the same, especially with the PS mark certification? Why are the imports of importer-manufacturers exempted from the ICC requirement, but the products of mere importers need ICCs? For the sake of consumers, these questions demand answers. —DAXIM L. LUCAS  An extraordinary event occurred this week. Countless Filipino citizens set aside partisan differences to voice their united support for ridesharing in the country— led by Uber and Grab—against a government effort that would ultimately hurt the service, displace thousands of drivers and well over a million customers. In a shocking display of tone-deafness, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it would not back down and called out the two companies for breaking the rules by allowing drivers to operate without the necessary government permits. (This is strange because it was the LTFRB a year ago that halted the processing of new driver applications). Worse, the LTFRB made a strange comparison by painting regulated public utility vehicles in a favorable light. Anyone who has tried to hail a taxi cab in Metro Manila (there are a few exceptions) would find this a laughable thought. Taxi operators, despite their constant complaints that Grab and Uber were hurting their business, have failed or refused to improve until this very day. Perhaps the LTFRB forgot that ridesharing companies did not ram their services down the public’s throat. Commuters tried it and realized it worked. This is an unfortunate twist when only last week, ridesharing operators Grab and Uber heaved a partial sigh of relief after admitting that most drivers were operating illegally and were fined P5 million each. During that hearing, the LTFRB leadership added that they supported the technology. That statement now rings hollow given a directive to arrest erring drivers, which would eliminate most of the existing ridesharing driver network. It is true that Grab and Uber were remiss, but the government has its fault here as well. LTFRB said both companies should show good faith while it creates its technical working group to discuss accreditation, pricing and accountability. That must be quite a group to take more than a year to convene. It’s a clear case of technology and demand simply outpacing an outdated model of regulation, which, ironically, runs counter to President Duterte’s desire to cut red tape. Regulatory issues need to be addressed. Uber and Grab need to yield as well. But not at the expense of the riding public. —MIGUEL R.

Good thing there’s the humble jeepney.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); An Aboitiz-led venture plans to unveil next week more details on a massive plan to transform the iconic but sadly outdated jeepney vehicles plying our roads. Specifically, a company called QEV Philippines—a venture led by Endika Aboitiz, Enrique Banuelos and Jose Maria Roger—wants to partner with local jeepney manufacturers to shift some 50,000 diesel jeepneys into cleaner electric-powered vehicles “at a reasonable cost.” QEV is an international company formed by Banuelos to install electric charging stations. They are present in Europe and South America and the technology was developed by Banuelos and Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) as a result of their working together to launch F2 electric racing cars, which race in circuits worldwide. Early this year, the company sent one jeepney to its Barcelona research and development center to study how to convert them into electric vehicles. And more recently, their engineers worked with the pioneer jeepney manufacturing firm Sarao to produce a prototype electric public transport vehicle that is efficient, clean and modern. QEVTech will put up chargers for the e-jeepneys in Ayala and SM malls and Shell stations. These can charge an e-jeepney in slightly over 10 minutes. —MIGUEL R. CAMUS AND DAXIM L.

But there is growing apprehension over the LTFRB’s plan to regulate these ride-sharing firms. It currently regulates traditional cab operators, yet the news media are replete with horror stories of cabbies robbing, raping or even killing passengers. Colorum cabs abound, especially at night. Many cabbies also turn away passengers heading to certain destinations, particularly during rush hours, or demand extra charges if there is heavy traffic along the way. And anything left in a regular taxi is more often than not considered lost. Contrast this with the operations of ride-sharing firms. The service lets commuters book through their mobile phone a private vehicle to take them anywhere within Metro Manila. Passengers who book a ride on Uber, for example, can check within minutes on their mobile phone app what kind of vehicle is coming and who the driver is. Payments are charged to a credit or debit card; no cash is involved. The company also conducts a background check on the driver/vehicle owner before being accredited. Passengers are required to open an account where they have to disclose personal details and register a valid credit card. At the end of the service, both driver and passenger can leave feedback for each other.  It’s unfortunate that traditional taxi operators are threatening to sue the DOTC. Instead of complaining, shouldn’t they improve their services to be at par with ride-sharing firms? And this is not the only potential roadblock to ride-sharing. The LTFRB also wants to impose restrictions and requirements that, as the bureaucracy is sadly known for, can end up discouraging prospective ride-sharing participants. The most worrisome is the plan to require a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for all ride-sharing vehicles, which is reportedly not required in other countries where the concept is flourishing. Just how difficult is it to obtain a CPC? Judging from LTFRB requirements, it can take forever. Among the requirements are: copies of verified application forms; operator’s data sheet; route measured capacity certification from the DOTC; evidence of Filipino citizenship; authenticated birth certificate; evidence of financial capability; certificate of average daily balance from a bank; certificate of business name issued by the Department of Trade and Industry; certificate of registration and official receipt of authorized vehicles from the Land Transportation Office; photograph of units being applied for (front, back and sides of the vehicles, and the photo should include the front page of a newspaper to show the date when the picture was taken); location map and picture with dimension of garage with a transfer certificate of title or tax declaration or contract of lease for the specific garage area; and proof of publication of notice of hearing to be submitted during the actual hearing at the LTFRB. An applicant is also required to personally appear during the submission of an application. Whew!  Transportation regulations should facilitate, not hamper, convenient, safe and reliable services to the public. That’s according to Abaya himself. Smartphone-based transportation companies have transformed the way people move in many cities abroad with a safer, more reliable and efficient option. They are about to do the same in Metro Manila. In ensuring passenger safety, ride-sharing firms are way ahead compared with the traditional taxis. Regulatory authorities would do well to keep this in mind."}]}
