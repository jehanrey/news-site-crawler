This year, the three-day event took place on the virtual stage from October 6 to 8, centered around the theme of REVOLUTION, in reference to the disruptive technologies that enabled businesses to bounce back from the effects of the global pandemic. Let’s take a look at some of the highlights from day one of the convention – from rethinking manufacturing with the use of sensors and virtual factory dashboards, reimagining retail models, reconfiguring business models around tech capabilities, and enabling humanitarian efforts especially in remote corners of the world.  We are on the cusp of a new era where we can unlearn and relearn technology and its role both in business and our lives. This was the opening idea that Jovy Hernandez, ePLDT President & CEO and SVP and head of PLDT & Smart enterprise and international business groups, shared as he welcomed delegates on the virtual stage. He added that digital transformation has accelerated as a response to the pandemic. “Now is the time to reimagine the world of business as we would like it to be,” he announced.  And a lot of reimagination has indeed occurred in the last 19 months since the lockdowns began. What would have taken years to accomplish in digital transformation were crammed into mere months. Many businesses that used to rely on legacy systems have either fully embraced a digital platform or are currently in the process of digitization. Most of these efforts were driven by a change in consumer behavior as more customers relied on online portals to acquire services they would normally pursue in person, fueled by people’s cautiousness and adherence to movement restrictions. This is the new “business as usual” – customers wanting less physical touch, but still having a semblance of human interaction. And unsurprisingly, the foundation that supported many of these transformations is connectivity enabled by telecommunications companies like PLDT.  “During the pandemic, network connectivity has become critical for many things,” shared John Harrington, Nokia’s SVP head of Asia Pacific and Japan. He pointed out that while many things dwindled during the pandemic, internet demand rose significantly. According to PLDT, to meet the increasing demand of consumers and businesses for reliable connectivity, they focused on expanding their services to different areas in the Philippines in 2020. Today, they have more than 524,000 kilometers of fiber connections throughout the Philippines—the most extensive in the country, 14 cable systems across the country (and more in the next three years), doubled its 5G footprint to 4,000 sites for 5G connectivity, 68,500 base stations, and the largest telco-neutral data center network with 9,000 racks across ten sites.  Harrington added that 5G’s rollout also hasn’t been dampened by the pandemic and that Nokia along with other telecommunications companies across the world had been busy establishing new 5G connections.  “We’ve actually seen an increase in demand for connectivity. We’ve seen global internet traffic rise by 30 to 50% … We’ve seen the initial rollouts in Japan, Korea, Australia, and Singapore, and [recently], we’ve seen Nokia with Indosat in Indonesia launching 5G.” He also pointed out that they have observed new patterns in traffic and demand such as broadening times of high traffic, which means increasing network capacities has been important as internet consumption has widened. Along with consumer demand was the rising need to create and maintain remote workforces, which meant that connectivity suited for office work was no longer limited within the actual premise, but had to be extended to people’s homes.  This meant a lot of changes and challenges, requiring better speed and capacity, as well as security. The panel also added that there is now more demand (and there will be more demand in the future) for artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics, and cloud services. As a result of these, analytics suggest that there may be a lot of growth for data centers in the next few years. A few examples of developments being explored in creating better data centers include using liquid cooling for base stations to lessen the heat generated and lower energy consumption, as well as using modular design delivery systems that allow faster deployment of mechanical and electrical systems. Issues and innovations on cybersecurity were also discussed on the virtual stage. During one of the Tech Leadership forums, Karrie Ilagan of CISCO described the new issue as having “more surfaces for you to get attacked”. Some began implementing principles like Zero Trust which means removing assumed trust or security across the board, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), as well as other next-generation access models for security. These measures increase observability and transparency to help boost cybersecurity especially when you have different third-party suppliers that may have been working in silos in the past. There were a lot of interesting applications introduced throughout day one of the PH Digicon 2021. Several panelists during the plenary sessions as well as the Tech Leadership forums demonstrated how digital transformation took place in their fields of work. IoT is essentially synchronizing digital and physical systems, and this as a principle has been changing many business processes. In manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled factories to install hardware and software that help them operate, monitor, and service machinery remotely, and create a system where all the moving parts can talk to each other. By using sensors, system mapping can tell operators which machines are working efficiently, what parts need fixing, how much product is being produced, and so much more.  In a leadership forum, this was described as having “twin factories”, the first being the real physical factory and the second a virtual copy where you could see a layout view of all the different moving parts. For retail, new models are being introduced in response to changing consumer behaviors. Several panelists gave insights on how they have been addressing these.  For Grab Philippines’ country operations head Ronald Roda, they pivoted their services from ride sharing to include delivery services, adopting an “Any time, anywhere, any reason” delivery model.  Another model demonstrated on the virtual stage was called BOPIS, or “Buy online, pick up in-store” as explained by GlobalData’s head of thematic research Cyrus Mewawalla, who also touched on the importance of having an omnichannel approach in retail to make sure that brand presence is consistent.  Mewawalla also talked about the shift from artificial intelligence to augmented reality in retail, and some brands are making use of this by allowing customers to digitally try on certain products without having to purchase the items beforehand. There was a close look at business process outsourcing as well as the sector is a major contributor to the country’s GDP. And a major change that occurred for BPOs is having to move their services out of the office and into their employees’ homes, which means IT systems had to be expanded in a short period of time. Luigi Casas, vice president and CRM head of PLDT Enterprise, said that one way this was made possible was through IT architecture designed and powered by SD-WAN, which grants powerful combined LTE and Fiber connection, advanced firewall and threat management, and dashboard monitoring. He also shared that these systems will be even made more powerful as PLDT finishes three more major international cable facilities within the next five years. Another application of new technologies is in emergency services. Harrington described a system they are implementing in Sendai, Japan, where 5G was used for alert systems, and 5G-capable drones can be deployed for assisting in evacuation and delivery of emergency supplies. PLDT and Smart president and CEO, and MPIC chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan (MVP) explained that these revolutionary technologies are also becoming enablers for conglomerates and companies to be Environmental, Social and Governance compliant as issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  He pointed out that it would take revolutionary leadership to adopt these necessary changes. “The mantra has always been the customer experience, at the end of the day all of these are being done to ensure network processes transformation are being done to ensure that we are able to ratchet up our ability to raise the quality of customer experience.”  Among the highly renowned panel of speakers during the first day of PH Digicon 2021 was Hollywood actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist Charlize Theron who talked about the role of communication and information for the advocacy work they have been doing in Africa. Theron is a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and is the founder of the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP), a foundation that has been investing in African youth and fighting against HIV/AIDS.  Theron looked back to the beginnings of the foundation, sharing that they first began with only three mobile clinics that brought health-saving information and tools to communities that had no infrastructure to support them. The mobile clinics also became a way for children to have access to the internet for the first time in their lives, and be able to learn how to use computers as work and life skills for their future. She shared recollections of growing up in South Africa at a time when there were still a lot of fears and questions about the AIDS pandemic and compared it to what has been happening recently with COVID-19. Theron pointed out that what matters right now is being able to listen to the people on the ground even when we can’t be with them physically. According to Theron, among the issues exacerbated is gender-based violence, which they have been trying to address through a program called “Together for Her”. Their foundation has also been hard at work in securing vaccines for their beneficiaries. All these packed discussions happened only during the first day of PH Digicon 2021, and a lot more unfolded as insights were shared and new connections were established. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/soaring-lebanese-fuel-prices-deepen-misery/","title":"Soaring Lebanese fuel prices deepen misery","date":"Oct 21, 2021 11:20 PM PHT","snippet":"'How are we supposed to live? We drive around and can't find passengers on the road,' says a taxi driver in Lebanon","body":"Taxi drivers blocked roads in Beirut on Thursday, October 21, in protest at spiraling fuel prices that are compounding misery for Lebanese already suffering the effects of a devastating economic collapse. Gasoline today is about 10 times more expensive at the pump than it was just a few months ago, shooting higher as the central bank has stopped providing dollars at heavily subsidized exchange rates for fuel imports. Several dozen taxi drivers parked their cars in Martyrs Square in the middle of Beirut and blocked a nearby main road in protest at the latest hike – a 25% increase announced on Wednesday, October 20. “How are we supposed to live? We drive around and can’t find passengers on the road,” said Hanna Ibrahim, a taxi driver. When passengers can be found, arguments often break out over the fare, she said. “They make us cry and we make them cry.” The Lebanese pound has lost around 90% of its value in the last two years, and three quarters of Lebanese are now in poverty. The price of a ride in a shared taxi, a vital means of transport for many in a country without railways or other public transport, used to be 1,500 pounds, or $1, before the crash. Today, it can go as high as 30,000 pounds. “We can’t take it anymore, before when we used to earn 20,000 Lebanese pounds, we used to bring home bread and cheese but not anymore, we are losing now,” Marwan Awawd, another taxi driver, said. In a meeting on Thursday, taxi drivers told energy minister Walid Fayad that fuel subsidies should have been kept in place until the rollout of a cash assistance program planned by the government, and urged him not to change fuel prices before a solution had been found to help the people. In the encounter broadcast by Al Jadeed TV, Fayad responded, “I feel your pain and I want to find a solution, but let me tell you something, so I am not giving you empty promises.” “If, God forbid, the dollar exchange rate goes up…and I don’t change the petrol price, there is one problem that will happen: the petrol importers won’t bring petrol,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/cebu-women-forum-lewd-drawing-nude-photo-troll-october-2021/","title":"Cebu women’s forum fights through lewd troll attack","date":"Oct 4, 2021 2:21 PM PHT","snippet":"The hijackers also abuse Zoom's sound features, blaring loud music to drown out the speaker's voice, and hurling degrading phrases","body":"Internet trolls hijacked a forum on feminism on Saturday, October 2, drawing penises, using obscene language, and flashing an unsolicited image of a nude man – a grotesque demonstration of why safe spaces for women remain an urgent concern. The attack took place during the online forum, What Women Want: Laban Juana. The event was a launch for What Women Want (WWW), a grievance system for misogyny and sexual harassment cases in the University of San Carlos (USC) in Cebu City. The launch, live streamed through Facebook and viewed by over a thousand users, went smoothly for two hours. Two resource speakers discussed feminist issues and Vice President Leni Robredo gave a message as well.  It wasn’t until the solidarity message towards the end that the trolls attacked. The day had started out exciting for Celine Lagundi, chairwoman of the group Gabriela Youth – USC (GY-USC).She traveled 17 kilometers from Liloan town to Talamban, a barangay in Cebu City, roughly an hour-long ride, to coordinate the shared speech with her general secretary Hannah Cartagena. When it came time for her to speak, the screen gradually filled with scribbles in red. It didn’t take long for her and the audience to realize that these were lewd drawings of phallic symbols, defacing the presentation that showcased Lagundi’s name. “It came across as ‘we don’t want to listen to you.’ It was very disempowering,” said Lagundi who wasn’t even halfway through her speech when the harassment occurred. A jumble of emotions coursed through her: confusion, shock, humiliation, and trauma. The hijackers also abused Zoom’s sound features, blaring loud music to drown out Lagundi’s speech and hurling degrading phrases like “bitch”, “kiss my ass”, and “suck my dick.” The host, Mariel Dumaraos, was forced to end the webinar when the hijackers flashed a photo of a naked man on screen. Turning to Cartagena, Lagundi’s immediate response was “why does this always happen to me?” It was not Lagundi’s first experience with harassment. She’s faced misogynistic and sexist attacks all throughout her university life, furthering the need for initiatives like WWW that promote safe spaces for women in schools. “It’s not new, but it shouldn’t be the norm. That’s the reason why it doesn’t faze me and it doesn’t scare me. I was horrified, sure, but wala siya’y nabuhat. (He didn’t change anything.) I would still be org chairperson, I would still fight for women’s rights… Our struggle and oppression, we live through it.” The organizers went live again a few minutes later. Lagundi and Cartagena were able to finish their speech strongly, aptly touching on online sexual abuse as well. “What a way to get the message of What Women Want across than a live harassment of the chairperson of the only militant feminist youth collective in the University of San Carlos,” Lagundi remarked, saying she’s proud of the WWW initiative despite the hijacking. The hijackers perverted the launch event that took the organizers a month to prepare for. WWW was set to launch in early August but was pushed back to fine-tune plans. Instead of condemning the attack, some netizens lambasted the organizers, victims themselves, for not being careful enough and not having more security measures in place.  One netizen criticized them for not disabling public annotation. Another questioned why the host didn’t remove the trolls from the room or remove their sharing capabilities. “I was shaking the entire time and I cried because I felt violated,” Mariel, who is also the proponent of WWW said. Her team attempted to remove the trolls from the private room, but it quickly grew out of hand when they multiplied in number. As a security measure, the Zoom link was only accessible to people who signed up through a registration form. The organizers understandably admitted people thinking they were students and supporters. As it turned out, the Zoom link was compromised by anonymous users who shared it in Twitter, according to student publication Today’s Carolinian. “None of us wanted that to happen… It was such a traumatic experience for us, too, and it’s disheartening to see people point fingers at us. I just hope people stop victim-blaming and redirect their anger sa trolls,” Mariel said.  Lagundi also called out the accusations, saying this is akin to what happens with offline harassment when people criticize the victim for not wearing conservative clothes or not being more careful. “It’s so strange that people have the audacity to blame me or blame the organizers. The rage should be directed towards the perpetrators,”  Lagundi  voiced. She instead called for collective healing. Seeing a solidarity message from the USC Supreme Student Council warmed her heart, and countless people expressed their anger towards the perpetrators and support for her following the hijacking. “I think that’s what victims of sexual harassment need: collective healing.” The hijacking of the WWW launch is far from an isolated incident. As Mariel cited in her orientation speech, 3 in 5 Filipino women have experienced sexual harassment at least once in homes, streets, and schools. Katrina Mentes, a legislative researcher at the House of Representatives under Gabriela Women’s Partylist and also WWW resource speaker, pointed out in her talk that rape jokes and misogynist remarks are normalized by President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte himself joked about an Australian missionary, saying that the mayor should have raped her first because she looked like a beautiful American actress. He also referred to a largely female audience as “puta” and “crazy women,” a chilling parallel to what occurred during the hijacking. Asked whether she would press charges, Lagundi said she probably wouldn’t because of the justice system, and the grueling process that would affect her mental wellbeing. “I have an understanding of how the justice system works. How it’s so broken. I’ve had personal experience of filing, attempting to file charges, and nothing happens because harassment and gender discrimination is systemic.” Mariel herself is no stranger to the issue, which is why she proposed the WWW grievance system in the first place. “I grew up seeing my mom being domestically violated at home. I also experienced being sexually harassed…I don’t want to live a life seeing women, including myself, being silenced by the abuser. So in ways that I can, I will continue to banner the promotion and protection of women’s rights.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/lessons-how-digitally-transformed-industries-rose-philippines-pandemic/","title":"Keeping the e in e-Industry","date":"Oct 4, 2021 1:45 PM PHT","snippet":"It’s been more than a year since e-Industries took over conventional businesses. What have we learned since then?","body":"The world has entered a new era, where investing in a physical space to run a business isn’t as important as it used to be. This, right after the boom of co-working spaces and flexible office leases, was a phenomenon that many saw coming but didn’t expect to happen so fast. Closure of physical spaces and travel restrictions didn’t just result in a shift to digital channels, but more like a pivot. In a world where safety in proximity was a concern, everyone had to figure out how to keep up with life even when apart. The industries that kept the world running plugged into the digital grid, becoming electronics-based industries, or e-Industries, that catered to the world’s needs remotely. And after more than a year since the pandemic began, those in the business community are accepting the fact e-Industries are here to stay. “At the height of disruptions brought about by the global pandemic, we at PLDT Enterprise first led the transformation of e-Industries last year through technological advancements to help fuel their growth and development despite the challenges in the business landscape,” said Jovy Hernandez, ePLDT president & CEO and SVP and head of PLDT & Smart Enterprise and International Business Groups. “We are committed to continuously improve and develop more tailor-fit solutions to support the expanding needs of various e-industries.” Sectors across the board had to make use of online channels, whether in distributing their products, staying in touch with their clientele, or even managing workforces and other internal processes. And clearly, the benefits of doing so have moved beyond simply picking back up where things were left in the past. The most prevalent among developments in the past year that will stick is remote and hybrid work setups. Several companies have already announced that they won’t be moving back to conventional work schedules and will only require limited face-to-face meetings. Some are experimenting with hybrid setups where physical interactions are also lessened. “Many experts have made their predictions that the return to the usual workplace is unlikely, and that remote work is here to stay. With remote work still at the forefront because of the pandemic, we ensure that businesses can continue on with their operations through our digital tools and services. Our aim is to bridge companies in their goals of transforming their operations through technology. Soon enough, we will not just work from home but work from anywhere,” shared Hernandez. Other technologies explored and deployed included warehouse and inventory management, chatbots, ICT solutions, and other cloud-related services. And now that 5G is also beginning to roll out globally, we can expect more powerful cloud architectures that can potentially be hardware-agnostic. Before the pandemic began, services that primed convenience were taking off, and people were willing to pay the premiums placed on them. Ride-sharing, though more expensive than other forms of public transportation, was patronized. Online food deliveries were a thing even then because of how easy it was to place an order and receive it even on short notice. Convenience was everything then, but that’s not necessarily the case here anymore. Safety, rather than convenience, is now the priority for many. When in the past, it used to be bringing products easier to people, today, it’s about removing as much contact as possible as the pandemic persists. And this also sheds light on the possibility of preserving the “human touch” even when we don’t see people physically. George Westerman, a principal research scientist for workforce learning at MIT Sloan, describes this as an assumption over customer values. He explains that a carefully planned digital architecture can indeed produce a personalized transaction even when done remotely. After more than a year of restricted movement, there are now things that we find normal that we would have had a hard time accepting pre-pandemic. One example is conducting health consultations. e-Healthcare used to be limited in checking and booking appointments. Today, even consultations done through video calls are accepted as legitimate, and prescriptions issued via email are valid. The same can be said for other industries like e-Learning and e-Banking. Online courses are nothing new, but the systems that schools employ are now more robust. Banking services have also taken a digital approach in the past, but more services are being brought into online and mobile platforms to keep up with the needs of customers. These are but a few demonstrations of how strict regulation can also quickly adopt new measures wherever and whenever necessary. While digital transformation and shifting to e-Industries heavily rely on finding the right technologies, investing in new tech is only half the battle. Doing so also requires having an open-minded approach and strong dedication to making new systems work. And even though a lot of the challenges that businesses face today are still difficult to navigate, there are those who have done it successfully who can give you an idea of how they pursued digital transformation and hopefully give you an idea on how you can apply what they’ve learned on your own.  Given both the emergence and prevalence of digital transformation, PLDT Enterprise established the Philippine Digital Convention in 2014 as a medium through which global industry mavens, thought leaders, and pioneers in technology could come together to help drive technological enablement among enterprises throughout the country and region. The PH Digicon has been gathering C-suite level experts who lay down the biggest trends in tech and how they have maximized such advancements into their operations. This year, the three-day conference will be held virtually, exploring the theme of “REVOLUTION” as a means to encourage businesses to embrace revolutionary innovations and switch to a digital approach as they recover from the pandemic. PH Digicon 2021 will be headlined by Hollywood actress, producer, and entrepreneur Charlize Theron. It will also feature other industry heads and trailblazers like Yasuo Suzuki of NTT Global Data Center, John Harrington of Nokia, Dave West of Cisco, Nicholas Ma of Huawei, and Filipino business tycoons such as Penshoppe Group chairman and CEO Bernie Liu, Jollibee Group chief business officer Joseph Tanbuntiong, JG Summit Holdings Inc. president and CEO Lance Gokongwei, Century Pacific Food, Inc. executive chairman Chris Po, Alliance Global Group Inc. CEO Kevin L. Tan, and many more.  The conference will be held from October 6 to 8, 2021. Join the revolution and register now for free at: phdigicon2021.com.

Lambero said he has been relying on the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, introduced in March 2020 for self-employed workers, business owners, and gig workers who did not qualify for regular benefits. “I don’t know what I’m going to do…maybe I’m going to be homeless,” said Lambero, who lives in the northwest city of Seattle and sends money back to his family in Ethiopia. “I don’t have any plan, I’m still wishing our government would do something,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone, in between coughs. Millions of contractors and out-of-work people in the United States will be without an extra lifeline when the expanded unemployment benefits expire on Monday, just as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are surging once again. Close to 160,000 new infections are being reported each day in the United States – the highest sustained totals in months – in the country which has been hardest hit globally, with 39 million infections and 640,000 deaths since the pandemic began. More than 7 million people will be hit by Monday’s expiry of three federal programs to help jobless Americans during the pandemic, which also supplemented state benefits with a $300-per-week boost and gave extra money to the long-term unemployed. The majority of these – 4.2 million – are PUA beneficiaries, according to an analysis by The Century Foundation think tank, typically workers like drivers who are classified as independent contractors and do not receive regular employee benefits. The rise of the gig economy in the United States and across the globe has become a flashpoint for the labor movement and triggered legal challenges over pay and protections which could reshape the booming on-demand industries. Anwaar Malik, an Uber driver from New York State’s Long Island, said he would have to return to work when the federal benefits end so as to pay his rent and support his wife and child, as well as family back in Pakistan. “Who’s going to take care of them if I get killed by COVID?” he asked, adding that he knew other drivers who died from the virus because they had to keep working amid delays in receiving unemployment benefits. “Don’t let us die,” he said. The ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft declined to respond directly to questions as to whether they supported a benefits extension. “We are grateful to Congress for stepping up to provide crucial support to gig workers when they needed it most,” an Uber spokesperson said in emailed comments. In early 2020, Uber and Lyft announced policies to provide financial assistance to drivers who tested positive for COVID-19 or who had to self-isolate because of a suspected positive case. Uber said it also took steps to confirm that both drivers and passengers wear masks, and Lyft said its drivers could decline rides for health safety reasons with no penalty. “We anticipate more drivers returning after the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits,” Lyft said in an emailed statement, which noted that most of its drivers were either students or also had other jobs. “It continues to be a great time to earn, with drivers in some of our busiest markets making on average more than $35 an hour.” Half of US states, nearly all led by Republican governors, ended some of the unemployment benefits starting in June, saying the payments were discouraging people from looking for work and leaving companies without the workers they needed to reopen. Kelly Harris of Ohio, who spoke by phone while on a food delivery job, said the federal benefits, which were cut off in her state in June, had helped her get through the past year. “It’s harder because I can only work so many hours if I don’t have anybody to watch my kids,” Harris said. Economists at four universities, including Columbia and Harvard, found that states that withdrew from federal programs in June saw slightly higher job growth, but only one in eight people who lost benefits had jobs in the first week in August. Courts in several states, including Indiana and Maryland, have ordered the benefits to continue flowing amid legal challenges. Ending the expanded benefits makes sense given the record number of job vacancies in the country, said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the federal Congressional Budget Office, which estimates costs of proposed legislation for Congress. “Anything that appears to be an impediment to having the labor market work more effectively probably should be gotten rid of – and this is on that list,” said Holtz-Eakin, head of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. Tina Raveneau, an organizer with the Independent Drivers Guild, which advocates for ride-share drivers, said that people were “praying” for an extension of the benefits. “We ride to eat,” Raveneau said. “We are not being heard.” Raveneau and other advocates have been pushing for a broader rethink of the gig economy, saying the pandemic has highlighted the need for more specific labor and safety protections for ride-hail drivers. “This working force is not going anywhere…. We want to be in the conversation,” she said. “It’s no longer gig work – it’s our job.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/mount-pinatubo-betis-wood-storage-venta-suites-pampanga/","title":"From Pinatubo to pandemic: Betis wood storage now leisure hideaway","date":"Aug 14, 2021 4:34 PM PHT","snippet":"The pandemic prods Lieza Bituin to develop and repurpose their old property in Guagua, Pampanga, into a  staycation destination","body":"It was an old wood kiln-drying chamber in the heart of the wood-carving village of Betis in Guagua, Pampanga, when Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991. Left as a warehouse during the last decades, the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for its transformation into a leisure hideaway. Surrounded by organic silhouettes from its lush tropical foliage and a private fishpond, The Venta Suites exudes rustic charm with some contemporary industrial touches. Owner Lieza Bituin comes from a family whose furniture manufacturing company was affected by the Pinatubo eruption. The disaster forced the Bituin family to abandon the kiln grounds, leaving only a storage warehouse as they relocated manufacturing facilities to Tarlac province and Mabalacat, another city in Pampanga. Three decades after the disaster wrought by Mount Pinatubo, Bituin found her furniture-making company, South Sea Veneer Corporation, floundering amid the COVID-19 pandemic. She had less projects since hotels, restaurants, and retail shops could barely operate, much less renovate. “Residential projects are still ongoing but there is also more competition now both from imported and local furniture brands,” Bituin told Rappler.  “The first months of the lockdown in 2020 caused delays. It was very difficult to restart operations. We were very lucky that we were able to provide continuous work for our employees. But it’s never without its own set of hurdles, particularly with rising costs of raw materials. It was our commitment to our customers to fulfill their orders,” Bituin added. Thinking of diversifying her income stream, Bituin thought of reviving an old property that was once inaccessible. It was a perfect time to develop their old property for a different purpose, leaning towards hospitality and focusing on the growing local tourism market. “The pandemic has people looking for staycation destinations, plus the opening of new highways makes transportation a lot more convenient for people from the city to venture outside of it,” Bituin said, as she explained her decision to open Venta Suites. “We are excited to contribute in creating Pampanga not only as a day trip destination for its local food cuisine, but also as a staycation destination,” she added. Bituin transformed the chambers into three spacious rooms. The details and artistic touches are notable from the historical foundation up to the hinges. Chambers 1 and 2, with interiors from reused antique collections and customized furniture,  can accommodate two guests. Chamber 3 can accommodate up to six guests. It features a semi indoor-outdoor private pool area, a glass door partition, and a bigger bathroom. Overnight rates range from P6,000 to P12,000 on weekdays and P6,500 to P13,000 on weekends, with breakfast included. Guests can also bring their own food or they can order at the nearby Souq restaurant.  The Venta Suites has an outdoor lounge and a dining area with a small pool. Bikes are available for guests to roam around the property, and Nordic macrame swings add flair to the greenery. Bituin noted that the craftsmanship – from weaving to wood carving, even clay pottery and manual construction – has always been innate to the Pampangueño. As the local crafts in Betis, and in Pampanga as a whole, still continuously give livelihood to its people, Bituin made a conscious effort to bring in other Filipino-made products. “Aside from the local furniture and decorations, we use locally-made baskets in serving our breakfast packs. We also provide inabel blankets sourced from Ilocos and added macrame swings. We also serve specialty coffee drip bags sourced from a friend’s coffee shop in Bulacan,” shared Bituin. With her love for plants and local crafts, her personal passion for traveling, and professional life in furniture design and manufacturing, Bituin incorporated these influences  in curating pieces for the quiet, rustic haven.

Heaven, 21, posted a series of photos of her and Kiko taking a walk together on an empty road, sharing embraces and a forehead kiss.  “His infinity,” Heaven wrote. Kiko, 26, who had previously deleted his past Instagram posts, broke his social media hiatus to also confirm his relationship with Heaven. He shared photos of the two of them playing with their pet dog, sitting on a grassy field, and sharing a car ride together. “I love you,” he wrote, to which Heaven replied, “I love you too,” in the comments. Comments on Kiko’s post have been limited. The public confirmation comes nearly six months after the two were first rumored to be dating, after speculations that Kiko and ex-girlfriend Devon Seron, who went public with their relationship in 2019, had broken up because of Heaven’s alleged involvement. Heaven had clarified in March that “she was not in any way romantically associated with Kiko nor am I the reason behind their breakup.” “Associating me with actors I have scenes with can be easy. At the end of the day, we’re nothing more than just co-actors working with each other,” she said then. Kiko and Heaven had acted together on ABS-CBN’s Bagong Umaga series, which ran from October 2020 to April 2021. In April, Kiko confirmed on a virtual episode of ABS-CBN’s Magandang Buhay that he was officially single. In June, Kiko and Heaven were seen spending time together in Boracay. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-lyft-drivers-strike-labor-rights-us-gig-workers/","title":"Uber, Lyft drivers strike to win labor rights for US gig workers","date":"Jul 23, 2021 10:10 AM PHT","snippet":"Gig workers demand better wages, working conditions, and the right to band together","body":"Drivers for Uber and Lyft have staged strikes in cities across the United States, urging Congress to grant gig workers the right to band together and push for better wages and working conditions. Wednesday’s protests – from California to Maryland – reveal an increasingly fractious dispute over how gig workers should be regarded by law and what rights they deserve at work. The question is under debate in Congress as lawmakers wrangle over whether the self-employed can bargain collectively as part of a wider Protect the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). “We want a seat at the table,” said driver Alvaro Bolainez, part of a 50-strong protest at Los Angeles airport. Bolainez urged his fellow drivers to turn off their apps and lay down their keys, saying his pay was consistently and unilaterally cut by the rich ride-sharing companies he serves. “It’s like a rollercoaster – one week I can make $1,000, the next I’ll make $400 working the same number of hours,” he said. A spokesperson for Lyft said in an emailed statement that the company is “fighting to expand benefits and protections for drivers in a way that allows them to keep their independence. This is the type of forward-looking approach our drivers want.” Uber referred questions to the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services Coalition, a pro-industry group, which said most driver earnings were on the rise in California. It also sent remarks from drivers who oppose the strike. “I treat it like it’s a business and I drive smart,” said 65-year-old Jim Pyatt, a part-time driver in California. “I never make less than $35 an hour and I love the flexibility.” But at the LA rally, drivers told a very different story – recalling days when earnings lagged the minimum wage, of idling roadside for hours or paying out of pocket for vehicle repairs. Labor organizers want to roll back a 2020 California ballot measure that cemented gig workers as independent contractors after their drive firms mounted a $200-million campaign against a state law aimed at forcing them to treat workers as employees. A Reuters calculation found the 2020 measure had saved Uber and Lyft $392 million each in costs such as payroll taxes and worker compensation. “It created a second-class status for all app-based workers in California,” said Nicole Moore, a rally organizer who urged the Senate to pass the PRO act when it votes on a multi-trillion dollar spending package under negotiation. The law would, among other measures, reclassify many independent contractors as employees for the purpose of collective bargaining, though not for wage laws and benefits. Veena Dubal, an employment law professor and critic of gig company practice, said with debate fomenting over worker rights, the West Coast was a microcosm of a far bigger problem. “Although the action is centered in California, it’s really workers over the country participating because they know California is the epicenter of the business model, but the companies are trying to export it elsewhere,” she said. In recent months, gig firms have courted unions and state officials in an effort to cement their workers’ status as independent contractors in all US states so as to cut costs. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/united-states-initial-public-offerings-h1-2021/","title":"US IPOs hit annual record in less than 6 months","date":"Jun 16, 2021 10:25 AM PHT","snippet":"Initial public offerings in the United States have already totaled $171 billion, eclipsing the 2020 record of $168 billion","body":"Wall Street’s record-breaking run for stock market flotations shows no signs of slowing down. With more than six months until the year ends, US initial public offerings (IPOs) have already totaled $171 billion, eclipsing the 2020 record of $168 billion, according to data from Dealogic. Driving the IPO rush are sky-high corporate valuations in the stock market, inflated by the Federal Reserve’s low interest rates and monetary stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has fueled a wave of speculative frenzy that benefits not just traditional companies going public, but also special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) formed strictly to raise money through IPOs. The IPO gold rush is set to reach new heights in the second half of 2021, as a number of high-profile startups such as China’s largest ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology Company Ltd, online brokerage Robinhood Markets Incorporated, and electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automative LLC prepare to launch multibillion-dollar share sales. “If the markets hang in anywhere near where they are right now, we are going to be incredibly busy this summer, and into the fall with IPOs,” said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley. “Trees don’t grow to the sky forever, so you’re not going to have a record volume every year. But assuming stability, we’d also expect a busy 2022.” Excluding proceeds from SPAC IPOs, traditional listings of big names, including South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Incorporated, have raked in $67 billion this year, keeping 2021 on track to be the biggest year for such IPOs. The average one-day gain for US IPOs so far this year is 40.5%, compared with 28.2% during the same period in 2020 and 21.7% in 2019, according to Dealogic. The average one-week return for 2021 is 35.7%, higher than 32.2% in 2020 and 25.5% in 2019. Capital markets bankers and lawyers estimate that companies could end up raising close to $50 billion through traditional IPOs, excluding SPACs, before the end of the September quarter. IPO proceeds have touched $24.1 billion in the second quarter through June 15, according to Dealogic. Didi’s offering alone could raise close to $10 billion, sources have previously told Reuters. By the end of the year, US IPOs could raise $250 billion to $300 billion or more – a staggering sum once considered unthinkable, according to investment bankers. “Five hundred million used to be a pretty big IPO. Nowadays everything seems to be in the billions or three-quarters of a billion-plus. So there’s really been an explosion in the size of transactions as well,” said Jeff Bunzel, global co-head of equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank. “And there seems to be adequate amount of capital out there to help support that level of activity.” The record numbers have been fueled largely by the boom in listings of special purpose acquisition companies. SPACs, or blank check companies, are listed shell companies that raise cash with the sole purpose of merging with a private company within two years of the listing. The process takes the private company public. During the first quarter alone, SPAC listings raised close to $100 billion, well above the $83 billion for all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research. Despite the recent slowdown in SPAC dealmaking, 339 SPACs have been formed this year, raising roughly $105 billion or nearly two-thirds of the total IPO volume. In 2020, SPAC volumes accounted for less than half of the total IPO proceeds. “Valuations are strong, fund flows are strong, and all the ingredients that you need to have an active and successful IPO market remain intact right now,” said Bunzel. Investment bankers and lawyers also pointed out that the capital markets boom is attracting more companies that would have otherwise stayed private for longer, making the IPO pipeline even more robust for the foreseeable future. “Because of the surge in SPAC transactions, a lot of companies are thinking this is an opportune time to hit the market and achieve attractive valuations. I think it’s led to private companies being more receptive and interested in pursuing a public option,” said Paul Tropp, who co-heads the capital markets group at Ropes & Gray. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/video-ivana-alawi-adie-paraluman-music-video/","title":"WATCH: Ivana Alawi is Adie’s ‘Paraluman’ in official music video","date":"Jun 6, 2021 11:33 AM PHT","snippet":"The music video is directed by Bela Padilla","body":"Actress and internet star Ivana Alawi stars as the titular muse in the official music video for “Paraluman,” the hit song by singer-songwriter Adie.

From ride-sharing apps like Uber and online marketplaces like UpWork linking freelancers and clients, to software that allows employers to oversee workers, digital platforms have transformed the nature of work, the UN’s ILO said. “At their best, all these platforms provide new opportunities,” said Guy Ryder, head of the ILO, which surveyed 12,000 workers in 100 countries, 70 businesses and 16 platform companies in its first in-depth report on the platform economy. “There are opportunities for disabled workers, for those in remote locations. There’s evidence that those who have been unemployed or marginalized might find their way into the labor market,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the shift to a digital economy, changing the way work has been organized and regulated for decades. With job losses, millions have become gig workers, providing on-demand driving, delivery or childcare services. But in many cases the work is poorly paid – with half of online workers earning less than $2 an hour – and lacks access to traditional employment benefits, like collective bargaining, insurance and work-related injury protections, the ILO found. Platforms generally classify workers as independent contractors and their rights depend on the platforms’ own terms of service, not employment law. The ILO found significant inequities in the platform economy, with workers in developing countries earning 60% less than those in developed countries, even after controlling for basic characteristics and types of tasks. More than 70% of taxi drivers reported their average daily number of trips and earnings decreased after a platform took over the market. Ryder called for workers’ rights already established in the “analogue” world – such as health benefits and bargaining rights – to be protected in the world of platform work. “It’s often a very one-sided work relationship,” he said, adding that this imbalance could be addressed through greater dialogue and regulatory cooperation between workers, platforms and government. The control and ownership of workers’ data is another emerging concern, the ILO said. “The data from work…is becoming a bankable commodity,” Ryder said. “Questions of the appropriation and ownership of that data is a big, big issue.” The emergence of a few giant players creates risks as they have access to vast amounts of information created by workers, such as how long it takes to complete a task or their locations, which digital platforms can use as they see fit, the ILO said. Andrew Pakes, research director with the British trade union Prospect said data is the “new frontline of workers’ rights.” “We need to get serious about these risks and take a stand before we sleepwalk into a new age of digital management and surveillance where employers hold all the cards,” he said in emailed comments. – Thomson Reuters Foundation/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/perth-lockdown-ending-australia-weeks-run-without-covid-19/","title":"Perth in lockdown, ending Australia’s 2-week run without COVID-19","date":"Jan 31, 2021 4:08 PM PHT","snippet":"Restaurants, cafes and cinemas are ordered shut, while a scheduled return from summer school holidays is extended by a week, after a security guard returned a positive test","body":"The Australian city of Perth was ordered into lockdown on Sunday, January 31, after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive for COVID-19, ending the country’s longest coronavirus-free run. From Sunday evening until Friday, February 5, people in the city of 2 million must stay home, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise, with visits to hospitals and nursing homes banned, said Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan. Australia’s fourth-most populous city had recorded no cases of the virus for 10 months, and Australia just hours earlier had announced 14 days without a locally acquired infection. Restaurants, cafes and cinemas were ordered shut in Perth and surrounding areas were ordered shut, while a scheduled return from summer school holidays was extended by a week, after the security guard returned a positive test late on Saturday, January 30, McGowan said. The vast, largely isolated state has been known in Australia for a hardline COVID-19 response that included keeping its border closed to the rest of the country until recently when it reopened to some regions. “I know for many Western Australians this is going to come as a shock,” McGowan told a hastily scheduled news conference. “We cannot forget how quickly this virus can spread, nor the devastation it can cause.” The security guard, aged in his 20s, was working at a hotel where 4 people in quarantine had active cases of the virus, including with highly contagious strains that have been linked to Britain and South Africa, the health authorities said. The man had a second job with an unspecified ride-sharing company but had not worked his driving job since reporting symptoms on Thursday. Other people in the man’s household had tested negative but were put in isolation and were expected to test positive in the coming days, they said. The lockdown affected four-fifths of the population of Australia’s geographically biggest state, and the rest were asked not to travel. People from other states, only some of whom were recently allowed back into the state, were again asked to stay away. The police would set up road checkpoints to question people’s movements, Police Commissioner Chris Dawson told reporters, adding that the police would also enforce a new rule requiring people to wear masks in public indoor spaces and on public transport. Australia has had its borders closed since March to slow the spread of the illness that has infected 29,000 in the country and killed 909. State governments have closed internal borders for the first time in a century, an effort to keep the virus out that has at times resulted in terse exchanges between state leaders over disagreements about people’s ability to move around the country. Earlier on Sunday, Australia reopened its “travel bubble” with New Zealand, meaning travelers from New Zealand are exempt from 14-day hotel quarantine, after the neighboring country reported no new locally acquired COVID-19 cases. New Zealand has, however, kept its border closed to Australia. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/new-renault-ceo-luca-de-meo-plans-leaner-electric-future/","title":"New Renault boss plans leaner, electric future","date":"Jan 14, 2021 10:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Renault plans to focus on its most profitable models and on new electric launches – including a revamped version of the classic Renault Super Cinq","body":"French carmaker Renault pledged to slim down and focus more on technology as its new chief executive officer laid out plans to revive a business hammered by management turmoil and the COVID-19 crisis. In a departure from the world-conquering view of former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn, CEO Luca de Meo said Renault would reduce the number of cars it turns out, focus on its most profitable models and on new electric launches – including a revamped version of the classic Renault Super Cinq. “We grew bigger, but not better,” De Meo said in an online presentation, which aimed to project a jazzier, more youthful brand under a street-art style “Renaulution” slogan. De Meo, who arrived last July after a stint running Volkswagen’s Seat brand, said the task now was to “steer our business from market share to margin.” Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the car industry, Renault was struggling to adjust to life without Ghosn, the architect and longtime boss of its alliance with Japan’s Nissan. Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges, which he denies, and later fled. The company also faces new challenges, as the European Union tightens emissions regulations and rivals PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles complete their merger to create Stellantis, the world’s 4th biggest automaker, with potentially more resources to meet the industry changes. Renault’s car production will drop to 3.1 million vehicles by 2025 from 4 million in 2019 – and down from the 5 million per year targeted by Ghosn in 2017. Half of new launches will be electrified, manufacturing will be simplified, and Renault will also focus on areas like car sharing and ride hailing, with the aim of deriving a fifth of revenues from these mobility services by 2030. De Meo ruled out further job cuts, beyond the 15,000 it earmarked last year over the next 2 to 3 years. But he hiked cost savings goals, with an extra 500 million euros ($608 million) planned to reach 2.5 billion euros by 2023, and then 3 billion euros by 2025. Investors were initially unimpressed, with Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois describing profit goals as “underwhelming,” reflecting the “depth of challenges at Renault.” Shares had largely recovered by 1153 GMT, trading down 0.3%. Underscoring attempts at a fresh start for its troubled alliance with Nissan, Renault included a video message in its presentation from the Japanese carmaker’s boss Makoto Uchida, who gave the plan his thumbs up. Under De Meo’s efficiency drive, Renault will build vehicles on fewer shared platforms to pare back costs by 600 euros per car by 2023, and aim to cut development time for new vehicles by a year, to under 3 years. The 53-year old’s shift to a more electric lineup will include building a battery plant in France with one of the company’s suppliers, while the company is working on partnerships in areas like technology. “We’ll move from a car company working with tech to a tech company working with cars,” De Meo said. Renault aims to lift operating margins to 5% by 2023. It also plans to lower capital spending and research costs to 8% of revenue from 10% by 2025. Together, these measures should lower Renault’s break-even point by 30% by 2023. The company has yet to publish margins for 2020, though following the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted operations, they are likely to be lower than the 4.8% hit in 2019. Renault also said it was targeting automotive free cash flow of 3 billion euros by 2023, and 6 billion by 2025. “The commitment to short-term cash targets is positive as it remains the key concern for investors,” Citibank analysts wrote in a client note. Renault said it had drawn an additional chunk of its 5-billion-euro government-guaranteed loan secured early in the COVID-19 crisis. The company said it would combine all its sports car efforts into one unit “dedicated to developing exclusive and innovative” vehicles, with Formula One racing “at the heart of the project.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/times-filipinos-acted-issues-yearend-2020/","title":"Pandemic can’t stop bayanihan: How Filipinos took action on urgent issues in 2020","date":"Dec 31, 2020 1:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Here's a glimpse of how Filipinos showcased the power of a community working together during a difficult year","body":"From leading relief initiatives following the Taal Volcano eruption to storming the streets to protest the anti-terror law, Filipinos showed how their bayanihan spirit remains intact even as they faced their own personal challenges. A Filipino trait defined as working together towards a shared cause, the bayanihan spirit was on full display in the country in 2020, when it was needed most.  As the pandemic forced people to stay at home, many turned to social media to find ways to help, crowdsource information, hold government accountable, and mobilize online communities to take action. Others staged campaigns nationwide to make their voices heard and also to aid fellow Filipinos. Here are some of the instances when Filipinos showcased the power of a community working together in 2020. On the second week of 2020, Taal Volcano erupted, marking the first of several disasters witnessed by the country this year. Many families were displaced and also lost their livelihood.  This triggered an outswelling of support and relief from various groups who led donation drives, organized feeding initiatives for displaced families, conducted psychosocial debriefing for traumatized victims, and led volunteer efforts for stranded animals. Help came from people from all walks of life, including street vendors in Sto Tomas, Batangas, who gave up a day of their income to feed evacuees at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Others assisted using social media and digital platforms to organize information. They created a basic map and web application to show locations of active evacuation centers to help donors see where to bring relief, among others. This outpouring of bayanihan efforts from Filipinos was not only seen in the aftermath of the Taal Volcano eruption but also in subsequent disasters, particularly when the Philippines faced the wrath of 5 tropical cyclones in a span of just 3 weeks from late October to November. Parts of the country were still reeling from Super Typhoon Rolly, when When Typhoon Ulysses struck the Philippines in November. At the height of Ulysses, several Filipinos posted desperate calls for rescue and relief on social media as flood waters rose as high as the second floor of houses in parts of Marikina and Rizal. Targeting to organize these calls for help for quicker response, Rappler’s civic engagement arm MovePH called for online volunteers to help scour and verify these pleas on social media. With at least 1,000 volunteers responding to the call, MovePH amplified verified reports on its social media platforms and brought them to the attention of the Office of Civil Defense, and Red Cross Philippines, among others. Two days after calling for volunteers, MovePH,  with its network, was able to monitor more than 1,600 reports for rescue and relief from Marikina, Rizal, Bulacan, Cagayan, and other parts of Luzon. Other Filipinos were also quick to come together online and consolidate relief efforts, following the successive disasters. With the outpouring of initiatives, several youth organizations banded together, also through social media. to consolidate rescue efforts, load requests, and relief drives for hard-hit communities. The aftermath of Typhoon Ulysses showed the gaps in the government’s disaster response especially as local governments appealed for rescue boats, and photos of submerged houses went viral on social media. This  sparked online discussions on the need for better, coordinated disaster response from the national government. When President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration lagged behind in cushioning the blow of the pandemic on the economy and aresting the spike in coronavirus cases, citizens worked together and looked for solutions. These included relief drives for those in need and  online campaigns calling for mass testing and setting up temporary bike lanes. Though well-intentioned, these initiatives were sometimes struck down by the very government whose efforts the groups were trying to augment.  At the onset of the community quarantines in the Philippines, for instance, groups turned to social media to gather donations for vulnerable communities’ needs and frontliners’ personal protective equipment (PPE). The groups responded to the shortage of PPE and the struggles of affected sectors in Cagayan de Oro City, Leyte, and Batangas, among areas. Restaurants, bakeries, and even retail stores donated food, relief packs, and health kits to frontliners and affected families.  Seeing this, the Department of Social Welfare and Development in April initially urged those leading donation drives to get a permit and pay fees prior to launching their efforts. The department withdrew the reminder after a massive backlash and said it will review the guidelines on public solicitation and make the process “more responsive to the emergency situation.” There were also those who used digital platforms to lead free ride-sharing initiatives using hashtags #pickupCOVID19PH and #INeedARide after the suspension of public transport made it difficult for health workers, hospital staff, and employees to go to work. Initially starting out as a Facebook group for people to share tips on running errands during the pandemic, Quarantine Tribute Tips quickly grew into a thriving community of action. Throughout the pandemic, it had used its strong following to gather donations and bring relief to marginalized groups such as jeepney drivers, after coming across their viral stories online. Various organizations and individuals also sought to help in pandemic response by volunteering their skills to crowdsource reports online, organize information and data, and make innovative programs. Information hub Help from Home, for instance, sought to compile initiatives helping frontliners and communities in one platform. To help people be more informed about the Philippines’ budget allocation and spending for pandemic response, a group of volunteers took the initiative to collate and visualize government data through the Citizens’ Budget Tracker website. Inspired by their idols, K-pop fans in the Philippines have also used their huge fan following to help disaster victims as well as those affected by the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, young Filipinos have brought to light sexual harassment in schools, called out red-tagging officials, and the flaws in the country’s shift to distance learning. Student governments of 4 major universities in Metro Manila even submitted to the Commission on Higher Education in  March a petition calling for the suspension of online classes nationwide after several student groups aired their concerns about transitioning to e-learning in the middle of an pandemic. Forced to keep up despite their circumstances, many students were left to fend for themselves and ask for donations under online campaign #PisoParaSaLaptop. In a bid to help these students, MovePH took on the campaign in August and helped promote the stories of students in need using its wide-reaching platforms. With the help of generous donors and our partners, MovePH raised at least P1,074,502.19 and supported more than 70 students by October 1. Although affected by the flaws in distance learning as well, several students have also sought to help each other through internet and radio initiatives they’ve led themselves. Going beyond these donation drives, students across the country came together to demand a national academic break in the wake of several disasters that wrecked people’s homes and hampered their access to internet connection and electricity. Students did not only mobilize for matters involving distance learning in 2020. Taking off from the viral hashtag #HijaAko where netizens called out victim blaming, students coined hashtags for their respective schools to expose sexual misconduct they experienced in their campus and demand safer learning environments from their administration.  The online campaigns have pushed school administrations to act on sexual harassment in schools and draft policies to further protect students. Being outspoken, however, has made student activists especially prone to red-tagging.  The enactment of the anti-teror law heightened concerns over the dangers of red-tagging. Students were at the helm of the protest movement against the law, which many fear will clamp down on Filipinos’ basic rights. Seeking to fight the controversial measure, many led online campaigns such as a Change.org petition calling to #JunkTerrorBill that has so far collected more than 940,000 signatures. Others also showed their opposition through an email protest to senators, Department of Justice officials, and Malacañang officials. These efforts are on top of rallies held nationwide. Despite the people’s clamor, lawmakers passed the anti-terror bill in July. When lawmakers kept dragging their feet on renewing ABS-CBN’s franchise, Filipinos sought ways to keep the embattled media network on air. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) even held weekly Friday protests and submitted a 200,000-signatory petition to the Senate and House of Representatives in February to call on the government to renew ABS-CBN’s franchise. Celebrities and online personalities have voiced their thoughts on the matter. Lawmakers’ delay in tackling the franchise renewal led to ABS-CBN shutting down radio and television operations on May 5, following a cease and desist order from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). The media network’s congressional franchise had expired the day before. Days after ABS-CBN was forced to go off air for the first time since Martial Law, several campus publications and organizations worked together in launching a Change.org petition to bring back ABS-CBN. MovePH, meanwhile, led an online campaign encouraging Filipinos to tag their representatives and use the hashtag #CourageON. Across social media, many Filipinos jumped on the trend to urge lawmakers to tackle the matter and bring ABS-CBN back on the air. While some representatives took note of the request, an overwhelming majority of the House committee on legislative franchises rejected the bills seeking to grant ABS-CBN a fresh franchise in July. These are just some of the many moments where Filipinos tapped into their bayanihan spirit to make real change in communities. Throughout 2020, many used social media and hashtags to bring attention to and start smart discussions on national issues such as  #FreePride20 and #ReleaseCebu7. Another is #Halalan2022 which Filipinos used to encourage people to register for the 2022 elections. Filipinos have long shown that they are capable of innovative solutions and aiding the marginalized, especially in the face of crises. While commendable, it also bears noting how many have had to rely on their fellow citizens to address their own needs.  The bayanihan exemplified by Filipinos to help fill in big gaps in the government’s response to the pandemic and disasters shows that more can be done in making these solutions sustainable and for government to learn from, and listen to, its own people. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-backed-gig-worker-initiative-wins-in-california/","title":"Uber-backed gig worker initiative wins in California – US media","date":"Nov 4, 2020 5:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Some 58% of voters backed a proposition exempting ride share firms like Uber and Lyft from treating drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors","body":"California voters put the brakes on Tuesday, November 3, on a state law forcing ride share firms like Uber and Lyft to treat their drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors. Some 58% of voters backed a proposition exempting the firms, which will instead provide some benefits but ones that fall short of those given to traditional employees. The measure divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others enjoy the flexibility of being able to work when they choose to pick up extra income. Uber driver Erica Mighetto campaigned against the proposition. “I’m among tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of drivers who are devastated by this outcome,” Mighetto told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by the fact that billionaire corporations can buy their ways out of laws. More than $200 million was spent on Proposition 22, in what is reported to be the most spent on an initiative before voters in the state. Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86% worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model. Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. An appeals court recently rejected a bid by Uber and Lyft to avoid having to treat drivers as employees while battling the California labor law. A Proposition 22 victory would render that court ruling moot. The exemption to the labor law also applies to food delivery apps such as DoorDash. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/investors-load-funds-uber-freight-october-2-2020/","title":"Investors load $500 million into Uber’s trucking business","date":"Oct 3, 2020 7:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber says it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation","body":"Uber on Friday, October 2, said an investment group led by Greenbriar Equity is pumping $500 million into its trucking unit. The preferred stock financing values Uber Freight at $3.3 billion, and comes as the San Francisco-based company’s core ride-sharing service is stalled due to the pandemic. Uber Freight matches truckers to shippers in much the way the ride service connects passengers with drivers in the so-called on-demand economy. While Uber’s ride service has suffered due to people hunkering down or being reluctant to get into cars with strangers due to COVID-19 risk, the freight unit, which launched in 2017, has grown. “We have led the industry with technology, transforming dated and analog processes to ensure that both shippers and carriers are equipped to succeed in a rapidly changing industry,” said Uber Freight chief Lior Ron. Uber said it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation. “We are excited to support Uber Freight in the next stage of its development,” said Greenbriar managing partner Michael Weiss. “We believe that carriers and shippers will be increasingly attracted to the convenience and simplicity that Uber Freight offers in a complex marketplace.” Greenbriar has been involved in the logistics sector for decades and brings expertise that Uber Freight can tap into, Weiss added. Uber reported a $1.8-billion loss in the 2nd quarter of this year as the COVID-19 pandemic caused its shared-ride business revenue to plunge. Meanwhile, California has filed lawsuits against Uber and Lyft for alleged wage theft by misclassifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, in violation of a recently enacted state law. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash are backing a state ballot initiative in November’s election which would classify rideshare drivers and other gig-economy workers as independent contractors, while offering certain benefits such as minimum wage, sick leave, and workers’ compensation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-former-security-chief-charged-for-alleged-cover-up-hack/","title":"Uber’s former security chief charged for allegedly covering up 2016 hack","date":"Aug 21, 2020 6:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Aside from obstruction of justice, Joseph Sullivan is also charged with misprision of a felony, which meant he knew of the 2016 data breach and tried to hide it","body":"The former security chief of ride-sharing company Uber has been charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly covering up a data breach the company suffered in 2016, the US Department of Justice announced Thursday, August 20, US time. Joseph Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer from April 2015 to November 2017, allegedly tried to hide the October 2016 data breach, which affected some 57 million Uber riders and drivers, and was only revealed in November 2017. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data without telling riders or drivers who had their information compromised. Aside from obstruction of justice, Sullivan was also charged with misprision of a felony, which meant he knew of the breach and tried to hide it. Sullivan faces up to 5 years in prison for the obstruction charge, and up to 3 years for the misprision charge. Speaking to The Verge via email, Sullivan’s spokesman Bradford Williams said there was “no merit” to the charges against his client, noting Sullivan is “a respected cybersecurity expert and former Assistant U.S. Attorney.” Sullivan is currently the chief security officer at Cloudflare.

They must be able to adapt and innovate quickly to continue operating and to also, protect the jobs of their workforce,' says the QBO director","body":"  Philippine startup incubator QBO Innovation Hub is holding a special competition this year for startups who may have innovative solutions in fighting the coronavirus: RESQUE: Startups vs. COVID-19 Competition.  In partnership with Youth Business International (YBI), and supported by Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, the program wants to find solutions that will help micro, small, and medium enterprises pivot to, and survive the new normal brought about by the virus.  The 3-month contest seeks to address issues such as  loss of employment, restoration of the economy, and the creation of new opportunities for growth and development. There are 2 categories in the contest: 1) COVID-19 solutions for startups with innovative solutions, products, and/or services that directly tackle COVID-related challenges. 2) Sustainable pivots for startups that adapt and secure sustainability through pivot strategies amid the crisis.  10 winners will receive a cash prize of P100,000, and will receive 2 months of mentorship from entrepreneurs and industry experts.  This global program, in which QBO is the local partner, is led by YBI, which is an organization supporting young businesses. Anita Tiessen, the CEO of YBI, says,“The world is changing dramatically from day to day and I feel deeply for business owners everywhere, especially those running smaller businesses and are from underserved communities, who are often least able to bear the economic shocks of this crisis.” The organization is looking to support about 200,000 small and medium enterprises worldwide through this viral downturn.  To give us a better picture of the issues facing startups now, and what they’re looking for in the contest, we talked to QBO’s director Katrina Chan.  How has the pandemic affected the startup sector in the Philippines?  Apart from the disruption in their offline operations, there is, of course, a financial impact on our startups. This was determined in the Philippine Startup Survey 2020 recently released by the Department of Trade and Industry, PwC, QBO, and IdeaSpace Foundation conducted among 90 startup founders. 64% will need P5 million in the next 12 months to get back to their normal operations while less than 20% of the startups have enough cash and capacity to sustain the business for more than 12 months.  While the statistics are alarming, the pandemic has also put some startups to their capacity because their services were needed to make the ECQ effective. 21% of the founders also said that there was an increase in the demand for their business. These are mostly startups from the logistics, education technology, enterprise services, financial technology, and healthcare sectors.  What opportunities are there for startups given the current situation?  The COVID-19 pandemic has posed not only challenges to businesses but also opportunities, especially to tech/digitally-enabled entities like Filipino startups. This is a chance for them to pivot their strategies, and maximize the power of tech of which they are known for, for the new reality we’re all in.  There are also opportunities to network, learn new business strategies and skills, gain mentorship and even financial assistance in order to cope. RESQUE: Startups vs Covid Competition is just one of the many opportunities that we, at QBO, aim to provide startups with COVID-19 related solutions or business pivots during the pandemic.  Other than that, we have a continuous lineup of webinars, or what we call QLITAN sessions, where we invite industry experts so startup founders can learn from each other. We also have incubation programs in place to help them even during the pandemic — these opportunities are out there and we believe, with strong government and private sector support, Filipino startups can still thrive during and even after the pandemic.  What advice would you share with prospective startups that want to build something great even during these challenging times?  Take advantage of opportunities available to you in order to bring your ideas to life. For startups, look for ways to network and learn new things and strategies. Study the market very well and aim to provide products or services that will make lives easier during this pandemic and even after. Businesses are opening their eyes to the need for digital transformation and are embracing working with new players.  The landscape is changing because of the changing consumer behaviors as well — it pays to know what your consumers need at this time and pivot to that. We’ve observed confidence in the growth of startups in the following sectors: logistics, education technology, enterprise services, financial technology, and healthcare sectors — because their products/services are greatly needed at this time. Startups will be key to creating the new world, the ‘new normal’ and can build momentum even in these challenging times.  Don’t let the pandemic stop you from innovating: there are opportunities like RESQUE, as well as mentorship sessions and incubation programs with QBO that you can join.  What does RESQUE aspire to do for startups in the coronavirus era?  RESQUE: Startups vs. COVID-19 Competition is a nationwide startup competition led by QBO after it has been named as Youth Business International’s delivery partner in the Philippines, with funding from Google.org, Google’s philanthropic arm. It aims to develop and deliver an urgent package of support to struggling local businesses during these uncertain times.  By opening this competition, we hope to inspire Filipino startups with innovative COVID-19-related solutions and products as well as those who have made sustainable pivots amid the crisis to continue innovating and creating ideas that will be useful at this time.  Apart from the grant of P100,000 each that will be awarded to the winning startups, there is a holistic package included in the rapid response and recovery program such as crisis helplines, targeted advice and online training through webinars and mentoring. This is a rare chance for the growth and development of their startup, which includes capacity building programs, 2 months of mentoring, education, and international exposure with the support of YBI and Google.org.  Select Google employees will also devote their time to mentor the winners. All these will aim to provide the startups the help they need to not only weather the COVID-19 storm, but also thrive after it.  What would you advise those looking for these COVID-19 solutions?  We would advise startups to review their business’ core competency: where, through their products and services, can they provide solutions. For this competition, we have identified 3 themes in which startups can aid and provide COVID-19 solutions based on the impact of the pandemic. These themes are: 1) Addressing the loss of employment; 2) restoration of the economy; and 3) creation of new opportunities for growth and development. What is the importance of these “sustainable pivots for startups,” which is one of the two categories for the contest?  The ability of the startups to pivot is crucial for them to remain afloat during this time. They must be able to adapt and innovate quickly to continue operating and to also, protect the jobs of their workforce. Sustainable pivots, as we’ve seen, have also opened doors for many startups to help Filipinos who are at the brink of losing their jobs.  An example would be Angkas with the introduction of Angkas Food where riders were given the chance to keep their jobs by pivoting to providing food delivery service from ride-sharing, which is strictly prohibited now. This is just an example of a startup innovating in order to remain meaningful and relevant at this time while ensuring business continuity.  Loss of employment, restoration of the economy, creating new opportunities – these are, of course, very tough problems.  What message would you want to give those looking to join that will help inspire them?  Startups are at a very good position to make a difference at this time because they are tech-enabled. This is a playing field that they know how to navigate and so hope that they see this pandemic as an opportunity to create ideas that can ultimately make lives easier. This competition is a way to inspire them to go out there, showcase their solutions and their business pivots, so we can help them to continue innovating and even thrive despite challenging times. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/264235-father-son-headed-work-arrested-backriding/","title":"Father and son headed to work arrested for backriding in Pangasinan","date":"Jun 19, 2020 9:44 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) 'Wala kaming masakyan papasok, kaya nag-angkas kami. Wala na kaming pambili ng pagkain,' says Pedro Mones, who works at a construction site with his son","body":" PANGASINAN, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A father and son were arrested in Villasis town on Thursday, June 18, for sharing a motorcycle on their way to work. Pedro Mones and son Paulo – both construction workers – shared a motorcycle ride from their home in Barangay Unzad in Villasis town, and were headed to their work site when police arrested them for violating quarantine rules set by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). (Editor’s Note: The subjects’ surname was earlier spelled as Munez. This has been corrected.) The policy bans motorcycle backriding since physical distancing cannot be practiced, and applies even to those who live in the same home. Some local governments have appealed the policy. (READ: Frontliners in a bind: Health workers fined P5,000 for backriding) Pedro explained that there was no other public transportation available and they had to get to work to put food on the table. “Wala kaming masakyan papasok kaya nag-angkas kami. Wala na kaming pambili ng pagkain (We couldn’t get any public transportation so we shared a ride. We have no more money to buy food),”  Pedro said.  Villasis police chief Major Fernando Fernandez, however, was adamant on the policy.  “Ang motor, mahigpit na ipinagbabawal na may sakay sa likod. May ordinansa sa Villasis na ang violation sa quarantine guidelines ay hindi hihigit sa 3 oras ng pagkakakulong at hindi hihigit sa 3 oras na community service.” (We strictly prohibit backriding on motorcycles. Villasis has an ordinance in which violators of quarantine guidelines will be jailed for no more than 3 hours, and will have to do community service for no more than 3 hours.)  The Moneses were later released after serving time for 3 hours and rendering 3 hours of community service. After we earlier reported that they wished they had bicycles to use instead, several readers, as well as the Office of Vice President Leni Robredo, inquired how they could help the father and son.  “Tatlong oras sa kulungan, tatlong oras din sa community service. Hindi na po pinagmumulta o kakasuhan ayon sa ordinansa. Naglinis po sila ng paligid, tapos pinakawalan na po sila,” Fernandez said on Friday. (They spent 3 hours in jail, 3 hours of community service. They weren’t fined, they weren’t charged according to the ordinance. They cleaned the surroundings, then they were freed.) The father and son were so distraught, they didn’t go to work on Friday. “’Yung anak ko hindi pumasok. Natakot ‘ata. Nagtanim na lang ako kanina. Hindi muna ako pumasok dahil sa nangyari (My son didn’t report for work. He was traumatized. I just planted today, I didn’t go to work either after what happened),” Pedro said. Double standards  Bayan Pangasinan spokesperson Eco Dangla pointed out the double standards in the Moneses’ predicament.  “Kapag ordinaryong mamamayan, kulong agad pero kapag si Koko Pimentel, Mocha, at Debold may ‘compassion’ at nababali ang batas (Ordinary citizens get jailed immediately, but if it’s Koko Pimentel, Mocha Uson, or Debold Sinas, there’s ‘compassion,’ and the law is bent in their favor),” Dangla said in a Facebook post. All 3 public officials mentioned violated quarantine guidelines. Senator Koko Pimentel went around Makati City and even accompanied his wife to the hospital despite having flu symptoms, and then learned he was positive for COVID-19 while he was out. Uson, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) Deputy Administator, held a gathering of over 300 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Batangas, while Metro Manila police chief Major General Debold Sinas allowed a birthday celebration for him in Camp Crame attended by dozens of cops. None of them were arrested or even reprimanded. – Rappler.com Those who have expressed their wish to send assistance to Pedro and Paulo Mones can do so through Cebuana Lhuillier Pera Padala or Palawan Express Pera Padala. Recipient details: Regina Tugadi, mobile 0965-550-0898.

I can’t bike while standing, or with one hand only, or while keeping a conversation. Basically I can’t bike and do something else properly – so I focus on the road. I’m probably that biker you honked at because I was slow at gaining my momentum after the light turned green. Or maybe I was too slow on an uphill? I’m probably that biker who jerked sideways after you honked too close and too loud. Worse, I’m probably that biker you almost hit because you couldn’t wait two seconds for me to change gears and gain my momentum, so you just overtook me. (READ: City cycling? Here’s a guide to choosing your first commuter bike) I’m probably that biker who almost fell into the gutter because you hogged the right side, because fuck it, that’s your blind side right? No one should use that side. I’m probably that biker you tried to scare by driving too close despite the clear wide road, just for the heck of it. It worked by the way; I was terrified and wondered the whole day if we actually knew each other, and maybe I’d wronged you so you were getting back at me. Yep, I’m probably that biker. But I hope you aren’t that jeepney who tried to scare me, or that big black SUV who overtook me after a stoplight, or that nice sedan who hogs the right side unreasonably, or that cab who honks aggressively while on slow, uphill traffic. But if you are, I sincerely hope you reconsider your actions. I understand that I am super annoying too – lane splitting, overtaking tight spots, or even counterflowing! Believe me when I say that I was forced to do it, and would not be so brave to defy traffic rules, and risk my safety and those around me if it weren’t for certain circumstances. (READ: [OPINION] Metro Manila can be bike-friendly) I was in the middle because I couldn’t transfer to the right side, because some truck wouldn’t let me pass after I crossed from the other side of the road. I was lane splitting because some Mazda hogged the right side. I was counterflowing because that’s what the enforcer gestured. I was overtaking because the taxi in front of me suddenly came to a full stop and opened his door. But let’s say I was really in the wrong – I’m sorry. Can you please not get even by putting me in a precarious situation? It is exactly because you are big, and you are 4 wheels, that you bear bigger responsibility on the road. To whom much (wheels) is given, much (responsibility) is expected.  Imagine if I accidentally hit your car vs you hitting me on my bike. You could kill me instantly, and even run away from the responsibility. The worst I could do to you is be an inconvenience, as I can’t even hit and run. I will do my best to be predictable on the road. I will pay utmost attention when riding. I will follow traffic rules and regulations. So please be a dear, and be an ate or kuya on the road. II. Dear fellow cyclists, I know it is easy to think of other vehicles as the inconsiderate and selfish ones on the road. Why can’t they just let us pass – we will only take a few seconds, or a little space, right? But friends, if we want our share of the road, we must also have a share of the responsibilities to keep it safe for all. To do this, keep in mind the following: At the end of the day, we all just want to get to our home safely and quickly. May we do so responsibly. And in case we encounter rogue drivers, let us not wish them accidents or ill intentions, but care to educate them instead. If we treat others on the roads as enemies, we really are bound to make enemies. Ride responsibly, and share the road. – Rappler.com Arlet Villanueva is part of the Facebook group Bike to Work Pilipinas, which advocates biking as a form of commuting in the Metro.

This new measure implemented strict quarantine procedures, suspension of transportation services, and regulation of food and essential health services, among others. Additional travel restrictions were rolled out while local governments across the capital region moved to implement an 8 pm to 5 am curfew in their respective areas. While the tactic is supported by experts, frontliners struggled with the national government’s lack of immediate and timely transport solutions for those who are required to report to work.  It was only on the day after President Rodrigo Duterte implemented the enhanced community quarantine when the Department of Transportation reactively set up free bus rides around Metro Manila for health workers.  However, even with this added provisions, frontliners and healthcare workers said that it does not fully satisfy the demand for transportation. (READ: Groups providing transportation services for frontliners)  Hoping to address this issue, spoken word poet Juan Miguel Severo introduced #INeedARide on Twitter to match people who need a ride to go to their workplace with volunteers who can accommodate these requests. {source} <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Dear health workers/anyone whose work isn&#39;t suspended today:<br><br>If you need a ride, please reply to this thread with <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/INeedARide?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#INeedARide</a> and your route.<br><br>If you&#39;re a private citizen w/ car whose willing to drop them off, check hashtag to see you can accommodate someone.<br><br>Let&#39;s do this.</p>&mdash; Juan Miguel Severo (@TheRainBro) <a href=”https://twitter.com/TheRainBro/status/1239790272004804608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>March 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script> {/source} Most of the Twitter users who used the hashtags are healthcare workers who need to get to hospitals for their duty.

Reyes Memorial Medical Center (JRRMMC) were already part of her daily sacrifice. But with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines and the subsequent lockdown of Metro Manila and the island of Luzon, Cristy also has to contend with the daily risk of being infected. After all, having to take 6 public utility vehicles each day just to reach her destination and get back home exposes her to these risks. Cristy said she does not want to harm herself, her loved ones, and patients at the 75-year-old hospital, many of them coming from Manila’s poorest communities. As of Monday, March 16, there has been no confirmed case in their hospital just two minutes away from the Department of Health (DOH) headquarters.   But self-quarantine – usually lasting 14 days – is almost out of the question, given the already thin workforce and the vague assurances of assistance from no less than the DOH. There’s little comfort, aggravated by the measly salaries of government nurses that range from P19,000 to P25,000, depending on salary grade. “Walang malinaw na alituntunin regarding sa leave credits kung ma-quarantine kami,” she said. “Walang sinasabi kung ito po ba ay ibabawas sa current numbers namin o hindi. Paano kung mag-positive kami?“ (There are no clear guidelines regarding our leave credits if we go on self-quarantine. They don’t tell us if it’s going to be deducted from our current number or not, What if we get the virus?) At JRRMMC, where there are 485 doctors and 366 nurses, hospital staff have also been asked to improvise with their protective gears. Cristy said they were told to transform cloth like linen into face masks, even if there has been no evidence of it being a sufficient protection against the virus. Still, it’s better than wearing nothing while dealing with patients every day.  “Kami na ang hahanap ng paraan kasi iyong government, hanggang salita ang ginagawa nila, hindi sila gumagawa ng action para bigyan kami ng sinasabi nilang sapat na supply,” Cristy said. (We are the ones looking for ways to address the problem because the government, they’re all talk, they don’t do anything to give us enough supply.) “Paano kung magkasakit kami, paano iyong pamilya namin, makakasigurado ba kami na mapapakain sila ng tatlong beses sa isang araw?” she said. “Hindi naman makatarungan ito.“ (What if we get sick? How about our families? Are there assurances from the government that they will be fed 3 times a day? This is not fair.) Cristy, unfortunately, is not alone in her predicament; nor is her experience unique. Health workers on the frontlines across the Philippines are put in a perilous situation where compromise and sacrifice are the name of the game, for the benefit of the public they serve.   Philippine General Hospital   A little over 5 kilometers away from JRRMMC is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the country’s largest government health facilities, where long lines at the outpatient department or the crowded emergency room and wards are a common sight. PGH, after all, is where many of the country’s indigents flock to, braving long commutes from their provinces to get much needed medical assistance. On average, the PGH outpatient department sees around 3,000 patients a day. On an annual basis, the hospital services at least 600,000 to 800,000 patients. On Tuesday morning, March 17, nurse Marie (not her real name) finished her 12-hour overnight duty and stepped out into a city where mass transportation is prohibited, in accordance with the enhanced community quarantine that President Rodrigo Duterte declared the day before. It had been a long night for Marie, who handles patients under investigation (PUIs) for novel coronavirus at PGH. She is one of the only 3 nurses per 12-hour shift in her group that receives patients referred to by the ER staff.  As of posting, PGH has had one confirmed case, 8 admitted PUIs, and had already sent home 34 PUIs showing mild symptoms. That night, Marie handled a patient who tested negative.  She just wanted to go home and prepare until her next shift in two days. Yet the jeepneys and buses that normally traverse Taft Avenue and contribute to the usual traffic were nowhere to be seen.  Marie tried hailing cabs, as ride-sharing applications didn’t work, but not one wanted to give her a ride home out of fear of being apprehended by authorities. Philippine National Police Chief General Archie Gamboa had ordered the arrest of “disobedient” drivers. Local government units were given the responsibility of setting up transportation for health workers in their jurisdiction. But during the first 7 hours of the lockdown, no help was in sight, at least at PGH. Fortunately, before giving up hope and starting what could be a two-hour walk, a tricycle driver took pity and offered his services. But he could only take Marie until Welcome Rotonda, the border between Quezon City and Manila. She held her breath throughout the 5.9-kilometer ride inside the clanky metal sidecar, through roads not normally meant for tricycles, away from the eyes of law enforcers. “Hindi lang life ko ang at risk, pati ang buhay niya kasi sobrang delikado iyong ginawa namin, pero ang hirap na kasi, baka gusto rin kasi niya kumita (We placed both our lives at risk because it was very dangerous, but it’s so hard, and maybe he wanted income),” she said. Getting home should have been the least concern for Marie, or any of the health workers. But the latest pronouncements of the national government that caused confusion among many Filipinos have been an added burden to the frontliners. “Nagpapatupad sila ng protocols na walang proper guidelines (They implemented protocols without proper guidelines), we’re left and living in the dark,” she said. “We don’t know how we’ll get to work, how we’ll get home, and how we’ll be safe in between.”   Only line of defense  If the serious lack of proper guidelines wasn’t enough, public hospitals also have to face and deal with long-standing issues that should have been better handled by the national government.  The problems – from lack of basic medical supplies to understaffed health facilities – become all the more glaring and hard to ignore amid the novel coronavirus outbreak that is threatening the nation. Marie recalled how during the first few days of the outbreak, fear was palpable among health workers in PGH buildings that had previously seen the horrors of World War II. There was a general lack of information on the novel coronavirus that had already affected thousands in several countries, especially China.  “After the news na sa floor namin na-admit yung isang PUI, it was scary,” she said. “We have general information about it pero iyong kung gaano katagal nag-stay sa air, parang sobrang limited ang information kasi bago pa iyong virus.” (After the news that the first PUI was admitted in our floor, it was scary because we didn’t know how it was transmitted. We have general information about it but information on how it stays in the air, things like that, were so limited because the virus was still new.) Aside from the vague protocols, especially on how to handle patients suffering from the virus, personal protective equipment (PPEs) were running low. Their supplies had been almost depleted in the aftermath of the Taal eruption. In the beginning, they were given two face masks to be used for one week. Staff were eventually provided one box good for a week – at least 52 pieces to be shared by 3 nurses, two assistants, and one utility worker. “Protection-wise, hirap na hirap na kami kasi (we’re having a really hard time),” she said. “We’re worried that we’ll get sick or we might bring home this virus.” “We already are worrying about taking care of patients, tapos madadagdagan pa ng burden na hindi namin alam kung ang families ba namin ay safe at kung makakauwi ba kami sa kanila (Then there’s the added burden of making sure our families are safe and worrying if we’ll get home safe to them),” Marie added. With PPEs running low, it’s still vague for many health workers at PGH how they’ll go on in the coming days, as the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus is expected to rise.  “It’s very frustrating kasi walang guidelines, walang help from the government na nare-receive right now (no guidelines, no help from the government),” Marie said.  Mark (not his real name), a resident doctor at PGH who asked not to be named, said masks and alcohol are their “only line of defense at the moment.” “We are grateful for those who have donated, but there still remains a shortage of the said materials,” he said, adding that full gowns and headgears are reserved for workers directly supervising people suspected of carrying the virus.  Some organizations have taken it upon themselves to address the problem government health workers are facing.  The student council of the University of the Philippines Manila, the institution that operates PGH, started a donation drive for health masks and other basic hospital needs. (READ: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)   Not enough manpower Beyond the lack of basic supplies, one glaring characteristic of the country’s healthcare system is the lack of manpower.  There are about 721 public hospitals, with at least 3,131 doctors and 5,975 nurses. Many of them are underpaid, compared to their counterparts abroad, with an entry-level nurse earning P15,000. The current roster pegs the ratio of government doctors to population at 1:33,909 – far from the ideal 1:20,000 – and 1:17,769 for nurses. “Some of our colleagues have fallen ill and are warranted to go on a 14-day quarantine, thinning out our workforce,” Mark said, adding that this has pushed residents to their limit. On a normal day, there are about 10 nurses assigned at the PGH ER while the number of doctors varies, depending on the day’s load.  The management suspended its outpatient services to deploy some workers to other wards. It has also welcomed over 100 interns who volunteered, despite an earlier suspension of internship programs. The mass transportation may lead to more problems, however. In fact, two of Marie’s colleagues were barred from crossing the QC-Manila border even if they showed their IDs. They were just told by authorities to walk the distance to PGH – a near-impossible task as much as it was ridiculous, especially under the heat of the sun. In the end, they were left with no choice but to go home, possibly missing a day’s wage. Helping themselves In Quezon City, health department head Dr Esperanza Arias said that hospitals are augmenting their staff by pulling in personnel from other departments. They are filling in the slots left by those assigned to an isolated area where patients suspected of having the coronavirus are being held. The city was also able to procure several PPEs before the threats of the virus increased in the metro.  “Sabi namin, kumuha na kami kasi (We said we should already get because) if we will not be able to use them now, we will still find use for it, in case,” she said. Local governments outside Luzon are also preparing for a possible increase in confirmed cases.  Beyond Metro Manila Dr Leonell Quitos is no stranger to the issues faced by government hospitals, having just completed his fellowship in Adult Infectious Diseases at PGH in 2019.  The 33-year-old is now on the frontlines as the only infectious diseases specialist in Iligan City in Northern Mindanao, doing his best – along with at least 300 doctors – to protect a population of at least 342,618 people against the coronavirus. “Iyong problems noon, nakikita ko pa rin ngayon (The problems I saw then, I still see today),” he said.  As the city is placed under a state of calamity over its first confirmed case, Quitos and his colleagues are working double time to manage the situation, including a plan to set up a hospital solely for suspect cases. On top of doing rounds, Quitos has been reaching out to officials to see their plans through.  He takes calls from colleagues and even the occasional media while driving to meetings – one of the few moments he’s free.  “Sama-sama natin tapusin itong problema (Let’s work together to end this problem), they will be properly compensated,” he added, urging doctors and workers to join them. Megan (not her real name), a health practitioner also in Iligan City meanwhile, said doctors are trying to raise funds to be able to buy them in bulk for distribution to all health workers. “The implication is the fear, especially if you don’t have masks or alcohol, some doctors are thinking of not holding clinic hours anymore, including those who are not working directly with departments against the virus but are still exposed nonetheless,” she said.   Too many lives at stake There is much to be desired in the way the Philippine health system is handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the ball is in the court of the national government.  On Twitter, PGH consultant neurosurgeon Dr Ronnie Baticulon acknowledged that many health workers are afraid of what could possibly happen in the near future because they’ve seen this health care system let them down before.  “Too much, too many lives are at stake,” he wrote.  Marie of PGH will go on shift Thursday. To avoid more problems, she already asked help from her barangay, requesting a shuttle service to her hospital. But not all have the same cooperative and helpful local officials. To address this, PGH started a carpool system. Dormitories have already been prepared for some health workers, though Marie admits that it will most likely not benefit all those in need.  But she said PGH is now handling the situation better than before, even without direct help from the national government. For Cristy of JRRMMC, however, the following days don’t show reason for optimism.  “Ina-accommodate namin pa rin ang mga taong pumupunta sa ospital as much as possible, kahit kami mismo hirap na hirap na rin, kasi pasyente iyan eh na dapat bigyan ng treatment na nararapat sa kanila,” she said.  “Pero gustuhin man namin na ibigay ang lahat, hindi namin kayang kumilos na 100% kasi hindi sapat ang pangangailangan ng mga ospital.” (We accommodate those who go to the hospital as much as possible, even if we’re having difficulty, because those are patients who need treatment. But even if we want to give them our all, we can’t do so 100% because hospital supplies are inadequate.) Clearly they need help. – Rappler.com TOP PHOTO: ISOLATION.

The mobile fair is one of the biggest events worldwide to be canceled so far owing to the virus that has killed more than 1,100 people to date. The announcement came after the GSMA, the mobile trade association that organizes the annual show, met to decide the fate of the event that had been planned to run in Barcelona from February 24-27. “The GSMA has canceled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern, and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event,” a statement said. It added that the decision was made with “due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country,” and that host city parties understood the cancelation. Just hours before the meeting took place, Vodafone, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, Britain’s BT, and Rakuten of Japan had pulled out, following in the footsteps of Intel, Facebook, Cisco, and China’s Vivo.  A source close to the event had said that organizers were wary of being left with a cancelation bill of about 100 million euros ($110 million). They faced resistance from authorities about declaring a health emergency in Spain which would allow insurance to cover the costs. So far, Spain has only registered two confirmed cases of infection, on offshore islands. The annual congress normally draws more than 100,000 people, including between 5,000 and 6,000 participants from China, organizers say. But this year, participation was hammered by the viral outbreak which has infected around 44,600 people. ‘Working for months for nothing’   The decision is certain to be a major blow for Barcelona, as the huge trade show was forecast to bring in almost 500 million euros, organizers said. “It’s the high point of the year,” said Ignacio Arias, manager of the AC Som Marriott hotel which lies very close to the venue where the conference has been held since 2006.  “During the 4 days of the congress, the hotel is fully occupied with the highest rates of the year. There’s no other week like it,” he said, with his words echoed by fellow hoteliers. “We were supposed to host the team assembling Sony’s stand but they haven’t turned up. Ericsson has canceled 30 rooms, and Intel and LG have canceled their meeting rooms,” said the manager of another nearly hotel who did not want to give her name.  “It feels like we’ve been working for months for nothing. This year has been pretty sluggish so far and this is just going to finish us off.”  Ride-sharing firms were also on edge.  “This period accounts for 20% of our yearly income,” said Jose Maria Goni who runs Unauto, a fleet of vehicles for hire with drivers.  Trade shows have been hit by the virus on several continents, and while Asia’s biggest airshow in Singapore went forward nonetheless, more than 70 exhibitors canceled. ‘Epidemic of fear’   The cancelations began on February 4 when South Korea’s LG Electronics, which occupies one of the largest spaces at the show, said it was pulling out to “remove the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel…as the virus continues to spread across borders”. With the exception of Apple, most major smartphone manufacturers typically present their new products and innovations at the congress. Before the cancelation, China’s top smartphone maker Huawei as well as its smaller rival ZTE, had pledged their executives and staff would undergo a self-imposed two-week quarantine period, while ZTE said its stand and equipment would be disinfected daily.  The organizers had also sought to reassure exhibitors, saying they would step up security measures, impose restrictions on visitors from China, and have staff on hand to take visitors’ temperatures. But it wasn’t enough, and the trickle of withdrawals quickly turned into a deluge with dozens of companies pulling out of the show.  Regional health minister Alba Verges tried in vain to reassure participants on Wednesday, saying that the only epidemic in Barcelona “is an epidemic of fear.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/newsletters/249840-shock-awe-this-week-outlook-january-20-26-2020/","title":"Golpe de gulat: This week’s outlook","date":"Jan 21, 2020 1:08 PM PHT","snippet":"Golpe de gulat is the Duterte administration's tool in telling the business elite that their time is up, that the future belongs to a new oligarchy","body":"In case you missed my newsletter last week, here it is: Oh, Taal: This week’s outlook Not too long ago, President Rodrigo Duterte’s alter egos would dismiss his rants against groups and institutions as nothing but “golpe de gulat” – his penchant for shock-and-awe statements that should not alarm the public. In 2017, for instance, his economic managers tried to temper his rejection of aid from the European Union (EU) following the EU’s criticism of the Philippines’ drug war, saying in many words that he did not mean it.Lo and behold, a year later, the government formally rejected P380 million in aid from the EU. Golpe de gulat  thrives under this dispensation, and the first two weeks of 2020 reminded us of this again. It is its weapon of choice against the business elite that has perpetuated past regimes. It is its most effective tool in telling them that their time is up, that the future belongs to a new oligarchy. Let’s cite the most recent instances.  Note that this move to review all government contracts with the private sector was institutionalized on April 1, 2019 – at the height of the water crisis – during the Duterte Cabinet’s 36th meeting.All the signs are there: an old authoritarian playbook rolling out in the guise of a campaign for public interest, against corruption, and against the elite. When one acquiesces to abusive power, one tells power it can do more. That’s what the Yale historian Timothy Snyder wrote in one of the most popular readings in the last two years, On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century. Some of the lessons he enumerated are worth remembering. MUST REMEMBER ON TYRANNY Lesson 1: Do not obey in advance. “Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.” Lesson 2: Defend institutions. “It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak of ‘our institutions’ unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. They fall one after the other unless each is defended from the beginning. So choose an institution you care about – a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union – and take its side.” Lesson 10: Believe in truth. “To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.” Lesson 17: Listen for dangerous words. “Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal notions of emergency and exception. Be angry about treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.” THIS WEEK’S OUTLOOK  Taal Volcano enters its second week of unrest. As of Monday noon, January 20, Alert Level 4 remained, with experts saying that based on data, a hazardous eruption remains possible “within hours to days.” It’s tennis season this week as the Australian Open began Monday – amid smoke fears from the bushfires – with Naomi Osaka making a winning start to defend her title.The World Economic Forum is happening in Davos from Tuesday, January 21, to Friday, January 24.

The investment in Joby Aviation comes as the automaker looks to expand into new sectors as the industry rapidly transforms, with president Akio Toyoda pledging to move the firm “from a car manufacturer to a mobility company”. “Air transportation has been a long-term goal for Toyota, and while we continue our work in the automobile business, this agreement sets our sights to the sky,” Toyoda said in a statement announcing the investment. “Through this new and exciting endeavour, we hope to deliver freedom of movement and enjoyment to customers everywhere, on land, and now, in the sky.” Founded in 2009, Joby Aviation is developing a four-passenger electric aircraft that takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter, though it has multiple rotors. The firm envisions the aircraft as a mode of commercial transport, rather than for sale to individuals, with its pilots ferrying commuters around. Toyota said it would also offer its “expertise in manufacturing, quality and cost controls for the development and production” of Joby’s aircraft. One of its executive vice presidents, Shigeki Tomoyama, will join Joby’s board, playing an “active role in setting strategic direction”, Toyota said. Joby already has a partnership with ride-sharing firm Uber to develop an “urban air taxi service”. Toyota has ventured into the flying vehicle field elsewhere, investing in the Japanese SkyDrive project to develop what is intended to be the world’s smallest flying car. It has also branched out into other sectors, announcing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month its plans for a “woven city” at the base of Mount Fuji that would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells and include roads for autonomous vehicles as well as smart homes. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/248481-philippines-strengthens-crackdown-competition-law/","title":"Philippines strengthens crackdown on consumer fraud","date":"Jan 4, 2020 8:17 AM PHT","snippet":"The Department of Justice boosts witness protection for whistleblowers against businesses that violate the Philippine Competition Act","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines is strengthening its crackdown on violators of the Competition Act with new policy adjustments coming from both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Supreme Court. The DOJ is crafting new rules for what it calls its “leniency program” that will give protection to whistleblowers of businesses engaged in anti-competitive practices. The High Court, meanwhile, has designated special courts that will focus on trying cases involving Republic Act No. 10667 or the Philippine Competition Act. RA 10667 ensures markets remain competitive, so that consumers can enjoy lower prices. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is a quasi-judicial body tasked to implement the law. It recently made headlines for imposing penalties on ride-sharing app Grab Philippines.  New programs Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete said the new rules to institute the leniency program will be finalized in late January. “The leniency program allows for a respondent, someone who participated in a criminal act, to be exculpated from criminal prosecution if he or she will testify,” Perete said. He added, “We have to take into consideration the reality that those who would enter into an anti-competitive agreement would probably have a lot of resources so you want an incentive for witnesses to testify, and protection for them as well.” In a notice of resolution dated December 10, 2019, but released only on Friday, January 3, the Supreme Court has designated as competition courts the previous special commercial courts in Quezon City, Manila, Makati, Pasig, Cebu City, Iloillo City, Davao City, and Cagayan De Oro City. These assignments are additions to new rules made by the High Court in September 2019, where it laid down procedures for application, issuance, and implementation of inspection orders for administrative investigations by the PCC.

Here’s our assessment.","body":" In years past, the Philippines has been no stranger in our annual rankings of who had it good and who had it bad as we put the spotlight on Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in 2015 and on the growing challenge to press freedom in 2018.   As 2020 begins, we take one last look at the year that was. Whether in Manila or New York, consumers and investors took note as President Trump continued his disruptive approach to diplomacy and pushed back on China trade practices in 2019.  At year’s end, the on-again-off-again US-China trade war had sent US equity markets on a volatile ride to record levels. If on nothing else, Trump has united partisan Washington on the need to rebalance the US-China economic relationship.  How that relationship evolves in the year ahead will surely impact all Southeast Asia as well as Main Street America and the 2020 US presidential elections.  So, who was up and who was down in the Indo-Pacific region in 2019? Here’s our assessment:  BEST YEAR: BTS – beyond politics, a K-pop band rules Amidst slowing economies and political divisions, good news was hard to find in much of Asia in 2019. A clear exception was the K-pop sensation known as BTS that has also made its presence felt across the USA. The 7-member Korean boy band was firmly established as a dominant social media presence and worldwide phenomenon in 2019.  BTS’ wildly successful, extended “Love Yourself World Tour” sold-out stadiums in Asia, and across the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, including the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and London’s Wembley Stadium. Music awards and commercial success accelerated, with accolades from MTV, Billboard and the American Music Awards. In 2019, BTS also became the first group since the Beatles to earn 3 No. 1 albums in less than a year, according to Billboard.  With the group contributing more than $4.65 billion to South Korea’s GDP, according to the Hollywood Reporter, little wonder BTS earned a Time cover story and a place on the magazine’s list of  the 100 most influential people for 2019. Trump might well have met rival boy group EXO on his own trip to Seoul in 2019, but it is BTS that wins our Best Year in Asia 2019.   GOOD YEAR: Tsai Ing-Wen – Taiwanese president becomes the face of “Good China” From Indonesia’s President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, easily reelected in April 2019, to Japan’s Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who became Japan’s longest-serving prime minister in November, Asia has its share of leaders who found 2019 to be very much a good year. No one’s fortunes changed as much for the better though than Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-Wen. At one point, her prospects for re-election seemed slim, particularly after her Democratic Progressive Party suffered a disastrous defeat in the 2018 local elections.  But as the January 11 general election approaches, Tsai is riding high in the polls, thanks in no small part to the unrest in Hong Kong and to a resilient Taiwan economy that continues to roar along, benefiting from growing foreign direct investment and the “reshoring” of Taiwan businesses, amidst US-China trade tensions. The Taiwan stock exchange is now up some 25% since the start of 2019. Tsai also won international attention when Taiwan approved same-sex marriage in May 2019, making history in Asia.  As the year ended, Tsai’s prospects for reelection never looked better.  MIXED YEAR: Trump & Xi – troubles at home & abroad for the world’s most powerful leaders  2019 was a mixed year for the two most powerful political leaders in the world.  By year end, Trump had become only the third US president to be impeached and worries reemerged about whether North Korea’s mercurial Kim Jong Un might try to crash Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy. Yet, a strong economy continues to augur well for Trump in the 2020 presidential elections. On this side of the Pacific, China’s President Xi Jinping in 2019 solidified his role as the strongest Chinese leader in decades.  This though hasn’t prevented growing pushback over China’s treatment of the Uighurs  and other predominantly Muslim minorities, accusations of debt diplomacy over Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative, increasing blowback over Chinese economic nationalism highlighted by a furioius response to a  pro-Hong Kong Tweet by a NBA general manager, and most critically, a slowing Chinese economy.   An end-of-year, “Phase One” US-China trade deal has at least brought a pause to the ongoing US-China trade war, offering up benefits to US and Chinese consumers worried over tariffs, and perhaps set the stage for a come-back and better year in 2020 by both Trump and Xi.  BAD YEAR: Masayoshi Son – from Uber to WeWork, the SoftBank founder’s magic fades   It’s just not working anymore. Since unveiling his $100-billion Vision Fund in 2016, Japan’s billionaire investor and Softbank founder Masayoshi Son has dazzled, becoming one of the world’s most active tech investors.   Investments in unicorns and would-be unicorns – startups valued at $1 billion or more – would, he and his investors envisioned, replicate the success Son had achieved with a storied early investment in Alibaba. There, a $20 million investment in Alibaba turned into stock worth more than $120 billion.    But in a bad year for Son, questions have grown about murky governance, elusive profits and the valuation of investments in companies ranging from ride-sharing company Uber to co-working space provider WeWork. In one month, WeWork cut its valuation from $47 billion to $10 billion, and in October, SoftBank stepped in, forcing out WeWork Chairman Adam Neumann with a $1.7 billion payout, and reducing the company’s valuation to $5 billion. What’s next for Son and Softbank? Seems a period of reflection and restraint is due, with Fortune reporting that he has told tech startups that “knowing your limitations will help unleash limitless possibilities.”  WORST YEAR: The People of Hong Kong – 6 months of turmoil and the worst may be yet to come The world has been transfixed this year by televised battles between Hong Kong protesters and police in tear-gas filled streets. What’s at stake? The future of the more than 7 million people who call this special administrative region of China home.   Ongoing protests were sparked by a now withdrawn bill that would have allowed people arrested in Hong Kong to be sent to Communist China.   With countries issuing travel warnings for Hong Kong, visitors’ numbers are plummeting. In August 2019, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) of the Philippines advised Filipino travelers who have no urgent business in Hong Kong to avoid Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) as a destination or transit airport. The Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs also that month issued a travel advisory to its citizens to defer non-essential travel to Hong Kong.  Schools have been closed and universities under siege. Hong Kong is now in a recession, its first in a decade. And while Trump has signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, the worst may be yet to come as the promise of “One Country Two Systems” fades and Beijing increasingly intervenes in this self-proclaimed “Asia’s World City.” Sadly, whether pro-China, anti-China or somewhere in between, the Hong Kong people are our biggest losers for 2019. – Rappler.com Curtis S.

This was the first in the series of stories Miguel did in 2019 to bare proposals for Sangley Airport, seen as the alternative gateway closest to Manila. The proposal, as submitted to the National Economic and Development Authority, stated that it would be undertaken through a novel government-to-government approach. This means a trust would be created with the Cavite province and the Philippine government as trustors. This proposal showcased a potential model for other local governments – that such arrangements are possible.

Jodesz Gavilan, Senior Researcher Covering Human Rights  The story: People on the Periphery seriesThe journalists behind it: Jonathan de Santos, Gaea Cabico and Efigenio ToledoThe news outlet: Philstar.com A Rappler editor has always reminded us young journalists that whenever the government has a proposal or a plan, we should ask: Who will be affected? How will they be affected? The Philstar.com team took these questions to heart and answered them through a series of stories that chronicled the human costs of the Duterte administration’s Build Build Build program. In the “People in the Periphery” series published in October 2019, we got to know the people from communities directly affected by what the government marketed as the “golden age of infrastructure.” The stories drowned out the soundbites of economists that we had heard day in and day out, pulled apart the curtains of numbers, and took us to the homes of Filipinos whose concerns were often an afterthought in massive government projects.

Examining the digital file, Mike Navallo discovered it was authored by a lawyer and a secretary working at the Office of the Solicitor General. The involvement of the OSG in preparing a private complaint raised both legal and ethical questions.

The PCIJ story showed that ballot layouts are as important as counting the voters’ choices on the ballots. As if the party list system didn’t already badly need reforms, the 2019 elections made us realize this additional problem: many voters failing to cast their votes because they were not aware that there was a list of candidate parties on the back of their ballots.   Michelle Abad, Researcher Covering Women’s Issues  The story: Inside the Underground Baby Trade in the PhilippinesThe journalist behind it: Lynzy BillingThe news outlet: ZORA Magazine Lynzy Billing shed light on a disturbing practice in one of the poorest areas of Manila. The underground baby trade was the result of a combination of factors: the inadequate implementation of the Reproductive Health Law, abortion being illegal, the tedious process of adoption offered by the social welfare department, and human trafficking. While the thought of selling babies – some on social media at that – sounded detached and inhumane, the investigative piece showed how some poor women were compelled to resort to these almost paper trail-less deals so they could put food on the table, at great cost to their psychological well-being.  Pauline Macaraeg, Researcher  The story: No country for unicorns: Why Philippine start-ups are strugglingThe journalist behind it: Elyssa LopezThe news outlet: South China Morning Post The piece is a must-read on the state of the startup industry in the Philippines.

The mood in the Visayas at the time was that people were getting fed up with liberal rule that left behind the regions in economic development. Duterte blamed the concentration of wealth on Manila’s oligarchs and on their alleged hold on government. He said their days would be numbered if he were elected.

TWG for motorcycle taxis chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said on Saturday, December 21, that Angkas bikers to be deactivated may be absorbed by the two newcomers, JoyRide and Move It. (READ: #SaveAngkas trends worldwide: Netizens rage over plight of Angkas bikers) Gardiola explained that the cap limits Angkas to just 10,000 bikers from 27,000 in Metro Manila, but JoyRide and Move It will have their own bikers as well. This means that some 30,000 motorcycle taxis will be available, provided that the two new companies will deploy the maximum number of allowed drivers. Meanwhile, some 9,000 bikers will be allotted for Metro Cebu, with each ride-hailing firm getting an equal share. This would bring the number of motorcycles to 39,000 nationwide. The cap was imposed by the TWG for a study on road safety. Gardiola added that the cap ensures a competitive market and avoids a monopoly by Angkas. “Also, please note that when the cap was discussed during the consultation meeting with Angkas and the other [transport network companies], Angkas did not, in any way, express disagreement. They were, in fact, amenable to it,” Gardiola said. The TWG extended the duration of the motorcycle taxi pilot run until March 2020.

It is the first time that Uber has released the figures – which also revealed 19 fatal assaults related to the company over the two-year period – as it and rival Lyft face increasing pressure to cope with the growing number of complaints of abuse. The company received 464 reports of non-consensual sexual penetration and 587 of attempted non-consensual sexual penetration in 2017 and 2018. The other assaults fell into categories such as non-consensual kissing or touching. While the number of reports went up from 2017 to 2018 in 3 of the 5 categories, including non-consensual sexual penetration and non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, the ride-sharing service hailed across-the-board declines in the “incident rate” based on a larger number of overall trips occurring in the latter year. “From 2017 to 2018, Uber saw approximately a 16% decrease in the average incident rate across the 5 most serious sexual assault categories reported. Additionally, there were rate decreases across each of the five individual categories,” the report said. Uber also reported 10 “fatal physical assaults” related to its service in 2017 and 9 in 2018. “During 2017 and 2018, there were 19 fatal physical assaults occurring in a total of 18 incidents in relation to Uber,” the company said.

The contraptions have popped up in cities worldwide but pedestrians in many places have come to see the silent machines as menaces, and authorities have been scrambling to regulate them. Tens of thousands flooded Singapore, becoming particularly popular among commuters and workers delivering food, but apartment fires blamed on charging devices and the death of an elderly cyclist after a September collision stoked public anger. Last week, officials announced a ban on the trendy two-wheelers on all footpaths. To start with, most riders caught breaking the rule will be given a warning but from January, offenders face being jailed for up to 3 months and fined. The move surprised observers after a panel advising the government had recommended weaker measures, such as a mandatory theory test – and angered some who have come to rely on the scooters. “It is definitely over-regulation,” Venkata Goruganthu, who rode his e-scooter to his office in the business district every day, told AFP. “There are car accidents and people are dying, are we going to ban cars on the streets now?” The 41-year-old technician will now have to commute by public transport, which will take him 45 minutes – twice as long as a scooter ride. ‘Reckless’ riders  But many others approved of the effort to rein in the scooters, which now number about 100,000 in the space-starved country of 5.7 million. “People are not responsible, they are reckless,” Vasukie Mayandi, a 51-year-old bank worker, told AFP. “They feel they want to move somewhere fast, but they’re not considering others who are using the same pathway.” E-scooters were already banned from Singapore’s roads but they are now prohibited on all pavements and other footpaths, and can only be used on cycle paths and a network of routes connecting parks. It drastically reduces the area where people can ride the contraptions – Singapore has about 440 kilometers (275 miles) of cycle paths compared with 5,500 kilometers of footpaths. Officials, however, say cycle paths will be extended to cover 750 kilometres by 2025. Following the announcement, regional ride-sharing giant Grab said it was suspending its scooter-sharing set-up in Singapore while the government said it would reject applications by other firms hoping to start such services. International clampdown  Singapore is just the latest country trying to get control of the scooters. Last week, the French government issued new rules, including a ban on using them on pavements – unless a city permits them in certain areas – and a 25 kilometer per hour speed limit. Germany does not allow them on pavements while London has taken the most extreme approach of major European cities, prohibiting the two-wheelers entirely unless a rider has a driving licence, insurance, road tax, a helmet and a number plate. The hardest hit in Singapore by the new rules is the army of people using e-scooters to deliver food across the city for companies such as Deliveroo, Grab and Foodpanda, although authorities have taken steps to help. On Friday, November 8, the transport ministry said the government and companies were offering grants for e-scooter delivery riders to switch to other devices including regular and power-assisted bicycles. Benjamin Goh has already changed to a bike for his food delivery job – but said his income would be affected as cycling is more exhausting, meaning he can complete fewer orders. “It’s very tiring for me to use a bicycle,” said the 26-year-old single father, adding that he would also end up fatigued and potentially less capable of caring for his young son after work. Goh said he felt food delivery workers were being punished for the bad behavior of some recreational riders, but conceded: “I can understand why people hate us.” – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/243271-dash-of-sas-neda-official-accused-sexual-harassment-still-in-office/","title":"[OPINION | Dash of SAS] NEDA official accused of sexual harassment still in office","date":"Oct 25, 2019 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"It has been nearly 9 months since the report was submitted to the Office of the President for a resolution. The silence from Malacañang is deafening.","body":"  Last January 30, the National Economic and Development Authority submitted the results of its internal investigation into a sexual harassment case a junior officer filed against her supervisor, a high-ranking NEDA official. (Read NEDA statement here.)   According to the statement, a thorough investigation was done by its Committee on Decorum and Investigation (CODI), and the committee’s findings and recommendations were submitted to the Office of the President.  As the accused is a 3rd-level official, a presidential appointee, President Rodrigo Duterte would make the final decision on the matter.  The sexual harassment incident was first reported in the Philippine Daily Inquirer and then by Rappler in early January. A 21-year-old employee alleged that her supervisor had fondled her while she and two other women shared a ride home with him after an office party. The accused was said to be drunk at the time.  The supervisor is very influential and enjoys the tenure and stature of his over 40 years of working in the NEDA. The Davao native is very well-connected within and outside the agency. However, his internal reputation is one of a serial predator who makes unwanted sexual advances on his subordinates, usually young employees in junior positions – much like the complainant. The unwanted overtures are usually made when on official business trips abroad. Some of the victims are now senior female employees who endured the harassment and remained silent about it.  Considering the power play and the internal culture of silence for females (a culture that exists in most of the country), it was very courageous of the complainant to seek redress. However, it cost the young budding economist her career. Rappler was able to confirm with independent sources that the complainant resigned shortly after she filed the case. While the NEDA upheld its responsibility to investigate the case, the complainant did not receive much support from colleagues, presumably out of fear of offending the very big boss whose predatory exploits were laid bare.  It has been nearly 9 months since the report was submitted to the Office of the President for a resolution. The silence from Malacañang is deafening. The accused was 63 years old at the time the complaint was filed in the latter part of 2018. According to the Civil Service Commission Act, the mandatory retirement age is 65 years old.  If the official is found guilty, the penalty of dismissal from office may be imposed along with “the cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations.” If a decision is not reached before his retirement, there will be a 90-day limit for holding his benefits while his case is pending. Past the 90 days, he will be awarded full retirement benefits. We have laws made to protect us from harassment, like The Anti-Sexual Harassment Law and the recently passed Safe Spaces Act, but these laws will remain mere words on paper unless authorities act on cases like the one from NEDA. That means making a decision and extracting accountability.  The NEDA case is an opportunity for government to restore public trust in its laws and exhibit good governance by showing that the influence and power of public office come with the responsibility of being held to a higher standard of decency. But the Office of the President is dragging its feet. We have to ask ourselves and our officials: Why is it taking so long for the Office of the President to make a decision? Who is it trying to protect? – Rappler.com     "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/243203-tnvs-franchise-applicants-online-appointment-scheduling/","title":"TNVS franchise applicants can now book appointments online","date":"Oct 23, 2019 11:32 AM PHT","snippet":"The online appointment scheduling system aims to make TNVS franchise applications accessible, easier, and more convenient","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Franchise applicants for transport network vehicle services (TNVS) can now schedule appointments online after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) made the option available.

Dyson, known for his bagless vacuum cleaners and bladeless fans, announced two years ago that he was investing two billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in developing an electric car, and the first vehicles were expected in 2021. The ambitious project catapulted the 72-year-old entrepreneur into competition against more established players such as US firm Tesla, founded by business magnate Elon Musk, and carmakers from the US to China. Adding to his difficulties, the plan ran into controversy when the company revealed that its first car plant would be in Singapore and its global headquarters were shifting to the affluent city-state. Dyson insisted it was to be closer to booming Asian markets – but there was fury that the tycoon was not investing more in UK manufacturing after vocally supporting Britain’s exit from the European Union. There had however been little indication that Dyson was having second thoughts about the high-profile project, which hundreds of employees were already working on, until an announcement late Thursday of the abrupt U-turn. Dyson said in a statement that his team had developed a “fantastic car” based on an “ingenious” approach but added: “Though we have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply cannot make it commercially viable.” “We have been through a serious process to find a buyer for the project which has, unfortunately, been unsuccessful so far,” he said. There are 523 people in the automotive team, the majority in Britain and 22 in Singapore, a spokesman said. Dyson said “as many of the team as possible” would be reassigned to other roles in the company. Singapore government agency the Economic Development Board predicted the decision to ditch the project would have a minimal disruption on Dyson’s operations in the Asian trading hub, as it was at an early stage. Tough project In May, Dyson unveiled brief details of patents filed for the electric car and said it would be more energy-efficient than rivals — and with “very large wheels” for city and rough-terrain driving. But analysts were sceptical about the plan and not surprised about the change of heart. “From the first instance it was always difficult to understand why Dyson thought that it would have any sort of competitive advantage in actually embarking on this project,” Walter Theseira, a transport economist at Singapore University of Social Sciences, told AFP. “Given the global competitive landscape, you’re adding a new manufacturer which is untested in the car industry.” Nitin Pangarkar, from National University of Singapore’s Business School, added the car industry was becoming “less attractive” as cities create better public transport networks and consumers change behaviour through steps such as sharing rides. “Dyson’s resources… are probably better spent elsewhere, in products similar to its current businesses,” he added. Electric vehicles are increasing in popularity as governments worldwide seek to phase out polluting petrol and diesel cars, but producing them profitably is a challenge even for leading manufacturers. While Tesla has strong consumer appeal, investors have been frustrated by the pace of production and the company’s inability to hit its financial targets. Despite dumping the project, Dyson insisted the company would continue a $3.1 billion investment programme in new technology, including the manufacture of batteries, robotics, machine learning and AI. The company in May completed the move of its headquarters to Singapore, where many international firms have their Asian bases, and Dyson has since made headlines by going on a property-buying spree. He reportedly paid Sg$74 million ($54 million) for Singapore’s biggest, most expensive penthouse — a three-floor residence with a rooftop terrace and jacuzzi. And the tycoon also bought a luxury house complete with an indoor waterfall, spiral staircase, landscaped garden and infinity pool, according to local media. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/239890-uber-trims-more-staff-seeks-route-profit/","title":"Uber trims more staff as it seeks a route to profit","date":"Sep 11, 2019 6:45 PM PHT","snippet":"San Francisco-based Uber is cutting about 265 people from its engineering group and another 170 or so jobs from its product team","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber on Tuesday, September 10, said it was laying off about 8% of its product and engineering teams as the smartphone-summoned ride service tries to map a route to profitability. The San Francisco-based company is cutting about 265 people from its engineering group and another 170 or so jobs from its product team, a spokesman told Agence France-Presse. While a fast-growing startup, ranks of Uber employees swelled to more than 27,000 employees around the world and the time had come to shift gears and cut ranks for efficiency, according to the company. “We’re making some changes to get us back on track, which include reducing the size of some teams to ensure we are staffed appropriately against our top priorities,” the Uber spokesman said. “Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day – ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility.” Uber planned to continue to hire top technical talent, but with a focus on “lean, exceptionally high-performing teams,” the spokesman added. In July, Uber cut 400 jobs from its marketing team of more than 1,200 workers to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi a month earlier had tightened his grip on the wheel at the ride-hailing firm following a bumpy stock market debut. After debuting in May at $45 for the initial public offering – translating to a market value of $82 billion – Uber shares went into reverse.  Uber shares gained a little ground on Tuesday, up nearly 4% to $33.51 at the close of the formal trading day on Wall Street. Uber shares tumbled last month after the leading ride-share company reported its loss eclipsed market expectations in the 2nd quarter of this year. The company said revenue grew 14% to $3.2 billion, but it lost $5.2 billion as compared to losing $848 million in the same period last year. Stock related compensation expenses took a huge bite out of its revenue, the company said. While the firm has lost billions since offering its first rides in 2011 in its home city of San Francisco, it envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. The company has moved into electric bikes, trucking, and scooters, as well as meal deliveries, and has a long-term project on flying taxis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/239887-gig-economy-challenged-california-lawmakers-approve-landmark-bill/","title":"Gig economy challenged as California lawmakers approve landmark bill","date":"Sep 11, 2019 6:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Under Assembly Bill 5, workers in California must be designated as employees if their work or performance is controlled by the company, and part of that company's regular business","body":" SAN FRANSCISO, USA – Uber and Lyft would be required to treat contract workers in California as employees under landmark legislation approved by the US state’s lawmakers Tuesday, September 10, that could reshape the gig economy. Those in favor of the gig economy – where workers are employed on short-term contracts without benefits like healthcare or minimum wage – say it allows flexibility, but opponents say it deprives workers of stability and security. Under Assembly Bill 5, workers in California – the biggest US state by GDP – must be designated employees, not contractors, if their work or performance is controlled by the company, and part of that company’s regular business. Bitterly fought by the tech giants, the landmark bill – which passed 29-11 in the state legislature’s upper house – sets a precedent that may be copied in states like New York where labor groups are pushing for similar rights for workers. The lower house – the Assembly – which has already passed the bill, will now vote on amendments introduced by the Senate, before sending it to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom is expected to sign it into law, having indicated his support for the measure last week in an op-ed published by the Sacramento Bee. Once a darling of both progressives and hard-nosed economists, start-up apps relying on the gig economy are weathering increasing political pressure, as well as plateauing or decreasing stock values as investors worry about potential legislation. Both Uber and Lyft warned about the impact of such laws in a co-bylined op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle ahead of the bill’s hearing. It said: “It’s also no secret that a change to the employment classification of ride-share drivers would pose a risk to our businesses.” But Lorena Gonzalez, the Democrat who authored the bill, told Bloomberg the law meant a business “cannot game the system by misclassifying its workers.” “As lawmakers, we will not in good conscience allow free-riding businesses to continue to pass their own business costs onto taxpayers and workers,” she said in a statement. “It’s our job to look out for working men and women, not Wall Street and their get-rich-quick IPOs.” Slated to take effect from January 1 next year, the bill’s passing was criticized by Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin, who told Gizmodo: “Today, our state’s political leadership missed an important opportunity to support the overwhelming majority of rideshare drivers who want a thoughtful solution that balances flexibility with an earnings standard and benefits.”  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/238874-grab-new-in-app-feature-safety-center/","title":"Grab doubles down on safety through new in-app ‘Safety Center’","date":"Aug 29, 2019 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing platform invests at least $20 million to work on safety for its users","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines wants to bring its safety incidents down to zero through a newly-launched in-app Safety Center announced on Thursday, August 29. The Safety Center is a centralized access point that contains all of the app’s safety features. Through this button, passengers will be able to share their ride details, report safety concerns, ask for emergency assistance, and review safety information.  After reporting a safety issue, the passenger will receive a digital response within 30 minutes, and a resolution period of two to six hours. When immediate action is needed in transit, passengers could also be connected to proper authorities. Grab has already partnered with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group for crime prevention and accident response. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said that the safety center is a continuation of their Safety Everyday Tech Roadmap which was initiated in 2018. It wasn’t brought about by any uptick in criminality. Rather, it was a move to strengthen their safety proposition.  “We went back to our roots and said ‘why did we launch Grab?’ It was safety, convenience, speed. So convenience we sort of solved, speed we fixed the algorithm, safety… was part of the process, but it wasn’t part of the business that we really invested in as much as we did in fixing the algorithms, fixing the speed,” he said. They decided to put in ‘real budget’ for safety development. Cu said they have invested at least $20 million on engineering support, feature development, and insurance to improve the app’s safety. Aside from this new feature, Cu said they are also looking for more women drivers. This is to increase the likelihood of matching women passengers to women drivers so harassment incidents can be reduced. Cu also clarified that drivers go through gender sensitivity training when they get onboarded.  “We take safety very seriously, from onboarding partners all the way up to while they’re in the app. So it’s a bunch of retraining on safe driving, retraining on gender sensitivity, even retraining with partners such as the Highway Patrol Group and even with some health partners as well,” added country marketing head RJ Cabaluna. The Safety Center feature will be fully integrated and available in the app on Friday, August 30. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/235848-love-letter-manila/","title":"[OPINION] A love letter to Manila","date":"Jul 20, 2019 6:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Drawing inspiration from young women silently reshaping the capital with their bare hands","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Manila is crumbling. I often hear this from disappointed tourists and politicians.  This year, I promised to explore the great capital more – to see if I would step on crumbs, as most people claim, or if my experience proves otherwise. As a child, Manila was a faraway exotic land. My family barely left our small sleepy town, hence I could not relate to classmates bragging about vacationing in Manila to see famous paintings, to watch musicals, or to simply shop and dine.  We had none of those. I was envious. I only got to travel to Manila through episodes of Lito Atienza’s drama series Maynila. I knew the show’s opening song by heart. As a teenager, I watched old copies of Lino Brocka’s Maynila sa Kuko ng Liwanag and Ishmael Bernal’s Manila By Night. Their version of Manila is completely different from Atienza’s.  In my mind, Manila morphed into a place of crime, sex, garbage, arts, and culture. Until today, Manila maintains its mystique. Despite having studied and worked in Quezon City and Makati for years now, I have never truly known Manila. Hassle Going to Manila has always felt like a chore.  Before the boom of Grab and Angkas, one had to take several jeepney rides to reach Escolta, the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the National Museum, Intramuros, and all other famous Manila landmarks. My mother always worried I would get mugged during these trips.  Manila was also extra confusing before the rise of Waze and Google Maps. The destinations were lovely, but a commuter’s journey isn’t. Ride-sharing apps made going to Manila easier, but only for those who can afford it. These beautiful parks and museums – albeit having no entrance fees – remain inaccessible to many Filipinos. Newly elected Manila mayor Isko Moreno has been generating media buzz for promising to restore the capital’s beauty and glory. Many are impressed by the mayor’s zeal.  Today, I met a few others doing their best to preserve our country’s heritage sites. They work silently, receiving little-to-no recognition, but their bare hands are literally reshaping today’s Manila.  Women get it done To celebrate my birthday, I went to an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila (MET). Incidentally, there were people at the lobby preparing for a “Heritage Walk” organized by the MET. I wanted to join, but slots were limited and you had to pre-register. Luckily, two participants bailed and I got their slot. Our group was a mix of young and old. I did not even know our destination. The next thing I knew, I was on a jeep heading to Paco Park.   It was my first time at Paco Park. I was clueless.  Completed in 1820, it was intended as a cemetery for Manila’s elites but was also used for victims of a widespread cholera epidemic during those times.  The Gomburza priests and Jose Rizal were once buried here. Rizal’s grave was “simple and nearly anonymous,” with his initials reversed to keep it unnoticed. In 1912, burials were discontinued; remains were transferred elsewhere. In 1966, it was turned into a national park; the St. Pancratius Chapel inside the park has been popular for weddings. Finally in 2015, Paco Park was declared a “national cultural treasure.”  After all it has been through, Paco Park stands still – not through some divine miracle, but through a carefully planned rehabilitation process. Among those keeping Paco Park alive is a group of women. At the heritage walk, I met Analisa, a 28-year old mason who was part of the conservation team that rehabilitated Paco Park’s ossuary, in partnership with the National Parks Development Committee. After two years, Analisa’s team started wrapping up their opus in July 2019. Out of the team’s 8 members, 6 are women. They are trained in masonry, carpentry, plumbing, and electrical, wood, and metal work. “Some say these jobs are not for women,” Analisa told me in Filipino. “That’s not true. Women can do whatever men can. We’re not weak.” Analisa was a computer science student, but she had to drop out during her second year in college due to financial constraints. At 21, Analisa started her technical-vocational education and training (TVET). “I enjoyed it. I like getting things done,” she said. In the Philippines, TVET is yet to be fully understood and appreciated. Some might even frown upon TVET, misjudging it to be less valuable than a college degree. In the past two decades, however, the number of TVET graduates has increased, according to the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).  The K-12 program’s technical-vocational-livelihood strand is among the government’s latest efforts to remove stigma against TVET. In 2018, TESDA reported having over 2 million TVET graduates.  Analisa earned her training through Escuela Taller Filipinas Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on preserving heritage sites.  They train indigent youth on technical-vocational skills needed in heritage conservation. Their students have also contributed to preserving the Fort Santiago, Ivatan houses in Batanes, and other heritage sites like the San Agustin Church.  Analisa advises young Filipinos – especially women – to pursue TVET. “You can do it if you have patience and perseverance. Believe in yourself,” the young mason said.  “Technical and vocational skills are important, especially in protecting our heritage,” she added. “When I was growing up, I didn’t understand the value of cultural heritage. I hope today’s youth isn’t the same.” Analisa’s favorite project so far is her team’s rehabilitation of the Malate Church, “because it was very difficult, but we were happy to see people appreciating our work after.”  Rise of mall rats In our colonial past, heritage sites were destroyed by wars. Today, our spaces are mostly threatened by mushrooms of malls and condominiums. And even by our mere lack of interest in our own history and culture. “We cannot freeze development and our social fabric,” explained Jeffrey “Foom” Cobilla, our heritage walk tour guide and an architect from Escuela Taller. “However, whenever we want to alter our space – especially our heritage structures – we should think about it carefully,” Heritage sites are protected under RA 10066 or the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009. Unfortunately, like most of our laws, this one needs sharper teeth. “What we want to do is to make communities more capable of caring,” said Foom. “More people should be involved either by participating in conservation projects or by simply raising awareness on the significance of our heritage.” Just as I was leaving the gates of the famous cemetery-turned-park, I was already thinking of where to visit next week. I then noticed some residents voluntarily sweeping and collecting trash along the sidewalks of the street beyond Paco Park’s walls. I realized Manila isn’t crumbling just yet – thanks to the likes of Analisa, Foom, and many others quietly keeping this great city afloat. – Rappler.com Fritzie Rodriguez is a humanitarian and development worker."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/235130-jay-z-joins-cannabis-business/","title":"Rapper Jay-Z joins cannabis business","date":"Jul 11, 2019 9:58 AM PHT","snippet":"Signing on as chief brand strategist for a cannabis company, Jay-Z is the latest celebrity to enter the weed industry","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – Rapper Jay-Z has become the latest celebrity to enter the weed business, signing on to be the chief brand strategist for a California-based cannabis company.

At its Uber Elevate Summit, the company said it had regulatory approval to begin tests of delivering food by drone in the region of San Diego, California. “Our goal is to expand Uber Eats drone delivery so we can provide more options to more people at the tap of a button,” said Luke Fischer, head of flight operations at Uber Elevate. “We believe that Uber is uniquely positioned to take on this challenge as we’re able to leverage the Uber Eats network of restaurant partners and delivery partners as well as the aviation experience and technology of Uber Elevate.” For logistical reasons, the drones will not deliver directly to customers, but to a safe drop-off location where an Uber Eats driver will complete the order. In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States. Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. The drone service is part of Uber’s move to the skies as it seeks to develop an aerial ride-sharing network tied in with its smartphone app to help people avoid traffic congestion on the ground. Uber said the drone service will provide data that will help manage its air network, and eventually allow the aircraft to operate autonomously. New autonomous car Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars. The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China’s Geely, to produce “tens of thousands” of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. Volvo said it will use a similar autonomous base for the introduction of its first commercially available autonomous drive technology in the early 2020s. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some “easy” trips may be made autonomously. Uber also unveiled the latest versions of its electric bikes and scooters that round out its shared transportation system. – Rappler.com Have your food delivered using this foodpanda voucher code to get P200 off your meal."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/232355-guide-twists-turns-black-mirror-season-5/","title":"Here’s your guide to the twists and turns of ‘Black Mirror’ Season 5","date":"Jun 5, 2019 5:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The new season of 'Black Mirror' highlights personal struggle and desire to find meaning","body":" The fifth season of Black Mirror isn’t as harrowing as previous outings. The technologies presented in these three episodes all have world-altering (possibly dystopic) potential, but the season focuses on smaller, more personal struggles. The result is a collection of stories that, while not as earth-shattering in their implications, make for compelling viewing. ** WARNING: PLOT POINTS FOR SEASON 5 FOLLOW **   “Striking Vipers”  “Striking Vipers” is about technology, and how we use it to build connections to fulfill our emotional needs. The story introduces two buddies: Danny (played by the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Anthony Mackie) and Karl (played by the DC Extended Universe’s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). The two characters meet via VR in a fighting game reminiscent of Street Fighter and Tekken (Danny plays a male character Lance, while Karl plays a female character Roxette). At first, they duke it out using special moves and combos. But they eventually form a sexual relationship through their characters, with the game’s exotic locations the perfect backdrop for their trysts.  The illicit relationship highlights the missing elements in both men’s lives. For Karl, the perennial bachelor, it’s the chance to engage in deep, transcendent sex. For Danny, it’s an antidote to his stable but unfulfilling marriage. The affair drives a wedge between the two friends. Danny wants to call it off, but Karl doesn’t want to let go. They eventually question their own sexualities — is it a homosexual act to have virtual sex with another man when he’s using a female character? In the electronic world of Striking Vipers, sexuality is literally binary. The two men decide to confront the issue in the real world. They meet in a rain-soaked alley and kiss. It’s a tense scene with some great comedic beats, but their discovery, and the overall resolution of the story, is a bit anticlimactic. “Smithereens”  “Smithereens” is a potent examination of grief and desperation. The story focuses on Chris (played with alarming intensity by Andrew Scott), a lonely and desperate ride-sharing driver. He kidnaps an employee of Smithereens, a social media platform that resembles Facebook. Chris holds the employee hostage and has one only demand: to speak with Billy Bauer, the creator of Smithereens. After a stand-off with both police and Smithereens executives, Chris finally gets to speak with Billy. All Chris wants to do is tell the tech mogul the story of how one glimpse at a Smithereens notification while driving resulted in a car crash that killed his fiancée. Smithereens is about things falling apart, and being utterly powerless to do anything about it. While the real world’s Mark Zuckerberg may seem robotic and prone to spewing empty corporate platitudes about connection and openness, Bauer is more human — jittery, even. At one point, he even breaks down and tells Chris that he never intended for Smithereens to become what it is now. Imagine Zuckerberg saying the same thing.  The episode fulfills the fantasy of finally putting a tech mogul up close and personal with the consequence of their creations. It gives a human face and emotional urgency to what these people probably see as cold data. While other Black Mirror episodes show technology amped to extreme degrees, Smithereens is more grounded in reality. And that’s what makes this episode potent. It isn’t a cautionary tale about what technology could become — it’s a cautionary tale of what technology is. “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too”  The episode presents pop star Ashley, played by Miley Cyrus. Ashley has all the trappings of a teen-idol: bubbly personality, throngs of adoring fans, and an image carefully managed by a team of handlers. To satisfy the demand for more Ashley, her team sells an AI-powered doll (named “Ashley Too”) which faithfully recreates Ashley’s personality. But this isn’t another story about the perils of fame. Instead, the episode explores themes of control, identity, and — most importantly — consent. Ashley seems vivacious and free (her schtick is dropping uplifting messages in her songs and interviews), but this figure is anything but free. Ashley is trapped by her fame, both emotionally and artistically. During quiet moments, she composes songs based on her dreams. The episode uses two Nine Inch Nails songs to great effect: “Head Like a Hole” and “Right Where it Belongs.” When Cyrus sings the latter to herself one early morning, it creates one of the more powerful scenes in a series already full of powerful ones.  Ashley suffers from apparent breakdowns, which her handlers (led by her aunt, who raised her) attempt to quash via drugs. She eventually overdoses, but her aunt can’t lose her money cow. So the team hook-up the comatose pop star to a brain-computer interface. They pluck songs found in her subconscious and attempt to turn them into a new batch of hits. There’s just a problem: the songs from Ashley’s true self are dark and confrontational (which makes the use of NIN’s music all the more appropriate). The team remix the material into teen-friendly pop songs, and plan to release them for public consumption. The episode has all the hallmarks of a classic Black Mirror episode: the heinous application of technology, the search for one’s identity. But the tone suddenly shifts when sisters Rachel and Jack, assisted by Rachel’s Ashley Too doll, attempt to rescue the singer. The last act of the episode plays like a fun teen heist comedy… and I can’t believe I just described a Black Mirror episode as “fun.” But the resolution and closing song number (c’mon, you knew there had to be one) are just that. The tonal shifts may be jarring at times, but they mirror Miley’s own career arc — it’s wild, unpredictable… and definitely fascinating. – Rappler.com   Iñigo de Paula is a writer who lives and works in Quezon City.

Braving principles of gender sensitivity which should start at home and with family roles is another. On my way to visit my best friend who lives in Quezon City, I decided to take time and not rush from Cavite. While I usually prefer more convenient options, it was a day of savoring the city – its noise, its people, and its colors. What best way to engage myself in the city by taking the jeepney, right? As I gave my fare to the driver and checked out what’s new in the city, I saw stickers of striking violet and yellow colors inside the jeepney. With the words “Kaya ni mister, kaya ni misis (What the husband can do, the wife can too)” and “Kapag mas maraming babae, ekonomiya ay lumalago (When there are more women, the economy thrives),” they caught my attention. (READ: Empowering women: Because women can and women will) I asked the driver where he got them and he told me that those stickers were distributed by their local government. After some exchanges of information, I figured out that it was the same campaign advocating for gender equality which also appeared on social media. I knew it was somehow familiar to me and I’m glad that the advocacy is in action. The stickers are about a campaign entitled Infairness Movement, initiated by Spark!, a non-governmental organization championing women and equality. The campaign aims to break stereotypes of the roles of men and women. (READ: [OPINION] This is what we want for our women) Men can do household chores, and women can take part in economic development by being employed or heading their own businesses, among others. The Filipino family One can picture a “usual” Filipino family scenario where the mother stays at home to do the cooking, while the father is in office attire, juggling meetings in corporate offices. It’s evident in elementary education stories, advertisements, and soap operas. But over the years, we’ve observed a shift. Take the train, for example, where we see people from all walks of life. It includes both men and women who work in the city and who go home to provinces close to Manila. However, has Filipino society really embodied that there must be no stereotypes, that discrimination must be a thing of the past? I can remember my elder brother who recently got married. As they were preparing for their new house, he quickly said that his wife must take charge of all the household chores. Should that really be the case? What if my future nephew and niece would see such behavior? Infairness Movement advocates that there must be no specific task delegation at home. The family must work together and break stereotypes, which I believe is necessary for community development. If dad can check the car engine, so can mom. If the mother can sew the hemline, so can the father.

Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday giving it an estimated valuation of some $80 billion, one of the biggest tech listings in recent years but rather lower than its earlier hopes of around $100 billion. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in cities around the world. It will also come in the rear-view mirror of a troubled market debut for Uber’s largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15% of its value since its March IPO. Strikes that took place Wednesday highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange, where Uber is set to list shares, with some signs reading “Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.” Similar actions took place in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington and in Uber’s home town, San Francisco. Protests were held in Britain as well with drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow called on to log off apps and demonstrate outside Uber offices, according to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “UBER” sometime next month. “We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and ‘little brother’ to Uber,” Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is “paving a similar road” to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. Uber’s platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/229691-angkas-event-poe-promise-fast-track-legal-motorcycle-taxi/","title":"At Angkas event, Grace Poe promises to fast-track legalizing motorcycle taxis","date":"May 4, 2019 8:28 PM PHT","snippet":"'Binibilisan ko, pinag-aaralan ko, para ang prangkisa na maghahatid ng mas maganda, mas mabilis, at mas affordable na transportation sa lahat, at pagkakakitaan ninyong lahat sa ligtas na paraan, ay maipasa na,' says Senator Poe","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a sea of riders, reelectionist Senator Grace Poe promised to “hasten” the passage of a bill that would allow hiring motorcycles for transport. At the Angkas “Safety Fiesta” event on Saturday, March 4, George Royeca, spokesperson and head of regulatory and public affairs, said Poe has always been the “champion” of the riding community. “Alam ko nakasalalay ang inyong hanapbuhay dito sa prangkisa sa Senado. Alam ba ninyo na isa ako sa mga pinakamabilis magtrabaho ng prangkisa sa Senado? Ang akin lang, sinisiguro ay ligtas ang ating mga kababayan at pati kayo,” Poe said. (I know that your livelihood depends on the franchise approval at the Senate. Do you know that I’m the fastest in terms of getting franchise approved in the Senate? For me, what’s important is the safety of the public and you too.) \n\n If given the chance to head the public services committee again, Poe said she would lobby for the passage of a bill that would give the public the opportunity to choose whichever transport options there are. “Binibilisan ko, pinag-aaralan ko, para ang prangkisa na maghahatid ng mas maganda, mas mabilis, at mas affordable na transportation sa lahat, at pagkakakitaan ninyong lahat sa ligtas na paraan, ay maipasa na,” Poe said, (I will work faster and study more about it so that the franchise that would bring better, faster, and more affordable transportation for everyone that would be a source of income which is safe would be passed.) Poe headed the Senate committee on public services in the 17th Congress and handled transportation issues, particularly Angkas regulation. Earlier this year, Poe called on the Department of Transportation to hasten its efforts in regulating Angkas and habal-habal (motorcycle taxis) operations. Poe urged DOTr to issue a department order that would allow such. But the transportation department had long argued that Angkas and habal-habal are illegal, because the Land Transportation and Traffic Code prohibits the use of motorcycles as public transport. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) On Saturday, senatorial bets Bam Aquino, JV Ejercito, Chel Diokno, and retired general Ronald dela Rosa also courted the motorcycle drivers at the event.  \n\n Diokno said that the would be pushing for a magna carta for riders, if elected, while Aquino said that legislation needs to catch up with the ride-sharing economy. Quezon City 2nd district Representative Winston Castelo, another champion of Angkas at the House, also attended the event. His wife, Precious, was with him as well, She is currently running for the legislative district post. Royeca said Saturday’s event was not a political rally and that Angkas is “not endorsing anyone.” But he said that the event was a “safe and open platform” for candidates to talk about their bid. Angkas has gained popularity from the commuting public as a “cheap and fast” transport service. But its operations faced legal hurdles when the LTFRB first ordered it closed in November 2017. A Mandaluyong court allowed Angkas to hit the streets again in September 2018, but this short-lived victory was struck down by a Supreme Court temporary restraining order that allowed law enforcers to apprehend Angkas bikers if they continued to operate. Aside from the legal hurdle, transportation officials and advocates have long expressed concerns over the safety of passengers boarding motorcycles. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride)  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/227314-ascent-launches-helicopter-ride-sharing-service/","title":"Startup launches helicopter ride-sharing service","date":"Apr 3, 2019 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Tech startup Ascent offers ride-sharing in the skies","body":" MANILA, Philippines – If you’re tired of the endless traffic in the metro and willing to shell out thousands of pesos, then a new helicopter ride-sharing service may be for you. On Wednesday, April 3, tech startup Ascent launched a service that offers ride-sharing in choppers, similar to carpooling. It will be run by pioneer operator INAEC Aviation Corporation. Currently, Ascent offers bookings to and from the following areas: The service, however, is not for the ordinary Filipino commuter. A ride from Makati City to BGC, which takes only roughly 3 minutes via air, costs P6,900. NAIA to Tagaytay costs P21,900 for a 20-minute flight or so, while NAIA to Clark is P25,900 for a 30-minute ride. Passengers have to log on to Ascent’s website. They may opt to book at their own time, or choose a set schedule by the firm.  Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinai-Sinelnikoff said the firm aims to provide another solution to the metro’s worsening traffic situation. “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region. We hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant to the current times’ economic productivity pitfalls,” said Sinai-Sinelnikoff. Ascent uses 7-seater Bell 429 and 5-seater Airbus H125 aircraft to carry commuters.  Passengers may opt for more services such as add-on luggage, on-ground guest assistance, airport transfers via helicopter, shuttle services to dedicated heliports, and corporate packages. Ascent was founded last year by Sinai-Sinelnikoff and chief commercial officer Darren Tng. It plans to expand routes to the Visayas and Mindanao later this year, and eventually around Southeast Asia. In 2015, ride-hailing giants Uber and Grab Philippines launched their respective chopper services, UberChopper and GrabHeli. Uber has since sold its entire Southeast Asia business to Grab, while the GrabHeli option is no longer available in the Philippines. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/225250-video-angkas-dante-gulapa-collaboration/","title":"WATCH: Angkas x Dante Gulapa is the collab you didn’t know you needed","date":"Mar 8, 2019 1:57 PM PHT","snippet":"We didn't ask for it – but we got it anyway","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In the world of the Philippine interwebs, viral sensation Dante Gulapa and the online persona of motorcycle ride-sharing platform Angkas, are undisputed superstars.

In it, Dante – wearing motorcycle protection gear and an Angkas-branded brief – dances to the very LSS-inducing “Angkas Tara Na.” “Royalty ba ‘kamo? The KING EAGLE Dante Gulapa will grace the Angkas stage for the first time!” said the ride-sharing platform on Facebook. They also tweaked their logo a bit – instead of wheels, the motorcycle is fitted with Dante’s now-iconic nipple tattoos.

Here’s how to save a little cash while commuting around the metro: Avoid rush hours Think about it: how many hours do we actually spend commuting? An extra 30 minutes of sleep may not be worth that extra hour or two traveling. Leaving earlier in the morning reduces the stress on both your body and your budget. For one, you have lesser competition when it comes to booking a ride or getting a seat on the train. Next, you get to beat the surge price of rush hours. And for nights? It may be time to pick a hobby. Why not get into jogging or some other exercise. Not only do you get to skip the traffic, but you might also start hitting your health goals. That’s hitting two birds with one stone! Share a ride Got extra time to spare on your trip? Why not carpool with a friend or share a ride with a stranger? Not only do you get to save when someone is sharing the bill with you but, by not commuting alone, at least you could get into a good conversation that could help your travel time fly by. Take advantage of points and special features Sometimes walking or taking the public transportation just won’t cut it if we’re going to a wedding or a dinner date, for example. In cases where we need to stay neat and fresh, we would, of course, opt for a more convenient way to commute like taking a Grab. While the fares can go up from time to time, there are promo codes that you could use if you’re traveling during off peak hours or on certain days. However, if you prefer to travel on your own time, using services like GrabPay Credits is for you. You get three times more points which you can use for discounts versus when you use cash. If you’re worried about going beyond your budget, you don’t have to because it doesn’t work like a credit card. You can set a budget and cash in to your app through a Grab driver, credit/debit/prepaid cards, or 7-11’s bills payment, and monitor your expenses with the transaction history in your app. You can also use your GrabPay Credits to buy prepaid load for all networks at 5% off.  How about you?

Unemployment around the world fell in 2018 to 5.0% – from 5.1% in 2017 – for the first time dropping to the level seen before the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the International Labour Organization said. But in its flagship “World Employment and Social Outlook” trends report, the ILO also raised serious red flags about the health of the planet’s job market. Deborah Greenfield, ILO’s deputy director-general, told journalists in Geneva that the decline in global unemployment “is projected to stall,” amid “uncertainty on many fronts,” and a “deteriorating economic outlook.” The UN agency said it expected the jobless rate to remain at roughly the same level this year and in 2020, although the number of unemployed people should swell by two million to a total of 174 million next year as a result of the expanding labor force. In particular, the report highlighted the hundreds of millions of people who remain poor despite holding one or more jobs. In fact, it found that a majority of the 3.3 billion people employed around the globe last year suffered a “lack of material well-being, economic security, equal opportunities or scope for human development.” “Being in employment does not always guarantee a decent living,” ILO research director Damian Grimshaw said in a statement, pointing out that “a full 700 million people are living in extreme or moderate poverty despite having employment.” The report found that a full 61% of all workers worldwide, or two billion people, are in so-called informal employment, with little to no social and contractual protections. Greenfield cautioned that some new and emerging business models, such as using new technologies to create temporary work through web-based platforms for things like ride-sharing services, could expand that number if not regulated properly. “Without the right policy measures it could easily add to the informal labor force,” she said. Among other issues highlighted in the report was the lack of progress in closing the gender gap in labor force participation, especially in the Arab states, North Africa and southern Asia. ILO found that just 48% of women are in the workforce, compared to 75% of men, meaning that around 3 in 5 employed people last year were men. In the Arab states, for instance, the report found that the unemployment rate for men stood at 15.6% – 3 times that for men. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/222358-grab-philippines-launches-new-app-features-january-2019/","title":"Grab launches 8 new app features","date":"Jan 31, 2019 12:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Among the new features include saving places, rewards points for being canceled on by drivers, and many others","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to be the “everyday app” of Filipinos, ride-sharing giant Grab Philippines beefed the app with new features.

Rewards points for passengers canceled on: If a driver cancels the passenger booking, the user will now get 30 GrabReward points which will be credited within 24 hours. GrabRewards is the firm’s loyalty program which can be used to purchase food, services, discounts.  Change destination: In case of last minute changes for drop-off points, users can now modify their destination while in transit. Users have to wait to be picked up before they can change the drop-off point. Changing their destination can be done by viewing the driver details and then tapping “change” on the right side of the supposed drop-off point.

But pollution and safety concerns have led to a modernization program, with jeepneys 15 years or older to be taken off the streets by 2020. “This is an act of treachery against fellow Filipinos,” said de la Cruz. “This is a uniquely Filipino product. We were born with it.” When he began 45 years ago, there were hundreds of artists giving the vehicles their famously boisterous paint jobs. Now there are estimated to be fewer than a dozen left.  He has seen orders decline from a high of up to 80 a month in the 1980s to just one or two now.  His canvas is being replaced by eco-jeepneys, powered by electricity or lower-polluting diesel motors. Riders of old jeepneys currently have to climb in through a hatch in the rear, cramming into the benches inside with no respite from the heat and roadside pollution. On borrowed time  The jeepney’s successor is being billed as a big improvement.  It has doors, individual seats, air-conditioning, and enough height to stand up.   But it will be mass-produced and look just like a public bus.  Skipping over the jeepney’s bespoke production process in small workshops means a loss of the individual style and flair that made them global symbols of the Philippines. “It’s one of the most genuine forms of modern folk art that we have,” Bernie Sim, a Manila-based graphic designer and co-author of a 2014 book on jeepney art, told AFP. French fashion designer Christian Louboutin launched a jeepney-themed handbag collection last year, while Swedish furniture giant Ikea painted a jeepney in its signature blue and yellow to announce plans to open a Philippine store. But the vehicles, which were first made from leftover US jeeps after World War II, have been on borrowed time for years. Jeepneys are highly polluting, and the Philippines is desperate to improve air quality in its traffic-clogged cities.  Their drivers are also notorious for ignoring traffic rules, and the vehicles have few safety features.  On top of that, Manila ushered in internet-based ride-sharing services in 2014, and 3 years later President Rodrigo Duterte said the jeepney must evolve or disappear. ‘I cry quietly’ “They have all but stopped making jeepneys,” said 52-year-old jeepney artist Vic Capuno, based in San Pablo town south of Manila. As a result he and a colleague at Armak Motors now paint just 3 of 4 jeepneys a month. De la Cruz worked on 9 in the last year. He’s the only painter left at Manila’s Sarao Motors, once the country’s biggest producer. Two of his siblings were also jeepney artists, but they died from diseases he believes were caused by years inhaling fumes from the paint.  Yet he is still passionate about the vehicle’s importance in Philippine history.   “When the jeepney disappears a piece of Filipino culture will also die,” de la Cruz warned. A self-taught painter, he was inspired by the work of renowned local artists such Carlos Francisco and Fernando Amorsolo. His jeepney designs, still seen on the streets for now, chronicle the rapidly changing landscape of his home – Las Pinas – from a farming and salt-making backwater into a highly urbanised area. “It’s a pleasing sight. It brings us back to a time and place that is no more,” said de la Cruz. After raising 4 children on the pay earned painting, he now also creates canvases and makes storefront signs as a sideline. He conceded he could have a decent life without the jeepneys, but was heartbroken by the government’s decision.   “I would like to appeal to the authorities not to outlaw it,” de la Cruz said. “At times I cry quietly when I think about what is happening.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/221003-not-guilty-libel-trillanes-davao-court/","title":"Not guilty of libel, Trillanes tells Davao City court","date":"Jan 15, 2019 11:03 AM PHT","snippet":"Davao City Branch 54 Judge Melinda Alconcel Dayanghirang orders mediation between the two camps on March 21","body":" DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes IV on Tuesday, January 15, pleaded not guilty to all 4 counts of libel filed against him by President Rodrigo Duterte’s son, Paolo Duterte, and son-in-law Manases Carpio.

The libel charges stemmed from Trillanes’ accusations linking Paolo Duterte and Carpio to shabu smuggling, as well as alleged extortion of ride-sharing companies such as Uber.  Last week, Trillanes filed a petition for review before the Department of Justice, which has 60 days to decide. Pending a DOJ decision, the court ordered a mediation between parties.  In the same hearing, Trillanes also asked the court to consider his motion for travel for his upcoming official trip to the United States from January 27 to February 10.

Rainier Madrid, counsel of Paolo Duterte and Carpio, said they would heed the judge’s order but gave no assurance it would succeed.

The move comes one day after rival Lyft launched the process to take the company public with a stock offering. The Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said that Uber could go public as soon as the first quarter, while Lyft is targeting its market debut for March or April 2019. Uber, which operates in over 60 countries, is in a race with Lyft to be the first to enter the market. Company CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had mentioned since joining Uber in late August 2017 that he was hoping for an IPO in the first half of 2019. Uber is already the largest of the venture-backed “unicorns” valued at more than $1 billion, which until recently was considered rare without tapping stock markets. In mid-October, the Journal reported that JPMorgan had been chosen along with Credit Suisse and Jefferies Group for its IPO next year, which could value Uber as high as $120 billion. If its valuation tops $100 billion Uber’s IPO would be the biggest ever in the tech sector, and worth more than the combined value of the three big automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. An IPO of such magnitude would especially be a mark of investor confidence for Khosrowshahi, who replaced the controversial Travis Kalanick, pushed out the door by investors anxious over a string of scandals. Khosrowshahi has vowed to fix the company’s work culture and business practices after a series of missteps and scandals over executive misconduct, a toxic work atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. For now, Uber has further increased its losses in the third quarter to more than a billion dollars.

It was earlier reported that Dayanghirang issued one arrest warrant against Trillanes on Friday, over a libel complaint of Paolo, but she issued 3 more that day. In all 4 warrants, Dayanghirang ordered law enforcement agencies, particularly the Philippine National Police Criminal Detection and Investigation Group (CIDG), to “bring said accused before me to be dealt with according to law.” Dayanghirang said Trillanes should be presented to her “within 10 days upon receipt” of the arrest warrants’ copies. Dayanghirang prescribed a P24,000-bail bond for each case, which the senator can deposit to any office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue or municipal and city treasurers office, and furnish her with the certificate of deposit “written as undertaking.” In case of arrest, Trillanes can also post bail in any court upon the approval of the judge, who has jurisdiction over the area he would be held in. ‘Merry Christmas’ On his Facebook page, Paolo deemed the judge’s orders as an early holiday gift. “I’m okay with this. Merry Christmas,” he wrote in a post where he also uploaded a copy of the warrant. Carpio has not made any statement so far. In September, Paolo and Carpio filed separate libel complaints against Trillanes before the Davao City prosecutor’s office after his father, President Rodrigo Duterte, sought to void the senator’s amnesty granted to him during the previous administration. They accused Trillanes of making “false, baseless, and unfounded” claims that they demanded money from ride-sharing companies, particularly Uber. Their complaints were based on a teleradio interview over DYAB Cebu on September 8, 2017, where Trillanes had claimed that Paolo and Carpio connived with Region 7 Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Regional Director Ahmed Cuison to extort money from Uber. They attached a transcript of the radio interview in their complaint. Later in September, the two filed more libel complaints  against Trillanes for allegedly maligning them in public, such as accusing them of involvement in the illegal drugs trade and smuggling. Trillanes on Friday slammed the issuance of the arrest warrant as reflective of the “topsy-turvy” justice under the Duterte administration, where critics are jailed or under threat of jail, while “plunderers” go free.

He said that based on the circular, “the service of warrants of arrests for minor cases like libel on Fridays, weekends, and holidays is prohibited per existing DOJ circular and that under Article VI, Section 11 of the Constitution, as a member of Congress, I am privileged from being arrested in cases punishable by less than 6 years imprisonment while Congress is in session.” Trillanes had said that he would post bail on Monday, December 11. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/218423-davao-city-court-orders-trillanes-arrest-december-2018/","title":"Davao City court orders arrest of Trillanes","date":"Dec 7, 2018 4:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Judge Melinda Alconcel Dayanghirang issues the warrant of arrest against the senator in connection with the libel case filed by presidential son Paolo Duterte","body":" DAVAO CITY, Philippines – A Davao City judge on Friday, December 7, issued a warrant of arrest against Senator Antonio Trillanes IV over the criminal case of libel filed against him by presidential son and former Davao City vice mayor Paolo Duterte. In a one-page order, Judge Melinda Alconcel Dayanghirang of the Regiona Trial Court Branch 54 ordered law enforcement agencies, particularly the police’s Criminal Detection and Investigation Group (CIDG), to “bring said accused before me to dealt with according to law.”   Dayanghirang, however, allowed Trillanes to post bail.Dayanghirang said Trillanes should be presented to her “within 10 days upon receipt” of the arrest warrant copy. She prescribed P24,000 as bail bond, which the Senator can deposit to any office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue or municipal and city treasurers office, and furnish her with the certificate of deposit “written as undertaking.” In case of arrest, Trillanes can also post bail in any court upon the approval of the judge who has jurisdiction over the area he would be held in. On his Facebook page, Paolo was obviously elated at the arrest warrant against Trillanes. “I’m okay with this. Merry Christmas,” he wrote, as he also uploaded a copy of the warrant. In September, Paolo filed the criminal complaint for libel against Trillanes with the Davao City prosecutor’s office after his father, President Duterte, voided the senator’s amnesty. He accused Trillanes of making “false, baseless, and unfounded” claims that he and his brother-in-law, Manases Carpio, demanded money from ride sharing companies, particularly Uber. In his complaint, Paolo said that, in a teleradio interview over DYAB Cebu on September 8, 2017, Trillanes had claimed he and Carpio connived with Region VII Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Regional Director Ahmed Cuison to extort from Uber. He attached a transcript of that radio interview in his complaint. “Respondent’s teleradio accusations and black propaganda against me and Atty Carpio are pregnant with malice aforethought and evil intent,” Duterte said in his complaint, adding that friends in Cebu called his attention to the false allegations. “Watching it, I was aghast to hear the respondent maliciously accusing me and my brother-in-law of supposed rampant and widespread corruption and extortion,” Paolo said, adding that the accusations were based on information reportedly fed to Trillanes by a source whom the senator did not identify. “Worse, respondent had also defamed and labeled me and Atty. Carpio of corruption and extortion not only against Uber and the “other companies” but also in the Road Board and in DPWH as part of supposed corrupt tentacles and shakedown,” Paolo said. After filing the case, Paolo said Carpio was also filing a separate complaint from the said interview. The criminal complaint for libel was the latest that Paolo filed against Trillanes. In December 2017, he and Carpio also sued Trillanes for civil case of libel with damages over the latter’s claim that they were involved in extortion against Uber. Paolo had said Trillanes had been maligning him, accusing him of such things as involvement in the illegal drugs trade and smuggling. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/215632-uber-lyft-monthly-subscription-plans-us/","title":"Uber, Lyft implement monthly subscription plans in U.S.","date":"Oct 31, 2018 11:45 AM PHT","snippet":"The ride-sharing rivals try to lower monthly travel costs for passengers with a new subscription model","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – US ride-share rivals Lyft and Uber are out to lure everyday riders with monthly passes for discounted or free rides, dabbling with a subscription model aimed at commuters. Uber on Tuesday, October 30, US time, introduced “Ride Pass” in five cities to let users lock in lower rates by paying monthly subscription fees. Uber “Ride Pass” costs $14.99 a month in Austin, Denver, Miami and Orlando, and $24.99 per month in Los Angeles. Prices at ride-share services rise or fall depending on demand. For example, a ride into work early, ahead of the pack, is typically cheaper than a ride home at day’s end during peak commute time when “surge pricing” kicks in. “One thing we hear a lot from riders is that changes in price, however small, can make it tough to plan their day with Uber,” product manager Dan Bilen said in a blog post. “The daily commute is a classic example, and it goes something like this: you pay one low price for the ride to work, only to find the ride back home is a different story.” Lyft earlier this month unveiled a subscription plan that lets passengers pay $299 monthly for 30 rides priced at $15 or less. Passengers pay the difference for rides costing more than $15. “This is the first step toward delivering on our goal of making car ownership optional,” Lyft said in a blog post. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/214930-grab-train-drivers-as-emergency-first-responders/","title":"Grab to train drivers as emergency first responders","date":"Oct 22, 2018 10:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab drivers will no longer just get you to your destination.

The ride-hailing company launched its Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap on Monday, October 22, which features various programs, including a commitment to train drivers to be part of a pool of first responders. Drivers will be fully equipped with first aid kits and safety training guides. Grab also entered into a collaboration with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for crime and accident prevention. Grab, together with the PDEA and the LTFRB, will synchronize efforts to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs. The partnership also aims to identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations as well as keep the ride-hailing service drug-free. Grab will also conduct road safety, anti-carnapping, and other anti-criminal seminars and training with the PNP-HPG. “Safety in the TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry should be a collaborative effort between transport network companies, government agencies, driver-partners, and passengers. Our passengers and driver-partners deserve a safer ride-sharing industry,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. Analytics for safety The roadmap also features enhancements on Grab’s driver platform, which tracks driver fatigue for them to “learn their driving patterns” and “identify how to drive more safely.” The driver fatigue monitoring system gives drivers reports on their patterns, such as in speeding, acceleration, and braking. The firm said there has been a 50% reduction in speeding incidents and a 20% reduction in hard braking and sudden acceleration since it rolled out the feature. “Our goal is to bring to zero the number of incidents that are completely preventable, and as far as possible, reduce the number of road accidents. Key to achieving our goal is to make it easy for users to make an actual change to their road behavior habits,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling. Grab said its roadmap is aligned with the Department of Transportation’s vision to reduce the road accident death rate by at least 20% by 2020. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/214819-facial-recognition-advertising-admov/","title":"Tech start-up uses facial recognition for ‘meaningful’ ads","date":"Oct 21, 2018 4:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Tech start-up AdMov installs tablets in the backseats of cars of ride-hailing services.

For instance, people are bombarded along EDSA with too much information, at times irrelevant to them.  On the other hand, advertisers are unable to reach their intended audience due to saturation and visual fatigue. A start-up in the Philippines claims it may have found the solution, and says it’s a win for both advertisers and consumers: facial recognition. {source} <iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHLdIOip8yA” frameborder=”0″ allow=”autoplay; encrypted-media” allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source}   How it works Tech start-up AdMov installs tablets in the backseats of cars of ride-hailing services like Grab. The drivers apply for the installation and get incentives for every playback of advertisement on the tablet.  But the magic begins once a passenger hops on the car. The tablets use their cameras to scan the faces of passengers in the backseat. Using facial recognition technology, the tablets can estimate the gender, age, and even mood of the passenger. Using the information generated, the tablet then is able to curate the appropriate content and advertisements that are intended for the passenger.  “When we show ads, it gives data to advertisers as well. We use this for targeting and for brands. There is no wastage,” said Bobby Cristuta, co-founder of AdMov. The artificial intelligence (AI) software also takes into consideration the location of the vehicle. For instance, if one is in Pasig City, it shows a presentation that features a brief history of the area.  For advertising purposes, it also shows passengers recommended restaurants. If one is near malls or passing through EDSA, the tablet can also alert passengers if there are sales nearby. Ellard Capiral, founder and CEO of AdMov, said that they offer a “right mix” of advertising and “meaningful content” to keep the passengers glued on to the screen. “The program also tracks eyeballs. If you are no longer paying attention to the ad, we mix it up and offer content like trivia and that pulls the passenger’s attention back,” Capiral said. Security concerns Since the technology uses the camera and facial recognition, is there a privacy breach? Capiral and Cristuta claimed there is none, since it only scans and approximates the age, gender, and mood of passengers. “We do not store photos and videos, the camera is there just to scan. Advertisers only have access to estimates, but they won’t see your face,” Cristuta said. They also claimed that their legal team ensured that the technology does not breach the provisions of the data security act. (READ: Data privacy 101: What businesses should know about systems registration) AdMov’s tablets are currently installed in some 500 ride-sharing vehicles in the Philippines. They plan to expand to Singapore and Taiwan next year.  Trends and future applications Based on the data-driven advertising approach, AdMov is able to provide a “geekier” insight on consumer behavior. “We had a client that was able to tweak their advertisement to have more impact through the analytics,” Cristuta said.  They also found that the trivial and funny are a big hit for consumers. “We also screen the ads and content. If we feel the ad does not fit in our lineup of content, we outright reject and do not include it since we want the attention of passengers. If it does not catch attention, it hurts our other advertisers as well,” Capiral said. The company says they see the future of their technology for news applications as well. “If a passenger passes through an area and there is a major accident or fire there, they can be alerted. But we need more partners for that type of content,” Cristuta said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/214370-grab-exercise-recipe-videos-idooh-active8me/","title":"Exercise, recipe videos coming to a Grab ride near you","date":"Oct 15, 2018 5:00 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Soon, Grab riders will be able to watch people in motion and yummy dishes while enduring the traffic","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Exercise videos and recipe videos are coming soon to Grab rides in the Philippines.  Singapore-based out-of-home advertising firm IDOOH International and fitness-oriented tech company Active8me have partnered to show instructional fitness videos and recipe videos on Grab rides.

Almost half a year has passed but the firms have yet to make a difference in the market. When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the country’s anti-trust agency, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), warned of a “virtual monopoly” of the industry. Grab Philippines offers ride-hailing services for sedans, taxis, 6-seater vehicles, and premium cars. It also introduced ride-sharing in the market. In a bid to “break the monopoly,” the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 6 new transport network companies (TNCs) – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto and GoLag in April; and ePickMeUp in June. They were set to challenge Grab’s dominance in the ride-hailing industry, as drivers, too, had more choices on companies to link up with. But the companies are faced with problems that keep them from making a difference in the market, ranging from capital investments to recruiting drivers and getting riders. Where are they now?  Taxi apps ‘are okay’ In the case of taxis, the LTFRB recently recalibrated meters to implement the fare hike that would include a P2-per-minute travel charge. The flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer.  The LTFRB also now requires operators to have a mobile application from an accredited TNC. It leaves them to choose from taxi-only firms Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated and MiCab Systems Corporation, or those with mixed services such as Grab or Hype Transport Systems. In separate interviews with Rappler, executives of MiCab and Hirna said that they have been faring well since they were accredited in May. For one, both firms do not charge booking fees, which they think should attract riders as they would only have to pay for the amount on the taxi meter. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Coco Mauricio, Hirna’s founder and managing partner, said the LTFRB should review the cap on the franchises given to taxis as public utility vehicles. “We’re doing okay. But it can be better if more taxis would be joining us; if the cap for the taxis are increased,” said Mauricio. MiCab, for its part, currently has 7,000 registered taxi drivers and operators in some key urban areas such as Metro Manila, Baguio, Cebu, and Iloilo. Hirna has some 6,500 partners operating in Davao City, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Bohol, Bacolod, and Iloilo. But MiCab acknowledged the fierce competition, especially with the taxi services being offered by Grab under GrabTaxi. “Competition is fierce, especially with global multinational companies and very rich companies in the Philippines. There’s Hype, and Grab is a multibillion-dollar company,” Kris Montebon, MiCab’s head of operations, told Rappler. In July, MiCab accused Grab of “phantom bookings” on their platform, and of  creating fake accounts to sabotage MiCab operations. MiCab accused the company of  attempting to poach its drivers too. Montebon said that MiCab’s key advantage is its particular focus on the taxi industry. In a way, he said, it is “improving its service quality,” as there has always been a negative commuter perception of taxis. There are an estimated 42,000 taxi operators nationwide but the figure has never been adjusted for the longest time. When the LTFRB suspended Uber for a month in 2017, it said it was studying a proposal to increase the cap on taxis in Metro Manila. Competing with the giant Other ride-hailing firms competing head-on with Grab for riders and drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) face more challenges. Despite having thousands of drivers registered on their platforms, Hype and Owto are having a hard time keeping their drivers online because of incentive schemes “not at par with Grab.” On top of financial constraints, both firms still experience minor glitches on their apps. Hype chief operating officer Jen Silan told Rappler that only 30% of their 10,000 to 15,000 bookings per hour are being served. Hype has 13,000 taxi and TNVS drivers combined. “Bookings served are still quite low. Honestly, not all the 13,000 drivers are going online so we were not able to serve a big percentage of the total bookings yet. Of course, there is still the perception among the riders that if there are no drivers in your area, then it would be hard to book,” Silan said. She also noted that competing with Grab is a challenge in terms of capital investments. Hype’s commission per ride is set from 5% to 15%. (READ: [OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters) “It’s really a challenge, especially if Grab is giving incentives that are not sustainable for the company (Hype). We’re not into that kind of competition. What we are offering to our drivers is permanent commission,” she said. Owto chief executive officer Joel Gayod said that the company also suffers from lack of drivers, making it unable to cater to its 86,000 booking requests daily.  Gayod complained that the “playing field is not fair” due to the “predatory practices” of Grab. “We’re facing a lot of challenges mostly because of the predatory practices of Grab. We can come up with an incentive scheme but what they do is practically giving away top-up that we cannot match. This kind of practice will kill us, the new TNCs,” Gayod said. While Grab takes up to 20% of the driver’s earnings, the ride-hailing giant gives a considerable payout through incentives to its TNVS partners, which Hype and Owto cannot match. “The LTFRB should always protect the new players. There should be some safeguards against these practices. Or else, we will die sooner or later and Grab will remain as a monopoly,” Gayod said. Some still adjusting Go Laguna (Go Lag) is the sole ride-hailing service offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by  TNVS drivers because of the distance. But it has yet to be fully operational, partly because of backend payment schemes being sorted out by the company, said Go Lag operations director Willie Bercasio. Bercasio told Rappler that there are currently 700 drivers that have signed up with them and there are around 150 on board. But Go Lag has been fielding only 50 rides per day in Laguna to avoid losing money. “We are still beta testing. If we take on more rides, we would start losing money because we also pay for our infrastructure like the bandwidth system,” Bercasio explained. He disclosed that they haven’t earned from the business yet, as they have not asked for service fees from the drivers so far. Meanwhile, ePickMeUp, the latest addition to the accredited firms, has yet to be launched. It used to be a logistics firm but it decided to venture into the ride-hailing industry. Viable competition The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2018-016 suspending applications for accreditation of new ride-hailing firms effective August 29. The LTFRB said it issued the order so it can focus on pending applications and to monitor existing ones.  This means that there are only 8 apps to choose from, including U-Hop, until the regulatory board accredits a new firm. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo pointed out that it’s not so much about the number of apps available for consumers, rather the viability of such firm to enter the market. “On paper, they are there. But have they made a dent in the market? We know that they haven’t, right? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,” Quimbo told Rappler in an interview. There were some 65,000 active drivers on Grab’s and Uber’s platforms, merged in a masterlist submitted to the LTFRB earlier this year. When Uber left, Grab mostly answers to the full demand despite the “undersupply” of drivers because not all drivers moved to its platform. Grab said that it only has 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day. To maximize the available number of franchises currently open, the LTFRB allowed 10,000 new drivers to apply as TNVS drivers. Quimbo acknowledged that current local players challenging Grab face a difficult task. She said the ride-hailing industry is a two-sided market – both drivers and riders should be satisfied enough to grow. “[They] need to attract the drivers and the riders. That in itself is a heavy capital requirement. The cash flow requirements are big if it comes to giving out incentives to both sides of the market. That’s the challenge,” she said. Grab has recently pulled in $2 billion worth of investments that brings its total funding to $6 billion – $1 billion of which is from Japanese car giant Toyota. The Financial Times reported the firm is looking at an $11-billion valuation.

Toyota also has investments in Grab, totalling $1 billion.  Technology from both companies will be integrated into purpose-built Toyota vehicles and deployed on Uber’s ride-sharing platform, with the first pilot rollout set for 2021. “The deal is the first of its kind for Uber and signals our commitment to bringing world-class technologies to the Uber network,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The agreement came as the smartphone-summoned ride service is throttling back its solo effort to develop autonomous vehicle technology.

The testing will enable Uber to gather data on different scenarios that will be recreated in computer simulations, and also develop more accurate mapping for the vehicles.

If unavoidable to pass by EDSA without a passenger, we encourage our drivers to use the yellow lane and take the nearest exit away from EDSA,” Leo Gonzales said, Grab’s public affairs head. On the first day of the dry run of the ban, many patrons of ride-hailing services were frustrated by the difficulty in booking rides. They also complained of heavier traffic in inner lanes as motorists avoided EDSA. Gonzales said that they have sought dialogues with traffic officials on the new scheme. “We agree that one way to solve congestion is to improve shared mobility. However, we hope that authorities will carefully put the interests of the ride-sharing industry as an important consideration in imposing new rules and regulations,” Gonzales said. Grab also urged its drivers and patrons to be more patient with the new scheme. “We ask our drivers and passengers to be patient as we work with the regulators to set an acceptable scheme that carefully considers sentiment and suggestions of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) market,” Gonzales said.

The films is oftentimes vibrant because Bautista takes the brunt of the humor, making the self-deprecation a tad more enduring. It also helps that Ahron Villena exudes a charismatic demeanor that adds a layer of verity to the unlikely love story. The film owes its meager pleasures to its protagonists’ chemistry. Trickles forward Harry & Patty opens with ride-share driver Patty (Cacai Bautista) in a droll sequence of her experiences with various passengers with very strange emergencies. One needs to give birth. Another needs to go to the bathroom. Another one needs to move on from a lover’s philandering. The last one, however, involves drunk and barely functioning Harry (Ahron Villena), who she has to bring up to his condo unit and provide extra care for. From there, the love story very slowly trickles forward. Alfonso mines the conceit of Patty and Harry being mismatched lovers because of the stark difference in their looks for laughs and giggles. Unfortunately, there are a few jokes that border being mean-spirited, with a lot of the characters wisecracking about Harry’s decision to court Patty. It seems that the film is unable to avoid grounding its comedy on the obvious, which is a stark sign of a deficiency in ambition.  Fluff and fantasies The film will inevitably reveal the point beneath its abundant fluff, which is that there is more to people than their looks. There is a twist at work, which is hoped to seal the deal, but only reinforces the idea that the love story of Patty and Harry is more a product of fantasy than a very real possibility. The film is very much confused about its endeavors. It imagines itself to be endearing with its narrative acrobatics but only ends up muddling the issue. It was simply better when the love was not reinforced by hidden personalities and agendas. It was more affecting when the attraction was really based on just love and not some forgotten history.  Harry & Patty, already busy as it is with its protagonists’ struggle to prove to everybody that they are indeed a match, riddles itself with other concerns. The film has too many characters. Some are even granted uninteresting sideplots that only distract. It is almost as if Alfonso and his team aren’t very confident with the worth of the central romance that they insist on crowding it with a lackluster one involving Patty’s brother (Mark Neumann) and his classmate (Heaven Paralejo). The sideplot involving Harry’s parents is also conveniently resolved, making it seem like a mere afterthought than an actual narrative milestone. Easiest of delights Harry & Patty is a cute but sometimes bewildering little romance. That’s it. Sadly, that is all it’s ever going to be with the very meager directions its plot takes to reach its predictable course.  It has promise but it mostly squanders it for the easiest of delights. – Rappler.com   Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun.

Around half of the funds came from Japanese car giant Toyota, which announced last month it was pumping $1 billion into Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-share company. Grab said a “significant portion” of the proceeds would go to developing operations in Indonesia, where it has partnered with local firm Ovo to offer what it said was the country’s most widely accepted mobile payments system. The announcement comes after Grab’s regional rival, Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, said in May it was investing $500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Singapore-based Grab, which operates in eight countries, launched an on-demand grocery delivery service in Jakarta last month. Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing market is expected to be worth $20 billion by 2025, according to research by Google and Singapore investment vehicle Temasek. However, Grab’s agreement to buy US giant Uber’s Southeast Asian business this year has run into trouble, with Singapore’s anti-monopoly watchdog calling for changes to the deal and threatening to overturn it.

Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber’s regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal “is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data” stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab’s board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the “partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.” The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls “profound change” in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a “once-in-a-century challenge.” “I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,” he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing “various services involving movement of people around the world.” Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year. The deal has run into trouble though, with Singapore saying in April that it would impose restrictions on the acquisition until it concludes a probe into whether the sale may have infringed competition rules. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is also reviewing the Grab-Uber deal.

The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the famously car-friendly city’s first people-walking business. “I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city, so I’ve never had to pick up dog poop,” McCarthy told AFP on a recent leisurely saunter in the Hollywood Hills. “I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I kind of said to my girlfriend, ‘Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.'” McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. Social disconnection has been linked in various studies to depression, heart disease, diabetes and cancer, and can shorten life as profoundly as regular smoking, according to some estimates. Eric Klinenberg, a professor of sociology at New York University, identified a major cause of loneliness in a recent column in The New York Times: a growing global culture of individualism.   ‘Human connection’  It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the “gig economy” has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers. “I’ve walked people that are married with kids that have tons of friends. It’s about convenience and it’s about location and basically having things your way,” McCarthy says. Meanwhile smartphones and social media have deepened divisions, replacing real human relationships with the ersatz companionship of a social media following. Instead of “screaming into the void of Twitter or Facebook,” McCarthy’s clients get to enjoy real human connections with people that don’t know them and won’t judge or gossip. {source}  <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Where does this path go?<br>If you don&#39;t walk it you will <br>never ever know.<a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/walking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#walking</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/hiking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#hiking</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/path?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#path</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/walk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#walk</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/mystery?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#mystery</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/poem?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#poem</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/haiku?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#haiku</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/true?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#true</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/life?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#life</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/thepeoplewalker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#thepeoplewalker</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/peoplewalker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#peoplewalker</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/adventure?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#adventure</a> <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/experience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#experience</a> <a href=”https://t.co/4cAFBZl6cp”>pic.twitter.com/4cAFBZl6cp</a></p>&mdash; The People Walker (@ThePeopleWalker) <a href=”https://twitter.com/ThePeopleWalker/status/996505991276478464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>May 15, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>  {/source}  “It seems like something new but it’s very similar to going to confession, to a bar, to a therapist, or going to a hairstylist,” he tells AFP. McCarthy is an aspiring actor, which makes him coy about revealing his exact age – “I guess I’m in my 30s,” he concedes – but auditions have taken a back seat to the business recently. “I still wouldn’t turn down a starring role opposite George Clooney,” he adds, just for the record. The business is on the cusp of making the kind of money McCarthy could call a living, with an app about to launch and grand plans for expansion across California, the US and, eventually, the world. All shapes and sizes  McCarthy has no idea how far his feet have taken him in the last two years but he walks clients four or five times a week, typically for an hour, and describes himself as more of a listener than a talker. “It’s less of a confession and more of a conversation. So I wouldn’t say that I’m getting the deepest darkest secrets and nobody is breaking down crying on our walks,” he says. McCarthy’s clients come in all shapes and sizes, and walk for a variety of reasons. Anie Dee, a Wisconsinite in her late 20s who decamped to LA seven years ago, had been driving for a ride share service, sitting down all day, and decided last year to get out more. “I have some health issues so walking long distances is very difficult for me. And so having somebody with me, we walk a lot further than I ever thought I could,” she told AFP. The freelance theater box office manager noticed as she began going out with McCarthy that her mood and outlook were noticeably more positive. “When you’re working a lot of desk jobs and you’re by yourself, you don’t really have that social aspect,” she said. “So when you go for a long walk it’s like, ‘I feel refreshed — this is really nice.'”. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/203609-beepbeep-ph-valet-service-car-pick-up-repair-service/","title":"Beepbeep.ph can pick up and have your car serviced with valet feature","date":"May 29, 2018 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"It's a feature designed for those who don't want to use their time to take their car to the repair shop","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In October 2017, online car shop directory beepbeep.ph launched to fulfill a simple task: helping car owners find automotive services, be it repairs, auto detailing, or paint jobs within their vicinity.  Founder Anton Ojeda wanted a way to make the whole process of having your car serviced and maintained easier for the casual car owner. He himself confessed that he wasn’t a gearhead, per se, and that he simply wanted to find the most convenient manner by which he could find and schedule servicing for his car.  To his, and his partner Paolo Acosta’s surprise, strangely there wasn’t anyone doing anything that would expedite the fulfillment of such a need. There are websites listing restaurants, and there’s AirBnb for home rentals, and Uber for cars. They didn’t see one for car servicing establishments.  In fact, they go so far as to say that based upon their research, a website that aggregates automotive services exists nowhere else in the world, and that beepbeep.ph may be first not just in the Philippines but the world.  What adds to the surprise is that the market certainly exists. Ojeda, in his presentation at the press event, shared that there are more than 3 million cars in Metro Manila. If each of these cars visited a shop twice a year for maintenance, that’s more than 6 million visits, he said. Ojeda looks at their service as a way to “modernize the car service industry.” They’ve partly done that by bringing all the 7,000 or so automotive shops in Metro Manila to an online, publicly accessible listing. The company said it took them about 4 months of legwork – going to the actual shop, and then verifying their legal documents – to bring them all to the site.  They intend to expand to provinces nationwide in a year, and are also targeting a Southeast Asian expansion by the end of next year.  The website also features user reviews for the shops.  Valet service The company is also expanding to new services, chief of which is a valet option – called Service Valet –that picks up your car from a given location like your house, then brought to a shop, and later returned after the service.  The company currently has 60 drivers and 30 more currently in training. “Our driver screening process is intense. We make sure they have a professional driver’s license, have experience, and we put them under rigorous testing wherein they drive several different car types,” Ojeda said.  Booking and scheduling with a shop are free but there is a fee for pick up and delivery. Rates for pick up and delivery are P1000 for a round trip and P600 for a one-way trip (pick-up point to shop or shop to delivery point). The drivers are also full-time employees of the company, and aren’t contractual in nature such as those in the ride-sharing industry. Trips are also insured at no cost to the customer – such that if anything happens at all, an insurance company can jump right in. Valet services are also fully documented by video for the duration of the trip.  Ojeda said that this service is especially valuable for those who simply don’t want to spend the time to take their cars by themselves to the shops. “With our time getting stretched further and further, we realized that a solution like beepbeep.ph’s Service Valet will help make people’s lives a whole lot better,” he said.  Ojeda also said that majority of shops don’t offer payment options beyond cash. But if they book through beepbeep.ph, they may opt to pay with other options such as credit cards. Assistance for drivers Also announced at the press event is their newly launched roadside assistance program, which has no membership fees, is open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and offered with non-cash payment options. They’re also launching the beepbeep.ph app in June, a key feature of which will be easy access to their roadside assistance program.  Beepbeep.ph has generated P150 million in funding from companies such as ASI Studios Inc., Brenmedia International Inc., and Synergy88 Realty and Development Corporation. Here’s a list of their featured services:  Beepbeep.ph’s partner shops are currently located in Pasig, Taguig, San Juan, Las Piñas, Valenzuela, Malabon, Quezon City, Manila, Marikina, Parañaque, Caloocan, Navotas, Makati, Mandaluyong, Muntinlupa, Pasay, and Pateros. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/203278-new-ride-hailing-apps-philippines-fares/","title":"How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?","date":"May 24, 2018 8:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Aside from Grab and U-Hop, Filipino commuters can now choose from MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Hype, and Go Lag","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Do you know the new ride-hailing apps? With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/202224-chris-brown-sexual-assault-lawsuit/","title":"Pop star Chris Brown named in sex assault lawsuit","date":"May 10, 2018 8:33 PM PHT","snippet":"The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, says she was lured to the singer's house following a concert at a nightclub on February 23, 2017 and was raped by Lowell Grissom, who performs under the name Young Lo","body":" LOS ANGELES, USA – A Los Angeles woman filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, May 9 against Chris Brown and a fellow rapper, alleging she was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted at Brown’s home during a drug- and alcohol-fueled party last year. The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, said she was lured to the singer’s house following a concert at a nightclub on February 23, 2017 and was raped several times by Lowell Grissom, who performs under the name Young Lo. She also alleges that another unidentified woman at the party assaulted her, forcing her into performing oral sex. The assault was all the more gruesome, the lawsuit alleges, as the attacker –identified as Doe X – was menstruating at the time.  “This is one of the most horrific cases involving alleged sexual assault that I have ever seen,” Gloria Allred, one of 3 lawyers representing the woman, said in a statement. “Our client, Jane Doe, has been severely traumatized by what she was forced to suffer.” According to the lawsuit, following a concert at 1 Oak club in West Hollywood, the plaintiff and her roommate went to an after party where they met Grissom and Brown and had their phones confiscated. The suit says that the plaintiff later ended up at Brown’s home as she was told by Grissom she could retrieve her cell phone at that location, where the party was continuing. “Our client alleges … she was forced to go to Brown’s home because she perceived that she would only be able to retrieve her phone there,” Allred said. The lawsuit said that the 29-year-old rapper provided alcohol and drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana, at his home. He also gave each female guest a clear capsule filled with white powder and instructed them to take it to have a “good time,” the suit alleges, adding that the plaintiff refused to take the drug.    ‘Wants justice for herself’  The complaint says that at one point, the plaintiff was led to a bedroom where several women were having sex with Grissom and Brown. “Plaintiff refused to undress and made it clear that she did not want to engage in any sexual activity with anyone,” according to the document. It said that the plaintiff was subsequently repeatedly raped by Grissom and assaulted by Doe X. She was later allowed to leave the room by Doe X, who instructed her to take a shower. “Plaintiff looked in the mirror and was horrified to see that she was covered in Doe X’s blood because Doe X had been menstruating,” the suit states. It said the victim eventually was allowed to call a ride-sharing service and went to a rape treatment center and to the police where she reported the assaults.  “She filed this lawsuit because she wants justice for herself, but she also wants to warn other young women about the potential danger to themselves if they have their phone taken away and if they go to Chris Brown’s house,” Allred said. Brown and Grissom’s publicists could not be immediately reached for comment. Contacted by Agence France-Presse, Los Angeles police said there was “no open investigation at this time regarding Chris Brown.” The pop star over the years has had several brushes with the law. He was convicted in 2009 of beating fellow singer Rihanna, his then girlfriend, who was forced to miss the Grammy Awards that year. In 2016, he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after a bizarre hours-long standoff with police in Los Angeles. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/201363-two-pronged-lambing-tampo-relationships/","title":"[Two Pronged] ‘Tampo’ and ‘lambing’ problems","date":"Apr 29, 2018 3:49 PM PHT","snippet":"'Daisy' asks our experts about a partner who doesn't quite understand her need for 'lambing'","body":"Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives. Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dra Holmes and Mr Baer, I like to ask if you have any sources that talk about “paglalambing.” My partner is a foreigner and I am a Filipino. I find him very cold especially when we have misunderstandings. During the times I am at the peak of my anger, I wish he would be more “malambing” rather than giving me the cold shoulder.  It came to a point that I told him directly to appease me rather than be cold towards me when I am angry. However, he is hesitant about this idea. Honestly, I am looking for that Filipino behavior in such situation. His cold treatment makes me feel uncared for and in the end, I am the one who appeases him instead. So, if you can share some sources that explains, “paglalambing,” it will be of great help. I think, orienting him about this behavior using reliable sources will enlighten him. Daisy ———————————- Dear Daisy, Thank you for your email. Cross cultural relationships can be a minefield as they add yet another layer of potential misunderstanding and difference to what may already be a possibly difficult interaction between two people. After all, class, background, education, religion, work, expectations etc. are already quite enough to deal with so when you add culture, customs, language, food and a myriad of other potential pitfalls, it requires a strong will to succeed in order to have a good chance of achieving compatibility. This is not necessarily a task borne equally. Obviously, a foreigner living in the Philippines faces different challenges to those he/she would face living in his home country with a Filipino spouse — likewise the Filipino. In addition, if there is significant disparity in power (financial usually) the weaker will be forced to adapt more than the stronger, however much this might not reflect an ideal relationship. Language may also be a stumbling block, at least until the couple have sufficient command of a common tongue, but even then one party is often more fluent than the other, which can lead to frustration or worse. But at the end of the day, it is a task both ought to face together. Tampo and lambing are important elements of Filipino behavior and foreigners truly invested in making a success of a relationship with Filipinos would be wise to understand what is involved. The other side of the coin, of course, is that there are facets of foreigners’ culture which Filipinos should be equally willing to understand. (Editor’s note: Tampo is Filipino term that loosely means losing interest or temporarily losing affection towards someone over a disagreement. Lambing, meanwhile, is the act of showing affection towards someone.)  The big question in all relationships is the extent to which each party is willing to compromise in order to meet their partners’ wishes and thus, improve the chances of success. All couples approach this differently. For example, for some, fidelity is paramount, for others not so much. For some, a house husband is fine, for others it’s anathema. Eating habits, sleeping habits, privacy expectations, sexual practices, children, their education — the list is endless but tampo and lambing certainly have their place. When it comes to cultural differences, compromise is also a requirement. How people manage these differences varies from couple to couple. It is clear from your email that at least in this respect (tampo/lambing) you expect your foreigner to respond to you in Filipino style and he is resisting. You need to have a conversation with him, explain how important this aspect of your relationship is to you and depending how he reacts perhaps make some concession elsewhere to sweeten what he perceives as a bitter pill. Be prepared, of course, for the standard counter-argument: why should we necessarily follow your cultural preferences in these circumstances rather than mine? If he is amenable, fine. If not, then you can give some thought as to his suitability as a partner since who would want such an unsupportive and uncaring man in their life, absent other compelling reasons. A brief survey on the internet reveals a considerable amount of anecdotal comment — covering the spectrum from “I will never acknowledge tampo” to “it is an integral part of a relationship with a Filipino”. For a more academic view, you can consult Filipino Psychology in the Third World by Virgilio G Enriquez (Philippine Journal of Psychology 1977 Vol 10 No 1 p8). All the best, JAF Baer  Dear Daisy: Thank you very much for your letter and for asking about any sources regarding paglalambing. Mr Baer has shared one rather scholarly article written by the late Dr Enriquez who is considered the father of Filipino Psychology. I think our book, Baer, J and Holmes, M. Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons (Anvil Publishing 2012) is also a good resource, as it tries to illustrate the difference between looking at our needing lambing as a stereotype vis-a-vis as a generalization. While this can hardly be considered an academic resource (and at the risk of seeming hopelessly biased, which I sure hope I am not), Mr Baer’s “Father of the Bride” speech at the wedding of former UP professor Chei Billedo (currently finishing up her Ph.D. in Amsterdam) and Frank Verhelst has a more accessible definition of lambing (and tampo): “Tampo is difficult to translate but easy to recognize. We are all familiar with the scenario where a woman is clearly upset and when asked what is the matter, replies ‘nothing,’ pouts and turns her head away like this and some even flounce out of the room. This, and variations on this theme, is tampo. Filipinas at this point expect their partners to respond with lambing. This roughly means a demonstration of remorse for the real or perceived affront plus a demonstration — preferably several demonstrations — of affection. Words, actions, gifts all work well in this situation but perhaps none so well as gifts. Note my use of the plural here. A large diamond may do the trick but five large ones will be infinitely more effective. And Frank, think how fortunate you are to live in Amsterdam, where you have a thriving diamond market a mere bicycle ride away!” I wonder, however, if sharing sources about paglalambing is enough to bridge the chasm between you. Doing so may come across as your saying: “Here. Read all these sources which will show I am right” — which is the type of message which will more likely get your partner to dig his heels in and refuse, rather than be more eager to do as you wish. This is exacerbated by his needing lambing too, as evidenced by your writing that he gives you the cold shoulder (tampo). As you say, “in the end, I am the one who appeases him instead” which I cannot help feeling is your making a kind of paglalambing to him, albeit begrudgingly — an attitude which perhaps is the exact opposite of what true lambing is and can be. In other words, we Filiinos do NOT have a monopoly of tampo and lambing; we are, perhaps, only quicker to give such feelings/messages names because we realize how important they are in helping relationships run more smoothly. It behoves us to remember this, because lambing is certainly not something that can be demanded or even expected as a “right,” or it does not come across as true lambing. Unless you tell us more about your relationship, perhaps what we have told you is as much as we can write to help you.

More and more local firms are also applying for accreditation.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Indonesia-based Go-Jek and two more local firms are interested to enter the Philippine ride-hailing market, a few weeks after California-based Uber left the country. Confirming a Reuters report, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Board Member Aileen Lizada told Rappler that Go-Jek executives will fly to the Philippines and meet with the agency on Tuesday, April 24, to discuss how the company can operate here. “They would like to personally introduce themselves and probably they will ask for the requirements [for transport network company (TNC) accreditation]. We will listen to what they have to offer,” Lizada said. TNCs provide pre-arranged transportation services using internet-based applications or a digital platform, connecting passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles. Back in December 2017, Go-Jek chief technology officer Ajey Gore told Reuters in an interview that his firm is planning to set up operations in the Philippines early this year, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow in the next few months. Go-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, was established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service. It then evolved into an on-demand mobile platform, providing transportation, logistics, mobile payments, and food delivery, among others. In February this year, the dominant Indonesian ride-hailing firm was able to raise over $1.5 billion from investors like BlackRock and Google. More local ride-hailing firms Other than Go-Jek, Lizada said there are two more local firms that have expressed interest in operating as a TNC: Cebu-based taxi-hailing platform MiCab and new ride-hailing firm Owto. “Owto and MiCab are applying for [TNC accreditation], while U-Hop and Grab are applying for renewal of accreditation,” Lizada told Rappler. She added that the LTFRB is set to grant TNC accreditation to Hiro, another local ride-sharing firm. (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?) The LTFRB earlier accredited GoLag Incorporated, Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated, and Hype Transport Systems Incorporated. The entry of these new ride-hailing companies comes on the heels of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) earlier warned that Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the local ride-hailing market. “The accreditation of new TNCs is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” said the PCC. The PCC is currently reviewing the local implications of the Grab-Uber deal. The antitrust watchdog had also ordered Grab and Uber to explain why the latter shut down, despite the commission ordering it to continue operating while the review is ongoing. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, saying that keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely would be costly. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/200766-fidel-ramos-congratulates-manuel-mogato-pulitzer-prize/","title":"FVR congratulates ‘Mr Mogato’ for Pulitzer Prize","date":"Apr 22, 2018 10:09 AM PHT","snippet":"'This is, indeed, an outstanding achievement for any respected journalist – a reflection of the dedication, personal discipline, and hard work you put in your chosen vocation,' former president Fidel Ramos says in his congratulatory letter to veteran journalist Manny Mogato","body":" Since he, along with two other Reuters colleagues, won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Duterte administration’s bloody campaign against illegal drugs, everybody has been congratulating veteran journalist Manny Mogato. Many of Mogato’s friends and sources expressed their admiration on Facebook, where they took turns hailing him, rightly so, as an inspiration for Filipino journalists in these times. Former president Fidel V. Ramos took one step farther by formally congratulating Mogato with an FVR-style congratulatory note.  The elder statesman is known to hand out personal letters. When he was president, he used to give letter-greetings to members of the Malacañang Press Corps who celebrated their birthday.  In his letter, Ramos, who has not hidden his disappointment with some of the policies of President Rodrigo Duterte, even took a swipe at the administration’s vaunted campaign against illegal drugs, which has drawn condemnation at home and especially abroad. “We and our children/grandchildren extend our warmest felicitations and sincere congratulations to you and – through you – to Clare Baldwin, Andrew RC Marshall, and your Reuters team for winning the prestigious ‘Pultizer Prize for International Reporting’ category for your series of investigations about the bloody illegal drug crackdown in the Philippines,” Ramos said. “This is, indeed, an outstanding achievement for any respected journalist – a reflection of the dedication, personal discipline, and hard work you put in your chosen vocation,” he added. These words may sound almost generic to some, but those who have known Mogato for a long time, especially his fellow former defense reporters, would know that FVR’s note is earnest and heartfelt, beaming with pride. Ramos and Mogato have known each other from way back, when Ramos was still defense chief and Mogato was a young reporter covering the defense-military establishment for the now-defunct Manila Chronicle under the Cory Aquino government. They would have tussles, as is normal in any journalist-public official relationship, especially since those were complex times for the military, as it faced at least 7 coup attempts by its rebellious officers. Ramos had to deal with a critical defense press corps, and he and his generals would call out Mogato and his colleagues for their coverage of their mutinous troops. Not a few times did Ramos also call the attention of Mogato during his press conferences, because Mogato tended to doze off as soon as the then defense chief began his opening statement. Yet, he was visibly fond of him. In his provincial trips, Ramos would often make special mention of the jolly reporter, warning soldiers he might eat all of their day’s ration. Mogato covered Ramos’ successful bid for the presidency in 1992 and was then assigned to cover him in Malacañang. So perhaps more than other former sources, Ramos can truly claim that he had tracked Mogato’s journalistic career and growth, and can rightly beam with pride over Mogato’s latest feat. “You have ably honed your skills since we first saw you spending long hours shuttling for breaking news at the then ‘interconnected’ PC/INP-AFP-DND-NDCC press beat, during our troop visits and inspections of disaster areas in the countryside as Defense Secretary, which became more frequent for the Malacañang Press Corps during my Presidency,” Ramos said. “May the Almighty’s bountiful blessings be always with you, your family and colleagues as you continue to perform your duties in the service of God, country, and people,” he closed his letter, which was also signed by former first lady Ming Ramos. Ramos has a special bond with reporters who covered him when he was the defense chief of then President Corazon Aquino. He shared rides with them on so-called “flying coffins” – Philippine Air Force Fokkers and vintage Huey helicopters – and many other adventures and misadventures that his defense press corps can only laugh about now. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/199787-weekly-video-highlights-april-2-8-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Videos to watch this week, April 2-8, 2018","date":"Apr 8, 2018 11:35 AM PHT","snippet":"It's been an eventful week – Aguirre's resignation, new AFP-PNP chiefs, and the 6-month closure of Boracay","body":"Dear Rappler readers, It’s been a week of changes in key positions in the Duterte administration.

The PCC released excerpts of Commissioner Order No. M-2018-001 pertaining to the interim measures on Saturday, April 7, a day before Uber was to transition its operations to Grab Philippines.   “In a bid to protect competition in a looming monopoly, the PCC issued a set of Interim Measures to ensure the welfare of the riding public and the drivers while the in-depth review of the Grab-Uber deal is ongoing,” the PCC said in a statement. PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo had announced the forthcoming release of the interim measures during a public hearing on the deal on Thursday, April 5, when it was first announced that the PCC had asked Uber and Grab to continue using their own platforms beyond Sunday, April 8. (READ: PCC asks Uber, Grab to continue separate operations beyond April 8) The PCC order, dated April 6, effectively stops Grab’s acquisition of its competitor temporarily until the PCC completes its “in-depth review” of the local implications of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to Grab.  Measures Under the interim measures, aside from maintaining the independence of their respective operations and other conditions that prevailed prior to the deal on March 25, Uber and Grab were also directed to “refrain from providing access to or from allowing a party to obtain from the other party any confidential information, including but not limited to information pertaining to pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, partner drivers, and customers.” The National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier expressed concern about privacy issues that may arise from the deal, saying personal data privacy should be respected and protected in the process. (READ: No migration of personal data to Grab in Uber app shutdown – privacy commission) The PCC also ordered the ride-hailing services to: Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order, but this will not be immediately executory as they will be given a chance to explain their side. Compliance report Referring to the continued independent operations after April 8, the PCC said in its order, “Should the Respondents failed to comply with item (a) above within five (5) working days from service of this Order, Respondents shall show cause within twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the aforementioned five (5) day period as to why they should not be held in contempt and subjected to penalties.” The PCC also ordered Uber and Grab to submit periodic verified compliance reports with supporting documents, the first within 15 days from the service of the order, and evern 20 days after. The PCC is mandated to protect competition in the market and prohibit anticompetitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. Virtual monopolization In a statement, PCC chairman Arsenio Balisacan said the looming monopoly may have consequences for Filipinos who avail of the ride-sharing services.   “This move by Uber in the Philippine market leads to further substantial concentration of what is, to begin with, an already highly concentrated ride-sharing market. This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,” he said.  “The PCC believes that Uber is capable of operating its ride-hailing app in the country, despite its claims that it has already exited the Southeast Asia market,” he added. The PCC chief cited the case of Uber operations in Singapore. “Uber’s compliance with our antitrust counterpart in Singapore to extend the operation of its app indicates the feasibility of continuing its operations in the Philippines as well,” he said.  Balisacan also said that Uber does not highlight the fact that it would become a “part-owner” of Grab through the deal. “Uber is highlighting its exit, but what it does not emphasize enough is its integration with Grab. Thus, Uber is not truly exiting the Philippine market, but rather effectively merging their operations with Grab here. The deal makes Uber a part-owner of Grab,” he said.   Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. The PCC has 75 days to come up with results of its motu proprio review on the Grab and Uber deal. – Rapppler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/199625-philippine-competition-commission-uber-grab-separate-operations/","title":"PCC asks Uber, Grab to continue separate operations beyond April 8","date":"Apr 5, 2018 4:35 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) But Uber Asia Pacific chief business officer Brooks Entwistle says the company no longer has the capital and people to continue its operations in the Philippines and 7 other markets","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The country’s antitrust watchdog, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), flexed its muscle and asked Uber and Grab to continue using their own platforms beyond Sunday, April 8. This is in order not to preempt the PCC’s voluntary review of the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to its rival firm Grab. After a 3-hour public hearing conducted by the two-year-old commission on Thursday, April 5, the PCC said it has come up with interim measures to ensure the integrity of the merger review. Tabled for discussion, among other measures, are maintaining the independence of Uber and Grab’s business operations while the review is ongoing, refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses, and refraining from sharing any confidential information like pricing. The PCC said it will also ask Uber and Grab to avoid practices that would reduce the business viability of parties involved, as well as avoid practices that would prejudice the watchdog’s power to review the transaction. “We will impose that the Uber and Grab [apps] will continue to operate beyond April 8, and that they will [still] be operating independently,” PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo said during the hearing. (READ: PCC warns Grab-Uber deal may have ‘far-reaching impact’ on commuters) ‘No capital, no people’ But Uber said it no longer has the capital and people to continue its operations in the Philippines and 7 other markets. “[From] a business standpoint, Uber exited 8 markets, including the Phiippines, as of Monday. Now, I look after 10 markets, instead of 18. Our funding is gone. Our people are gone. We don’t intend to come back to these markets,” Brooks Entwistle, Uber Asia Pacific chief business officer, said during the hearing. Grab, meanwhile, claimed the interim measures of the PCC are “unnecessary” as the end result of the transaction would not have a negative impact on commuters. “The interim measures will not be necessary because the concerns are not really real,” Grab external legal counsel Arlene Maneja said during the public hearing. “Any concern that the commission may have in relation to operating as a single entity is actually not a real concern because there is nothing in the transaction that actually merges the operations,” she added. Uber announced last March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. A day before the public hearing, Grab said the full transition of Uber drivers to its platform will push through despite the ongoing merger review. Even if the deal falls below the threshold of the PCC’s mergers and acquisitions review, the antitrust agency has used its power to start looking into the potential effects of the transaction, expressing concern that it would lead to “a virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market.” (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?)

The sale announced on Monday, March 26, ended a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marked the US firm’s latest retreat from international markets. But the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market – the first time such a directive has been issued in the city-state. Under rules which take effect immediately, the companies will not be allowed to integrate their operations until the CCS investigation is finished. They will have to maintain separate pricing and cannot obtain confidential information from each other like costing or customer and driver details. This is likely to prove a major stumbling block for the deal, under which Singapore-based Grab is set to take over Uber’s ride-sharing and food delivery operations in the region. In return Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business, with chief executive of the California-headquartered company Dara Khosrowshahi joining the Grab board.

This comes after Uber on Monday, March 26, announced that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.  Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8. “We have called Grab to a meeting next week to enlighten the commission on this ‘sale,’ particularly its provision on the processing of Filipino drivers’ and users’ data and the measures they take in protecting these data,” NPC Commissioner Raymund Liboro said in a statement on Tuesday, March 27. “As the biggest transport network vehicle provider in the Philippines after the exit of Uber, we want Grab to demonstrate that they could ‘walk the talk’ when it comes to protecting personal data and upholding the data privacy rights of its drivers and users.” (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?) Liboro added that Grab, through lawyer John Paul Nabua, assured the privacy watchdog of its continued cooperation and compliance with Philippine data privacy and protection laws. “Grab also declared to the commission that there will be no sharing of any user data between Uber and Grab. Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,” Nabua said. No impact on data breach probe The NPC on Tuesday said Uber’s merger with Grab would not affect the agency’s ongoing probe into a data breach in 2017, which exposed information on drivers and users of Uber. “This sale does not affect our ongoing investigation into past Uber breaches that involved Filipino users,” Liboro said. “This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,” he added. Back in November 2017, the chief executive officer of California-based Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, announced the firm failed to disclose a massive breach that exposed information on over 57 million users of the application. Uber had said that two individuals downloaded data from a cloud server used by the ride-sharing application, containing names, email addresses, and contact numbers of users. Meanwhile, Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said on Monday that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date.

Uber’s Southeast Asia operations will only be available until April 8. “To minimize disruption, Grab and Uber are working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders, Uber Eats customers, merchant partners, and delivery partners to the Grab platform. The Uber app will continue to operate for two weeks to ensure stability for Uber drivers,” Grab said in a statement on Monday, March 26. “We’re working hard to onboard Uber drivers onto the Grab platform. We appreciate your patience during this transition timeframe if there may be any service disruptions,” the ride-hailing firm added later on its website. In the immediate term, Grab noted that “nothing will change and operations will continue as normal.” Current Uber users’ account information, however, will not be shared with Grab. “If you are new to Grab, we will still need you to register your account with us to start riding,” Grab said. The firm added that fares would remain the same, with a dynamic surcharge applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. As for firms that use Uber as company transportation, Grab said: “Uber for Business services for employees of local and global companies will not be supported for trips taken in Southeast Asia after the transition. Uber rides outside of Southeast Asia will still be supported through existing Uber for Business agreements.” Grab had announced on Monday that it is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the acquisition deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. “We will retain our commitment towards quality of service and continue to adhere to regulatory guidelines on activations and pricing. Most importantly, we are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family. They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Grab Philippines country manager Brian Cu said in a separate statement. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was sought for comment on whether it will review the deal, which is seen to affect the local ride-sharing market. But representatives of the antitrust agency could not be reached as of posting. (READ: GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion) The Philippines in May 2015 categorized ride-hailing firms like Uber as a new mode of public transportation called transport network vehicle services (TNVS). These allowed the firms to fall under rules that allow “pre-arranged transportation services” using smartphones and other similar technologies. The Philippine government has since suspended the processing of TNVS applications twice, after issues on the scope of regulation as well as complaints from taxi operators who argued there was “unequal application” of rules. It was just on February 5 this year when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again opened TNVS franchise applications. Despite its aggressive expansion in the region, Uber still lags behind Grab, which covers over 2.3 million drivers in 168 cities across 8 countries. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/198968-grab-buys-uber-southeast-asia-operations/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab buys Uber’s Southeast Asia operations","date":"Mar 26, 2018 10:21 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return","body":" SINGAPORE (3rd UPDATE) – Uber sold its Southeast Asian business to rival Grab on Monday, March 26, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marking the US firm’s latest retreat from international markets. Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber’s latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. “Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.” Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab’s board as part of the deal, said: “This deal is a testament to Uber’s exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.” Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber’s losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/198540-uber-self-driving-car-kills-arizona-pedestrian/","title":"Uber self-driving car kills Arizona pedestrian","date":"Mar 20, 2018 10:23 AM PHT","snippet":"The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode, with an operator behind the wheel, when it hit a woman walking in the street in the city of Tempe late Sunday, according to the San Francisco-based company","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Ride-sharing giant Uber said on Monday, March 19, it is suspending use of self-driving cars after one of the vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in the US state of Arizona. The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode, with an operator behind the wheel, when it hit a woman walking in the street in the city of Tempe late Sunday, according to the San Francisco-based company.  The victim was hospitalized and later died from her injuries. “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokesperson told AFP. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.” Uber said it had temporarily halted its use of self-driving cars for testing or customer rides in Tempe, Pittsburgh, Toronto, and San Francisco.  Tempe is one of just two cities — along with Pittsburgh — where the ride-sharing firm has been using autonomous vehicles as part of its regular passenger. The vehicle operator in the driver’s seat was the only person in the car when the accident occurred, Uber said. The car was in police hands on Monday. Sunday’s accident was the first fatal self-driving car crash involving a pedestrian. The first deadly self-driving car accident was reported in mid-2016, and involved a Tesla. Sheriff needed? The Tesla Model S, cruising on “Autopilot,” failed to detect a crossing tractor-trailer against a bright sky, killing the driver – who it later emerged had kept his hands off the wheel for extended periods of time despite automated warnings not to do so. Investigators at the US National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the Tesla crash was the combination of “a truck driver’s failure to yield the right of way and a car driver’s inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation.” Autonomous-vehicle technology has been touted as having potential to save fuel, ease congestion, and to save thousands of lives by avoiding accidents due to human error. As with the fatal Tesla crash, however, the deadly Uber accident is likely to stoke concerns that the industry is moving too fast.  Google-owned Waymo this month began using its self-driving trucks to haul cargo bound for the internet giant’s data centers in Georgia, while rival Uber announced the use of self-driving semi trucks as part of an on-demand trucking service in Arizona. In September, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released new guidelines that permit more testing of self-driving cars. But America’s non-profit Consumer Watchdog has warned that roads are being turned “into private laboratories for robot cars with no regard for our safety.” The group on Monday called for a nationwide moratorium on testing self-driving cars on public roads while investigators figure out what went wrong in the Uber accident. “Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place,” Watchdog technology project director John Simpson said in a statement. “When there’s no sheriff in town, people get killed.” Car vision tests? US states set their own rules for roads, and a handful have passed laws allowing self-driving vehicles. California and Arizona have been particularly encouraging, hoping that companies developing autonomous technology in those states will create local jobs and facilities devoted to a promising new industry. Duke University robotics professor Missy Cummings is among the advocates of slowing down introduction of autonomous vehicles to avoid risk and get proper regulations in place. While machines are better at staying vigilant and reacting to routine situations, human drivers have proven superior at handling unusual or unexpected situations, according to the professor. Cummings reasoned that if people need to pass vision exams in order to get driving licenses, so should self-driving cars. She noted a case in which putting stickers on a stop sign could fool autonomous car sensors into seeing it as a sign indicating a speed limit. “If we are still learning at this rate, and still uncovering major problems, it begs the question of why we are trying to put this technology into widespread use,” Cummings told AFP. “I am a big fan of the technology, but it is very unproven and experimental.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/197775-daily-news-highlights-march-9-2018-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, March 9, 2018","date":"Mar 9, 2018 11:34 AM PHT","snippet":"Here are the stories you shouldn't miss this Friday","body":"Good morning, Rappler readers!

(READ: SoftBank seals deal for large Uber stake) Didi and Uber ended a ferocious battle in the surging Chinese market in 2016 with a tie-up along the lines of the reported deal with Grab. Southeast Asia’s top ride-hailing firm Grab launched services in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh late last year as it looked to lock down regional domination against main rival Uber. Grab, which launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding market, which is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore investment firm Temasek. While ridesharing giant Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, the US-based company has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe.

But rather than complement mass transit and other modes of transportation, these services compete with it, putting more individuals in cars; thereby increasing the number of cars congesting city streets. One study in San Francisco discovered that on a regular weekday, ride-hailing drivers can make more than 170,000 vehicle trips concentrated in the most congested parts of the city. The report said that this is 12 times the number of regular taxi trips in the same specified timeframe.  Another study found that the increase in taxis and ride-hailing service vehicles have significantly contributed to the slow traffic of Manhattan’s central business district. A survey conducted in 4,000 adults residing in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, to name a few, pointed out that as much as 61% of trips would not have been made – or would have been made by more traffic-friendly means such as walking, biking or by public mass transport – if ride-hailing didn’t exist.   Speed was the primary reason people used ride-hailing services, and that the higher cost doesn’t discourage people from choosing ride-sharing services over cheaper public transit, according to the survey in Boston.  Solutions on the horizon?  The growing body of research on the effect of ride-sharing services on traffic appears to point that the services may be adding to the congestion. Ride-sharing may be convenient, and people generally favor the service as evidenced by the services’ continuing popularity. However, that convenience may be coming at a price – and it will be up to the companies in question to tweak their product, and combat the growing evidence against them.  Ride-sharing poster boy Uber may already be taking initiative, as pointed out in AP‘s report as well. The company recently launched a service called Express Pool in the US. It’s a service similar to traditional buses where riders are picked up and dropped in common locations, and is said to be gaining traction and ridership in the US. As of writing, this service is not yet available in the Philippines. “This could be good for congestion if it causes vehicle occupancy rates to go up, but on the other hand, the Uber Pool rides and I guess these Express rides are really, really cheap, just a couple of dollars, so they’re almost certainly going to be pulling people away from public transport options,” Christo Wilson, a Boston Northeastern University computer science professor who has looked at Uber’s practice of surge pricing remarked in regards to the new service, told AP. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/196050-uber-earnings-2017-losses-grow-from-2016/","title":"Uber loss leapt to $4.5B in 2017 as final quarter showed hope","date":"Feb 14, 2018 2:59 PM PHT","snippet":"The losses grow from the $2.8 billion it lost in 2016","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Ride-share titan Uber on Tuesday revealed that its losses last year swelled despite signs in the final three months that it was stemming the red ink.

(READ: U.S. prosecutors confirm Uber target of criminal probe) The surprise agreement ended an image-bruising trial between the two Silicon Valley rivals competing in a race to develop autonomous cars, after four days of testimony before a federal judge in San Francisco. A source familiar with the confidential deal said Uber agreed to a financial settlement giving the Alphabet unit 0.34% of Uber shares – which would be some $244 million based on Uber’s valuation of $72 billion. Uber also agreed not to use any of Waymo’s technology for autonomous driving as part of the settlement, which was approved by Judge William Alsup as he dismissed the case. SoftBank recently took a 15% stake in Uber by acquiring shares from early investors at a discounted price, according to a source familiar with the terms of the deal. The investment was part of an effort by Uber to move past a series of scandals and missteps and reform its board structure as it gears up for a 2019 public share offering. Khosrowshahi has vowed to fix the company’s work culture and business practices. Even as Uber has seen unprecedented growth by expanding to dozens of countries, it has been hurt by missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic work atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/194445-transportation-angkas-grabbike-lgu-regulation/","title":"Should LGUs regulate habal-habal, motorcycle ride-sharing apps?","date":"Jan 24, 2018 10:21 PM PHT","snippet":"A technical working group is formed to deliberate on possible amendments to the law to make way for the services provided by apps like Angkas and GrabBike","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Should Philippine laws be amended to allow local government units (LGUs), instead of national government, to impose standards on modes of transportation like the ubiquitous habal-habal (motocrycle-for-hire)? It was a suggestion raised by lawmakers on Wednesday, January 24, as the House committees on transportation and public order and safety held a hearing on the possible regulation of “habal-habal,” the colloquial term of motorcycles used as a means of public transportation. Current laws on public transportation do not make mention of motorcycles, leading to the suspension of operations for ride-sharing applications like Angkas and GrabBike. Representatives Raul del Mar and Ramon Durano, both from Cebu province, made the suggestions as the committees began tackling possible revisions to the law. Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña, a vocal supporter of applications like Angkas, agreed with the sentiment. A former member of the House, the Cebu mayor called on more “autonomy” for LGUs. “These kind of social experiments cannot be decided in one office here in Metro Manila just by looking at maps and data. You have to go to the people and see how they feel. What we’re really asking for is more local autonomy,” he said during the hearing. The committee eventually agreed on the creation of a technical working group (TWG) to study and flesh out possible revisions to the law. The technical working group will eventually report to the mother committee, where further revisions and deliberations will take place. Realities on the ground  During the hearing, Osmeña had pointed out that national government had failed to address the “realities” of life outside of the metro. In far flung areas, for instance, the habal-habal can be the only means of transportation for locals. It’s either that or walking. Habal-habal in the Philippines can refer to motorcycles that can carry up to 8 passengers without any attachments or those that can carry even more thanks to the installation of makeshift wooden planks. The Cebu city mayor raised this when a motorcycle safety expert said that it’s recommended that only a maximum of two people ride a motorcycle at once. “If a mother has to bring her baby to the hospital using the habal-habal, what does she do? Does she tell the driver to bring the baby there first then come back to get her?” he said. Experts told the committee that ideally, a single motorcycle should carry only a maximum of 150 kilograms. Services like Angkas or GrabBike only allow one passenger for every motorcycle driver. “They’re not in the mountains, they’re not talking to these farmers who brings the child to school. They cannot do it from the 10th floor of a high rise building. You cannot look at the map and say ‘I know the problem.’ You have to be in the foxhole, you have to be on the field,” said Osmeña, explaining why he wants LGUs to have a higher stake in regulations such as that of public transportation. Besides, he said, if mistakes are made by one LGU, it can always learn from other who implemented programs better. Concerns were raised, however, that should LGUs be allowed to impose their own regulations, standards might be too different in different areas. These will all be fleshed out by the TWG. “You ask for federalism but you’re complaining about our ability to run our own affairs. Let the local government solve their own problems,” added Osmeña. Congress is current deliberating on possible amendments or revisions to the 1987 Constitution so that the country can shift to a federal form of government. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/194238-poe-ltfrb-math-tnvs-vehicles-cap/","title":"Poe to LTFRB: ‘Explain the math’ behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles","date":"Jan 22, 2018 2:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber are around 125,000, exceeding the cap two times over","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Senator Grace Poe urged the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to “explain the math” behind the 45,700-cap on cars under ride-hailing companies. On Monday, January 22, Poe said the LTFRB should be transparent in its decisions, citing the Executive Order on freedom of information (FOI). “In this age of algorithms, LTFRB should make public the factual basis of its decision. Ilabas nila ang minutes ng meetings and consultations para alam ng publiko. (They should put out the minutes of the meetings and consultations so the public knows),” said Poe. “Such disclosure of a public document is what the FOI rules, issued by the President, require. Tulad namin dito sa Senado (Like here in the Senate), ang transcripts are made public. Walang (None are) censored or hidden,” she added. Poe said that she’s not questioning the decision, rather just asking the LTFRB to explain the scientific basis of cap. “Malaki na ang inunlad ng data science, kaya maraming interesadong malaman kung ano ang justifications. Isang importanteng tanong: Ano ang baseline data na ginamit? Ano ang forecast model for future demand ang ginamit?” she said. (Data science has greatly improved that’s why many people are interested to know what are the justifications. One important question is: What was the baseline data used? What forecast model for future demand was used?) On Thursday, January 18, the LTFRB released a memorandum circular setting a “common supply base”, limiting the number of cars operating under Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) to 45,700. Impact Poe highlighted the possible impact on both drivers and patrons of the service. The senator asked if consultations with patrons were done by the regulatory agency. “If the most important components in the ride-sharing business, the customers, were consulted, was there a survey? Was the pulse of those who’ll be affected were taken into account?” Poe said in a mix of Engish and Filipino. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada explained that the numbers were computed based on the data submitted by ride-hailing application companies and the “churning rate” of drivers which takes into account those who decided to quit driving. (EXPLAINER: LTFRB requirements for Grab, Uber permits) Poe noted that the review should not be based on the churning rate but through an algorithm that determines demand and supply.  “Given that there are currently about 100,000 TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,” she said. Units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber are around 125,000, exceeding the cap two times over. The memorandum is the latest move by the LTFRB in an attempt to regulate ride-hailing apps like Grab and Uber. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/194173-james-deakin-bongbong-marcos-photo-video-netizens-reactions/","title":"James Deakin under fire for photo, video with Bongbong Marcos","date":"Jan 21, 2018 5:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Netizens say Deakin should've known better than to associate himself with the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, but the journalist says talking to 'a whole range of people' is part of being 'objective'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Automotive journalist James Deakin drew flak on Sunday, January 21, after he was shown in a photo and video with former senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The photo was posted on Instagram by Filipino-American mixed martial artist Brandon Vera last Wednesday, January 17.

The TNT KaTropa were looking to end their two-game skid against the streaking Blackwater Elite and as usual, Williams was a pivotal piece in doing so.  But January 17 was not an ordinary day for the former league MVP as he had to take an Angkas motorcycle to get to the Araneta Coliseum after getting stuck in traffic in Taguig due to the fire that hit the residential area along C5 road.  “Coming from the South, I got to Taguig in about two and a half hours and I heard there was a fire on C5 and I was like, ‘Oh my God, what am I going to do?’ My driver said ‘check Angkas, an Uber for motorcycles,’” said Williams while laughing about his unusual situation.  “Quickly got out of the car in the middle of the C5, the middle of traffic, found this guy under the overpass, he was surprised to see me. I got my helmet on, jumped on the bicycle and we got here for about 40 minutes.”  During the ride, the 35-year-old shared that ordinary commuters were surprised to see him riding a motorcycle and admitted that while it was a first for him in his 12-year PBA career, it was still a “good experience for me.”  “You get to see Manila in a different light,” said Williams.  While the thought of riding a motorcycle through the gridlocked streets of Metro Manila frightened him, especially after his driver was “swerving pretty well,” Williams said that he cared more about how his coaches would react if he did not get to the game at all. “I considered running, I considered jogging. Whatever you got to do, crawl, walk or run. It was a good experience though. Thank you to the cyclist, I think his name is Richard or something like that, he’s a lifesaver.”  Williams arrived at around 7:15 pm with the first quarter nearing to an end. However, he was only fielded in the second half, when the KaTropa were trailing 36-43. Williams’ arrival proved to be a crucial moment for TNT as it erased a 10-point Blackwater lead in the third quarter en route to a 92-83 win. The Filipino-American put up 6 points, 6 rebounds and 4 steals and had a plus-minus of plus-8 in just less than 18 minutes of action.  “You got to come out there with extra effort after coming in late like that. But it’s always my intention to come out and do whatever I have to do.”  Williams shared that arriving late for a PBA game is one of his worst nightmares, and against the Elite, it came true. That’s probably why he did not mind giving more than what he was supposed to pay for the Angkas driver. “I tipped him very handsomely. It was about a hundred but I’m sure I paid with whatever was in my pocket because I was very grateful.” The experience, he said, was a fun one for him but Williams is sure to mind what coaches cautioned him afterwards “I told coach I won’t do it again. Let’s pray that it doesn’t happen again.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/193497-ces-las-vegas-beyond-the-car-how-tech-firms-exploring-future-transport/","title":"Beyond the car: how tech firms are exploring the future of transport","date":"Jan 12, 2018 6:44 PM PHT","snippet":"A predicted shift away from owning and relying on cars will change the way urban planners design cities, say experts","body":"LAS VEGAS, USA – Carless commuting is cruising in the fast lane at the Consumer Electronics Show, with companies showing off electric bicycles, scooters, skateboards and more aimed at making the internal combustion engine a thing of the past. As the ranks of people around the world living in cities has grown, so too has the cost of car ownership as well as traffic congestion. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the annual tech gathering in Las Vegas where some 170,000 conference goers jammed the streets. “In a lot of big cities, cars aren’t tenable anymore,” said tech analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates. An AFP reporter testing the car-free concept through the week at CES by relying on a freshly released GenZe electric bicycle consistently sailed past clogged traffic near the convention center and on the famed Las Vegas Strip. Riders too tired or lazy to pedal meanwhile can twist a throttle to glide along at close to local street speed limits. GenZe spokesman Tom Valasek, a former auto industry marketing executive, said that several car makers had come to check out the company’s CES exhibit. “There is a lot of curiosity right now about where things are heading,” Valasek told AFP. “I know a lot of people in the auto industry who are quite worried that car ownership is going away.” Driverless cars The popularity of smartphone-summoned rides from services such as Uber and Lyft are playing into the trend, with technology giants investing heavily in self-driving capabilities that could soon see automated vehicles available on-demand. “We believe car ownership makes no sense in the future,” Lyft chief executive John Zimmer said at a CES dinner event. Zimmer doubted that his daughter, now a young child, will want to own a car when she is of age. Instead, he said: “She’ll want access to transportation.” A boom of autonomous cars would likely prompt vehicles to evolve to be more akin to rooms on wheels: sleeper cabins in trains, or private offices, Zimmer added. A shift away from owning and relying on cars was also expected to result in traffic and parking becoming less of a priority in urban design. GenZe, a US-based division of the Mahindra Group in India, this week announced its e-bikes will be added in April to a Ford GoBike ride-share program in San Francisco. The e-bikes should “help to make San Francisco more livable and reduce congestion,” Metropolitan Transportation Commission deputy executive Alix Bockelman said in a release. Leading online social network Facebook has a fleet of 100 GenZe bikes for employees to get around its Silicon Valley campus, and they are also used by delivery services DoorDash and Postmates, according to Valasek. Scoot, Skate, Ride  Despite negative publicity about hoverboards a few years ago – centered on their tendency to explode – the manufacturer Swagtron was at CES with some of those devices along with skateboards and bicycles boosted with electric motors. “We are seeing with personal mobility that some people like to skate; some people like to scoot, and some people like to ride,” Swagtron chief operating officer Andrew Koven told AFP. Koven saw alternatives to cars as an “absolute necessity” that was part of a “systemic shift” toward getting around in ways that are economical as well as socially and environmentally responsible. “If I am commuting a short distance to work, do I really need a car?” analyst Gold asked rhetorically.  Cities are already eyeing autonomous shuttle services. A self-driving electric shuttle built by Navya was introduced here last year in a test that segued into a program providing rides on a route in downtown Las Vegas. Swiss-based Rinspeed also showed its autonomous shuttle, and Toyota introduced a boxy concept vehicle which could be used for ridesharing, deliveries, medical services or as an extension of retail stores. Plenty of new cars were shown at CES including a number of self-driving models. But some attendees said that the vehicle of the future may be something different. Automakers “have been building cars from the driver’s perspective,” said Ankit Jain, head of the Ola Play software platform for the India-based rideshare group. In future vehicles which may be autonomous, “the passenger is the one paying,” Jain said. “You have to fundamentally rethink the car.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/191368-consumer-tech-yearend-2017-iphone-x-nokia-bitcoin/","title":"The year in consumer tech: iPhone X, Nokia’s return, Bitcoin’s rise","date":"Dec 19, 2017 5:03 PM PHT","snippet":"From the return of a beloved brand to the rise of cryptocurrencies, here are some of the most important things that happened in the world of consumer tech in 2017","body":" With the year coming to a close, we round up the biggest things that happened in the world of consumer techology. From smartphones to virtual assistants to virtual reality, innovations continue to come in the form of new physical designs such as we’ve seen with Apple’s iPhone – arguably the most hyped phone of the year. Along with this, we saw the continued push for new consumer-facing technologies such as augmented reality, cryptocurrencies, and AI-focused chips such as the ones found in new Huawei flagship phones. In no particular order, here’s what we witnessed in 2017 from the world of consumer tech: Year of the X Apple’s 10th anniversary phone, the iPhone X, was clearly the most anticipated handset of the year. The media frenzy following the announcement in September was one for the books, which had top tech global websites jostling for a leak and paying top dollar for prior information, even betting on how it was going to be named.  The hysteria was somewhat doused when it was finally revealed that the brand new iPhone would sell for way over a thousand dollars, the most expensive smartphone ever.  In the Philippines, the iconic phone is selling for approximately P64,000 plus, with variations in installment and incentive pricing from Smart and Globe. This is also not to forget that Apple has another advanced smartphone in the running, the iPhone 8, although most of the attention truly had been sopped up by the X.  Samsung and Nokia’s comeback The silver lining in the iPhone X cloud is that it gave competitors a wide enough room to wiggle in and compete aggressively specs for specs and a share of consumer’s wallet. Samsung, which got toasted in 2016 with the global recall of its burning flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7, rebounded this year with a brand new smartphone, the Galaxy Note 8.  Earlier in the year, we also saw the Galaxy S8 and also the LG G6 which gave us exciting new edgeless designs sporting a thinner (18.5:9 and 18:9 respectively) profile.  And depending on which side of the OS wars one is aligned with – Android or iOS –Samsung got its game and grove back.  But the quintessential comeback kid this year is Nokia, which heralded its return to the hardware market with an Android device called the Nokia 6 in January.  The icing on the cake was the makeover of the Nokia 3310, which was finally unveiled in October with 3G capabilities. Nokia also launched the flagship Nokia 8 and a mid-tier phone, the Nokia 6.  Once the king of handhelds, Nokia is, however, facing a very different tech landscape. Years after it bowed out of the mobile space, consumers are marching to the beat of a very different drummer. The name of the game today is “selfie” and people do not have to shell out loads of cash to get that perfect shot, pimples and wrinkles removed. Breaking the Apple-Samsung duopoly In the mid-range segment, the Chinese handset trio – Huawei, Oppo and Vivo – definitely have an edge with competitive pricing and a marketing strategy that sizzles even in the mall corridors. Asus, Lenovo, and other brands have their own competitive offerings.  But it’s Huawei that’s sort of breaking the Apple-Samsung duopoly in the top tier with the launch of its flagship phone, the Huawei Mate 10 and its twin, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The Chinese giant snuck by Apple in the middle of the year, taking the second spot in terms of global sales, although Apple’s iPhone X push thereafter may have shaken up the standings yet again.    Huawei’s marketing pitch with their Mate 10: artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and a very palatable and competitive price tag in the flagship range. Other phones in its lineup this year such as the photography-oriented P10 and P10 Plus and the value-packed midranger Nova 2i round up what has been a great year for the Pia Wurtzbach-bannered brand.  Google continues push in device market And as if the competition is not fierce enough, the hardware space got even more crowded with Google announcing its new devices for the year. In October, Google launched the smartphones Pixel 2 and Pixel 2XL,  the Daydream View VR headset and the Google Pixel Buds.   The announcement followed the news in September that Google is acquiring Taiwan smartphone maker HTC, which its spokesman explained as “an overall investment in its emerging hardware business.” Google clearly knows its inadequacy in the retail front: it has no physical stores or showrooms for selling its products.  How this will play out in 2018 and beyond would be interesting to watch, especially as many of these newly launched Google devices are not yet available in countries like the Philippines. When they do become available, would they move the needle in the local device war? Would the local geeks take to a wireless headphone that can translate? Battle of the voice assistants Filipinos have yet to experience fully interacting with Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Assistant, Samsung’s Bixby and other voice assistants in a big way as many of the devices powered with these conversational software are not yet available locally.   But a new battle royale is already looming in the horizon in this space.  Research firm Gartner predicts an acceleration of  visual- and voice-search technologies in the next two years.  In 2018, would Filipino homes start to welcome gadgets that they can talk to and boss around to switch on the light, read the news, open and close their doors, or play their music of choice? It still sounds like science fiction and still in the domain of the early adopters, but the certified geeks here are already toying with these devices.  AR and VR, and other realities making progress  A year after augmented reality (AR) entered the lexicon of the Filipino consumer, through the widely popular mobile game, Pokemon, the technology has moved on, along with its twin, virtual reality (VR).  In May, the Philippines saw the launch of the first broadcast augmented reality (BAR) experience, a journey on “a winter playground of faux snow sculptures and stuffed polar bears and penguins.”  On the device front, devices such as the Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony PlayStation VR, Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream View, HTC Vive, have yet to gain mass appeal locally. But AR- and VR-capable smartphones are already out in the market such as the Asus Zenfone AR, which fully supports the Google platform.  Filipinos still “social” A report confirmed in June Filipinos’ continued enthusiasm with social, with 58% of the Philippines having a monthly active account on the top social network here. Even against the global backdrop of fake news, political propaganda and other ugly realities, the social space is alive and vibrant.  While the most tweeted moments in 2017 is still a hodgepodge of typical Pinoy interests: celebrities, basketball, and beauty pageants, on one hand, and more serious concerns such as class suspensions, storm warnings, the Marawi conflict, and the Asean Summit on the other.  Practical tech and internet speed  The use of technology in this vast consumer haven is also seeing a seque to more practical things like the use of ride-sharing and transport apps to manage their daily drive or commute, shopping online and paying for online purchases through various fintech apps and services. The question now is internet speed catching up? A report released in May showed that the Philippines continues to lag behind internet connection speed averaging only 5.5 Mbps versus the global average of 7.2 Mbps. The Philippines also ranked 100th out of 122 for mobile broadband and 94th out of 133 for fixed broadband in the Speedtest Global Index. Whether this is good news or bad news can be hotly debated by the telcos and the consumers in a duel that will forever rage in this side of the world for as long as connection is not fast enough for everybody’s satisfaction. This isn’t surprising as even some of the smartphones selling below the mid-range today have even better camera, connectivity and other capabilities than the iPhone of 10 years ago. As people want their devices to do more, they expect better connectivity.   As has been the case in previous years, the entrance of more data service providers would benefit the state of internet service packages in the Philippines, forcing market players to lower prices, ultimately for the consumers’ benefit. Legislation such as the proposed Open Access Bill hopes to gain more traction in the following year to allow more players in the market.  The buzziest buzzwords of 2017  Globally, a new buzzword has emerged in 2017: artificial intelligence or AI. With AI chips now embedded in the most advanced smartphones, it would be interesting to watch what this can do for consumers. But the surprise development in the tech scene this year is bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Are Filipinos ready to embrace this cryptocurrency, essentially digital money with a ledger verified by a network of computers instead of a central bank? Cryptocurrency, as represented by Bitcoin and its staggering rise from $1000 to a bitcoin to highs of $18,000 to a bitcoin in December 2017, has at the very least, forced us to rethink the way we think about what currency is, and the potential form that future currencies could eventually take. Either that, or you’ve started trying to mine or trade for bitcoin – in spite of its volatility – and hope that its value rises even further, as a few analysts believe it could. (READ: Bitcoin breaks $10,000 barrier but analysts warn of bubble) While the actual usage of bitcoin in commercial transactions is still developing (the number of companies that accept cryptocurrencies is still low), it has some traits that give it some appeal, namely the ability to bypass bank fees for remittances, and anonymous transactions.  Be wary though; some are also saying that bitcoin is a bubble that could pop anytime. Consider it a very high risk investment that could either make you very rich in 2018 or set back your financial plans for the future. – Rappler.com Eden Estopace is an IT journalist based in Manila.

The US Attorney’s Office in Northern California sent the letter to US Judge William Alsup last month to share some of what they have learned “in the course of a United States’ pending criminal investigation,” according to a copy of the paperwork obtained by Agence France-Presse. Alsup had referred the case to the Justice Department to look into possible criminal charges, but prosecutors remained mum after that. Information shared by the department with Alsup sparked a courtroom furor over the possibility that Uber operated a program to hide nefarious tactics. It also resulted in the trial being delayed a second time, with the judge setting a new start date of February 5. The US Attorney’s Office said in the missive to Alsup that they interviewed former Uber manager of global intelligence Richard Jacobs, who contended that “employees routinely used non-attributable electronic devices to store and transmit information that they wished to separate from Uber’s official systems.” Attorneys representing Uber have repeatedly assured the judge no files taken from Waymo ever touched Uber servers. Jacobs’ attorney laid out his allegations in May in a letter to Uber’s associate general counsel, according to the Justice document. Alsup continues to mull whether it should have been shared during an evidence-gathering phase of the civil case. The letter signed by Jacobs told of an effort to evade discovery requests, court orders, and government investigations “in violation of state and federal law, as well as ethical rules governing the legal profession.” Techniques used included smartphones or laptop computers that couldn’t be traced back to the company, and communicating through encrypted, vanishing message service Wickr, according to the letter and a transcript of courtroom testimony obtained by Agence France-Presse. Jacobs testified that he left Uber early this year with a compensation deal valued at $4.5 million. As part of that agreement with Uber, Jacobs remained a consultant on the payroll. Uber executives who testified denied any wrongdoing or trail-covering. The civil case stems from a lawsuit filed by Waymo – previously known as the Google self-driving car unit – which claimed former manager Anthony Levandowski took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto and was later acquired by Uber. Uber is also a target of investigations and lawsuits over the cover-up of a hack that compromised personal information of 57 million users and drivers. Uber purportedly paid data thieves $100,000 to destroy the swiped information – and remained quiet about the breach for a year. US justice officials are also investigating suspicions of foreign bribery and use of illegal software to spy on competitors or escape scrutiny of regulators. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/191180-ltfrb-congress-legalization-angkas-habal-habal/","title":"LTFRB: Up to Congress to legalize Angkas, habal-habal","date":"Dec 12, 2017 8:38 PM PHT","snippet":"While in limbo, 15,000 Angkas drivers receive financial assistance equivalent to 60% of their earnings last October","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it’s up to Congress to pass a measure legalizing ride-sharing on motorcycles. On Tuesday, December 12, LTFRB held a dialogue with ride-sharing app Angkas and habal-habal drivers to hear the concerns of the sector. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said issues discussed during the dialogue will be submitted to Congress, along with a proposal by the Angkas app management that the agency will receive within the week. “We feel for you. That is why we requested the Office of Congressman Cesar Sarmiento to be here. Whatever will transpire here, we will give to the Committee on Transportation,” Lizada told the drivers. She added that what’s happening with Angkas seemed like a “repetition” of the agency’s experiences with Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) companies Grab and Uber. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) “I told [Angkas], I thought we’re done with Uber and Grab. This is a rewind of everything… What Uber and Grab started eventually became the government’s problem,” Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino. While in limbo, David Medrana of Angkas said they are providing financial assistance to some 15,000 drivers in Metro Manila and Cebu, equivalent to 60% of their earnings last October. Lizada also said the Department of Labor and Employment will hold a job fair for the drivers and conduct sessions on the department’s livelihood programs on Wednesday, December 13 at 8 am at the LTFRB Central Office in Quezon City. While waiting for a policy measure to be passed in Congress, transportation officials will still apprehend Angkas and habal-habal drivers. “The law was only given to us to implement. That’s why we invited Congress here,” said Lizada. Traffic, road safety Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña attended the public dialogue on Tuesday and told the transportation officials that he supports Angkas. (READ: Why passengers and bikers think Angkas matters) Osmeña said that the services offered by the app contributed in alleviating traffic in metropolitan Cebu. He added that the whole Angkas issue boils down to the issue of providing services to the public. “I can tell you – public good is very different from what the government is doing… Who is the law supposed to serve? Unfortunately, it’s creating a drama,” Osmeña told Land Transportation Office  (LTO) and LTFRB. The LTFRB also raised concerns over the safety of motorcycles on the road. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride) According to government data, majority of vehicular crash incidents involve motorcycles.

Angkas drivers who were present at the dialogue said they were trained prior to being allowed on the road. “We put a regulation to improve something that they don’t have. They don’t have protection but we gave them that. Their lives were improved,” Medrana said, referring to drivers who were previously habal-habal drivers prior to joining Angkas. “What they’re missing out are the opportunities,” he added. Last November, the LTFRB ordered for the closure of Angkas, citing Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code that mandates motorcycles can only be registered as private vehicles and not be used for hire. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal)– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/190713-habal-habal-safety-cost-cheap-ride/","title":"Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride","date":"Dec 9, 2017 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"The growing prominence of ride-sharing apps like Angkas has mainstreamed the operation of habal-habals in cities. But are habal-habals safe?","body":" On a rainy night in July, 23-year-old Alejandro Cajano hailed a motorcycle using the Angkas app to get to his home in Makati. He never made it. The motorcycle figured in a road incident that left him in a coma for two months. He died in September, leaving behind a grieving family and over a million pesos in unpaid hospital bills. Like Cajano, many Filipinos rely on habal-habals or a motorcylce modified to seat two persons, for transport. Until recently, habal-habals were only known to operate in rural areas to carry people and goods over rough mountain roads, and areas not accessible by public transportation. But the growing prominence of ride-sharing apps like Angkas has mainstreamed the operation of habal-habals in cities. (READ: Angkas passenger in coma after crash: Who’s liable?) Though commonplace, there is no argument that habal-habals are illegal. Section 7(a) of Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code clearly prohibits the use of motorcycles for public transport. Unlike Uber and Grab which are now allowed to operate under Department Order No. 2015-011, there is no regulation allowing the use of motorcycles for hire. Angkas continued to operate despite earlier warnings, in the hopes that the government would give it the same legal status as Uber and Grab. After its shutdown, Angkas ceased operations, but declared its  willingness to be regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), believing its operations to be a safer alternative to the already common habal-habal. This begs the question: Are habal-habals safe? Vulnerable to road crash According to the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, motorcycles are among the most vulnerable road users, making up 53% of fatal road crashes in the Philippines. To provide safety, Angkas provides driver training and requires background checks and skills assessment. But the vulnerability of motorcycle riders is not only due to the skill of the driver, but also due to the design of motorcycles and environmental risks.  Motorcycles offer little protection to its riders. They are capable of great speed but unlike 4-wheeled motor vehicles, there is no outer shell, airbag, seat cushion, or seatbelt protecting its driver and passenger from crashes. (READ: IN NUMBERS: Road crash incidents in the Philippines) Motorcycles are also difficult to maneuver. Like any two-wheeled vehicle, the stability of a motorcycle is relative to its speed. To remain balanced, a motorcycle must run at a certain speed. When it moves slowly, its balance depends on the physical strength of the driver, the ability of the passenger to balance, and the collective weight of the driver and passenger. A driver can also easily lose control of the motorcycle because of potholes, speedbumps, or wet surfaces. Indeed, in Cajano’s case, environmental factors appeared to have played a role in the crash based on the dash camera footage of the incident. (READ: 6 in 10 injured in road crashes are motorcycle riders) Given the design and environmental risks, the promise of strict background checks and skills training are not enough to protect passengers from road crashes. (READ: What laws help keep road users safe in the Philippines?) In fact, in an assessment of the effectiveness of interventions for motorcycle safety, the United States National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration ranked motorcycle licensing and motorcycle rider training low in terms of effect. It noted that there is limited data to conclude that these interventions are effective. The promise of a fast and convenient ride is also a cause for caution. The data on speed is indisputable – the greater the speed, the greater the risk of a crash and the greater the severity of the resulting injury. This means that delivering on this promise of a fast and convenient ride is likely a compromise on its safety. Economic cost of road deaths Angkas’ promise of insurance coverage amounting to P200,000 also does not make up for the economic cost of a road death. As we have seen in Cajano’s case, head injuries can push medical costs to more than a million pesos. Dr Hilton Lam, who conducted a study estimating the socio-economic cost of road traffic injury, said medical expenses range from P60 to P336,561. Lam also estimated that about P112,000 per person in annual wages is lost due to death. In Cajano’s case, assuming he would work until the age of retirement, this means P4.704 million in income was lost. (READ: Rappler Talk: Are Philippine roads safer in 2017?) Cajano’s family was also compelled to file a case to assert Angkas’ liability, adding to their mounting financial losses, because Angkas disowned liability over the driver’s action.  Though Angkas claimed to have covered the hospital expenses of Cajano in full, Cajano’s father claims otherwise. The way forward Given these considerations, should the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the LTFRB allow and regulate habal-habals? We have to remember that laws are norm-creating. Allowing habal-habals, even while regulating it, would likely encourage its use. (READ: Why passengers and bikers think Angkas matters) It is also hard to imagine the policy interventions the government would have to introduce to make habal-habals safe, given that motorcycles, by design, are highly susceptible to environmental risks. Of course, regulation is not the only option. In rural areas, the habal-habal is seen as a necessary evil because it can navigate unpaved roads and access areas not serviced by public transportation. Because accessibility is the primary concern in rural areas, the government can, instead of regulating habal-habals, build better roads and provide safer transportation options. (WATCH: Rappler Talk: Solutions to Metro Manila traffic and road safety issues) Meanwhile, in Metro Manila and Cebu where most roads are paved and various public transportation options are available, accessibility is not the primary issue. Rather, the discussion revolves around convenience and cost. With the worsening traffic situation, commuters demand cheap point-to-point transportation. Must the government yield to this demand? The story of Cajano is a cautionary tale. It is tempting to dismiss it as an isolated incident but data on fatal crashes involving motorcycles tells us it is not. It tells us that the price of the cheap and convenient habal-habal is safety. Sometimes, you pay dearly with your life.– Rappler.com Rochel S. Bartolay and Sophia Monica V.

Uber Philippines and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday, December 5. The ride-hailing company will build the Movement for Manila platform with the help of the DPWH Planning Department “to provide inputs for enhanced traffic management and troubleshooting.” The tie-up will see Uber share its traffic data with the DPWH in order to help the government agency analyze how its infrastructure projects affect traffic and eventually to determine which projects are most needed for various locations. Uber gets its data from the daily routes of thousands of Uber drivers. “We realized that all this data can be useful not just for us but also for society and for the government as it can be used for better planning,” said Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua at the signing. “We think this data can be sliced and diced to better understand how our roads and infrastructure [are] currently supporting travel, how fast it takes [motorists] to go from one point to another. It helps us not only evaluate past projects but also inform how planning can go forward,” he added. Effects of infrastructure projects In practical terms, Cua pointed out that the DPWH can use the data to determine how opening new infrastructure projects like roads and bridges would affect travel time not just in a particular area, but also in surrounding places. An example of this is how Uber determined that opening the NAIA Expressway earlier this year cut down the average travel time from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2 to San Lorenzo Village in Makati City by 3.8%, and from the same terminal to Marina Bay in Pasay City by 4.7%. Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar noted how the government needs to use technology to solve a lot of the metro’s problems, particularly as the DPWH will be entering a crucial stage in the Build, Build, Build program implementation next year. “With this partnership with Uber, we’ll be able to plan our traffic much better. The wealth of information they are providing will help us cut down on the time it takes [to] analyze traffic… and it will be very important in our short- and long-term planning,” Villar said. Open to other firms, too Uber and its users will be relieved not to find the company at odds with the government this time. The DPWH said it was in fact Uber which approached them with the idea for the partnership. The government agency added that it is open to partnering with other firms for data which can be used in the planning and implementation of projects. Uber has been involved in legal issues with the government in recent months, culminating in it being suspended for a month and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The US-based firm may face even more problems ahead as it confirmed that details of Filipino users were exposed in a data breach that has affected 57 million users worldwide. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/data-stories/190406-rappler-traffic-parking-online-survey/","title":"Rappler readers share how they really feel about Manila traffic and parking issues","date":"Dec 5, 2017 1:39 PM PHT","snippet":"Traffic has not only affected our personal schedules, but also takes time away to spend with loved ones. This Rappler-led survey digs deeper into how traffic changes our lives every single day","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Aside from work, sleep and food, two things are also now a constant in our everyday life: enduring traffic and looking for parking. These may even dictate how we go about our day. We don’t just consider the time it actually takes to accomplish certain tasks; we’ve become conditioned to factor in the additional time that we waste in traffic or looking for parking. (READ: With emojis, hugot phrases, even Hangul, people shared how traffic made them feel) How deeply do these circumstances affect society, especially in a fast-paced city like Manila? To find out, Rappler conducted a survey from November 9 to 15 among its readers, in partnership with Uber. A total of 4,397 responses were gathered from Filipinos aged 18 to 44. The poll offers insight as to how FIlipinos value their own time, and how they believe the public issue of traffic can be solved or improved. Plans depend on traffic and parking time Have you ever declined an invite for dinner and drinks with friends on a Friday night? Or do you now often choose to stay in during payday weekend? This is becoming a common decision for Metro Manila residents who fear the worse-than-usual traffic on these days.  Among survey respondents, 44.91% always factor in traffic and parking time when making plans or fixing their schedules.  During a recent Twitter conversation that we conducted about traffic, netizens also expressed the same sentiment.   Many also voiced out dismay that traffic robs them of time for loved ones. In the survey, 34% said that they would rather spend time with friends and family if they can reduce the time they spend on the road or lined up in parking areas. Coming in as a 2nd priority was being more productive at work (26.66%).   Too many cars, or not enough parking slots? On top of traffic, survey respondents also revealed that looking for parking can be a massive waste of time as well.   For most respondents, the average waiting time for looking for parking is 5 to 10 minutes (38%). More than a third of respondents (37%) claimed that they spend an average of 20 minutes waiting for parking slots to free up.  A recent Uber study reported that right now, Metro Manila needs an additional car park that’s twice the size of Makati, just to serve all the cars plying its roads. Online, car owners complained that even sidewalks and actual roads are being converted into parking slots, further worsening the traffic issue.  The survey revealed an interesting split in perspectives when it comes to people’s thoughts on solving the parking issue. Almost half (49.65%) of respondents believe that there are not enough parking slots in Metro Manila. But 40.61% feel that it’s the reverse – that there are simply too many cars.  The survey mirrors what netizens raised during our Twitter conversation.     Seeking solutions When asked what they feel is the best solution to solve traffic, improving public transportation (47%) was the top choice, followed by upgrading road infrastructure (30%).  Among solutions of private sectors, ridesharing wins over parking. 15% of respondents believe that ridesharing is the best solution for traffic, vs. only 8% for parking. Ridesharing skewed slightly higher for age group 35-44 (20%), the second largest age group of the Philippine labor force. More often than not they have higher purchasing power among other age groups who are willing to spend on convenience and comfort that ride-sharing offers. So what’s the best solution to ease traffic and parking woes?  While long-term solutions aren’t available, ride-sharing allows more people to move with less cars on the road. Motorists now have the option to share trips instead of bringing one car for only one or two people. Less cars on the road mean less traffic and parking lines. Commuters can also enjoy safer, faster, and more comfortable trips.  Although not included in the survey, netizens are also open to other solutions such as working outside of Metro Manila and adopting shifting schedules in companies.     Even if heavy traffic and lack of parking spaces present daily problems, there are available solutions to help us move through the city, better.

Pishevar allegedly groped a sixth woman, Austin Geidt, an executive at the Uber ride-sharing company. The other women requested anonymity, citing Pishevar’s proclivity toward filing lawsuits and worries he would use his position of power to ruin their careers. “Shervin Pishevar is the victim of an organized smear campaign… We are confident that these anecdotes will be shown to be untrue,” Mark Fabiani, a crisis management expert, said in a statement sent on Pishevar’s behalf on Friday, December 1.

This was among the findings of a recent survey conducted as part of a study called “Unlocking Cities,” done by global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The study, commissioned by ride-sharing platform Uber, looks at the impact of ridesharing in Southeast Asia. The accompanying survey was done from September to October, covering around 300 respondents from Southeast Asian cities. The survey places Metro Manila 3rd worst in the region, with an average of 66 minutes stuck in traffic daily. It comes after Bangkok, Thailand, which is said to have the worst traffic (72 minutes), and 2nd worst Jakarta, Indonesia (68 minutes). The best performers in terms of traffic are Singapore (30 minutes) and Hong Kong (35 minutes). In Metro Manila, on top of the 66-minute traffic experience, drivers also spend an average of 24 minutes per day searching for parking. Traffic woes as economy improves  The BCG survey results also indicated that traffic may worsen, as 84% of Metro Manila respondents said they plan to buy a car in the next 5 years. At the same time, however, 37% of Metro Manila respondents said they would be “highly willing” to forgo purchasing a vehicle if ridesharing can meet their transport requirements. As expected, travel time more than doubles during rush hour in the morning and in the evening, according to Metro Manila respondents.   ‘Silver lining’ A silver lining, according to the study, is that a portion of potential new vehicles could be used on ride-sharing platforms such as Grab and Uber which would, in theory, lessen the number of overall vehicles on the road at the same time.   The effect would be especially pronounced if half of those cars are used for carpool services, where users would choose to share a ride with others in exchange for a lower fare. Both Grab and Uber offer this. Assuming 50% of rides are carpool services, BCG estimates that ridesharing could potentially reduce a million private vehicles from Philippine roads. Regulatory woes, infra buildup The potential effects of ridesharing, however, assume the presence of optimal conditions which has been far from the case in the Philippines. Uber itself was recently suspended for a month in the country and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The US–based firm may face even more problems ahead as it confirmed that details of Filipino users were exposed in a data breach that has affected 57 million users worldwide. The LFTRB also recently ordered the closure of popular motorbike-hailing platform Angkas over questions of legality. Multilateral agencies have put forward the improvement of public infrastructure as a long-term solution to traffic congestion. The study echoes this, pointing out that Manila, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh have all announced plans to invest more than $60 billion in rail infrastructure by 2022. But according to the study, the “added capacity of rail transport alone will not be sufficient to meet growth in transport demand by 2022.” It continued: “We estimate that ridesharing adoption between 16% and 40% across these cities is needed in conjunction with public transport to maintain congestion levels today.” The Philippine government is trying to address the poor infrastructure situation with its Build, Build, Build campaign, which seeks to raise public spending on infrastructure from 5.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 7.4% by 2022. The clock is ticking, however, with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) estimating that traffic congestion would cost the country P6 billion per day by 2030 if problems are not fixed. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/189695-court-blocks-uber-israel/","title":"Court blocks Uber ride-sharing in Israel","date":"Nov 27, 2017 9:21 PM PHT","snippet":"The Tel Aviv district court judge's injunction ordering the services to stop from Wednesday comes after a court challenge from a taxi drivers' union and a separate ride-hailing app","body":" JERUSALEM – A court blocked Uber’s ride-sharing services in Israel on Monday, November 27, in a victory for the country’s traditional taxi operators, saying the US firm’s private drivers lacked proper insurance. The Tel Aviv district court judge’s injunction ordering the services to stop from Wednesday came after a court challenge from a taxi drivers’ union and a separate ride-hailing app. “They operate private taxis in violation of the law,” said Yehuda Bar On, head of the taxi drivers’ union. “They put passengers in danger because they don’t have insurance. They take drivers who have not had training and official tests.” Uber did not immediately respond to the ruling. The US firm has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, but it has faced a series of scandals and legal challenges. Last week, Uber said hackers compromised personal data from some 57 million riders and drivers in a breach kept hidden for a year. It has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators. Israel’s transportation ministry is also pursuing a court case against Uber, saying its ride-sharing services violate the law. Uber Israel in recent weeks launched its daytime ride-sharing services in the Tel Aviv area. It began its nighttime services in the same area in October 2016, though it operated with numerous restrictions, according to Israeli media. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/science/189328-artificial-intelligence-story-not-data/","title":"I am story, not data","date":"Nov 23, 2017 7:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'We live and die as stories, not as data'","body":"Three days ago, I was face to face with “Alter” and it was not just looking at me, it was sensing me and its environment. Alter is a humanoid robot stationed in Miraikan, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo. Alter’s insides are laid bare but it had a face and arms that moved in patterns that it “thinks up” by itself.  It senses noise, humidity, pressure and temperature around it and reacts to these elements. And since those things change minute to minute, Alter builds up on its own learning and reacts to it in ways that are not predictable. What you see is a humanoid that moves, not quite like a human does, but you get a sense that it is no longer mechanical, that it is alive in its own right, even if in the place of a beating heart, it has “coupled pendulums” that mimic neural signals. I participated in the Science Center World Summit held last week so in that same day, I also listened to the Chief Scientist of Hitachi, Kazuo Yano, with great optimism, about the role of AI in promoting human well-being. He is involved in AI technology that examines the link between human happiness and movement. One big finding he revealed was that people in call centers who are active, are able to sustain their activity more, and report (through the sensors they were fitted with) being happy more than those who stay at rest more. The goal of this study was not to measure happiness per se but to link it with productivity since it has been pretty much established in studies that happy people are more productive. It would have been so easy to accept the robust link between productivity and happiness if human productivity only included call centers or sales performance. An Italian researcher, Daniel Archibugi, who sat in the same panel as Dr. Yano, did raise a challenge to the latter as to what we will do with poets whose obvious productivity, as seen in their works, are, in great part, attributable to their inner capital: “unhappiness”. In a session that I moderated, I had presenters who demonstrated technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, robots and learning trackers not only as they are today but what they would probably look like at least 10 years from now. Maholo Uchida, the one in charge of the robots in Miraikan, spoke of their robots as members of their team, even taking great care of the humanoids when they would be lent to other institutions, to the extent of having fashion and hair stylists for these humanoids. Towards the end of the summit, I had a chat with the first Japanese astronaut, Dr. Mamoru Mohri, who also headed Miraikan – the science museum of new and emerging technologies, especially AIs. At the summit, he showed us videos of when he was in space looking at the Earth, giving us a keen sense that the Earth was indeed a lonely planet – there is no neighboring planet that could save it or save us. He was born of the Earth and as an astronaut, has risen above it to contemplate it and to share that wisdom with the rest of us, who most likely will remain grounded. He possessed this wisdom that also seemed unabashed to welcoming AIs as complementing human lives. He noticed my earrings. I was wearing a pair of astronaut earrings given as a gift by someone whom I treated like my own son. Dr. Mohri pointed to them and said “Is that Asimo?” (Asimo is the Honda resident robot of Miraikan.) I said, “No, Dr. Mohri, it’s you.” My head spins imagining our common future with AIs. AIs are the chief sense-makers of what has come to be called “big data” that everyone wants to collect. My head did not just spin with the prospects that are already articulated in the news and current literature: “AIs will eliminate jobs”, “AIs will augment jobs”, “AIs will annihilate humans and the world”, “AIs will transform the world for the better”. I get worried when Stephen Hawking, who has contemplated the death of stars and planets and Elon Musk, a revolutionary technologist, rise as top voices that warn against an uncontrolled AI future. But my AI anxiety is also tempered when I hear Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg be more optimistic about what AI can do to make us better humans or a force for good. But then, there is also what critics too say about Musk and Zuckerberg standing where they do, because it is consistent with their branding. But even without the hyped debates of these tech celebrities, there is no escaping future days and nights with AI. Robots  do not only do backflips, or animate science museums. They are also now embedded in the pillars and peripherals of human work and life including transport (yes, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Grab rely on AI), defense, food, and commerce. In the future and some say in the near-future, self-driving cars and trucks will be familiar.  Food will be tailored and made according to detected requirements, and stores and supermarkets will be characteristically human-less, save for the shadow humans who designed the AIs that run them. I am fascinated by AI prospects.  I am also anxious about them. This is the nature of a non-AI. I am very conscious that I was not raised to look at machines as living but I also am aware that some cultures do not differentiate or they do not find it hard to look at AIs as a genuine part of human lives. I know that their view is as valid as mine. But maybe there are profound questions that we all can agree on posing, regardless of culture or level of technological development. Like any technology, AI could go spectacularly well in some aspects or gloriously fail us in others. But aside from those, it would also have unintended consequences.  Would we be ready to reverse the consequences if they do not turn out to be good? Just as an earlier study this year has shown, AI could also learn human biases and operate with them. Then, would AI just be a mere technological mirror of the human designers in First World countries and their own biases – a repeat of our imperial and colonial past? Will AIs be able to make imaginative leaps in thought and action that our most profound human stories are made of? Would an AI have made that leap that Einstein did, given data that was only Newtonian? Would slavery have been outlawed by AI given only data from slave owners? Would AI ever do the neural razzmatazz that would make it even come close to the literary and musical genius of say, a Lin-Manuel Miranda? Data is not narrative. It is only part of it. A narrative is a story we tell ourselves to keep ourselves together so we know who we are and can imagine who we can become, joined by all the other selves that we scoop and tuck in the folds of our own lifetimes.  We live and die as stories, not as data.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/189327-uber-hack-cover-up-legal-troubles/","title":"Uber in legal crosshairs over hack cover-up","date":"Nov 23, 2017 1:36 PM PHT","snippet":"Stolen files include names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Two US states said Wednesday, November 22, they are investigating Uber’s cover-up of a hack at the ride-sharing giant that compromised the personal information of 57 million users and drivers. Uber purportedly paid data thieves $100,000 to destroy the swiped information – and remained quiet about the breach for a year. That decision evidently came despite a promise by the firm to “adopt leading data security protection practices” in a settlement with New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman and his counterpart in Connecticut, George Jepsen, on Wednesday told the Agence France-Presse that Uber is the target of probes in their states over the hidden hack. “None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over at the company in August, said Tuesday. Two members of the Uber information security team who “led the response” that included not alerting users about the data breach were let go from the San Francisco-based company effective Tuesday, according to Khosrowshahi. The Uber chief said he only recently learned that outsiders had broken into a cloud-based server used by the company for data and downloaded a “significant” amount of information. Stolen files included names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers for riders, and the names and driver license information of some 600,000 drivers, according to Uber. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, not telling riders or drivers whose information was at risk, according to a source familiar with the situation. Co-founder and ousted chief Travis Kalanick was advised of the breach shortly after it was discovered, but it was not made public until Khosrowshahi learned of the incident, the source confirmed. Promise to protect  In early 2016, Schneiderman announced a settlement with Uber stemming from an investigation into the company’s handling and protection of riders’ personal information. The probe was prompted by word of a hack, and by reports that Uber executives were able to track the locations of riders in real-time using a tool known internally as “God View.” The settlement required Uber to better protect rider data, and pay $20,000 for failing to tell drivers about the 2014 data breach in a timely manner. Schneiderman’s office determined that the earlier hack took advantage of access information posted by an Uber engineer at software development platform Github. Computer security specialists interviewed by AFP said the recent breach apparently involved a similar slip with a password that was taken from Github and used to get into Uber data stored in the cloud at Amazon Web Services. “The fact that attackers were able to compromise an Amazon Web Services account and not come away with credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other highly sensitive information could mean that Uber had controls in place to keep this kind of data very well-secured,” said Covata vice president of security Mike Fleck. “It’s also possible that the attackers just didn’t look very hard and Uber got lucky.” Hackers are known to take seemingly low-value information, such as email addresses, and build on them with what they can find or steal elsewhere to prey on victims, according to McAfee vice president of labs Vincent Weafer. “On the hacker side, there is aggregation, tying disparate data sets together,” Weafer said. “There is no such thing as benign information; we really have to take better care.” Law firm Keller Rohrback put out word on Wednesday that it is looking into the potential for a class action suit against Uber. “By choosing not to disclose this massive data breach and attempting to mitigate the breach by paying the hackers to destroy the data, Uber has essentially rolled the dice with its customers’ and drivers’ personal identities,” law firm partner Cari Campen Laufenberg said in a release. State law in Uber’s home state of California calls on companies to disclose big data breaches without unreasonable delay, meaning the handling of the hack could herald a rough stretch of road there. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/189033-traffic-installation-bgc-uber/","title":"With emojis, hugot phrases, even Hangul, people shared how traffic made them feel","date":"Nov 20, 2017 5:02 PM PHT","snippet":"On Friday, November 17, Uber screened their Boxes film live along 5th Avenue, BGC – and invited passers-by to share their thoughts on traffic in Manila","body":" MANILA, Philippines – “R.I.P Free Time,” said one bright orange sticker. “Exhausting. Kaiyak.” said another yellow one. And all around these, there were many other circles scrawled with sad-faced and crying emojis, all expressing varying degrees of dismay and frustration. These statements peppered a pile of massive cardboard boxes that appeared along 5th Avenue, Bonifacio Global City last Friday, November 17. This wasn’t a hugot wall dedicated to unrequited love – these words and emojis were people’s thoughts about traffic in Metro Manila. The sentiment is unanimous – it’s a hassle, a waste of time, and money.  “Everyday I commute going to work, and like most people I get bombarded by jeeps here, cars there, taxis everywhere. It takes such a long time to go to work,” said David, 22. Together with his friend, he stayed for a while at the installation to try the cardboard cars similar to those featured in Uber’s film, “Boxes.”  Boxes depicted the chaos of a city overflowing with boxes – a hilarious yet realistic metaphor for the congestion we experience on our own highways here in Manila. {source} <iframe width=”640″ height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNyq2_92H0Y” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source} “Traffic is very time-consuming, especially for us students. Instead of us having the energy to do homework and review when we get home, we feel drained,” says Mae, a 20-year-old who studies at Far Eastern University. According to an independent study commissioned by Uber, Filipinos in Metro Manila spend up to 402 hours every year just stuck in traffic. All that wasted time is equivalent to almost P100,000 lost income. (READ: How much time and money do we waste sitting in traffic and looking for parking?) That’s why others are doing their best to stay optimistic about the situation – and to constantly seek solutions. 26-year-old Franz, who posted his response in Hangul, says that traffic helped him to learn the Korean language. “I stay in traffic a lot so I end up having more time to practice. Instead of channeling your frustration into something negative, you turn it into something positive,” he said.  Franz pointed out that improving public transportation is the best way to solve traffic in Metro Manila. But his friend, Michael, added that immediate solutions are just as important. “I would say urban planning (can solve traffic) but that would take a longer time and it’s too complex. So the fastest way is to use Uber – ridesharing – for the meantime. And even if urban planning has been improved, I think ridesharing is still a very valuable solution,” Michael said. Athlete Jeron Teng, who also dropped by, agreed that ridesharing services like Uber offer a much better alternative to wasting time on the road. “For an athlete like me, ridesharing is more convenient. Sometimes after practice I would rather relax and share a ride than drive or look for parking,” he said.  Aside from sharing their thoughts on traffic, participants in the installation also learned how they can do their part to ease congestion in the city, through ridesharing. They all agreed that less traffic on the road doesn’t just mean more time or money – it also empowers them to help our cities become better. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/188792-uber-unlock-manila-traffic/","title":"The way we move: How traffic and parking issues affect our lives","date":"Nov 17, 2017 5:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Traffic and parking issues have affected our lives in many different ways. What did people have to say about these problems and what we can do to #UnlockManila?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – It has come to a point where we factor in traffic and parking when we move around the city. Have you ever asked yourself: Will I go out with friends if there’s heavy traffic? How early should I leave my house to beat rush hour traffic? Is there parking where I’m going? These days, when we drive or commute even for a short distance, it takes us hours, when realistically, it should only take a few minutes. If only we had the luxury of not having bumper-to-bumper traffic and parking issues, then maybe life would be a little less stressful. And perhaps these problems wouldn’t dictate our everyday decisions.  During a recent Twitter conversation on Rappler, we asked how these two problems–traffic and parking–have affected our daily lives and productivity, and what possible solutions can be adapted.  Readers also shared their ‘horror’ stories on how much time they’ve spent on the road and what they wish they could’ve done with that time instead.  It’s very true that heavy traffic can take away time from loved ones. Missing birthdays or being late for important family events can be caused by road problems.  And there were those who talked about their everyday woes as they go to and from work.  Apart from their not so pleasant experiences on the road, people also shared what they think is causing traffic along Metro Manila roads and possible solutions.    Imagine how our roads would be if motorists stayed in their designated lanes, parked in proper parking spaces and followed traffic rules?  You can’t deny that Metro Manila is congested and because there are so many people who need to get around, the volume of vehicles on the roads have increased as well. Would it be possible to solve this with a more efficient public transportation system? How to #UnlockManila? Metro Manila has so much potential to become a great city to live and thrive in. But problems like heavy traffic and lack of parking can impede its growth and development.    That’s why we need to work together to #UnlockManila’s true potential. Available solutions such as ridesharing is a prime example of how people can work together in order to make a difference and be a part of the solution.    Fewer cars on the road and more people sharing rides with one another can bring us one step closer to improving the lives of motorists and commuters alike.    What other solutions come to mind when issues such as traffic and lack of parking are raised?

What do you know about cars?'” The sexist remark made her want to walk out, but she didn’t. She has already left a lucrative real estate job in favor of a career in the male-dominated automotive industry, so she gathered some inner strength and replied: “Can you treat me as a coequal even just for 30 seconds?” Without blinking an eye, she said next: “You are a Korean. What do you know about the Philippine market?” That clinched the deal. She shared this experience during a panel on “Unleashing Women Economic Power” at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Business and Investment Summit in Manila. (WATCH: ASEAN Business and Investment Summit 2017, November 13) Getting into these “game-changing” situations that level the playing field for women require “competence, attitude, and packaging,” she told an audience of business owners, government officials, and other executives from Southeast Asia. She urged the audience to “continue challenging and to reframe the social expectations and attitudes toward women and women leaders.” She highlighted another tool, saying, “Education is the number one leveler and penetrating strategy for women in a perceived male-dominated industry.” Agudo and her partners established Hyundai Asia Resources Incorporated (HARI) to market the Korean brand in the Philippines, and how she handled that 2001 meeting eventually changed the industry landscape in the Philippines. Not long after, Hyundai was grabbing significant market share from Japanese and American brands that already had a firm footing in the domestic car industry. HARI, where Agudo is president and chief executive officer, joined the ranks of Toyota and Honda in the industry’s top 3 in only a decade or so. It earned her various accolades, including being recognized by Ernst & Young as Woman Entrepreneur of the Year-Philippines in 2011. Fast forward to 2017, gender disparity is less of an issue to Agudo and her peers.  HARI and the entire industry are facing disruptive technologies that will likely erode the double-digit growth in vehicle sales in the Philippines that players have been enjoying in the past years.  The continued demand for the services of ride-sharing firms, like Grab and Uber, and other potential innovative alternatives to consumer mobility, such as driverless cars and flying taxis, will shift market positions of current players, Agudo shared.  By 2030, the evolution of the industry – not whether one is male or female – will decide who will be the losers and winners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/188458-msmes-free-trade-robredo-businessmen-asean-summit-2017-philippines/","title":"MSMEs must benefit from free trade, Robredo tells ASEAN businessmen","date":"Nov 14, 2017 7:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Vice President Leni Robredo says technology is a 'wild card' that both rich and poor countries must learn to decode to help small-scale entrepreneurs","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo urged entrepreneurs from Southeast Asia to push for inclusive growth that would benefit even micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Robredo delivered the keynote speech during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Business and Investment Summit on Tuesday, November 14, at the Solaire Resort and Casino, which was held on the sidelines of the 31st ASEAN Summit and Related Summits. (READ: Duterte admin breaks tradition, sidelines Robredo in ASEAN) “The problem of inclusivity is everyone’s job now, because inequality has turned the world’s poor into angry consumers. Technology has given them a voice, and the internet has taught them to use the power granted by democratic and political institutions,” said Robredo.  She said the world has belittled MSMEs, often glossing over the fact that helping them holds the key to addressing inequality. (READ: Create pro-poor business models, Robredo tells ASEAN businessmen)  According to Robredo, both the government and the private sector play crucial roles in helping MSMEs reach their full potential. “For too long, the world has treated micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises  with casual concern, their small economic footprint keeping them in the little boy’s room, unable to participate in global discussions,” said Robredo.  “But if we are to solve inequality, we must ensure that MSMEs benefit from unclogged value chains, fair trade, and peace,” she added.   Citing the recent crisis in Marawi City, the Vice President said creating more “inclusive and sustainable economies” will help ASEAN countries address terrorism and extremism in the region. She said the Marawi seige reminded the public that “desperation provides terrorists fertile ground for recruitment of our youth.” “We need to give our restless youth broader opportunities to take them away from that path. As technology creates faster means of sending information to a content-hungry generation, the faster it will be to influence them to either do good or bad,” said Robredo. Technology and fair trade How should ASEAN pursue inclusive growth? Robredo believes member-states must learn to use the latest innovations in technology – like ride-sharing apps and Airbnb – to their advantage.   “Within this backdrop, technology is a wild card we must all learn to decode – rich and poor countries alike. It is redefining our economies and changing the future of work,” she said. Artificial intelligence, added the Vice President, may also lead humans to compete with machines within the next 5 to 10 years.  “We will have to look at retooling and retraining our people so that their skills will not be at risk of automation. We will need to rewire our education systems to inculcate critical thinking skills and creativity among our youth – skills that cannot be matched by machines,” said Robredo. ASEAN countries, added the Vice President, must aim to pursue fair trade within and outside the regional bloc.  “The best thing that each of you businessmen,  investors,  and policymakers can do for the poor  is to create a moat of responsible sustainability around your businesses. This way,  you keep your employees employed and those who benefit from your goods and services stay happy.  As you do better, we all do better.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/188350-asean-revolution-precrafted-filipino-unicorn/","title":"Filipino unicorn sets eyes outside ASEAN","date":"Nov 14, 2017 11:35 AM PHT","snippet":"Revolution Precrafted, the first Filipino startup valued at more than $1 billion, wants to establish a presence in 18 countries","body":" MANILA, Philippines — A homegrown startup finally managed to get unicorn status with a valuation of over $1 billion but unlike most of its peers, it has set its sights far beyond its regional turf. Revolution Precrafted Properties Limited now joins the very exclusive unicorn club in Southeast Asia that includes ride-sharing firms Grab and Go-Jek, travel firm Traveloka, and tech platform Sea Ltd. Unlike these service-based platforms aiming to expand into and dominate market share in Southeast Asia, Revolution Precrafted’s export-oriented model means it is not geographically dependent. The firm develops pre-built parts of designer homes and offices. Robbie Antonio, son of Century Properties founder and chair Jose EB Antonio, founded it in 2015.  “Unlike many of the unicorns in Southeast Asia, we’re really focused on the world, not just Southeast Asia,” Antonio said on the sidelines of the 2017 ASEAN Business and Investment Summit (ABIS) on Monday, November 13. “We’re really hoping to have a footprint in major parts of the world including America, Europe. The goal is to be the biggest home supplier in the world,” he emphasized. At the moment, however, the firm’s expansion has been confined to the neighboring countries, which Antonio explained was only because of close proximity. “In the end, we’re shipping homes. It is not exactly as easy as shipping other goods like clothing or appliances. It’s a much more complicated job.” The firm recently entered Indonesia after closing a deal early this year with Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie Group. Revolution Precrafted will supply 5 mega studios and 5 hectares of office spaces and storage facilities for a studio project in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Antonio pointed out, however, that there are other deals in the works in the the US and Central America. He plans to expand in phases. “We’ve identified 18 countries we want to open offices in. I just came from the Middle East and we’re going to penetrate that market as well,” he said. Branded housing The new insight Antonio has brought to the prefabricated industry is to combine it with the sheen of exclusivity in a style reminiscent of Century Properties’ use of the Trump and Paris Hilton brands for some of their high-end residential buildings in Manila.  Revolution Precrafted’s roster of high-profile designers for its pre-crafted structures include New York-based architecture firm Philip Johnson Alan Ritchie Architects, Jean Nouvel Design, and music star and designer Lenny Kravitz.  “I didn’t start the pre-fabricated space, but clearly we’re the only ones who are doing this from a branded perspective so we have intellectual property. But I wanted to keep operating and capital expenses down,”  Antonio said. Antonio pointed out that the firm consciously tries to minimize operating and capital expenses, emphasizing that “unlike some of the other ASEAN unicorns, Revolution Precrafted is already highly profitable.” The firm owns no land and carries no inventory while it outsources its construction to factories that use robotics to execute the firm’s designs. “Unlike Grab or Go-Jek which would need to raise $2 billion [to expand], we don’t. We’re never in that position,” Antonio said. ASEAN financing troubles  While Revolution Precrafted’s strategy may differ from its other high-profile peers, one common problem for all of them is “access to funding” in the region.  Speaking at an ABIS panel discussing financial inclusion in the region, Antonio said early stage financing for startups in the region was quite poor and hinders competitiveness compared to developed markets. “There are about a 1,000 unicorns in the world, most of which are situated in America for one reason: access to funding,” he said. “It’s not like we have fewer brilliant people here in Southeast Asia. We’re close to double the population of the America, yet t there are only 9 unicorns in the [region].”  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/188255-uber-deal-sell-stake-softbank/","title":"Uber gives green light for sale of stake to Japan’s SoftBank","date":"Nov 13, 2017 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) 'We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,' a company statement says","body":" NEW YORK, USA (UPDATED)  – Scandal hit ride-sharing company Uber on Sunday, November 12 (November 13, Manila time) announced a deal to sell a stake to Japan’s SoftBank, as the firm looks to turn a new page ahead of its planned IPO by 2019. The move was unveiled shortly after reports emerged that its former CEO Travis Kalanick and an influential investor had buried the hatchet in a long feud that paved the way for the acquisition. “We’ve entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment,” the company said in a statement Sunday evening. “We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber’s long-term potential,” it added. “Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance.” But SoftBank refused to confirm the news when contacted by AFP and said it was not planning to issue any statement on Sunday. The Japanese group, founded by billionaire Masayoshi Son, expressed an interest several months ago in investing around $1 billion in Uber for a stake of at least 14 percent.  But the deal was threatened by conflict between Kalanick and US venture capital firm Benchmark. The latter filed a lawsuit against Kalanick, accusing him of fraud, breach of contract and of plotting to manipulate the board of directors to allow him to return as CEO following his resignation in June. The two parties reportedly reached an agreement on control of board seats, which included Benchmark putting its lawsuit on hold — while Kalanick will allow directors to vote on his future appointments to the 3 seats he oversees. A deal would be positive for Uber, which is looking ahead to the future in the wake of recent repeated scandals, among them workplace sexual harassment allegations. ‘Gorilla’ investor Meanwhile, SoftBank has been diversifying through investment for several years, and has ventured into sectors outside its core mobile technology business – completing deals with the likes of French robotics firm Aldebaran and e-commerce with Chinese giant Alibaba.   It is sending tremors through the tech world with a its massive new Vision Fund — a venture capital fund with $100 billion coffers intended for startups and expected to dominate the industry so thoroughly it’s playfully referred to as a “gorilla.” “SoftBank shows a remarkable amount of bravery, confidence and optimism to look to apply this much money in technology,” said Bill Maris, who started Google Ventures nearly a decade ago and runs his own California-based investment firm Section 32. “I can’t say it’s a wrong bet, if you think the trends in tech will continue in the future. I would be much more worried if SoftBank was saying tech is dead.” Some investors worry that the Vision Fund will buy into startups at high prices, overinflating the market, while crowding out other investors and prolonging the time it takes for young companies to go public. SoftBank has outlined plans to focus on late-stage investments when startups are more established, and on investments of at least $100 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/188017-uber-loses-employment-case-britain/","title":"Uber loses employment rights case in Britain","date":"Nov 10, 2017 7:39 PM PHT","snippet":"The London employment court rejects Uber's appeal against an October 2016 ruling in a case that is being closely watched for the wider implications for Britain's booming 'gig economy'","body":" LONDON, United Kingdom – US ride-hailing app Uber on Friday lost a landmark case in Britain that would give drivers the right to paid holidays and the national minimum wage, lawyers representing the claimants said. The London employment tribunal rejected Uber’s appeal against an October 2016 ruling in a case that is being closely watched for the wider implications for Britain’s booming “gig economy”. “Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset,” Paul Jennings from law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite said in a statement. “The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so-called gig economy,” he said. Uber said it will appeal the ruling. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal,” Tom Elvidge, Uber UK’s acting general manager, said in a statement. “Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control. We’ve also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover,” he said. Uber drivers are paid for each ride and the firm insists they are self-employed, choosing when, where and for how long they drive. ‘Brutally exploitative’  However, James Farrar, who brought the test case with fellow former driver Yaseen Aslam, has called Uber’s business plan “brutally exploitative”. They are supported by the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) trade union, which also represents couriers, cleaners, foster carers and security officers. “These companies are making a mockery of supposed employment rights,” the union’s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said in a statement. Ahead of the ruling, an Uber spokesman told AFP that whatever the result, it “will not necessarily be the end of the process and we expect either side would appeal”. Any challenge would go to the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider a similar case involving the company Pimlico Plumbers, which is appealing a ruling that one of its former plumbers was entitled to employment rights. Uber meanwhile is currently fighting a decision by London authorities not to renew its license, owing to public safety concerns. The company has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital. – Rappler.com   UBER LOSES.

It also announced Los Angeles will join two other previously revealed “UberAIR” pilot schemes in Dallas Fort-Worth, Texas, and Dubai. California and Texas are the US states with the largest number of cars. “Uber’s participation in NASA’s UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) Project will help the company’s goal of starting demonstration flights of uberAIR in select US cities by 2020,” the ride-sharing company said in a statement. Uber wants to “explore other collaboration opportunities with NASA” with a view to open “a new market of urban air mobility,” it added. The first demonstration flights are expected in 2020, moving into commercial operations by 2023 – in plenty of time for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The flights will have a pilot during initial flights, but could be automated in the future, spokesman Matthew Wing confirmed to AFP. An UberAir journey between Los Angeles’ airport and the Staples Center arena, for example, would take 27 minutes – three times less time than the same journey by car.  The promotional video posted above illustrates that the app would work in a similar way to the current set-up for ordering a car ride.

These days, it seems that enduring bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city has become the norm, even for nearby destinations. According to a survey commissioned by Uber Philippines, the average Manila driver spends 66 minutes in traffic everyday. And the delay doesn’t end when you reach your destination – lack of parking space sets drivers back an additional 24 minutes every day, according to the same study. These inconveniences affect not just car owners, but also pedestrians and commuters who also experience slow traffic and sidewalks being taken over by cars. Can you relate to these scenarios? There are many ways to solve the issue – the government can introduce and execute ideas to help improve public transportation and beef up road infrastructure, for starters.

An initial court hearing is expected on December 11. London transport authorities last month said they would not renew Uber’s licence to operate in the city owing to public safety concerns. Transport for London (TfL) claims that the conduct of Uber, which has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital, had raised concerns. “While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” Uber added on Friday.  “As our new CEO (Dara Khosrowshahi) has said, we are determined to make things right.” TfL has highlighted the company’s approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and to obtaining criminal record checks for drivers as factors in its decision. The company came under scrutiny in Britain after it emerged that dozens of rape and sexual assault claims had been made against their drivers and when one of their drivers used his vehicle in a recent terror attack on Buckingham Palace. It also questioned the process through which drivers obtain their medical certificates and the practice of “greyballing”, when the company uses a fake version of its app to fool regulators in cities in which it is banned. ‘Mistakes’ In an open letter last month, Khosrowshahi apologized for “mistakes” made by Uber. “While Uber had revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way,” he wrote. But he pledged to appeal the TfL decision “on behalf of millions of Londoners.” Uber hired Khosrowshahi from US travel group Expedia in August, in the hope that he can steer the ride-sharing service away from the string of controversies. Uber, which has accumulated financial losses, has faced allegations also of technology theft, corruption and use of illegal software. At the same time, its drivers have been struggling with a wave of opposition from traditional taxis in several countries – and has faced regulatory problems in other hubs including Cape Town, Mumbai, and New Delhi. But Uber has seen also its global popularity explode since it launched in 2009 in San Francisco. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/184812-gcash-pay-easier-phone/","title":"8 ways your phone makes paying easier","date":"Oct 12, 2017 10:29 AM PHT","snippet":"Avoid heavy traffic and long lines with the help of your mobile wallet","body":"MANILA, Philippines – Going cashless used to be a luxury available only to those who have credit cards. {source}  {/source} But now, anyone with a mobile phone can now conveniently pay for everyday transactions like buying prepaid load, paying utility bills, and more!

The proposal adopted by Uber’s board also promised to put an end to in-fighting between Kalanick supporters and investors who suspected the co-founder was plotting a wily return to the head of the company. “Today, after welcoming its new directors Ursula Burns and John Thain, the board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,” Uber said in an emailed statement. “SoftBank’s interest is an incredible vote of confidence in Uber’s business and long-term potential, and we look forward to finalizing the investment in the coming weeks.” If the investment goes ahead as proposed, Softbank would directly pump between $1 billion and $1.25 billion into Uber at the San Francisco-based startup’s current valuation of $69 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. As a secondary investment move, the Japanese group would put out an open offer to buy 14% to 17% of outstanding shares from large investors at a discounted price, the source said. Major investors who are unhappy with the leading smartphone-summoned ride share startup, or who want to cash-in on early investments that have multiplied in value, could take SoftBank up on the offer. Governance changes approved by the board hinge on the SoftBank investment taking place. Changes included eliminating “super-voting” power of some shares, such as those owned by Kalanick, to shift to a one vote per share model that would curtail the co-founders clout, according to the source. The board also endorsed Uber going public with a stock market debut by the year 2019. The board itself would expand from 11 seats to 17 seats, with two of the additions going to SoftBank and the other four being independent. One of the four independent seats would chair the board. Rule changes for the board would include requiring two-thirds or more of the board to approve any new chief executive hired before the stock market debut, signaling that newly-appointed boss Dara Khosrowshahi would be safely ensconced at the startup. If all of those piece fall into place, a lawsuit filed by early Uber investor Benchmark Capital will be dropped, ending a distracting power struggle at the company, the source told AFP. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/183624-competition-policy-enforcement-in-the-digital-age/","title":"Competition policy enforcement in the digital age","date":"Sep 30, 2017 11:26 AM PHT","snippet":"The decisions to be made by the Philippine Competition Commission in coming months, as it fully implements the Philippine Competition Act, will set the tone for competition regulation in Philippine markets","body":"On August 23, 2017, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) greenlighted the proposal of Alibaba founder and Chinese tycoon Jack Ma’s Alipay Singapore Holding Pte Ltd (Alipay) to acquire a 45% share in Globe Fintech Innovations, Incorporated (Mynt). Mynt was formerly wholly-owned by Globe Capital Venture, Incorporated, itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globe Telecom, Incorporated. The PCC decided that based on the facts and circumstances disclosed by the transacting parties, the proposed acquisition would not substantially lessen competition in the relevant market for electronic money payment and related services. Following an in-depth review of the case, the commission found no basis to suspect increased ability or incentive for the parties to engage in foreclosure or anti-competitive behavior in the face of competitive restraints from other incumbent and potential market participants, both domestic and foreign. A week prior, PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan confirmed to the media that the PCC had requested to meet with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) about the month-long suspension of Uber’s Philippine operations. The commission was concerned that elevated demand and prices for other ride-sharing services in the absence of viable transportation alternatives affected consumer welfare. The suspension ended prematurely on August 29 after Uber paid a P190-million fine, in addition to assuring P229.2 million in financial assistance to drivers displaced during the 15-day suspension. Nevertheless, the PCC’s initiation of a dialogue with the LTFRB showed the commission’s agility in responding to the emergence of competition issues. This is a crucial function of the PCC, which must vigilantly monitor and sort out potential threats to socially-beneficial competition, even when the source of such threats is another government agency.  The digital economy democratizes markets  To this day, business deals across all stages of production and distribution in the Philippines are realized or hindered based on familial ties and patronage. As such, market access, financing, and technical expertise remain elusive for many small and unconnected businesses. Digital platforms and services provide small-scale entrepreneurs access to financing, marketing, and distribution networks, allowing them to start up, grow, and connect their business to a vast network of consumers and other firms based within and outside main urban hubs. For example, the fundamental innovation behind ride-sharing, as popularized by Uber and Grab, was the creation of an accessible and reliable platform for drivers to set up profitable independent operations, while providing riders a centralized and convenient transport option. Meanwhile, the electronic payments market, which is expected to quickly grow and develop following the Alipay investment in Mynt, provides a means for fast and convenient business-to-business and business-to-customer financing and transactions. The PCC itself expressed a desire to facilitate expansion and innovation in the nascent industry, seeing its potential to serve the needs of unbanked individuals and small businesses. The digital challenge Even with full appreciation of the benefits of the digital economy, it is undeniable that the two recent PCC engagements portend the rise of competition issues concerning these new ways of doing business. The digital economy is characterized by a complex value web of interconnected markets with constantly evolving products, participants, and boundaries. Players in the digital economy leverage modern telecommunications technology and interconnectivity to engage in platform development and use advanced data analytics to serve as intermediaries between different economic sectors. This leads to the prevalence of multi-sided markets, where instead of just buyers and sellers, a platform provider links two or more groups of clients, such as suppliers, advertisers, and consumers. In addition to electronic financial services and ride-sharing platforms in the cases above, other examples of digital economy operators include online search giant Google, e-commerce aggregators like Lazada and Zalora, entertainment platforms like Netflix, and social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, among others. The multi-sided structure of digital markets allows extensive network effects. The network effects in these markets can be direct, that is, on the same side of the market. For example, if more of your friends are on one social networking platform, you would be encouraged to sign up for the same one. There can also be indirect or cross-side effects, like when sellers decide to sign on to an e-commerce aggregator based on customer traffic or when brands and businesses choose social networks to advertise with based on the number of the platform’s active users. Since transactions are processed online at minimal cost, digital economy players can take advantage of such network effects and benefit from increasing returns to scale, leading to massive scalability. Taken together, multi-sided network effects and increasing returns to scale lead to the tendency of digital markets towards dominance by a single firm or by a few large players. But the markets are multi-sided, and it is relatively easy to move from one digital platform to another. This provides many ways to reach end users, so while specific markets are prone to domination, broadly speaking, the manner of service delivery remains contestable. This staves off complacency on the part of market leaders that still have an incentive to stay at the top of their game and to innovate to keep their position. Therefore, in the digital economy, market power and dominance may not necessarily imply harmful consumer and competitive effects traditionally associated with monopolies. But competition authorities traditionally look into the accrual of market power and the potential abuses that firms or groups of firms may perpetrate to the disadvantage of competitors and consumers. They employ frameworks that assess markets and determine appropriate policy interventions depending on the relevant market identified, established dominance, and estimated likelihood or proof of perpetration of abusive or anti-competitive conduct. They observe patterns in pricing and market share, among others. The distinctive features of the digital economy challenge traditional frameworks for competition policy enforcement, requiring a shift in approach from rigid conceptions of market boundaries to the development of new theories of harm, depending on evolving business models; from reliance on pricing signals to the proactive design of incentives for innovation; and from evaluations of static efficiency to a greater consideration of dynamic efficiency in the multiple interrelated markets. International debate: The case of Google  In recent years, the European Commission had pursued charges against online search giant Google. In June 2017, it finally decided to fine Google 2.42 billion euros for abusing its large market share in online search to stifle competition in the comparison shopping market by giving illegal advantage to its Google Shopping service in online search results. The decision’s key point was that firms must compete on the merits of a product, rather than by leveraging the company’s dominance either in the market for that product or in other markets. The decision called for equal treatment of the platform provider’s own services and rival services in the pertinent market. On top of this, two other cases under investigation relate to anti-competitive behavior involving the Android operating system and AdSense. The European Commission advised of preliminary decisions leaning on further adverse decisions and fines against Google. Meanwhile, the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau had earlier dropped cases against Google based on the direct consumer welfare effects of Google’s actions and the precedent message on innovation an adverse decision would make. They reportedly found insufficient evidence that the company engaged in anti-competitive behavior or abuses of its dominance in the online search market. The European Commission decision is evidence of its staunch advocacy of ensuring a competitive environment among firms in the tech ecosystem, arguing that fair competition allows other firms to compete and provides consumers with genuine choice and the full benefits of innovation. These divergent actions taken by the world’s major antitrust bodies illustrate potential gray areas in assessing and regulating the anti-competitive behavior of digital market players. Cultivating a culture of competition  Since the Philippines is in the relatively early stages of competition policy advocacy and enforcement, authorities have latitude in spreading awareness and obtaining buy-in among stakeholders when it comes to understanding the benefits of market competition and adjusting practices to foster a culture of competition. The PCC finds itself in the unique position of being guided but not bound by precedents from jurisdictions with long-established competition regimes, that are themselves reassessing their frameworks in light of the new challenges presented by the digital economy. Nevertheless, the decisions to be made by the commission in coming months, as it fully implements the Philippine Competition Act, will set the tone for competition regulation in Philippine markets. Taking competence in economic and legal analysis, along with genuine concern for societal welfare, as given, foresight and prudence will serve the commission well in “ensuring businesses compete and consumers benefit” in all markets, traditional and digital. – Rappler.com   Emmanuel M.

The longstanding driving ban was seen internationally as a symbol of repression of women in the Gulf kingdom and its repeal comes after years of resistance from female activists. The shock announcement, which risks riling religious conservatives, is part of Saudi Arabia’s ambitious reform push aimed at adapting to a post-oil era and improving a global reputation battered by its human rights record. “King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud has issued a decree authorizing the issuance of drivers’ licenses for women in the kingdom,” Saudi state TV said. “The decree will take effect in June 2018.” Saudi Arabia will use the “preparatory period” until then to expand licensing facilities and develop the infrastructure to accommodate millions of new drivers, the announcement added. Conservative clerics in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy ruled according to sharia law, have long justified the ban arguing that lifting it would lead to promiscuity. One of them claimed that driving harmed women’s ovaries. Many women’s rights activists have been jailed for flouting the ban. The surprise announcement was widely welcomed, both at home and abroad. “A glorious day. Can’t hold back my tears,” tweeted Saudi shura council member Latifah Alshaalan. “Congratulations to the women of my homeland.” Activist Manal al-Sharif, who led the 2011 “Women2Drive” protest movement, tweeted: “Today, the last country on earth to allow women to drive… we did it.” “It is a testimony to the bravery of women activists who have been campaigning for years that… Saudi Arabia has finally relented and decided to permit women to drive,” rights watchdog Amnesty International said. Tight restrictions Saudi Arabia has some of the world’s tightest restrictions on women. Under the country’s guardianship system, a male family member – normally the father, husband or brother – must grant permission for a woman’s study, travel and other activities. It was unclear whether women would require their guardian’s permission to apply for a driving license. After Tuesday’s historic announcement, the hashtags “I am my own guardian” and “Saudi Women Can Drive” began gaining traction on social media, while many openly lampooned conservatives who long favoured the ban. One Saudi woman tweeted a picture of three women in a convertible going shopping, with the message: “Us soon.” The policy could socially liberate women – heavily reliant on foreign drivers and ride-sharing apps – and also boost the economy at a time of low oil prices by increasing their participation in the workforce, experts say. The announcement follows a dazzling gender-mixed celebration of Saudi national day at the weekend, the first of its kind, which aimed to spotlight the kingdom’s reform drive despite a backlash from religious conservatives. Men and women danced in the streets to drums and electronic music, in scenes that are a stunning anomaly in a country known for its tight gender segregation and an austere vision of Islam. Women were also allowed into a sports stadium – previously a male-only arena – to watch a concert, a move that chimes with the government’s Vision 2030 plan for social and economic reform. With more than half the country aged under 25, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king’s son and the architect of Vision 2030, is seen as catering to the aspirations of younger people. ‘A great step’ US President Donald Trump welcomed the decision as “a positive step toward promoting the rights and opportunities of women in Saudi Arabia”, according to a White House statement. The US State Department called it a “great step in the right direction”, echoing a similar comment from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Tuesday’s announcement comes at a crucial time for Saudi Arabia. The oil kingpin is in a battle for regional influence with arch-rival Iran, bogged down in a controversial military intervention in neighboring Yemen and at loggerheads with fellow US Gulf ally Qatar. “Allowing women to drive is the biggest PR win that Saudi Arabia – and Prince Mohammed – could have in a single swoop,” said Jane Kinninmont, from London’s Chatham House. Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, heir apparent Prince Mohammed, 32, is seen as stamping out traces of internal dissent before any formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father. His gambit to loosen social restrictions, which has so far not translated into more political and civil rights, seeks to ease criticism over a recent political crackdown, some analysts say. Authorities this month arrested more than two dozen people, including influential clerics and activists, in what critics decried as a coordinated crackdown. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/182380-protect-private-information-online/","title":"#2030Now: How to protect your private information online","date":"Sep 17, 2017 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"National Privacy Commissioner Raymund Liboro stresses the importance of the right of everyone to have their private information secure","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Technology now serves as the middleman for almost everything – may it be on ride-sharing services, social networking platforms, and online short-term lodging services, said Commissioner Raymund Liboro of the National Privacy Commission (NPC). “We took away the middleman in everything we do [and replaced it with our] personal data,” said Liboro during the Social Good Summit on Saturday, September 16, in Taguig City. While the internet brings with it a lot of benefits and advantages, it also has the capacity to put people in danger, he said. Emphasizing the importance of protecting one’s private information online, he cited instances when the power of technology caused more harm than good.  Just last year, the Philippine Commission on Elections was hacked and resulted in the leak of citizens’ private information: birthdates, fingerprint data, addresses, citizenship information, passport information, and other valuable personal data. (READ: Website leaks Philippine voter data ) Liboro also cited another case of failure of data privacy when the user’s information of the dating website Ashley Madison was leaked, causing suicides among involved people.  With this kind of environment, he stressed the importance of the right of everyone to have their private information secure.  The NPC is a government agency that seeks to uphold and protect the right to privacy, and at the same time ensure free flow of information to help spur innovation. Liboro reminded the rights of a data subject when their private information is at stake: The Philippines also has the Data Privacy Act of 2012, which gives the control of information back to the owner.  The law recognizes “the vital role of information and communications technology in nation-building and its inherent obligation to ensure that personal information in information and communications systems in the government and in the private sector are secured and protected,” He added that this “law is a 21st-century law that protects one’s 21st-century rights”. Aside from the Data Privacy Act, the country also has the Cybercrime Prevention Act, Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act, and E-Commerce Act to ensure the protection of people’s online rights.  Tips To prevent problems involving private information, Liboro gave simple and practical tips that can help citizens safeguard their information in the digital world.   –Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/180694-new-uber-chief-sees-ipo-future-report/","title":"New Uber chief sees IPO in its future – report","date":"Aug 31, 2017 9:23 AM PHT","snippet":"Freshly hired Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi meets with employees, promising to fight for the company and hinting a stock market debut is in its future","body":"SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Freshly hired Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi met with employees on Wednesday, August 30, promising to fight for the company and hinting a stock market debut is in its future.

Born in Iran, Khosrowshahi immigrated to the United States with his family as a child and became a citizen here. Expedia shares have climbed more than five-fold during the 12 years Khosrowshahi has been in charge of the travel services internet firm. “I don’t doubt his skills and his background in finance and hospitality, which is going to be very important,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Silicon Valley technology analyst firm Creative Strategies. “The only thing we don’t know is his ability to navigate some of the difficult settings around internal disciplinary issues and code of conduct that he will inherit.” Need for discipline  Khosrowshahi will have to address conflicts with regulators and taxi operators, a cut-throat company culture, sexism and board members feuding with investors over Kalanick.  Kalanick was the driving force behind Uber, taking a spur-of-moment idea and turning it into the world’s most valuable venture-funded tech startup. But his brash personality and freewheeling management style, which some argue set a tone inside the company, made him a liability as well as an asset to the global ridesharing giant, and in June he stepped down as chief executive. Good chief executives typically ramp up discipline and accountability in employee ranks upon taking charge at companies, so that would likely be among steps taken by Khosrowshahi at the Uber helm, according to Bajarin. “He is going to have to be highly aggressive in disciplining the company to stay on message and, more importantly, to stick within whatever the codes of conduct are,” the analyst said. Khosrowshahi has consistently scored well at website Glass Door, where executives and companies are anonymously rated by employees past and present, suggesting he might able to parent workers without alienating them. And, since Uber’s board members including Kalanick need a consensus to offer him the job as chief, he could have backing if he butts heads with those resentful the founder was pressured to step down. Is it enough? Khosroshahi’s strong background in travel and transportation should be a benefit when it comes to guiding Uber through its next phase of growth, according to Bajarin. Khosrowshahi’s experience includes jobs managing finance and strategy, having worked in executive positions at IAC/InterActiveCorp and the investment firm of Allen & Company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Khosrowshahi, 48, was born in Tehran to a prominent family behind a conglomerate with interests in food, trade, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and more.  His family immigrated to the United States prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1978. He attended college here, earning a university degree in electrical engineering. Expedia is based in the city of Bellevue, near Seattle. “If Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing – he’s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure, it will be with my best wishes,” Diller said in a letter included with a filing notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that Khosrowshahi had been offered the job as chief of Uber.

Hundreds of thousands of Manila commuters find Uber and its ride-sharing rivals welcome alternatives to the country’s notoriously poor and overcrowded buses and trains, run-down taxis and irascible cab drivers.  But late Friday, August 25 the government’s transport agency said it would lift the ban following an Uber appeal. It ordered the US firm to pay a fine of P190 million ($3.7 million) and give its drivers financial aid for lost earnings. “The online ride-sharing services of the respondent USI (Uber) will be restored when it has paid the amount of fine and the said financial assistance remitted,” a Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) resolution said. Uber said it would comply with the ruling, which also requires it to pay about $391,000 a day in financial assistance – split between its Philippine drivers – until the company restores its operations. “We’re working hard to meet the conditions for the lifting of the suspension and hope to resume operations as soon as possible,” it said in a brief statement that did not give a timetable. The Philippine transportation agency last year imposed a moratorium on the processing of new applications for ride-sharing services as it studied how to regulate a growing industry.

Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season.

Just a day after announcing that they will be “recruiting and activating drivers” to “provide service in the gap left by Uber’s abrupt withdrawal,” the service is already trading jabs with the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Arcade City says in an online press release: “We forgive the LTFRB for ordering Arcade City to ‘cease operations’ before they understood what Arcade City is and is not, specifically how Arcade City is different from Uber.” On August 16, the LTFRB issued a cessation order, where it said that it considers Arcade City as another transport network company (TNC) and told them to stop bookings on the platform.  {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fltfrb.citizen.enforcer%2Fposts%2F1932143470360905&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”676″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source}   Arcade City contends that it “does not provide ‘pre-arranged transportation services for compensation’ and therefore does not fit the LTFRB definition of a transportation network company.” LTFRB’s memorandum on TNCs defines the term as an “organization whether a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship that provides pre-arranged transportation services for compensation using an internet-based technology application or digital platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.”  Arcade City explains further that while drivers may freely identify as Arcade City drivers, “Arcade City does not require payment from riders or drivers.” Arcade City calls the system a new “peer-to-peer model of ridesharing” – both riders and passengers find one another on the app, but Arcade City doesn’t set the rates like Uber or Grab does. Instead, according to their press release, “drivers are free to set their own rates.” Essentially, Arcade City is an open market, where buyers (riders) and vendors (drivers) strike deals.  How does it make its money? Arcade City takes 10% of the rides paid through the app according to a May 2016 article by U.S. website Vice. It also described Arcade City as the “black market Uber that runs on Facebook.” For a time, Arcade City connected riders and drivers via the Facebook group “Arcade City Austin/Request A Ride” before it relaunched its app. The Facebook group is still online, where Arcade City founder and CEO Christopher David (pictured below) is one of 3 administrators.  {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D648737088616589%26set%3Da.100507176772919.707.100004409100811%26type%3D3&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”444″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} “Let’s play,” David says in his re-posting of Arcade City’s statement to the LTFRB: {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMillennialChris%2Fposts%2F908150226008606&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”483″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} David is a former Uber driver in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, who has been vocal against his distaste for corporate authority.  In an interview with cyrptocurrency site Coin Telegraph, David said that while government regulation is definitely an issue for drivers, an even bigger issue has been “drivers being mistreated by the distant corporate HQ.”  “Uber and Lyft are run by nerds in San Francisco. To them, drivers are just numbers. The fares that determine drivers’ livelihood are just levers to push and pull to maximize profit. The driver uproar and mass protests following last week’s rate decrease tells me this is the perfect time to launch a decentralized alternative,” said David, making references to Uber fare decreases in 2016 and his decentralized alternative Arcade City.  Mirroring the current situation in the Philippines, Arcade City emerged in Austin, Texas after Uber and Lyft withdrew. The two ride-sharing companies exited in May 2016 after disagreements on regulations, but finally returned in June 2017. During their hiatus, Arcade City built up their ridesharing network that they say now has 43,000 members. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/178935-uber-not-perfect/","title":"Uber is not perfect, and we should not be afraid to point that out","date":"Aug 16, 2017 5:41 PM PHT","snippet":"If we continue to push for 'solutions' that only benefit a fraction of the public, then we continue to be part of the problem","body":"Of course people are mad. After several years of dependency on Uber and Grab as an alternative to our decrepit public transport system, recent events have rendered Metro Manila’s middle class commuters stranded – literally and figuratively. Uber has been suspended by the LTFRB for defying an order to stop accrediting more drivers, leading patrons to take part in the newfound – and very pricey – bloodsport that is grabbing a super-surged Grab, or trudging along in Dickensian queues for trains, jeeps, and buses. If you’ve long felt safe in the knowledge that you can get from Point A to B with the least amount of suffering, having that taken away from you can only make you feel cheated and wronged. On social media alone, just saying anything remotely negative towards ride sharing apps is a death wish; whole droves of netizens will shame you for even daring to think these apps are anything but a godsend. Moreover, the LTFRB has been cursed out and disparaged more than ever, labeled as enemies of technological progress.  What the madding crowd fails to acknowledge, however, is that this issue has more than one villain. We tend to take the good vs evil concept too simplistically, content with the idea that if one is bad (LTFRB), then the other must be good (Uber), and that at the end of this issue, only one must prevail. But let’s face it: as messed up as the LTFRB may be (and its incompetence, at this point, is well documented), Uber is also very much a culprit in this chaos. It is one thing to disrupt the norm to do things better; it is a whole other thing to circumvent an order on the pretense of being a disruptor, and at the expense not only of frazzled commuters, but of Uber drivers and the loved ones they financially support.  Uber is not being hard-headed as some kind of power-to-the-people, Robin Hood-style derring-do. Uber kept accrediting drivers because it is a business, and its financial success depends on having as many drivers as possible plowing the streets. If Uber truly was interested in people’s wellbeing, as its marketing strongly suggests, then it would not have put the livelihoods of Uber drivers in danger.  Yes, these drivers are not technically under Uber’s employ the way employment is normally understood – a loophole that reveals disruption’s dark side – but the company is still willfully ignoring the fact that many of these drivers depend on the app as their sole source of income, and are putting these men and women on the chopping block ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, many Uber patrons gloss over the company’s bullheadedness and this brazen exploitation of technicalities, because it is all too easy to just focus on how the app benefits their commute in the short term.  If there is any party citizens should be siding with on this issue, then, it is neither the LTFRB nor Uber. It should be with the public. And the public is certainly not limited to middle class commuters who could afford to shell out a few hundred pesos a day to travel faster and more comfortably than others. Our energies would be far better directed not at idly demonizing a long-problematic agency, or defending a company that essentially sees us as bags of money, but at clamoring for an honest-to-goodness middle ground, where public transport is greatly augmented through sustainable, accessible tech.  If we continue to push for “solutions” that only benefit a fraction of the public, then we continue to be part of the problem. Yes, fixing the catastrophe that is the Metro Manila commute is easier said than done, but we have to suck it up and understand that addressing serious issues entails a lot of time and effort and cooperation. It is not going to be easy; that’s just how it is, and the sooner we accept this and get the process going, the sooner we can see results that actually help for the long haul.  The culture of disruption remains welcome, and clearly inevitable. But entities that thrive on it are neither foolproof nor absolute, and the last thing we need disrupted is our ability to call out bullshit when we see it. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/177496-angkas-bikers-gather-donations-passenger-coma/","title":"Angkas bikers crowdsource donations for passenger’s medical bills","date":"Aug 10, 2017 4:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Bikers from the ride-hailing service Angkas raise at least P25,000 for the Angkas passenger who ended up in a coma after a road crash","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Around 200 motorcycle riders and passengers of ride-sharing app Angkas gathered at the Quirino Grandstand last July 30 for a shared purpose: to gather donations for passenger Alejandro Cajano who ended up in a coma after figuring in a crash.  Cajano was on his way to Makati on July 15 when the motorcycle he booked through Angkas figured in a vehicular crash. The incident left him in critical condition. His hospitalization bills are now estimated at over P1 million. (READ: Angkas passenger in coma after crash: Who’s liable?) While Angkas is also providing financial assistance, the ride-hailing service’s bikers themselves organized their own efforts. Sympathizing with Cajano and his family, Angkas bikers organized the meetup through a Facebook group chat. The group was able to gather P25,000 from those who attended as well as those who sent in their donations online.  This is not the first time the rider groups worked together to assist one of their own.  Luisito Castillo, an Angkas rider, says there are numerous group chats and Facebook groups for the motorcycle riding community which serve as a support system for fellow riders.  These group chats are always active, with daily updates on traffic-free routes as well as calls for rescue during emergency situations. Not just a community of riders The effort of Angkas bikers to help Cajano is just a glimpse of how tight-knit the biking community is. According to Jon Guarin, one of the leaders of Team Riders, their community is more a family than just a gathering of fellow riders. They constantly organize events and gatherings to strengthen their bond. Castillo shares that there is not even a month that there was no event for riders.  These events also include disaster response efforts, outreach activities for the homeless, fallen soldiers, and several other advocacies.  The community of riders recognizes the importance of strengthening their bond as they continue to face challenges on the road every day. According to the World Health Organization, 23% of the 1.25 million road crash related deaths every year involves motorcycles. Experiencing the same vulnerable environment makes understanding and supporting each other easier.  They also face other problems, such as a ban on motorcycle helmets imposed by some cities due to security issues. While this may ease local officials’ concerns on motorcycle-riding criminals, it can also leave riders vulnerable to injuries. “In order to slowly change the stereotype against us, we want to set a good example and let everyone know that we can do good things not only for our fellow riders but to anyone who needs help,” Castillo said in Filipino.  Driven by their similar passion to ride, they took it upon themselves to help each other as one community. Riders like Castillo and Guarin believe that their love for riding and the convenience it brings them are big factors why the biking community has a strong connection.  The internet and social media even made connecting with each other easier. One of the Facebook groups organized by the riders, named R.A.C.E.R. (Riders Anti-Crime & Emergency Response), has reached up to 57,000 members.  This simple Facebook group has become a daily safe space for them to ask and extend help especially during road crashes or crime-related emergencies. The group’s page is constantly filled with pictures, videos, and information that the riders encounter daily on the road.   Castillo said that he used to ride out before just to look for people to rescue. Now, it became easier to locate and help people through Facebook groups and chat groups.  During an emergency situation, a few riders need only to start a group chat, and within a few minutes, more members will join in, ready to help. “Kailangan lang po talaga na may magsimula para maipakita sa marami na pwedeng makatulong ang kahit sino. Yung maliit na pagtulong, pag pinagsama-sama ay lumalaki rin,” Castillo said.  (All it takes is just one member to initiate action, to show others that anyone can help. A small amount of help gathered together will eventually accumulate.) – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177848-weekly-video-highlights-july-30-august-5-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Videos you need to watch this week, July 30-August 5, 2017","date":"Aug 6, 2017 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Must-watch videos from this week","body":"Dear Rappler readers, It is the first week of August, and in the Philippines, the month began with the continuing woes in the Bureau of Customs.

Meski dicintai konsumen, pesaingnya yang masih konvensional menyuarakan keberatan yang memaksa pemerintah turun tangan. Kementerian Perhubungan mengeluarkan Peraturan Menteri Perhubungan (Permenhub) Nomor 26 tahun 2017 yang mengatur pembatasan kuota armada; tarif atas dan bawah; serta pengalihan kepemilikan kendaraan. “Tiga klausul ini menambah rumit situasi,” kata Presidium Masyarakat Transportasi Indonesia (MTI) Muslich Zainal Asikin di Jakarta pada Kamis, 3 Agustus. Ia melihat keberadaan aplikasi daring penyedia jasa transportasi sebagai jalan keluar masalah konektivitas di Indonesia. Di Indonesia, keterhubungan antara satu lokasi dengan lokasi lainnya rendah; aksesbilitas pun cenderung sulit karena tidak semua daerah terjangkau transportasi umum. Untuk wilayah Jabodetabek, kualitas layanan transportasi umum di 40 persen wilayahnya masih kurang memadai. Tak ayal, indeks konektivitas Indonesia hanya 2,01 persen berdasarkan Bank Dunia; atau paling rendah di ASEAN. Padahal, pada tahun 2020 diperkirakan lebih dari 30 juta orang akan pindah ke perkotaan karena alasan ekonomi. Waktu perjalanan sendiri akan bertambah 1,9 menit untuk setiap peningkatan populasi sebanyak 100 ribu orang. Berdasarkan riset yang dilakukan lembaga AlphaBeta pada Mei 2017 lalu, setelah kemunculan aplikasi seperti Uber, Grab, ataupun Go-Jek, masyarakat dapat menghemat 10-38 persen waktu perjalanan mereka. Waktu yang dihabiskan rata-rata orang Indonesia di 33 provinsi dalam perjalanan, bila diuangkan, mencapai Rp 498 triliun dan diprediksi meningkat 41 persen menjadi Rp 703 triliun pada 2020. “Sistem ride-sharing bisa memangkas hingga Rp 138 triliun pada 2020,” kata Muhclis. Karena jumlah mobil yang beroperasi di jalanan juga berkurang sehingga bisa mengurangi kemacetan. Potensi ekonomi Direktur Institute for Development of Economics (INDEF) Enny Sri Hartati mengatakan aplikasi daring ini membantu perekonomian Indonesia. Sekitar 43 persen dari salah satu mitra aplikasi penyedia jasa transportasi yang disurvei sebelumnya tidak memiliki pekerjaan. Demikian juga penelitian oleh Puskakom UI menemukan kalau munculnya aplikasi daring ini membantu menyerap angkatan kerja yang masih menganggur. Bahkan, 77 persen dari pengemudi yang disurvei juga menerima upah di atas rata-rata minimum nasional. Tak hanya itu, pemudahan akses transportasi juga dapat membantu perekonomian. “Misalnya dapat mempertemukan produk petani langsung dengan konsumen akhir. Artinya, dapat mempertemukan produk petani langsung dengan konsumen akhir, seperti di daerah-daerah,” kata Enny. Penataan kota pun bisa terbantu, karena transportasi daring bisa membantu masyarakat menuju transportasi publik. Lahan yang harganya masih terjangkau seringkali masih jauh dari jalur angkutan umum terdekat. Riset menemukan 4-15 persen perjalanan dengan Uber dimulai atau diakhiri 200 meter dari pusat angkutan umum; 24 persen perjalanan di Jakarta dan 42 persen di Bandung mengarah ke pinggiran kota yang jarang angkutan umum; sementara 30 persen di Jakarta terjadi pada jam 22.00-02.00 saat tak ada lagi transportasi publik yang beroperasi. “Kehadiran transportasi umum juga memungkinkan menjai solusi untuk penataan kawasan pemukiman. Di daerah yang harga lahannya masih terjangkau, sering terkendala ketiadaan fasilitas transportasi,” kata dia. Revisi aturan Baik Muchlis maupun Enny mendorong supaya pemerintah lebih terbuka dengan moda transportasi baru ini. Penetapan kuota serta tarif atas dan bawah justru membatasi kesempatan masyarakat untuk bekerja. “Harus ada kajian komprehensif mengenai pengenaan tarif batas atas atau pun tarif batas bawah dengan melihat lebih banyak aspek,” kata Enny. Menurut dia, jika masing-masing pelaku usaha transportasi telah memiliki hak dan kewajiban yang sama, dan persaingan usaha telah berlangsung secara sehat dan adil maka pengaturan justru akan mendistorsi pasar. Muchlis menilai ketimbang protes, lebih baik penyedia jasa angkutan konvensional fokus mengembangkan diri. Seperti misalkan menghilangkan taksi dengan biaya siluman, pelayanan buruk, atau yang menerapkan sistem harga ‘tembak.’ Mereka juga harus lebih aktif memenuhi tuntutan masyarakat, seperti misalkan sistem pemesanan yang lebih mudah; atau identitas sopir yang mudah dibagikan sehingga membuat penumpang merasa aman. “Mereka juga harus berkembang dan memperbaiki diri, juga belajar berbagi dengan pemain baru. Masa mau untung sendiri?” kata dia. MTI mendorong pemerintah untuk segera merevisi Permenhub 26/2017 karena justru mencoreng muka sendiri. Saat negara lain mulai membuat kebijakan yang memudahkan transportasi berbasis daring, Indonesia malah menyulitkan. Seharusnya pemerintah lebih fokus mengatur soal keselamatan, kepastian KIR, dan kelayakan mengemudi angkutan berbasis daring. “Bisa dievaluasi lagi, setahun atau setengah tahun, kemudian revisi aturannya,” kata dia. – Rappler.com BACA JUGA:    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177568-uber-ltfrb-ancient-rules-technological-innovations/","title":"Uber to LTFRB: Don’t impose ancient rules on technological innovations","date":"Aug 3, 2017 1:25 PM PHT","snippet":"'What we are asking for is the right regulation and right process.

(READ: EXPLAINER: LTFRB requirements for Grab, Uber permits) “We are not adverse to regulation. What we are asking for is the right regulation and right process.

Gonzalez also hit the government agency for its “inefficient processes.” “Let’s simplify processes. We are not against applying for accreditation. What we are against is inefficient process for TNVS (transport network vehicle services),” he said. (READ: Uber survives LTFRB hearing, gets more time to defend accreditation) Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV shared a similar sentiment. For him, some policies should be changed to make taxi operators competitive, while some should be created to limit TNCs. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) “Maraming provision ang nagtatali ng kamay kaya ‘di sila nagiging competitive. ‘Yung focus ho ano dapat i-limit sa TNC, ano i-angat sa taxi operator para madali. Pareho lang ‘yung service, wag na tayo magbolahan. It’s the same,” Aquino said. (There are many provisions that restrict them that’s why they don’t become competitive. The focus should be on what we can limit for the TNCs, and how we can make taxi operators more competitive. They essentially offer the same service, let’s not fool each other here. It’s the same.) Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the panel, also asked the LTFRB to level up its system and ways. (READ: LTFRB orders Uber, Grab to deactivate drivers registered after June 30) “Technology and market should dictate. You should be able to regulate accordingly and not stifle the market. I know it’s difficult, market is freely evolving, but this is something you should consider,” Poe said. Level playing field Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), slammed the seemingly special treatment being requested by Uber and Grab. Suntay said there should be a level playing field for TNCs and regular taxi operators. “We have always believed that the market is big enough for all of us to coexist [but] where fare competition can exist. We follow what is required of us,” he said. Suntay decried the undue advantage of Grab and Uber, saying they are all in the same business but TNCs operate without regulation. (READ: LTFRB ‘shocked’ that Uber, Grab have over 100,000 drivers) Passengers have mostly preferred riding Uber and Grab to taxis for safety and convenience. Taxi drivers have been criticized for asking higher fares or for arbitrarily declining passengers. (READ: Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB) But Suntay argued that cab drivers only earn little because government orders taxis to use meters. On the other hand, he said Grab and Uber rely on “dynamic pricing” for fares. Suntay also claimed that the Philippines has the lowest taxi fares in Asia. “May mga taxi driver nagpapadagdag. ‘Pag nagpahatid sa traffic, malulugi ang driver. This is the reason why may mga taxi driver na tumatanggi maghatid,” he added. (There are taxi drivers who ask for higher fares because if traffic is heavy, the driver would be on the losing end. This is the reason why there are taxi drivers who refuse to take some passengers.) Uber said it is open to having its vehicles apply for franchises but not the company itself, saying the latter is not involved in the actual ferrying of passengers.

Hospital bills are estimated to cost up to P1 million.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Everything turned upside down for 23-year-old Alejandro Cajano on the night of July 15.  By habit, he took a motorcycle ride courtesy of ride-sharing app Angkas on his way home to Makati. That night, however, he figured in a tragic crash that left him in a coma for over 2 weeks now.  It happened near Nagtahan bridge, in the city of Manila, when the vehicle in front of them suddenly stopped, causing Cajano and the Angkas rider or biker to fall to the ground. Before they could recover from the impact of the fall, an SUV behind them hit Cajano.  Following the crash, Cajano sustained brain injuries and was left in a critical condition. Half a month after the incident, he has raked up a huge hospital bill estimated to reach up to P1.1 million. Convenient service Tragic incidents like this raise questions about how app-based transportation services are regulated. This was raised during the hearings by a lawmaker who lost his relative in a car crash in Singapore involving a similar transport-based app-service, Uber. (READ: Grieving lawmaker demands Grab, Uber legal accountability) In its January 2017 press release, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that Angkas is “considered as another form of TNC [Transport Network Company]”. Angkas is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a “software application provider, [that] matches users [with] third party service providers like passengers and bikers.”  Just like Grab and Uber, Angkas customers can easily book a ride through their app. Aside from being able to zoom through traffic, Angkas riders also offer cheaper fares. Angkas rides cost P50 for the first two kilometers and an additional P10 for the next kilometer.  Angkas essentially provides its customers with a convenient and cheap way to navigate through the city where mass transportation remains problematic and where traffic jams are a common occurrence. There is a need to clarify guidelines, however, when questions arise about who foots the bill when crashes happen.  In Cajano’s case, it was Angkas and the SUV driver, Louie Dy, who paid the bills at the Del los Santos Medical Center where Cajano was initially admitted. Cajano’s condition and mounting bills, however, required him to be moved to the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center, a publicly-owned hospital.  Because multiple parties are involved (the Angkas rider, Angkas itself, Cajano’s family, and the SUV driver), lawyers have stepped in to mediate the case and settle liabilities.   On July 30, two weeks after the incident, Angkas released an official statement on their Facebook page stating that they have provided financial assistance to both the rider and Cajano.   The family has been grateful to Angkas for its cooperation, especially in terms of financial support.  According to a GMA News report, however, the management of Angkas sent a statement to the Manila Traffic Enforcement Unit saying that the motorcycle rider, Zammy Banzuela, is not their employee.  Angkas described Banzuela as someone with the “access [to] the Angkas App’s booking services [which allowed] him to be matched with passengers who use the Angkas App.” Accountability issues Under LTFRB’s Memorandum Circular No. 2004-004, Public Utility Vehicles nationwide are required to have the Passenger Personal Accident Insurance Program (PPAI). In 2015, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) extended the same requirement to Transport Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab through Department Order No.  2015-011. Things are more complicated for Angkas, however, compared to the situation of other TNCs.  For one thing, existing transport regulations do not consider motorcycles and tricycles as PUVs. By extension, motorcycles are also not included in the type of vehicles operated by TNCs according to LTFRB guidelines.  Therefore, although the LTFRB considers Angkas a TNC, the agency has not accredited it and has even ordered it to stop operations in January 2017.     The issue becomes even more of a concern given that motorcycle riders are the most vulnerable groups to road traffic crashes in the Philippines according to data from the World Health Organization.   Riders may be sanctioned Because regulations are murky in this area, it is unclear what sanctions might be imposed on Angkas when crashes arise. The Land Transportation Office (LTO), which has jurisdiction over the registration of motorcycles, said that it can only impose sanctions on Angkas riders in the meantime, according to an Inquirer report. In its Facebook page, Angkas promises to ensure coverage for both the biker and passenger. This insurance policy covers up to P 200,000 according to an Angkas employee. Riders and passengers who figure in crashes can claim the insurance after 15 days of confinement with complete hospital documents.  To ensure the safety of both passengers and bikers, Angkas spokesperson Walter Wong said they make sure their bikers are professionals by conducting background checks and by making sure that motorcycles are in good condition. Angkas also said it requires biker applicants to pass through an obstacle course examination to ensure that they are well trained. Aside from this, they also conduct seminars and service training on how to handle passengers. When asked about this issue, Wong replied, “We want to provide a safe, accountable, and professional service to passengers whose needs are currently not being met. In the absence of a clear policy, habal-habal continues to proliferate but without any professionalization or safety measures in place.” He added, “So we welcome regulation of our industry to raise the standards for this type of service. When Grab and Uber started, car-hailing was also a new and unregulated industry that faced the same challenges as us. Today, it’s acknowledged that they provide a lot of value to commuters. We believe it’ll be the same for us.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/176933-you-need-to-know-fuss-grab-uber-ltfrb-regulation-explainer/","title":"What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?","date":"Jul 28, 2017 9:26 AM PHT","snippet":"What's happening between the LTFRB and ride-hailing services?

The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What’s the issue about? Here’s a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year.  What’s the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB’s earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don’t have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it’s not their fault they are considered “colorum.” They point to the LTFRB’s earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB’s preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What’s the LTFRB’s position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it’s standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a “minority” in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB’s admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August.    How did the public react? With the LTFRB’s crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government’s move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What’s next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it’s considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/176337-documenting-daily-commute/","title":"Dear politicians, we’ve documented our commute so you don’t have to","date":"Jul 23, 2017 3:07 PM PHT","snippet":"We need solutions for our transportation woes and we need them fast","body":" Much has been said about commuting in Metro Manila, especially with the ongoing Uber-Grab-LTFRB hullabaloo. From bad drivers to overcrowded trains, the list of transportation woes doesn’t seem to end. Many say it’s a problem with policy: the government simply does not manage our transportation system well enough. But how can they, when our policy makers live in a bubble, travel in their posh cars, and are oblivious about the experiences of daily commuters? There have been calls to require our politicians to take public transportation, and some even did it as publicity stints. Now we know that would be hard request to make and many of you don’t have the time to take the jeep or ride the MRT. So we’ve decided to document our commute, in 360° photos, hoping that it would give you an idea on what it’s like to commute in Metro Manila. Manila traffic We are lucky enough to be able to take the afternoon to evening shift at work. This means that we are spared from the dreaded rush hour traffic. But roads are also congested in other times of the day; it simply is much heavier from 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/64EiCF/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“64EiCF”></iframe> {/source} Traffic in Manila is unpredictable. Commuting is a game of chance. You can try to leave during non-rush hour windows, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get stuck in heavy traffic jams. Even at noon, we still experience heavy traffic going to the office. The estimated distance from our place in Manila to our office in Kapitolyo, Pasig is just 8 kilometers. During late nights to past midnight, we can go home from work in just around 20 minutes, but earlier in the day, travel time can take up to 2 1/2 hours due to traffic jams and bottlenecks. There are some days when we have to take the morning shift and travel to work during the busiest times of the day. The longest time that we’ve been on the road for work was around 3 hours on a UV Express – from 6:30 to 9:30 in the morning. That’s 3 long hours that we could have spent doing something productive. But instead, we were right there sitting inside a cramped FX, praying to any higher being to give us patience. Now imagine the working majority who have to get through this every single day, reliving this over and over again – as if metro traffic is a part of our own personal hell. Our daily commute to work We have 3 options when we take public transportation going to work. We can either 1) ride a jeepney, then a UV Express; 2) ride a tricycle, then a jeepney; or 3) ride a tricycle, take the LRT 2, take the MRT, then a jeepney. We know that some have to endure a more grueling daily commute than any of these but just to give an example, let us show you a quick comparison of our different commuting scenarios. OPTION 1: Jeepney + UV Express = P48 pesos We usually take the first option because it seems more convenient and more affordable compared to our other travel choices.  The jeepney ride from our home to Quiapo costs only P8 pesos, then the UV Express from Quiapo to Kapitolyo costs P40 pesos.  When we ride the UV Express from the terminal, we have to pay for a fixed fare – which means we have to pay for the van’s whole trip to Pasig’s center even if we’re already disembarking halfway there. But we still take it nonetheless, instead of hailing a ride mid-route, because it’s the only way we can be guaranteed a seat.   When you ride from the terminal, you will have to wait for the FX to be filled before it leaves. Take note: Most of the time, it won’t leave until every seat is filled. It doesn’t matter to the drivers if people come in different sizes. When they say the FX can take 10 people, 10 people have to find a way to fit inside, no matter how uncomfortable and cramped it is already. Heck, there have also been reports of drivers being rude against plus-size passengers for taking up more space. At the terminal, we almost always have to wait up to 40 minutes before we can leave. That’s when we either have to wait for the FX to be filled or endure long lines waiting for a vehicle during rush hour. But then, taking this route is still the more convenient option because after leaving the terminal, the FX can already go straight to our destination without having to take in passengers midway (this is also why hailing FXs outside terminals is hard). OPTION 2: Tricycle + Jeepney = P68 pesos On some days, when there are less UV Express vehicles available, we take the second option. A tricycle ride from home costs P50 pesos because for reasons we don’t know, they do not have a fare matrix and every ride is considered a special ride with a special fare. It’s even more expensive than our jeepney ride from Mendiola to Kapitolyo which is just Php18.  The jeepney’s cheaper fare is a tempting bargain but we still prefer taking the UV Express when possible because of the comfort. Both rides can be crowded and cramped, but at least you get closed windows and air conditioning in the latter (Metro Manila smog isn’t exactly something you’d want to breathe in).  Personal space? There’s no such thing when you commute, squeezed inside public utility vehicles (PUVs) like sardines in tin cans. (READ: ‘The 15 passengers you’ll meet on a Philippine jeepney‘ ) {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/QrJg5x/” frameborder=“0” width=’100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“QrJg5x”></iframe> {/source} When FX drivers say 10 people can fit inside, 10 people will fit inside. But when jeepney drivers say the jeepney can take 14, 16 will ride, with 2 of those (sometimes even 4) standing at the PUJ’s stirrup. OPTION 3: Tricycle + LRT 2 + MRT + Jeepney = P94 pesos Our third option when going to work involves more ride transfers as compared with the other two. We seldomly use this option mainly because we dread MRT rides especially during rush hour.  Gone were the days when train rides mean convenience, efficiency, and better alternative to other existing modes of public transportation. Every day, commuters complain about overcrowded trains and stations.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/Gzvnz3/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“Gzvnz3”></iframe> {/source} The trains are faster, yes, but the long lines during rush hour will delay your travel also. Every now and then, you’d also see commuters venting their anger against other commuters. When you’re tired from work and forced to squeeze yourself in an overcrowded train, it’s easy to lose your temper. (READ: ‘The MRT Survival Guide‘ ) There are also the occasional delays brought about by the train breaking down. Whenever the trains malfunction, you can already be assured that there’d be traffic everywhere, with commuters having to take alternative modes of transportation. Safety Safety is an issue when commuting too. Commuters like us already know better than to bring out our phones and gadgets inside PUVs or put valuables and wallets inside our pockets. Many Manila commuters have experienced crimes, like ‘holdups’ and pickpocketing. In fact, we were careful ourselves about bringing out our camera to take photos for this story. Bad driving is also a safety problem. Many PUV drivers overspeed and swerve all over the road like daredevils, never mind that it’s making their passengers scared and uncomfortable.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/TAoZn2/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“TAoZn2”></iframe> {/source} Comparing costs All 3 commuting scenarios are still significantly cheaper than taking a cab or any of the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services available. Taking the public transportation going to work will cost us less than P100 pesos, a faily reasonable price since we are living in one city and working in another. Without any surge in pricing (which is rare), a GrabCar ride to work costs around P200 pesos. For Uber, it can go as high as P250 pesos. Taking the more affordable alternative, a GrabShare or UberPool ride can cost us around P140 to P150 pesos. During peak hours, travel costs can skyrocket to around P350 to P500 pesos.  Seeing these huge differences in prices, one would think that taking the public transportation is automatically the better option. But then aside from safety and convenience, time is definitely of huge value. People who are conscious about the value of their time may veer toward spending more on Uber or Grab rides if it means shorter travel time. But then again, convenient as they are, ride-hailing services are not really an option for many commuters who can only hope and wait for the government to solve their transportation woes. It’s already 2017 and the Philippines need a better transportation system, and we need it fast. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176157-daily-news-highlights-july-20-2017-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, July 20, 2017","date":"Jul 20, 2017 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

What I support is a more comprehensive campaign calling for better public transportation that benefits everyone – commuters and drivers alike.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has halted the apprehension of undocumented drivers until Wednesday, July 26, 2017. Responding to this, Grab and Uber drivers united and launched an online campaign calling on the LTFRB to grant permits to additional Uber and Grab drivers.  I, however, think that saving Grab and Uber alone will not really solve our traffic woes in Metro Manila.  Let me start by sharing my experience with a taxi driver – whose name unfortunately escaped my memory – almost two years ago. Unfair boundary system  He told me that taxi drivers like him work 24 hours a day just so they could reach their boundary and earn enough to support his family for two days.  “Paano ‘nyo nakakaya (How do you do it)?” I asked.  “’Ayun Ma’am, lumalaklak ako ng Cobra at kape. Minsan sinasamahan ko pa ng Red bull. Ganoon talaga eh,” he answered with a smile. (Ma’am, I drink Cobra and coffee. Sometimes, I would also take strong energy drinks like Red Bull. That’s just how it is.) He said he would spend the following day in bed, gathering his strength for the next cycle on the road. The next day, he would start work at 5 am, weathering the traffic, unforgivable flooding and rain, and fatigue, and clock out exactly 24 hours later. He said this as a matter fact, without the slightest hint of complaint or regret. That is how he is able to put food on the table. How could he complain about it? Since then, I’ve made it my mission to ask every taxi driver I get to meet if this is how they lived. Majority of the taxi drivers – from the youngest to the 72-year-old driver I met – affirmed this.  The only ones who control their time and sleeping habit are those who are rich enough to own a cab. And that’s just a speck of the total taxi driver population in the Philippines.  The plight of bus drivers and conductors who would cram their vehicles with standing passengers during rush hour is no different. They are also limited by the boundary system that defines our public transportation system. This is the reality of many taxi and bus drivers in the country: the public transportation system is plainly inhumane to them.  False dichotomy How does this relate to the “We want Uber and Grab” campaign?  The current narrative surrounding the campaign creates a false dichotomy between the ride-sharing apps and traditional public utility vehicles. It is as if to favor one thing, you should be against the other.  But that misses the whole point.  It is true that Grab and Uber have served as an answered prayer for many commuters in Metro Manila,  However, Grab and Uber alone cannot solve traffic. In fact, they only add more franchises and cars on the road, benefitting only a certain portion of the commuter population that could afford its pricing rate on a daily basis. And how they leave more carbon footprint is a totally different matter.  What the country needs is better public transportation which essentially means fewer and more efficient modes of transportation – emphasis on train systems and buses – that have the capacity to transport more commuters.  Because of the false dichotomy, we forget that there are good and bad drivers regardless if they drive a cab or a Grab or Uber car. We’ve read it on social media, in news reports.  There are kind and honorable taxi drivers like Gener Jarito and Jhun Ochavo as there are rude drivers with the Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS).   Because of the false dichotomy, we also miss the fact the LTFRB is not only being inconsistent with its regulation of franchises. It has also failed to fix the boundary system in taxis and buses, and has fallen short in delivering its mandate to provide a decent means of livelihood for regular public utility vehicle drivers.  What is clear and sure is that it is wrong for the government to cut the lifeline of a temporary and functional solution such as Grab and Uber without providing a long-term solution to traffic for the public.  Proposal What should the government do then?  We are on the cusp of technological disruptions. Airbnb has redefined accommodation. Social media has empowered citizen journalism. Amazon has taken the retail industry on a whole new level. As early as now, we should be asking ourselves: In this age of technological disruptions, how do we make sure everybody gains from them? Right now, with the discussion on public transportation in the Philippines, the onus largely weighs on the government to make sure this gets addressed.  This is why I agree with Grab when it said that “we must level it up by improving the quality of service of other modes of public transport, and bring them at par with TNVS not by back-pedaling on the standards in place we have today.” In fact, the government might just be able to hit two birds with one stone. By learning how to adapt these advancements to benefit our taxi drivers, the government might be able to finally solve the problem surrounding the outdated taxi and bus boundary system that benefits no one but the franchise holders. While doing so, the government should definitely expedite its plan on improving, building, and expanding our train and bus systems. Let us step back and go beyond Uber and Grab. Let us pressure the government to provide an efficient public transportation that we deserve.  Because, honestly, with an efficient train system and better public transportation in general, discussions like these would be irrelevant and everyone would be happy. – Rappler.com   Raisa Serafica is a community manager and social media producer for MovePH, Rappler’s civic-engagement arm "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/175753-thinkph-2017-digital-data/","title":"#ThinkPH 2017: Humanizing stories through digital and big data","date":"Jul 16, 2017 3:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Speakers from Uber, We Are Social, Nestle, and Dentsu Aegis Network showed us how in the age of digital and big data, being human remains the best strategy","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Big data.

Uber’s service base continues to evolve because they want to look beyond profits and metrics, said Cua. With carpooling, fares become more affordable, and the number of cars on the road is reduced, cutting down carbon dioxide emissions. “Uber’s mission all over the world is to move cities. But we realized that in order to move cities, we need to move individual lives,” said Cua. “Uber is more than just a platform that connects riders and drivers. Uber has become a tech that changes lives.”  With this in mind, Uber has become more than an app. And with people looking for smarter solutions to reach their destinations, for Cua and Uber Philippines, there is no turning back. Don’t panic, participate “Connected tech is now an integral part of everyday life for most people in the world. But our increasing reliance on connected tech is starting to change the way our brains work,” said Kemp. This, however, shouldn’t be a cause for panic but instead an opportunity to participate. With more than half the world already online, one million users connected everyday, and in the Philippines alone, 50,000 new users per day, being a tech-savvy brand or business is the way to go.  Consumers are changing the way they remember things, such as Googling something instead of racking their brains to think. So they also need to rethink user experience, Kemp said. In the advent of voice control devices like Siri and Alexa, and what’s now known as “decisionless shopping,” even the pronunciation of a brand name is crucial to its success.   By changing the way we tell stories, and by constantly evolving with consumers and the way they experience things, we don’t have to be afraid of being left behind. Marketing to the connected consumer When Greenpeace launched a campaign against KitKat in 2010, Nestle was caught off guard. The brand’s social media pages were attacked. And their social media managers, not really sure what to do, fought back, making the situation much, much worse. This scandal that started on social media and was then taken by the activists to the streets, in front of one of Nestle’s global offices, prompted the brand to launch a Digital Acceleration Program. Nestle brought some of its people to Switzerland to undergo an 8-month training in digital.  “We realized we don’t know how to manage social media,” said Mercado.  They learned about digital but they also learned more about the people who care about their products by mapping out the consumer journey and personalizing the engagement. Now, Nestle brands are all over social media, topping the Youtube ads leaderboards, and the minds of its consumers.        Tell stories the human way In advertising, many brands and agencies get excited by digital and tech that sometimes they forget they’re supposed to tell stories. “If you want to do digital, you have to look at the entire media landscape,” said Lim.  This means considering the value of TV, radio, outdoor, and print – the whole ecosystem –whenever you’re creating a campaign “for digital.” According to Lim, people who buy in sari-sari stores learn about brands through noon time TV shows like Eat Bulaga. And these are the real people your brand should be talking to. Lim also reminds us that websites and apps are just platforms and that we should look beyond them. We should focus on capturing the human experience so brands become more relatable and approachable.   “Digital only rarely succeeds. Make digital a part of the human system,” he concluded. The day-long digital summit featured speakers who tackled the connection between humanity, culture, and technology, and how we can harness innovation and creativity for progress.

The ride sharing app gave passengers an alternative solution against traffic. But beyond convenience, it also offered life-changing opportunities. The stories below are some examples.  On his own terms Edgardo Rovillos is a single father. Day and night, he drives along the roads of Manila as an Uber partner. “Nag-start ako noong December, kasi yung yung time na yon critical na sakin. Di ko na alam saan hahanap ng pang-gastos, kasi graduating na anak ko. Pagmamaneho lang talaga kasi yung alam ko. Yun lang siguro ang talent ko na hindi mawawala sa akin.” (I became an Uber partner last December, as it was a critical time in my life. I didn’t know how I could earn enough for expenses because my son was also graduating. Driving was the only thing I know how to do well. It’s the only talent I have that nobody can take away from me.) Despite having to work odd hours, Uber also gave Edgardo the power to manage his own time. He built his driving routine around his son. He says that his son is his inspiration and motivation to drive until the wee hours of the morning.  Edgardo is happy that he has more time to bond with his son while earning enough money to put him through school. No time wasted Rayzy Nufable is a busy mother of two. Uber, she says, has helped her juggle all of her responsibilities. Her time with her kids is the most important part of her day, but she struggles with getting home early because of traffic. “Magmula noong nagkaroon ng Uber, sobrang nakatulong sakin. I’m sure na makaka-uwi kaagad ako sa mga anak ko, which is very important to me.” (Uber has been a great help to me ever since. I’m certain that I can always get home to my kids on time.) She recalls a particular incident when her 10-year-old, Niccolo, got into an accident at school while she was at work. Thanks to the reliability – and compassion – of her Uber driver, she reached her son at the fastest possible time.

Here's how you can save while seeing the world!","body":" Backpacking or low-budget traveling is becoming popular among millennials. With the rise of low-cost airlines and the emergence of inexpensive and sometimes practically free accommodations, traveling has never been more accessible. A budget, however, should always be set. So aside from waiting for seat sales to happen, I have listed down 12 simple money-saving tips for stretching your travel budget and enjoying your trip at the same time. As I always say, traveling doesn’t necessarily have to burn a hole in your pocket for it to be enjoyable. 1. Bring an empty water bottle (preferably 500 ml in size). Buying bottled water can be costly when you travel outside the country and even while you are inside a plane. What I do is I bring an empty bottle with me and after I pass through immigration, I look for water refilling stations, which are usually located near restrooms. You can also refill water in some restaurants or hostels where you plan to stay. It is also cheaper if you will buy two-liter bottled water, instead of buying 4 500 ml bottles. What I usually do is I transfer the water from the two-liter to the 500 ml bottle. It will help you minimize your spending and the same time, when you stroll around the city, your bag wouldn’t be as heavy carrying a 500 ml bottle. 2. Share a cab. Two to three hours before I check out of my hostel, I tell the receptionist to get me a cab at checkout time. I also ask them if there are other travelers going to the same destination (airport or bus terminal) and whether they want to share a cab with me. In my experience, most travelers won’t mind sharing a taxi ride with other travelers as this will split the cost of the cab fare and at the same time, you’ll have an instant travel companion. 3. Try Couchsurfing. This is one of the best ways to save money while traveling, as accommodations will probably get the biggest chunk of your budget. When you try Couchsurfing (CS), however, avoid having the mindset that you are just there for the free stay. Instead, treat it as a way to experience your host’s way of life, an opportunity to learn their culture, and a chance to get to know their stories. {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=”7″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:37.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BM29cd6huOT/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Thank you Ali for letting me stay for free in your hotel.

It was my first time to try CS and it was an amazing experience. My CS hosts welcomed me into their homes as if I am an old friend of theirs and even helped with my travel plans. They were sincerely interested in learning about the Philippines and our culture. I gained friends along the way, learned their cultures, and at the same time, I was able to save money. 4. Stay at shared accommodations (backpacker inns, capsule pods, Airbnb). If you’re not yet ready to try Couchsurfing, stay at hostels, backpacker inns, or Airbnb. You will not just save money on accommodations (compared to when you stay at hotels), but you will also meet travelers from other countries. When you stay at shared accommodations, you will somehow be forced to chat with other travelers. It will be a great way to learn a thing or two about their travels and you’ll probably gain a friend in the process. If you’re feeling adventurous and want to try something a little unconventional, staying at capsule pods is inexpensive, too. 5. Don’t buy food in areas popular with tourists. Whenever I visit a tourist spot, I make sure to bring food with me. If I forget to bring food, I walk at least a few blocks away to look for a local place to eat. The food will definitely be much cheaper compared to the restaurants located just around the popular tourist destination. {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=”7″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/5XDB5Hu6Sj/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Sydney Harbour Bridge  #travel #backpacktraveler #wanderer #wanderlust #instatravel #instapassport #igaustralia #igaus #sydney #sydneyharbour #fortheeconomy #goprosydney #gopro #goproaustralia #hashtagwhore</a></p> <p style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;”>A post shared by Bla Aguinaldo (@bla_sphemy_) on <time style=” font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;” datetime=”2015-07-20T13:45:29+00:00″>Jul 20, 2015 at 6:45am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=”//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js”></script>{/source}   When I visited Sydney a few years back, I sat on a bench facing the impressive Sydney Harbour Bridge outside the Opera House and decided to eat my leftover shawarma that I had for lunch.

When I visited Iran, I met two Turkish guys in a shared accommodation, and when they learned that my next destination was Istanbul, they taught me how to travel like a local in Istanbul. {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=”7″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:37.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BNCUclRhnSb/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Crossing the european side of Turkey through ferry  #travel #turkey #istanbul #sultanahmet #eminönü #kadikoy #wanderer #wanderlust #instatravel #igtravel #solobackpacker #backpacker #pinoybackpacker #hashtagwhore</a></p> <p style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;”>A post shared by Bla Aguinaldo (@bla_sphemy_) on <time style=” font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;” datetime=”2016-11-20T15:01:31+00:00″>Nov 20, 2016 at 7:01am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=”//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js”></script>{/source}   I took a bus, ferry, and tram from the airport to my hostel and it cost me less than P200. If I took a cab that time, it would have cost me around P2,000. 7. Buy food at a grocery store. Instead of eating every day at restaurants, buy food at supermarkets, convenience stores, or grocery stores. You can buy bread, fruits, and sometimes even hot meals, saving you a few bucks. If you have a tight budget, you can prepare your own food with food you bought from the grocery store, or have breakfast and lunch at low-priced eateries. For dinner, you can eat at a fancier restaurant. Just remember that you don’t need to eat every meal at a restaurant. 8. Walk. During my travels, I try to walk as much as possible since this helps me get a real feel of the place. I get to interact with the locals and see their way of life. Walking also means saving on transportation costs and getting my daily dose of exercise. 9. Familiarize yourself with the places you plan to visit. Before leaving your country of origin, make sure to familiarize yourself with the places you will visit. Check any landmarks near your destination. Save on Google Maps the locations in your itinerary. Google Maps has a feature that lets you access maps even if you don’t have an internet connection. Offline maps are particularly helpful when you are on a walking tour, so you won’t get lost and spend unnecessarily on a cab ride. 10. Take a sleeper bus or train. This will save you money not only on accommodations, but also save you time. Just make sure that the bus or train you are taking has a good reputation when it comes to safety and cleanliness. I was reluctant to try a sleeper bus in Vietnam at first as I thought I wouldn’t be comfy in it. Surprisingly, I had a fairly comfortable ride. 11. Haggle. This one is definitely the easiest to follow for us Filipinos, as we are experts at bargaining. While traveling in Iran, the two Turkish guys I met were amazed at my bargaining skills and wanted to learn how I do it. I told them to immediately ask for half the price then start haggling from there. It works for me so it might work for them. 12. Take it easy on the souvenirs. This is probably one of the most difficult to follow on this list, as we Filipinos are generous. Whenever we travel, we tend to buy pasalubong or gifts for everyone – our family, our friends, our coworkers, our neighbors. When traveling on a tight budget, however, learn to limit your expenses. {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=”7″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BM0ue5ehGlb/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>From Iran, with love  #postcards #iran #persia #yazd #shiraz #tehran #esfahan #travel #traveler #backpacker #solobackbackpacker #pinoybackpacker wanderer #wanderlust #igtravel #hashtagwhore</a></p> <p style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;”>A post shared by Bla Aguinaldo (@bla_sphemy_) on <time style=” font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;” datetime=”2016-11-15T08:19:39+00:00″>Nov 15, 2016 at 12:19am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=”//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js”></script>{/source}   Instead of buying t-shirts for your friends, send them postcards.

Here's a list of the big issues the company has faced since 2013.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned on Tuesday, June 20, 2017 (US time), amid pressure from its investors – a culmination of a wild string of incidents that brought to light Uber issues relating to company culture, sexism, corporate espionage, stolen technologies, shady internal tools, and its treatment of drivers, among others. We round all of these up in our timeline below of Uber’s troubles leading up to resignation of its head honcho. Included are several incidents involving the Philippines: August 16, 2013 – A group of Uber drivers in the US file a class-action lawsuit, claiming that their status as independent contractors instead of official employees is a misclassification – a status that leaves them bereft of full-time employee benefits. The case is ongoing as of June 2017.  December 2013 – An Uber driver hits a family on the road, killing a young girl and seriously injuring her mother and brother. Uber is sued by the family, but the company fights back on the basis that the driver wasn’t officially booked at the time of the incident, meaning he technically wasn’t an Uber driver during that period.   January 2014 – Techcrunch and Valleywag confirm that some Uber employees intentionally booked thousands of rides from competing ride-sharing services – only to cancel them and mess with their operations.  August 2014 – The Verge exposes an Uber secret project called Operation SLOG designed to spy on, and lure drivers away from competitor Lyft.  October 2014 – Uber’s espionage on riders is exposed by Forbes, which discovered their “God View” and “Creepy Stalker View,” which tracked the trip of users. November 2014 – Former Uber senior vice president, Emil Michael, suggests that the company hire researchers and journalists to dig up dirt from the lives of its critics. He says it at a private dinner, suggesting a budget of 1 million dollars. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith uncovered the incident, and Michael is forced to apologize. February 2016 – An Uber driver is accused of killing 6 in a shooting spree in the US. Uber’s background check process is questioned, compounded by a 2014 rape incident in India involving an Uber driver. The driver has been sentenced to life in prison. In the Philippines, a woman was allegedly raped by an Uber driver on July 27; Uber Philippines removed the driver from their platform, identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, after the incident.

Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Center (EMSC) last year identified 1,150 suspicious social media accounts – a staggering rise from the 148 accounts it was watching in 2015. The trend, which is also is reflected in other parts of the world, has elevated social media’s role in the smuggling trade to a top priority for European police in 2017. “There is a huge spectrum of services that are being advertised on social media, from accommodation to transportation, to false IDs, visas, sham marriages, you name it,” Europol expert Lara Alegria recently told reporters in Sicily, Italy. Some social media accounts are even offering what another Europol official called “complete immigration packages, including entry into a country, residency and even work permits, as well as marriages and education for the children.” The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has also documented this trend, and reports that an increasing number of migrants arriving in Italy and Greece have been “recruited” through social media, and especially Facebook. In some ways, social media is an obvious choice for smugglers due to its global reach and the level of anonymity it provides. And it’s typically free. Social media accounts are created but vanish again within days, after they’ve done their job, the director of the IOM’s regional office for the EU, Norway and Switzerland, Eugenio Ambrosi, tells the Spanish news agency EFE. The EMSC says Facebook appears to be the platform of choice for smugglers, but some movement towards other providers, such as Telegram, has also emerged. Smugglers are also hiding their activities by using platforms including peer-to-peer accommodation networks, and ride-sharing services. Most traffickers who advertise online are based in Turkey. But Europol has also found evidence of such activity via accounts based in Europe, offering “high quality false European documentation” and smuggling by land into the European Union, sometimes as a “transit point” to North America. The primary services offered online are transport – which can include journeys on cruise ships, planes, and even cargo ships – as well as false identity and travel documents. “The variety of services has greatly expanded and nowadays includes offers that suggest criminal groups are also attempting to corrupt embassy and consular officials from European embassies” typically located outside the EU, the EMSC says. A Europol official has told EFE that some EU member states have launched investigations into whether smugglers have been paying consular staff working abroad to issue entry visas. The European Police Office declined to comment on the official’s claims, citing “ongoing investigations.” The IOM’s Ambrosi says law enforcement agencies face a vast challenge in cracking down on smugglers who use social media to ply their trade. Because networks, and the smugglers themselves, span different regions, and sometimes continents, simultaneous action is required, Ambrosi says. Police have already had some successes on the back of cross-border cooperation. In July last year, the EMSC produced 16 intelligence briefings for member states based on its monitoring of suspicious social media accounts. In one success story stemming from those briefings, a ring of Turkish people smugglers was busted, and 12 migrants were arrested, aboard a cargo ship bound for Slovenia. Facebook has told EFE that any content relating to people smuggling and human trafficking is against its community standards, and is removed when it is reported. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/172253-gyrodrive-hybrid-license-nirvana-systems/","title":"‘GyroDrive’ is first vehicle licensed to operate both on roads and in air","date":"Jun 7, 2017 5:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Called the 'GyroDrive,' the Czech invention beats flying cars to a hybrid license","body":" BOCHOR, Czech Republic – As global automakers compete to bring the first flying car to market, Czech pilot Pavel Brezina is trying a different tack: instead of creating a car that flies, he has made a “GyroDrive” – a mini helicopter you can drive. The engineer and owner of Nirvana Systems, a company producing motors for small flying machines, insists his vehicle is the first in the world authorized to operate both on roads and in the air. “This is the only road-certified flying vehicle I know about,” Brezina told AFP in a hangar at the Prerov-Bochor airport in the eastern Czech Republic. “Everyone is trying to make a high-speed car that can fly, but this is a different thing,” said the tall, bespectacled 51-year-old, who has 30 years of experience as a pilot under his belt. His GyroDrive vehicle is based on a gyroplane – a mini-helicopter – that uses a copter-style rotor to move up and down, and an airplane-type “pusher propeller” to go forward. Brezina’s company buys gyroplane kits from a German firm, and then assembles and equips them with a system allowing the pilot-driver to switch between a petrol engine propelling the rotors and an electric engine that drives the wheels. The two-seat GyroDrive has a maximum driving speed of just 40 kph (25 mph) and can take its crew of two on short drives to a petrol station or a hotel. It needs less than 100 meters (110 yards) to take off and reaches a top speed of 180 kph in the air. Its flying range is 600 kilometers. After landing, the pilot only has to fix the main rotor blades along the axis of the GyroDrive and pull out a built-in license plate to transform it into a road vehicle. Prices start at 1.5 million koruna ($63,500, 57,000 euros), but they can reach four million koruna, depending on specifications. “Robust testing” While Brezina is already planning to take his wife – also a pilot – and two children to London aboard GyroDrives, inventors worldwide are frantically working on prototypes of cars that fly. In neighbouring Slovakia, the AeroMobil company says it has received dozens of orders from customers for a flying car expected to hit the market in 2020. “We want to build a vehicle that will not only be able to fly and drive but also fulfill each technical and legal requirement,” says AeroMobil CEO Juraj Vaculik, touting “a robust testing program.” He told AFP that AeroMobil initially plans to produce 500 units of its winged car, which uses a turbo propeller to get off the ground. The AeroMobil is expected to reach a top ground speed of 160 kph and up to 360 kph in the air, with a flying and driving range of some 700 kilometers. In mid-May, Japan’s Toyota also unveiled plans to launch a three-wheel flying car dubbed SkyDrive using retractable wings and drone technology. The vehicle is expected to have a top flight speed of around 100 kph, hovering around 10 meters off the ground. It will have a top land speed around 150 kph. Silicon Valley flying car startup, Kitty Hawk, reportedly backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, released a video in April of its airborne prototype and announced plans for deliveries of a “personal flying machine” this year. Other firms, including ride-sharing service Uber, also have soaring ambitions for their flying car prototypes. Not for everyone Brezina got the license plates for his GyroDrive in March, 3 years after starting the project. For his first trip, he flew some 230 kilometers west to an airport on the outskirts of Prague, then drove downtown to have a cup of coffee in the Czech capital’s central Wenceslas Square – and got stopped by the police on the way. “Well, if you saw this driving through Prague, wouldn’t you stop it? I would,” chuckles Brezina, adding the police merely checked his papers and did a breathalyzer test. Brezina told AFP he has already been safely flying gyroplanes all over Europe and beyond for the last 7 years with a group of friends. “I would liken it to a group of motorbikers, this is actually a 3D motorbike. We also travel to other continents where we rent gyroplanes,” he said. Looking into the future, Brezina said he doubts GyroDrive will take over roads and airways. “First, it requires a set of certain qualities to become a gyroplane pilot, and second, it’s not just about pushing a button. I think it will spread, but not on a mass scale.” Co-financed by the Slovak government, AeroMobil will not be everyone’s flying car either because of its eyewatering price tag of 1.2-1.5 million euros ($1.35-1.7 million) per unit. It will rather serve as “some kind of a flying Uber service,” Vaculik said. “Our concept is that not many people would own this flying car but many will be able to use it,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/172247-uber-firiings-cut-throat-workplace-probe/","title":"Uber probe of cut-throat workplace triggers firings","date":"Jun 7, 2017 3:15 PM PHT","snippet":"The terminations came as the ride-sharing firm looked into 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and 'physical security.'","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, US – The on-demand ride service said the terminations came as it looked into a total of 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and “physical security.” The majority of the complaints were from workers in San Francisco, where Uber is based. Uber has seen a shake-out in its executive ranks as it works through a series of scandals that included disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics, and covert use of law enforcement-evading software. It was likely that some departures of Uber executives were related to investigated complaints, but the company offered no details. “All reported incidents to date have been investigated, and where they were corroborated we have taken swift, decisive action on the findings,” Uber said in an email statement. “We have been doing this consistently and with rigor for the past few months and will continue to do so as issues are raised.” Uber is strengthening its human resources staff and processes, and recommendations for changes based on the internal investigation were to be released next week. Uber chief Travis Kalanick has been working to steer the scandal-tainted on-demand ride service on a friendlier course with workers, riders and drivers. “Going forward, there can be no room at Uber for brilliant jerks and zero tolerance for anything but totally respectable behavior in an equitable workplace environment,” board member Arianna Huffington said earlier this year while discussing efforts at the company. The privately-held firm is valued at about $68 billion, making it the largest ventured-backed “unicorn” in the tech world, having expanded to dozens of countries even as it battles regulators and established taxi operators. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/168116-philippine-club-football-learn-indonesia/","title":"What Philippine club football can learn from Indonesia","date":"Apr 27, 2017 3:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Indonesia is both north star and cautionary tale for the Philippines Football League","body":" It’s an overcast Saturday afternoon as we wind through the narrow secondary roads of Jakarta’s suburbs in an Uber towards the town of Bogor, West Java. I’m with Welly Tarigan, a cousin of my sister’s Indonesian husband, and a diehard Inter Milan supporter as well who has always admired one of the giants of Indonesian club football: Persib Bandung. The car turns off Jalan Tegar Beriman into the access road that leads to Stadion Pakansari, where Persib is set to face off against PS TNI in the Indonesian top tier. Even at the corner, we spot stalls selling merchandise for Persib Bandung. They line the road all the way to the stadium. The shacks hawk knock-off jerseys, scarves, flags, viking hats and other trinkets. We arrive at 4 pm and already throngs of Persib fans can be found, decked out in Persib’s royal blue. Then I discover that the game is kicking off at 6:30 pm, and that the 4:30 pm time I saw on the internet is just when the gates open. We buy the cheapest “tribun” tickets for Rp70,000, or about P262, then after a pre-game snack of nasi goreng with chicken nuggets, and the purchase of a Persib scarf, we make our way into the stadium an hour before kickoff.  The logistics of entering the stadium are chaotic. Welly tells me that security wants to stop fans who don’t have tickets from entering, so they crack open the gates in intervals, letting in spectators in batches. We need to show our tickets in the air and after some jostling and shoving, we are in. We pass a drunken Persib supporter on the ground, surrounded by security personnel, and take our seats. Pakansari seats 30,000, and about half were filled with Persib Bandung fans, 90% of which are wearing some kind of Persib jersey or fan shirt. TNI is the team of the Indonesian army, and small cadre of supporters, all uniformed servicemen, occupy one corner of the stadium, which played host to the Suzuki Cup semis and finals last December. Yes, only half of the stadium was filled, but Persib is the away team in this fixture against a new TNI squad still out to gather fans. Bandung is 135 kilometers away.  The cheering for Persib’s rabid fans, known as the Bobotoh, is well-orchestrated and loud. They also have adopted the Viking clap of the Iceland national team, which they execute before kickoff.  At 6:30 pm the whistle blows and the game is underway.  * * * “Indonesian football is very strange,” says Indonesian football agent Zo Genardo over a steaming plate of “iga,” or beef ribs at an Indonesian restaurant in a Jakarta suburb.  “Every single part of Indonesian football has politics,” he continues. “Even grassroots. It’s scary.”  Genardo says that 70-80% of Indonesian politicians use the game to help get elected. He also claims the governing body of Indonesian football, the Persatuan Sepakbola Seluruh Indonesia, or PSSI, functions more like a political party than a sports authority.  Disunity and infighting have been hallmarks of Indonesian football. Things reached a nadir on May 30, 2015 when FIFA suspended the country from all forms of international football. Two rival leagues, questions about the eligibility of two clubs to play in them, and government interference in the matter, (a FIFA no-no), led to the sanction. Because of it, Indonesia’s national team was unable to participate in World Cup qualifying and its clubs barred from joining the AFC Cup. The ban was lifted a year later.  PSSI has also been involved in other dubious matters, like when unfashionable Persipura Jayapura from West Papua was unable to join the AFC Cup despite being the league champs. The reason? The PSSI forgot to accomplish the paperwork, according to Genardo. There is another worrying trait of Indonesian club football that may seem all too familiar.  “Indonesians only want shortcuts to success. That is the mentality,” adds Genardo.  Typically Indonesian clubs have only operated U19 teams under their senior sides, but none in younger age groups, according to Genardo. It is only now that clubs are developing youth academies. Clubs presumably recruit talented players from the countryside instead of molding them themselves.  Because of this system, a hole exists in the development of players from ages 16 to 20. At that age Indonesian players lack match experience and good coaching, thus preventing them from reaching their full potential. That might explain why a football-addled nation of 250 million people has never come close to qualifying for the final stage of a FIFA World Cup. (They did play in one round of the 1938 World Cup as the Dutch East Indies, falling to Hungary 6-0.) Genardo estimates there are only 60 to 70 “A” license coaches in Indonesia, only 3-4 times more than the number of “A” license mentors in the Philippines. That seems disproportionate considering the difference in football fervor between the two countries.  To its credit Indonesian football seems to have reorganized well since the ban was lifted. There is now a unified three-tier league pyramid under the auspices of the federation. Matches are well-attended and draw big TV ratings.  But the country still punches below its weight, according to Rappler Indonesia football contributing writer Agung Iskandar.  “Indonesia is a football country. But in terms of management, it seems much more disaster than achievement (sic).”  * * *  After 45 minutes, TNI and Persib are where they began, at 0-0. The military side shows quality on the wings but cannot convert. Bandung has hit the woodwork but the back of the net eludes them.  The air in the stadium is redolent of Indonesian clove cigarettes, as a greyish fog settles below the roof. Yes, they allow smoking in Indonesian club football, and many fans, including teenagers, can be seen puffing away on Gudang Garams while taking in the game. De La Salle coach Hans Smit, infamous for lighting up during matches and born in Depok, about 40 minutes away, would feel very much at home. The second half brings a surge of hope within the Bobotoh faithful. Coming into the game as a second half sub is none other than Chelsea legend Michael Essien.  The attacking midfielder is in Indonesia after departing the Blues in 2014 and suiting up for AC Milan and Panathinaikos. At 34 years old, he is no longer the dynamo he used to be, but he impresses in Persib blue just as he did in the same color for Chelsea. Essien’s vision and passing touch result in some threatening sorties, and eventually, a breakthrough. The Ghanaian rises above the TNI defense to nod home an opener. The roof of the stadium just about manages to stay put as the Bandung faithful go bonkers. It’s his first Persib goal. {source}<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUqetTIt-0s” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}  Moments later, Persib go 2-0 with a lovely volley from captain Atep Rizal. The Bobotoh go berserk once again. The match seems to be in control with around 20 minutes to go.  * * *  As the Philippines embarks on it’s own fully professional, national competition, the Philippines Football League, what lessons can be learned from the Indonesian experience? Quite a few.  Youth. There were hordes of youngsters at the Persib-TNI match. My companion Welly even noticed 3 kids who couldn’t have been more than ten years old, watching the game in full Persib regalia. They appeared to be unaccompanied by any adult or older kids. There were also young children with their parents and lots of teens. Lifelong fandom begins at an early age. Both teams and the PFL need to recognize this and market to children. Family ticket packages and free or discounted admission for young children will also help. Marketing campaigns should also be directly targeted to kids.   Unlike Indonesian clubs in the past, Filipino clubs also need to invest in youth football. Fortunately it’s mandatory that PFL clubs have youth programs.  Sustainability. Financially, Indonesian clubs have traditionally suckled at the teat of provincial governments’ udders. But that practice is being stopped by the government, and now clubs must get funding from the private sector. With 18 clubs in the top tier and 60 more in the second, Indonesian clubs appear to be managing the transition reasonably well.  It has been a brave move by the powers-that-be to ask teams to go it alone. But in the long run it could compel teams to be more professional, accountable, and better-managed.  The Philippines Football League and its clubs should also work towards sustainability as its goal. They must spend prudently and try to maximize revenue streams. The league must reach out to sponsors and be creative. Case in point: the Indonesian top-tier has not one, but two title sponsors. It’s called the Gojek Traveloka Liga 1. Gojek is a motorcycle ride-sharing service and Traveloka a flight-booking website.  Politics. In an ideal world, those involved in football administration are in it for the love of the game. Political appointees should be minimized. And those in leadership must see the biggest picture and the longest view in order to help the game forward. A feel for marketing and promotion is also crucial.  The sort of balkanization that led to Indonesia’s FIFA suspension should never happen in Philippine football.  Regionalism. Persib represents the Sundanese ethnolinguistic group that is centered in the West Javan capital of Bandung. However there are plenty of Sundanese scattered all over Java who still cheer for the “Maung Bandung,” or Bandung tiger. Banners of the different Persib supporters groups from all over Java can be seen draped on the railings at the stadium in the game against TNI.  Persib’s bitterest rival is Persija Jakarta, the club of another ethnolinguistic group, the Betawi. The enmity between the two supporters is long-standing and at times lethal. Their derby matches are heated and played in front of huge crowds. Welly tells me of a time when Persija’s diehard fans, collectively known as the Jakmania, attacked a convoy of buses containing traveling Persib supporters. That in itself isn’t even remarkable. What is unusual is that the Persib wasn’t even playing Persija, but were on their way to Palembang to play Sriwijaya in a Cup final. Such is the passion. Misplaced passion, perhaps, but passion nonetheless. These teams represent tribes, and tend to recruit their players from within their communities. It will be tough for PFL clubs to do this initially, but an effort should be made. It can only help to strengthen the bond between the team and its city or province. If I were Davao Aguilas FC I would try to get the best players from both Davao and Mindanao. I’d also market the team to all Mindanaoans just to broaden the fanbase.  Patience. The big clubs like Persib, Persija, did not become popular overnight. Persib’s progenitor, called the Bandoeng Inlandsche Voetbal Bond, was founded in 1933 and Persija five years earlier. It takes generations for a team to be ingrained into the local community and for a rabid fan culture to emerge. So the PFL must plant seeds now and hope to harvest fruit later on.  * * *  Despite leading 2-0, victory is denied Persib Bandung and their faithful. Astonishingly, Persib concedes two late TNI strikes and the game finishes 2-2. The soldiers celebrate joyously while the stunned Bobotoh put hands on heads as the final whistle sounds. The Persib fans give their heroes one last Viking clap cheer anyway. So much promise and potential frittered away. A microcosm of Indonesian club football perhaps? Let’s hope the Philippines Football League avoids a similar fate. – Rappler.com  Any reactions?

Second, only the first 40 bookings of a passenger are given priority-booking treatment. This means that when a passenger tries to book a ride after his or her 40th FleetShare trip, the system will prioritize the bookings of other passengers who haven’t reached 40 bookings yet. Passengers will still be able to book and ride, but it will likely take them a little longer to get a car due to this booking system.  FleetShare said its app will not have price surges that passengers experience from competing apps Grab and Uber.

The initial partnership between the two firms involves Ayala Malls The 30th and uberHOP, a carpool service that lets riders heading in the same direction book and share a ride during rush hour at a fixed fare. For a flat rate of P70, riders going to and coming from Ayala Malls The 30th in Ortigas will be linked to the business hubs of Makati City and Bonifacio Global City (BGC). The service runs from 5 pm to 9 pm on weekdays and will ply the following routes: “The beauty of this is that it brings 6 to 8 people together, people who would have otherwise taken their own cars from Makati and back, so that’s around 6 less cars on the road during rush hour, and we all know even just one additional car during rush hour is really more than we need,” said Uber Philippines communications head Cat Avelino at the announcement of the partnership on Monday, March 20. More convenient transportation The 3 routes are part of an initial test program that may eventually lead to uberHop and other services being incorporated into more Ayala malls in the future. “Definitely we hope that this will be the first of many more partnerships with Ayala to come. Ayala has over 40 malls already in Metro Manila and around the Philippines so we’re definitely open to opportunities we can have to amplify and to extend the benefit that people get from ride-sharing,” Avelino said. The partnership also ties in to Ayala’s Easy Ride project which aims to provide its customers with convenient access to multiple modes of public transportation to and from the malls. “The real value-add of Uber is that they can direct where the drop-off and pick-up points are and that really helps with the flow and the customer experience of the mall as well as for our traffic,” said Ayala Malls The 30th general manager Mariana Zobel de Ayala. “Regardless of demand number, it definitely adds to the experience of organizing our transporting public around the world so there’s a lot of positives to it,” she added. Smaller malls Opened earlier this year, Ayala Malls The 30th is a departure from Ayala’s usually bigger offerings. In terms of leasable area, it offers just under 28,000 square meters (sqm) including the 2,000-sqm cinemas. It is that smaller footprint which makes it ideal for testing out services and which the firm hopes will form part of its appeal. “We spent a lot of time studying the Pasig and Ortigas market and we felt that we could have success with a format like this even with the residential density of the higher-end market here,” Zobel de Ayala said. “What really differentiates us from our competition in the area is that the format is very different… When people come they feel they can get a lot done. They’re not just here to shop or to eat, they can go to the salon or supermarket, get clothing alterations as well as go to the cinemas. The size is more manageable, more consumable,” she added. Ayala will be launching a similar mall to be called Ayala Malls Vertis this April – one of 11 malls scheduled for completion through to 2018. The firm’s capital expenditure for the next 3 years is pegged at P16 billion. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/164697-uber-president-jeff-jones-quits/","title":"Uber president Jeff Jones quits","date":"Mar 20, 2017 2:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The company's former second highest executive cites differences in 'beliefs and approach to leadership'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The road gets even bumpier for ride-sharing giant Uber as its president Jeff Jones steps down.  Jones announced the resignation Sunday, March 19 through a statement sent to tech website Recode, where he said that what he had seen and experienced at Uber was inconsistent with the “beliefs and approach to leadership” that have guided his career.  Jones just lasted 6 months – a far cry from his 5-year stay at US retail giant Target, where he served as its chief marketing officer.  His departure comes during a challenging time for the company. It is currently facing sexual harrassment and sexism allegations; accusations of stealing self-driving technology from Google parent company Alphabet; and a tarnished image because of its CEO’s perceived support for US president Donald Trump a few months back. According to Recode sources, these issues directly affected Jones’ decision to step away from the company.  Ironically, Jones was hired in the fall of 2016 to fix Uber’s image as well as head its main ride-sharing business.

Grab's newest service, GrabShare, aims to do something about that","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Long, winding lines at the MRT station; suffocatingly packed buses and vans; the numbingly slow crawl of EDSA traffic — this is just a glimpse into a day in the life of a Metro Manila commuter. To say the traffic situation in the Philippines is bad would be an understatement. According to a Ford survey published in several major news sites, 30% of Filipinos consider commuting the worst part of their day. And it’s largely because of the current state of available public transportation options: crowded, uncomfortable, and inconvenient.   But as much as Filipinos hate it, there’s no avoiding it. Everyone still needs to go to work, visit their families, have dinner and drinks with friends. So what’s a commuter to do?  Companies are now coming up with new ride-sharing options that aim to change the way Filipinos look at getting from point A to point B.  A new way to commute In a media launch help last February 16 at The Brewery in BGC, Grab introduced GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial ride-sharing service in the Philippines. With GrabShare, commuters can expect to share their ride with only 1 other passenger for up to 30% cheaper fares than GrabCar (Sedan). GrabShare allows a maximum of only one additional detour per ride, to make sure that the passengers’ time and money are not wasted. The new service will introduce cheaper fares for passengers and more income for drivers by allowing them to complete two bookings in one trip.   GrabShare works by using a “matching algorithm” to help passengers get to their destinations in the shortest time possible. The algorithm factors in the closest available drivers, travel time, overlap of trip routes, detour distance, and current traffic conditions before sequencing pick-ups and drop-offs so commuters can experience the most efficient and practical rides.  Grab claims that Filipinos who are used to sharing seats in cramped vehicles now have a more comfortable and convenient option for getting around.  Perks for both passengers and drivers GrabShare was first launched in Singapore in December 2016, and was considered a huge success. In 2 months, 2 million GrabShare rides were completed, covering a total distance of about 20 million kilometers. Since more passengers have been choosing GrabShare, Grab has improved their passenger matching rate by 15%, and with it, increases Grab drivers’ monthly incomes by 10%.  So in addition to providing Filipinos with a better option for ride-sharing, GrabShare also helps their drivers increase their potential earnings. While the traffic situation in Metro Manila still leaves much to be desired, at least now Filipinos are not limited to their usual commuting options. And ride-sharing doesn’t necessarily have to be associated with sweaty lines and cramped seating arrangements anymore. As people and technology evolve, so can the future of our commute. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/163456-uber-skids-have-lyft-steering-for-passing-lane/","title":"In U.S., Uber skids have rival Lyft steering for passing lane","date":"Mar 7, 2017 10:57 AM PHT","snippet":"A socially responsible and driver-friendly reputation buoys Lyft as Uber faces questions about its culture","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – As Uber’s gets dented by controversies, on-demand ride rival Lyft is accelerating expansion and out to pick up converts by appearing a friendlier, more sympathic alternative. US-based Lyft lets people summon rides using smartphone apps as does Uber, but has cultivated a reputation as a more socially responsible and driver-friendly version of the service. Lyft even mocked Uber in an advertising campaign late last year, depicting leaders of an imaginary “RideCorp” firm that appeared to be a reference to its market-leading competitor. The supposed executives sat in a black-walled conference room discussing how to defeat Lyft. Each short video clip focused on undermining what Lyft touts as advantages, such as extensive driver background checks and letting passengers tip drivers (something Uber has firmly opposed). Lyft also took a stand in January against US President Donald Trump’s first anti-immigration executive order, announcing a million-dollar donation to the American Civil Liberties Union to help fund legal opposition. Meanwhile, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick was on track to be part of a Trump business advisory group and a movement grew to dump the ride-sharing service because of his connection to the administration. Kalanick quit the group, putting out word in an email to employees that the move was not meant as an “endorsement of the president or his agenda.” Uber also took heat for how the service reacted to a taxi strike at a major New York City airport to protest Trump’s initial anti-immigration order, winding up accused of trying to undermine the protest. Uber said its response was misinterpreted. Lyft saw downloads of its mobile application climb as a “DeleteUber” campaign picked up speed on Twitter. The campaign got renewed momentum in recent weeks after accusations of sexism, cut-throat management, and a toxic work environment at Uber surfaced. In the Philippines, Uber drew flak for a tweet that was deemed insensitive towards jeepney drivers who were holding a transport strike at the time.  Last week, Uber acknowledged the use of a secret software program to steer drivers away from trouble, including sting operations by local authorities to catch law-breakers. Lyft was founded in 2012, 3 years after Uber, and is also based in San Francisco but is smaller. Lyft has attracted a few investors, including General Motors, Alibaba, and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding. The company is currently seeking to raise an additional $500 million in a funding round that would value the company about $6 billion, less than a tenth the valuation of Uber. While Uber has expanded internationally, Lyft has concentrated mostly on the US. Early this year, Lyft expanded to a hundred more US cities, bringing the total to about 300. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/162926-uber-image-battered-by-company-culture-skids/","title":"Uber image battered by company culture skids","date":"Mar 1, 2017 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing company scrambles to regain control after a string of mishaps","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Accusations of sexism, cut-throat management, and a toxic work environment have Uber trying to pull its image out of a skid as competition revs in the on-demand ride market. “Experienced managers know how to prevent these kinds of problems, or make it look like there isn’t a problem at all,” analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said while discussing Uber’s travails. “It is showcasing a severe lack of skill at the top.” Uber hired former attorney general Eric Holder to review workplace conditions after an ex-employee alleged sexual harassment and sexism at the firm. Susan Fowler, an engineer who worked at Uber until the end of last year, said in a blog post that her manager made sexual advances shortly after she joined the company. She said she complained to upper managers and the human resources department, but was told that it was the man’s “first offense” and that they wouldn’t feel comfortable punishing a “high performer.” Fowler told of later meeting other women engineers at the company who said they had experienced similar harassment, including inappropriate behavior from the same manager she had reported. Men engineers were gifted leather jackets, while women were left out, she noted. “In the background, there was a game-of-thrones political war raging within the ranks of upper management in the infrastructure engineering organization,” Fowler said, comparing the scene to a hit fantasy television drama in which rival nobles viciously vie for power. “It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor’s job.” A New York Times report on Friday depicted a “Hobbesian environment” at Uber in which workers were pitted against one another and misbehavior by top performers was overlooked. The story included tales of a director shouting a homophobic slur in a meeting; a manager threatening to beat an underperforming worker with a baseball bat, and women employees groped at a Las Vegas retreat where cocaine was used in bathrooms during private parties. #DeleteUber  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that Holder and another attorney will look into issues raised by Fowler, “as well as diversity and inclusion at Uber more broadly.” Holder was former US president Barack Obama’s attorney general between 2009 and 2015. The lawyers were to be aided by journalist Arianna Huffington, who is a member of the Uber board. The controversy threatened to revive a #DeleteUber campaign triggered by Kalanick’s short-lived plan to be part of a business advisory group for US President Donald Trump. Kalanick quit the group under pressure from a growing movement to stop using the ride-sharing service because of his connection to the new administration, and by extension an anti-immigrant agenda. As the campaign picked up speed, rival Lyft’s popularity accelerated. “Now, they are facing yet another avoidable backlash where people are disconnecting themselves from the (Uber) app,” analyst Enderle said. “Lyft is likely the biggest beneficiary, but at the same time, Google is coming to market with its Waze carpool service – this is the wrong time for Uber to have this.” Snowball of trouble Meanwhile, the race to develop self-driving vehicles took a turn on Thursday when Google’s parent company Alphabet filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing it of using stolen technology. Alphabet contends that a manager at its autonomous car subsidiary Waymo took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto, Uber’s self-driving vehicle unit, in a reported $680 million deal. Waymo is calling for a trial to stop Otto and Uber from using technology taken in a “calculated theft.” Waymo also wants unspecified damages in what it described in court documents as “an action for trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement and unfair competition.” San Francisco-based Uber acquired commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto last year as it pressed ahead with a pursuit of self-driving technology. “We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,” an Uber spokeswoman said. In the eyes of consumers, Uber’s controversies pack together into “a snowball of trouble rolling down the hill getting bigger and bigger,” said brand management specialists Bruce Turkel. Once people switch to a new ride-hailing app, they are likely to stick with it and forget about using Uber, according to analysts. “Uber can do all the damage control they want, it’s not going to change who they are at their very core,” Turkel said. “And, unfortunately, when you watch Travis Kalanick when he is on TV or whatever, he has that frat boy kind of attitude anyway. So, when you hear about sexual harassment, it actually fits.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/162397-alphabet-uber-stealing-self-driving-car-technology/","title":"Alphabet accuses Uber of stealing self-driving car technology","date":"Feb 24, 2017 9:16 AM PHT","snippet":"Waymo's lawsuit contends Anthony Levandowski in December 2015 downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary files from a highly confidential design server to a laptop","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Alphabet on Thursday, February 23, filed a lawsuit accusing Uber and its self-driving vehicle unit Otto of stealing technology from Waymo, a subsidiary of the Google parent company. “Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time and expense of independently developing their own technology,” Waymo said in a San Francisco federal court filing. The suit contends that a Waymo manager took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto. “We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,” an Uber spokeswoman said in an email reply to an AFP inquiry. Waymo called for a trial, and urged the court to order Otto and Uber to stop using patented technology at issue in the case.  Waymo also wanted unspecified damages in what it described in court documents as “an action for trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, and unfair competition.” Waymo argued that a “calculated theft” of its technology netted Otto a buyout of more than $500 million and enabled Uber to revive a stalled self-driving car program. California-based ride-sharing service Uber acquired commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto late last year as the company pressed ahead with its pursuit of self-driving technology. Anthony Levandowski, a co-founder of Otto, a 90-person startup, was put in charge of Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving technology for personal driving, delivery and trucking. Waymo’s lawsuit contended that Levandowski in December 2015 downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary files from a highly confidential design server to a laptop. A week later, and after removing a data storage card, Levandowski reformatted the company laptop in what the suit maintained was an attempt to erase any trace of what happened to the downloaded data. At issue in the suit was proprietary LiDAR system information that was stored on the Waymo server and which, according to the company, wound up at Otto. Waymo has invested tens of millions of dollars in LiDAR sensors that use lasers to scan and essentially enable vehicles to “see” what is around them, according to the lawsuit. “Thanks in part to this highly advanced LiDAR technology, Waymo became the first company to complete a fully self-driving trip on public roads in a vehicle without a steering wheel,” the suit said. After downloading confidential information regarding Waymo’s LiDAR systems and other technology, and while working at Waymo, Levandowski attended meetings with high-level executives at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco in January 2016, the lawsuit contended. By the end of that month, Levandowski officially formed a venture that would become Otto and resigned from Waymo, according to the court filing. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/162012-uber-urgent-sexual-harassment-investigation/","title":"Uber launches ‘urgent’ sexual harassment investigation","date":"Feb 20, 2017 6:40 PM PHT","snippet":"A former Uber engineer claims that her manager made sexual advances shortly after she joined the company at the end of 2015.","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick has announced an “urgent investigation” at the ride-sharing company after a former employee wrote a blog post on Sunday, February 19, alleging sexual harassment and sexism at the firm.

Other the next few months, Fowler said she met other women engineers at the company who said they had also experienced similar harassment, including alleged inappropriate behavior from her previous manager. After lodging various complaints of what she considered inappropriate behavior, Fowler said she was told by her manager that she was “on thin ice” for reporting his boss to human resources.  The HR department, meanwhile, told her that she might be the problem, not the men she was reporting. Fowler said she was blocked for a transfer and given a negative performance review without justification. She now works at Stripe, a company that helps businesses handle online and mobile payments. The Uber case is likely to revive debates over sexism in male-dominated Silicon Valley. In 2015, a California jury rejected charges of gender discrimination against a prominent venture capital firm in a case seen as a proxy trial of Silicon Valley sex bias.

But to do this, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will have to lift its moratorium on applications for transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said that his company has already lobbied the LTFRB to lift its application suspensions for TNVS, a transport category for application-based four-wheeled vehicles. The lifting of LTFRB’s moratorium is needed before Grab can expand its GrabCar services to Davao, Iloilo, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. (READ: GrabTaxi rebrands as Grab, eyes further expansion) “As much as we would like to expand to all these cities, there is still a franchise suspension by LTFRB,” Cu said on the sidelines of an event in Taguig City on Thursday, February 16. Grab currently has its GrabCar service in Metro Manila, Cebu, and Bacolod. “We have lobbied [to the LTFRB]. Just very recently. So right now, nothing is happening yet. I think they are waiting for the omnibus franchise policy. Right now, it is just a memorandum circular,” Cu said. It was in July 2016 when LTFRB suspended applications for TNVS due to the surge of applicants and the review of their fare scheme. Still double-digit growth Cu said when it comes to profit, Grab Philippines “expects double-digit revenue growth in 2016.” This is despite the “stunted expansion” due to the LTFRB moratorium. “In 2016, demand was still strong. Up to now, we are still continuing to see demand. We believe we solve a present need that is why we are working with the legislation,” Grab Philippines’ country head said.  Grab on Thursday, February 16, announced the regional launch of GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial carpooling service, with its introduction in the Philippines and Malaysia. In exchange for sharing their ride, passengers enjoy cheaper fares and a maximum of only one additional detour. Meanwhile, drivers earn more by completing two bookings in one trip. To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh had earlier said her company was taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh had said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/161029-wunder-solve-ph-traffic/","title":"Can you help solve traffic during your daily commute?","date":"Feb 13, 2017 6:04 PM PHT","snippet":"There's one thing you can do to ease traffic in the metro","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Think the traffic situation in Metro Manila couldn’t possibly get worse? Think again. The Philippines could lose up to P6 billion a day if traffic doesn’t improve by 2030, according to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Filipinos, however, stand to lose a lot more due to bumper to bumper traffic – aside from their patience. Precious time and expensive fuel are wasted. Greenhouse gas emissions increase, and so do risks to health. While the government has already come up with ways to solve traffic, results will not be apparent immediately as there’s lots to cover. There’s poor urban planning in an already-overpopulated capital, leading to a severely congested metropolis. Using public transportation is difficult. Citizens are subjected to inefficient bus services: aggressive drivers often veer off their designated bus lanes and stop in the middle of highways to drop off or pick up passengers, blocking parts of the road meant for regular traffic. Because they are paid based on how many passengers they carry, they loiter to load the whole bus, blocking other cars. The notoriously glitchy railway system is hardly a faster and more pleasant alternative. Train breakdowns lessen the already inadequate number of coaches – for which there are long queues snaking down packed train stations, especially during rush hour. (READ: MRT and the violence of our mass transport system) The country currently ranks 12th among countries with the worst traffic in the world. No wonder, then, that 30% of Filipinos consider commuting to be the worst part of their day, according to a Ford survey which has appeared on three local news sites. They are also beginning to ditch public transportation in favor of bringing their own cars to work or to school. Thanks to affordable car loans, they can purchase their own vehicles without much difficulty. But while good for the economy, this only exacerbates the issue. 32% of vehicles making trips in Metro Manila are privately owned. Rising car sales means more vehicles on the road, contributing to the so-called carmageddon on EDSA. The staggering number of cars being sold can also be attributed to ride-hailing’s surge in popularity in the Philippines. Entrepreneurial Filipinos have taken advantage of the demand for more accessible, efficient, and safe transportation options. They buy new cars in bulk, hire drivers, send them out to clogged highways, then get passengers using apps. But while this form of ride-sharing makes commuting more comfortable, it doesn’t help reduce traffic. This practice adds around 10,000 to 15,000 cars to those already on the road. Ride-sharing: the true solution Of the over 20,000 commuters from Quezon City who take their cars to work, 65% drive by themselves, according to a study by Wunder. This takes up a lot of space on the road, particularly if one is driving a large car. A simple way to help decongest the traffic is to make arrangements with other people to travel in one vehicle.  In the Philippines, carpooling comes in many forms, but true carpooling means riding with existing car owners, not buying more cars to be able to share rides. By using apps like Wunder, drivers with similar routes can offer their empty seats to passengers. Car owners can even share seats with other car owners. They turn into passengers by leaving their own cars at home to fill in those seats instead. In addition to reducing the number of cars on highways by putting more people in less cars, this lessens every commuter’s carbon footprint. Fewer cars mean less air pollution, which, according to the World Health Organization, is the cause for 7 million deaths each year. With this, the potential for respiratory illnesses lessens considerably. Sharing rides can also reduce stress experienced by commuters. It also saves money. Resources, namely car and fuel, are maximized, thereby cutting costs for everyone involved. In the end, no matter how loudly we complain to fellow passengers or honk at erring drivers, the sorry state of traffic is – for the time being, at least – here to stay. While we’re waiting for more viable, long-term solutions from the government and the private sector, we should learn how to be creative enough to come up with answers of our own. We can all be part of the solution once we realize that it can start with us. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/161122-ford-invests-artificial-intelligence-startup-argo-ai/","title":"Ford to invest $1B in artificial intelligence startup","date":"Feb 11, 2017 10:41 AM PHT","snippet":"The venture with Argo AI will employ leading engineers and 'roboticists' to develop a 'virtual driver' system, described by Ford officials as the 'brain' of an autonomous vehicle","body":" NEW YORK, USA – Ford will invest $1 billion over 5 years in an artificial intelligence startup with the aim of developing an autonomous vehicle by 2021, the auto giant said on Friday, February 10. Ford will take a majority stake in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, started in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees who had worked on autonomous driving. The venture will employ leading engineers and “roboticists” to develop a “virtual driver” system, described by Ford officials as the “brain” of an autonomous vehicle. The setup is intended to give Ford a head start on competitors in the race to commercialize autonomous vehicles, said Ford executive vice president Raj Nair.  “This is really unique in the industry,” Nair said on a conference call with analysts.  It will have the “speed and nimbleness of a startup, but also integrated into a full production development team.” Nair said research towards full autonomy has moved “beyond the research phase,” but there remains the need for a “tremendous leap” between the driver-assist technologies now available and full autonomy. Argo AI employees will have a minority equity stake in the venture. The structure is intended to lure top engineers to the venture, Ford executives said.  Ford said the investment would help it to realize a previously announced plan to introduce an autonomous vehicle for ride-hailing or ride-sharing service in 2021. Argo AI plans to hire more than 200 people at sites in Pittsburgh, Michigan and Silicon Valley, according to a press release. Argo AI and other boosters of autonomous driving argue it could make roads safer and open up mobility to the elderly and others.  “We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move,” Argo AI chief Bryan Salesky said. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/160373-uber-chief-quits-trump-advisory-group-after-uproar/","title":"Uber chief quits Trump advisory group after uproar","date":"Feb 3, 2017 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Outraged Uber riders and drivers form #DeleteUber movement and forces Uber boss, Travis Kalanick, to step down from Trump group","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick on Thursday, Feb 2, US time, quit US President Donald Trump’s business advisory group as a movement grew to dump the ride-sharing service because of the collaboration. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda, but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick said in an email to Uber employees, a copy of which was obtained by AFP.

In the proposed package, diesel excise rates will be increased incrementally to P6.24 per liter by 2020, starting with a P3-increase in the second quarter of 2017. For gas, the proposed excise tax is P10.40 per liter by 2020, starting with P4.35-per-liter tax in the second quarter of 2017. The increase is expected to jack up prices for these oil products, used mainly for transportation, power generation, and cooking. “Many are saying this is anti-poor but the truth is, the richest 10% of Filipinos consume 50% of oil products. Then the top 1% make up 13% because they have many cars. Those who ride jeeps, buses share the cost with 20 or 40 other people,” Chua said. The finance official said it was about time the oil tax was increased since it hasn’t been touched for the past 20 years. The P6-increase represents the total value of increase lost during those years.  Proposed oil excise rates: To soften the blow of the tax rate increase, the hike will be staggered, starting with a P3-increase in 2017, an additional P2 in 2018, then a P1-additional increase in 2019. The automobile tax rate increase too, said Chua, is designed to put more burden on the rich than the poor. (READ: No poor Filipino by 2040: Can Duterte gov’t set the stage?) “The cheap cars will have lower tax rates while the expensive cars, like SUVs and luxury cars, will have higher tax rates,” said Chua. Proposed auto excise rates: Even with the tax, average-income Filipinos will still be able to buy cars because of the lowered income tax rates in the proposed tax reform package. “Even if the excise for automobiles increases, the lowering of income tax is bigger so the average Filipino buying a car, let’s say a Vios or Innova, will still have more savings to buy a car,” said Chua.  The imposition of the higher tax rates is necessary to make up for the shortfall in government revenue caused by the lowering of income tax. Such changes in the country’s tax system, said Chua, are meant to rebalance the current system to favor the poor instead of the rich, and help the government earn more revenue to fund priority programs for infrastructure, education, and health.  “It’s designed to be equitable such that the rich pay more and the poor pay less,” said Chua.   If Congress passes the proposed tax reform bill, the DOF estimates that the government would be able to add P1 trillion to its 2018 budget which would fund  road projects. Such projects include the Bonifacio Global City-Ortigas Center Link Road, UP-Miriam-Ateneo Viaduct along C-5/Katipunan, EDSA Taft Flyover, and the Central Luzon Link Expressway. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/159322-asia-pacific-bad-to-good-ranking-malacanang/","title":"The ranking that had Malacañang talking","date":"Jan 26, 2017 11:01 AM PHT","snippet":"As the lunar new year arrives – the Year of the Rooster – on January 28, we take one last look at the Year of the Monkey, 2016 and the rankings that perked up Malacañang","body":" It’s not every day that a Philippine presidential spokesperson holds up a print-out of an article you have written, and one’s writing becomes the topic of a Malacañang Palace press conference. So was the case for my co-author, Southeast Asia anlayst Jose B. Collazo, and me when our annual year end wrap-up for CNN of “Asia’s winners and loser” had Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte topping our 2016 recap of who had it good in the year that was. Our list “perks up Palace,” reported GMA News. “Palace welcomes Duterte accolades as ‘Asia’s Big Winner'” read, in part, another headline. On social media, from Twitter to YouTube, our selection garnered praise, surprise and disdain.  “It’s heartening to know that certain media agencies are able to notice the good things the President is doing,” Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said at the news conference. A clip of his comments was soon posted online, and clarifications followed that it was not CNN but CNN contributors Collazo and I who had made the selection. From the Twittersphere came comments and questions about alleged human rights violations and a weakening Philippine peso, as well as praise for our selection. But just as now President Donald J. Trump had been named “Person of the Year” by Time Magazine last December, our opinion piece for CNN made no judgment as to whether Duterte’s leadership to date has been for good or for bad, or somewhere in between. I believe that ultimately that is up for the Filipino people to decide.   What was clear though in our deliberations was that the new Philippine president is a leader to be noticed, and one that clearly the leaders of the largest economies in the world, the United States, China and Japan had taken note of in 2016. For the prior year, 2015, Collazo and I had taken to CNN and awarded “best year in Asia” to China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The newly created international financial institution was then well on its way to being a future challenger to the Manila-headquartered Asian Development Bank, on whose Board of Directors I had served for nearly four years. We awarded “worst year in Asia” 2015 to “Asia’s lungs.” From north China to tiny Singapore, and India’s capital city to Indonesia’s Kalimantan, burning forests and factory smokestacks darkened skies and threatened to shorten lives across the region.  Sadly, they still do. But in the year that was, we looked further east, across the Pacific, to an outgoing US president and a pivot and partnership that were not to be in choosing who had the worst year in Asia.  As the lunar new year arrives – the Year of the Rooster – this January 28, we take one last look at the Year of the Monkey, 2016 and the rankings that got Malacañang talking. Best year: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte Not without controversy, Philippine President Duterte topped our CNN list for “best year” in Asia by winning his nation’s presidency in a landslide last May 2016 and subsequently upending, rethinking and reshaping the state of affairs – for good or for bad – at home and abroad. Since taking office last June 30, 2016, the former mayor of Davao City has launched an unsparing, and bloody, war on crime and drugs that has brought mounting human rights criticism and concerns over extrajudicial killings. The tough-talking leader also has declared a “separation” from the United States, its long-term ally, and moved to put aside territorial disputes in favor of business deals with China – this, despite an international tribunal ruling in the Philippines’ favor in July over territories in the South China Sea. In early December, the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey firm had Duterte enjoying a 77 percent approval rating as Filipinos continue to put their trust in their controversial president. For now, the Philippine leader’s unconventional moves seem a harbinger of things to come. This is no pivot to China, but a disruption of the old normal. Duterte ends 2016 seeking to rebalance his nation’s ties, improve the life of the average Filipino and make the Philippines – a one-time economic and trade powerhouse – great again. And for that, Asia’s best year went to Duterte.  Good year: Asia’s digital disruptors Amazon’s Jeff Bezos may well be a household name in America, but how about Wei Cheng, co-founder and CEO of Didi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuai), the multi-billion dollar Chinese ride-sharing app that beat Uber Technologies at its own game in China. In September, Uber surrendered in its costly battle for riders in China and swapped its operations there for a minority stake in Didi Chuxing. Cheng is an example of Asia’s Digital Disruptors who came into their own in 2016. Like Jack Ma of Alibaba Group, these new titans are embracing disruptive business models and leveraging local knowledge and connections to win customers and investments.  For them, 2016 was most definitely a good year, even if some are still struggling, as are their Silicon Valley role models, to turn a profit Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, the parent company of the Alipay online payment service, was valued alone at about $60 billion last June when it raised $4.5 billion. Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma of India is one more digital disruptor. His and others’ e-commerce and digital wallet offerings are likely to benefit from India Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ongoing efforts to “demonetize” and “digitalize India.” With Forrester research projecting the Asia-Pacific e-commerce market to reach US$1.4 trillion in 2020, these and other digital disruptors are likely to see many more good years ahead. A mixed year: Asia’s webizens When their smartphones did work, increasing mobile adoption and internet penetration in 2016 gave Asia’s webizens the tools to connect and share information and opinions as never before. Unfortunately, for many in Asia, if an increase in freedom of on-line expression is the metric, the year was mixed at best. The 2016 Freedom on the Net report by US non-governmental organization Freedom House rates only two of 15 Asian countries – the Philippines and Japan – as having an internet that is assessed as “free.”  Webizens were “partly free” in South Korea, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Cambodia and Bangladesh, and “not free” in Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Pakistan. From outright censorship or arrest in China or blocked access to social media platforms and communication apps such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, to the murder of bloggers in Bangladesh, for Asia’s Webizens the power of technology also brought new risks in 2016. Bad year: South Korean President Park Geun-hye In South Korea, it has been a bad year for embattled President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached over a still unfolding scandal that could well have been penned by a Hollywood screenwriter. Allegations of corruption and slush funds mix with tales of cult-like rituals and influence linked to a mysterious, close friend now on trial, Choi Soon-sil, daughter of a deceased religious figure. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets calling for the president’s resignation. Park barely beat out another contender from South Korea for “bad year” in Asia – Samsung Electronics for its now discontinued Galaxy Note 7. The smartphone was seen as a worthy challenger to Apple’s iPhone. Any such aspirations in 2016, literally and figuratively, went down in flames. Battery problems causing some Galaxy Note 7s to spontaneously combust put the “must have” phone on a permanent “no fly” and then “don’t buy” list. Worst year: The US pivot to Asia The dubious distinction of worst year in Asia went to former US President Barack Obama for a “US pivot to Asia” that was increasingly seen as more rhetoric than reality even before November’s elections. A central Obama foreign policy initiative, the pivot was described as a strategic rebalance, shifting U.S. diplomatic and military resources to the world’s most dynamic economic region. At its economic heart would be an ambitious trade deal, a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) linking 12 Pacific Rim nations accounting for 40 percent of world trade. The U.S., not China, would help “write the rules,” Obama declared, through this “gold standard” of trade deals. All that was not to be. First, one-time TPP proponent Hillary Clinton turned her back on the deal. And then, Trump’s election drove a stake into it. The now inaugurated U.S. President had said among his first actions in office will be to withdraw the United States from the TPP in favor of “fair bilateral trade deals.” Oversold, under-delivered and now trumped: the Pivot to Asia. So endeth the Year of the Monkey. And so now begins a new year, if not a new era, as President Trump – dare I say America’s Duterte – begins a four-year term as US president. – Rappler.com   Curtis S.

The money paid by San Francisco-based Uber Technologies will be used to provide refunds to affected drivers in the United States, according to the Federal Trade Commission. “Many consumers sign up to drive for Uber, but they shouldn’t be taken for a ride about their earnings potential or the cost of financing a car through Uber,” FTC bureau of consumer protection director Jessica Rich said in a release. An FTC complaint accused Uber of exaggerating income potential in certain cities to attract new drivers, and making the terms of its vehicle-financing program appear more attractive than they were. Uber had claimed that uberX drivers’ median annual incomes topped $90,000 in New York and $74,000 in San Francisco, when the actual amounts came to $61,000 and $53,000 respectively, the FTC said. The complaint also contended that while Uber claimed that its Vehicle Solutions Program provided the best financing options available, drivers received worse deals on average when it came to interest rates and leasing terms. While negotiating the settlement, Uber held firm that its approach to calculating incomes differed from the FTC’s, saying the company had no intention of deceiving prospective drivers. Uber has recently stopped using an outside partner for financing vehicles in favor of an in-house program to better oversee the process. “We’re pleased to have reached an agreement with the FTC,” an Uber spokeswoman said in an email response to an Agence France-Presse inquiry. “We’ve made many improvements to the driver experience over the last year.” Along with having to pay $20 million, Uber is barred from misrepresenting driver pay or terms for the financing of leasing vehicles, according to the FTC. Drivers’ advocates welcomed the settlement. “The reality of being a ride-sharing driver is a far cry from the rosy picture these apps describe,” said Jim Conigliaro, founder of the Independent Drivers Guild, which says it represents 45,000 Uber drivers in New York City. “It is encouraging to see the FTC take them to task and refund drivers.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/157929-uber-launches-website-showing-traffic-data-around-world/","title":"Uber website shows traffic data around the world","date":"Jan 10, 2017 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"Launching 'Movement,' Uber says the website is designed to help urban planners make more informed decisions","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-sharing giant Uber launched a website that shows the traffic data the company has collected through the years. Called “Movement,” the website primarily targets urban planners and researchers looking to improve the flow of traffic in their respective jurisdictions. The idea here is that the information collected from the trips made by their drivers can be used to identify traffic trends and patterns. By identifying these patterns, urban planners will then be able to make more informed decisions in their attempts to implement improvements to an area. Uber currently operates in 450 cities worldwide. Said Uber in a statement: “Since Uber is available 24/7, we can compare travel conditions across different times of day, days of the week, or months of the year – and how travel times are impacted by big events, road closures or other things happening in a city.” Users of the Movement site can specify the data range, zones within a region, time of day, and day of week. The site also presents some data in charts for more convenient viewing. The data is also anonymized according to Uber, which means that passengers won’t have to worry about the website impinging on their privacy.  At the moment, the data on Movement is on limited-access availability. Individuals and organizations can apply to gain access to the data, although Uber said that it will be fully available to the public down the line. “While it’s early days for this product, we’re committed to serving cities from Manila to Melbourne to Washington, DC,” Uber said. “We’re excited to partner with city officials, urban planners and research organizations to continue building features that today’s transportation planners need.”  Those interested in working with Uber on a partnership or research opportunity using Movement data can contact research@uber.com. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/156300-only-1-in-20-trips-affected-by-fare-shock-uber-philippines/","title":"Only 1 in 20 trips affected by fare shock – Uber PH","date":"Dec 22, 2016 6:25 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber PH addresses concerns about its new 'upfront fare' system","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In November, ride-sharing app Uber introduced a new way of informing passengers of how much their ride would cost. It’s called “upfront fare” and what it does is that it computes the several factors (time, distance, surge rate) affecting the overall fare, and rounds it off into a single number. The number is shown to riders as an estimate of how much they would be paying for their trip. As opposed to the old system, the upfront fare is meant to take away the act of having to compute for your fare manually with Uber’s surge rates. These surge rates occur in high-demand situations, and in the old system, were readily shown to the rider. The change, unfortunately, has led to problems for some Uber users. They experience a form of “fare shock,” where they end up paying more than what the upfront pricing system initially told them. Several of these users have surfaced on social media, claiming that the new system feels misleading.  In a roundtable meeting with media on Thursday, December 22, Uber Philippines general manager Lawrence Cua addressed the issue. He clarified that the discrepancy – which causes the fare shock – may arise because of several different factors: the route changed, the trip added multiple stops, or the traffic worsened during the trip. When those happen, Uber reverts to its original way of computing for time and distance along with potential surge rates, instead of the initial upfront fare offered. Cua said this is done in order to protect the Uber driver and ensure that he’s being compensated properly.  Affected users Cua said, however, that those experiencing the discrepancies are in the minority. According to him, fare shock occurs only once every 20 trips or 5% of trips.  Currently, there are around 600,000 Uber users in the Philippines, said Cua. If all of them took an Uber trip now, 5% of those trips (30,000) would be affected. As Uber gets more data and feedback, Cua said they are constantly improving their predictive capabilities to come up with more accurate upfront fares. But the ride-sharing app also needs to do a better job of letting passengers know that upfront fares are not fixed – they’re just predictions and can change in the middle of a trip.  Uber already has a page on its website explaining the details of the upfront fare system, but not everyone will get to read that. Perhaps the app design could be tweaked to better inform the rider of potential fare hikes mid-trip. Currently, Uber has no such plans to tweak the design or revert to the old system. The current solution it has proposed is for affected consumers to file a help ticket, which the ride-sharing firm vowed to address immediately. Uber is also looking to increase its fleet of drivers, which is currently stuck at 20,000 because of legal issues with the government. With more drivers on the road, Uber’s hope is that the fluctuation in fares can be more manageable. Right now, the demand outstrips supply, causing higher surges during rush hour and creating bigger fluctuations for the upfront fare system. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/149097-hearing-impaired-uber-driver-beethoven-initiative/","title":"Hearing-impaired Uber driver recalls rare instance of discrimination","date":"Oct 13, 2016 8:28 PM PHT","snippet":"With over 1,500 trips under his belt, Mike – one of the drivers under Uber's 'Beethoven Initiative' – recalls the one time a passenger made him feel bad about his disability","body":" MANILA, Philippines – His name is Mike Eballa. He’s a “partner-driver” for ride-sharing giant Uber. He’s been one for 5 months to the day with 1577 trips under his belt and a 4.5/5 rating. Like many other Uber drivers, he believes that the tech company has been of great financial help to him.  There is one thing though that might surprise passengers a bit: He’s hearing-impaired. Over the course of 5 months, things have been pretty smooth sailing for the 39-year-old driver – save for one instance.  At a media event held at Uber’s office, Thursday, Oct 13, Mike recalled that one time when he was made uncomfortable about his hearing disability. Picking up a group of young individuals in Manila, Mike overheard his passengers snickering about his condition. Mike is hearing-impaired and not completely deaf. He heard the group pointing out the disability in a way that he didn’t feel too great about. He kept silent though, and opted not to confront.  Mike is just one of the hearing-impaired Uber drivers in the Philippines now. Uber’s “Beethoven Initiative” is designed for him and others like him. According to Uber, 6 in every 1,000 households in the Philippines have a household member who is deaf. The condition makes it hard for individuals to find work. In the Philippines, Uber says that 120,000 locals have difficulty finding work because of the disability.   The “Beethoven Initiative” is essentially a set of features that make it easier for the driver and the passenger to communicate. These are:  The last item in the list was how Mike’s offending passengers found out that he was hard-of-hearing.  Safety concerns Lawrence Cua, Uber’s general manager for the Philippines, says that the program is also a directive towards being completely non-discriminatory towards hearing-impaired drivers who want to make a buck on their platform. Cua says they don’t discriminate between an individual who’s only slightly hearing-impaired and one who’s completely deaf.  Cua also acknowledges concerns regarding the safety of espousing such an open platform.  “Studies have shown all over the world, drivers who are hearing-impaired actually have fewer accidents than regular drivers. That’s a statistical fact. They are more attentive, they tend to be more focused on the driving – and that actually leads to safer rides overall,” Cua said. Cua also presented several references to support his statement: The “Beethoven Initiative” features officially rolled out a month ago in the Philippines. In the US, it was first launched in 2015, and is currently available in 400 cities worldwide. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/147118-airbnb-raises-555-million-dollars-to-grow-globally/","title":"Airbnb raises $555 million to grow globally","date":"Sep 23, 2016 4:54 PM PHT","snippet":"Investors in the latest round of funding include Google and venture capital firm Technology Crossover Ventures","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, US – Home sharing giant Airbnb just raised $555 million and is seeking even more in a funding round that values the company at $30 billion, a source close to the company told AFP.

The team at what Apple named project Titan had grown to more than a thousand people but ran into problems, including showing what it could do differently from other companies working on the technology, according to the Times. Apple fueled speculation about it automotive ambitions this year with a billion-dollar investment in Chinese ride-sharing powerhouse Didi Chuxing. Apple downshifting on Titan comes after pumping resources into it for two years, according to the Times. It also comes as Tesla, major carmakers and rival Google rev investments in autonomous vehicles. Google parent Alphabet and San Francisco-based Uber have both been working on getting self-driving cars on roads. Uber plans to deploy driverless cars for its ride-sharing services in Pittsburgh, pushing the envelope for the use of self-driving technology. At the same time, Uber announced two other moves to further solidify itself as a trailblazer in driverless cars. It established a $300 million venture with Chinese-owned, Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021. And Uber is buying Otto, a San Francisco startup developing self-driving commercial trucks. Uber and Volvo were two of the founding members of a coalition unveiled in April to push for a unified US legal code on self-driving cars — a group that also includes Google, carmaker Ford and Uber rival Lyft. Autonomous cars are among big-vision ideas pursued by Google’s X Lab. Google has driven its autonomous cars some 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) with only some minor dustups. Early this year, the company announced plans for its self-driving car program to put down roots in the Detroit area with a technology center. The facility will house engineers and others testing vehicles provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alphabet said at the time. The tech giant began testing its autonomous driving technology in 2009 using a Toyota Prius equipped with Google equipment.

She wakes up early to catch a UV Express shuttle from her home in Cainta, then walks the last few meters to her office in the Ortigas business district.  For pharmacist Erika Guanzon, the trip from her home in Sucat to her Bonifacio Global City office involves a shuttle and a taxi ride, which costs an average of P270. She wakes up early every day, because there’s no telling how long the shuttle queues will be – and what time the vehicles will leave. These are stories that have become all too common in the Philippine capital region, where traffic is hellish and long, and stressful commutes are more the norm than the exception. Desperate Metro Manila residents turn to various transportation options just to ease their daily suffering, increasingly trying out tech-based solutions as an answer. Sioson and Guanzon both found their own solutions through carpooling. Sioson recounted how she saw a Facebook ad promoting a new service. At the time she decided to try it out, the Germany-based company Wunder was just a month into its operations in Manila. Months since her first carpool ride, Sioson now helps manage a community of Wunder users from the eastern part of Metro Manila. The group – now 400-members strong – coordinates on pick-up points and departure times, routes, and the number of car seats available for shared rides. The whole process, coordinated via a group chat on Viber, is systematic and organized. There’s a template that drivers use to post available seats. There’s an etiquette guide for potential riders. The group bans riders who are rude or who turn up late at designated meeting points. Coming from her frustration of the hassle of everyday commute came a concerted effort to look for a sustainable and viable transport solution. It’s the marriage of technology and community organizing, as commuters take matters into their own hands to create solutions that the government cannot currently provide. Addressing safety concerns Carpooling has long been touted as one solution to the traffic menace. Last year, a government agency launched its own carpooling app which makes use of social media profiles, similar to Wunder’s approach. More recently, popular ride-hailing service Uber launched its own version, UberPOOL, which promises cheaper fares to compensate for potentially longer travel time and detours.  But Wunder sells itself as a “real carpooling service,” in that it operates on a not-for-profit model, according to the firm’s Manila community manager Arnold Cesar Romero. (READ: Getting around Manila through tech-based carpooling) “Drivers in Wunder are only allowed to set their everyday travel details from home to work and back. The app will not be able to handle intervening travels in between, thus discouraging users from using Wunder for commercial purposes. Further, the costs that passengers share are set by the application and are calculated so that profit cannot be made,” Romero said. Romero said the most active neighborhoods in their system come from Malabon, Caloocan, and Marikina, with many of the riders heading to business districts in Makati, Pasig, and Taguig. Based on their data, riders save around 21 hours every month compared to taking public transportation. Drivers also earn up to P5,000 every month for sharing empty seats in their cars. But carpooling services share the same challenge: getting riders to be comfortable with the concept of sharing rides. Both UberPOOL and Wunder require registration; Wunder also links social network profiles so that riders and drivers can check out each other’s profile and decide whether or not to share the ride. Guanzon acknowledged that everyone would feel cautious on their first carpool experience. Before taking a ride, she would look at the Facebook profile of the driver, checking to see if they have common friends. In Sioson’s case, she figured that since they are all working professionals, her safety won’t be compromised.  Romero also attributes Wunder’s acceptance in the Philippine market to the Filipino trait of being sociable. “Wunder in the Philippines grew enormously since its launch in February 2016 because Filipinos are inherently trusting and caring individuals who are willing to share what they have – for drivers, that empty seat in the car and for passengers, a few pesos for gas or toll,” he said. “The one thing they don’t want to share is the solitary feeling of standing in line waiting to get inside a cramped, poorly ventilated public utility vehicle and be stuck in traffic for hours,” he added. Romero also pointed out that Wunder users are also organizing themselves and building micro-communities. Sioson’s group, Wunder East, is one of the most active ones; the group has even formed personal bonds with each other, organizing meetups and movie nights. Advocacy While Wunder users come from different backgrounds – from lawyers to accountants to BPO professionals – they have one thing in common: they’re fed up with the daily stress of traveling around Metro Manila. Sioson believes it’s this – plus their initiative of creating a community of like-minded individuals – that got Wunder members from the eastern part of Metro Manila to organize themselves. The trips cost a little more than usual – the P60 fare, Sioson admits, is more expensive than a UV Express ride – but she gets point-to-point service and the assurance of a ride, minus the long lines and uncertainty of getting a seat in time to get to work. “This is an advocacy for us. It came to a point where we were just so frustrated at the daily hassle of commuting,” she said. For her, it began simply as a way to add structure to the unpredictability of travel in the metro. But by organizing the group, she also got to help other frustrated commuters. “It’s a big help, especially to the mothers who used to get home at 9 pm or 10 pm and find their children already asleep. Now, they get to play with them, have dinner with their families, because they can get home at 6 pm,” she said. While better transportation options are the ultimate solution to the metro’s transport woes, citizens are making do with what they have, creating their own solutions to benefit more people – and building their own communities along the way. – Rappler.com Change the Philippines through your talent in tech. Click here to find an IT and Software job on the Rappler x Kalibrr Job Board."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/141571-uber-china-merge-local-rival-didi-bloomberg/","title":"Ride-share battle ends with Didi buying Uber China operations","date":"Aug 1, 2016 2:21 PM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) As part of the merger, Didi Chuxing will also take a stake in Uber","body":" BEIJING, China (3rd UPDATE) – Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing will take over the China operations of its US rival Uber, it said Monday, August 1, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. In exchange for the Uber China assets, Uber and its Chinese partners will receive shares equivalent to 20% of Didi Chuxing, a statement said. The combined Chinese firm will be valued at $35 billion, Bloomberg News reported. Since Uber launched its China operations little more than two years ago both companies have spent billions of dollars on subsidies for drivers and passengers in China, as well as trading vitriolic accusations, as they fought for dominance in the potentially lucrative market. But now the companies’ founders will swap public acrimony for seats on each other’s boards, with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick joining Didi’s board of directors, and Didi’s founder Cheng Wei getting a seat at Uber’s top table. In the Didi statement Cheng said the two firms “have learned a great deal from each other over the past two years in China’s burgeoning new economy.” Earlier this year Uber said it lost $1 billion annually in China, and Didi was thought to be dropping similar amounts of money. A lengthy post on Kalanick’s verified Facebook page Monday called Uber’s battle in China a “big, bold idea” and “one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had as an entrepreneur.” “Most people thought we were naive, crazy – or both” because the firm was “a young American business entering a country where most US internet companies had failed to crack the code,” he said. His at times elegiac farewell praised the company’s China team as “the smartest and most entrepreneurial sons and daughters of China” who were “nobly serving” China’s cities. But he went on: “As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as much as following your heart.” A sustainable business was “only possible with profitability,” he said, and the merger would free up “substantial resources,” while Uber will become Didi’s largest shareholder. He signed off the post “with much UberChina love.” The deal comes days after Chinese authorities announced new rules governing ride-sharing, making clear for the first time that they may operate legally in the country. The new rules will also forbid ride-sharing platforms from operating below cost, possibly restricting their scope to offer subsidies. Rides in major cities with Uber and Didi have often cost significantly less than regular cab fares due to the payments, and many drivers work for both companies at the same time. One user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service lamented the merger, saying: “This is meant to tell us that ride-sharing is now legal and we are going to raise the price.” One Didi driver was reluctant to believe the merger Monday. “If it is true, the allowance offered by Didi or Uber now will certainly decrease.” the man, surnamed Su, told AFP. Monopoly murmurs Didi, which claims almost 90% of the China ride-hailing market, said last month that it had recently raised $7.3 billion – $1 billion of which came from Apple – in one of the world’s largest private equity financing rounds. As part of the merger, Didi Chuxing will also take a stake in Uber, with reports saying it will invest $1 billion, valuing the US firm at $68 billion. Uber has become one of the world’s most valuable startups as it has expanded to more than 50 countries. But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Its China business partners include internet search giant Baidu and state-owned Citic Securities. Didi’s backers include e-commerce titans Alibaba and Tencent, along with China Life, the country’s biggest life insurer. Analysts noted that the deal would create a massive single company with near-monopoly power in China. Commentaters on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform called for an anti-trust investigation into the tie-up. “Come and suck the Chinese people’s blood together!” wrote one user. Others saw it as a capitulation by Uber in the face of an overwhelming local rival. “Uber knows when to fold them in China, after being engaged in an incredibly expensive ride war with Didi there,” technology journalist Kara Swisher wrote on her recode.net site. “Cutting the massive losses in China and turning it into a more solid investment” would clear the way for an expected Uber public stock offering next year, she added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/139143-carpooling-services-metro-manila/","title":"Getting around Manila through tech-based carpooling","date":"Jul 10, 2016 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Services like Wunder and uberPOOL indicate that Filipinos are more open to sharing their rides even with complete strangers to get around Manila's congested roads","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In the daytime, Metro Manila is home to around 20 million people. At any given time, thousands are on the move: heading to the office, going home, running from one meeting to another. All this movement is a burden to a transport system that’s woefully inadequate to deal with the demand. The trains are either bursting at the seams or suffering technical glitches; buses are full to brimming. Private cars with a passenger or two crawl along EDSA, while passengers try to hail taxis sometimes pressured to pay additional tips. In the last couple of years, the Philippines has seen the entry of app-based ride-hailing services that provide passengers with transport options at the touch of a button. Uber and Grab are the best-known names in the industry, providing passengers with their own cars simply by using their smartphones. But critics say these services are exacerbating the traffic problem. They point out that enterprising businessmen buy more vehicles and hire drivers for Uber and Grab, essentially increasing the number of vehicles crowding an already congested road network. Transport officials have underscored their focus in proposing solutions: move more people, not cars. Last year, the Metropolitan Manila Development Agency launched an app to encourage Facebook friends to start carpooling. There have also been suggestions to allot a high-occupancy lane along EDSA exclusively for cars with 3 or more passengers. (READ: Taming Manila traffic: Hits and misses of 2015) Last month, Uber followed suit with the launch of its newest ride-sharing service, uberPOOL. The company said this aims to put more people into fewer cars, coordinating the logistics of a traditional carpool setup using technology. The new service promises a fixed fare that’s estimated to be 25% cheaper than usual UberX fares. In exchange for cheaper fares, passengers have to share the ride with others, and they should expect longer travel time as the vehicle makes several detours to pick up or drop off other riders. As with Uber’s initial launch in Manila two years ago, the concept of uberPOOL carried with it a degree of uncertainty, said Uber Manila’s general manager Laurence Cua. But, he added, Filipinos’ quick adoption to uberPOOL showed that they’re becoming more open to trying out new technology solutions. “I think what we’re learning is that people in the Philippines are very tech-savvy, they’re very progressive, very open-minded about embracing new concepts. And with technology, something like carpooling becomes safer and more convenient because you don’t have to match or pre-plot…With uberPOOL, we knew that we could solve those problems efficiently with a tap of a button,” Cua said. Carpooling with tech But before uberPOOL was launched, another carpooling app had already entered the Philippine market. European carpooling app Wunder launched earlier this year, with the goal of connecting riders with others who have empty seats in their car. Unlike Uber and Grab, trips on Wunder are limited, so that passengers only chip in for the cost of gas as drivers travel to or from their destination. It is not meant to be a profit-making business. The launch of carpooling apps in the Philippines may indicate that Filipinos are not hesitant to take to the ride-sharing concept. (READ: Uberpool in Manila: Adjusting to the metro’s unpredictable traffic) “Carpooling in general is not a very new concept, especially for the Philippines. We’re a very communal people, we’re very friendly. And we don’t mind sharing things, mabait tayo eh…People are just more socially dynamic,” Cua said, noting the positive feedback two weeks since the launch of uberPOOL. But the traditional carpooling setup, where groups of people discuss what time to leave and where to meet up, is a process that’s been made easier by technology. Instead of having to pre-determine carpool trips beforehand, these technology-based apps allow on-demand ride-sharing services. Cutting cars on the road Uber touts its carpool service as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option: riders cut their transportation costs, while helping cut down on greenhouse gases with fewer cars on the road. “If you keep doing that again and again, with thousands and hundreds of thousands of people, then you’re now able to make scalable and high-impact changes on how people move around,” he said. But despite this new thrust in the company’s goals, Cua said drivers who want to partner with Uber should not be concerned that the company will also cut down on driver applications. He pointed out that demand for decent transportation in Metro Manila remains high. “As long as there are people who are looking for a ride to get around, then there’s gonna be demand for something like Uber. And so that should not be a concern…We do want to see more drivers use Uber, and the main reason for that is there are people looking for their services,” he said. The carpooling service also aims to discourage people from buying more cars, which end up being underutilized in parking lots anyway, Cua added. But what about criticism that Uber is actually encouraging people to buy more cars? Cua pointed out that car ownership has been steadily growing over the last 10 years, buoyed by more purchasing power for consumers and riding on a growing economy. This, Cua said, happened even before Uber entered the Philippine market. When Uber entered the scene, it became an avenue for drivers to make extra income to help pay for the vehicle that they would have bought anyway, Cua said. He also said that the company is hoping to discuss with government the current limitations on the cars allowed on Uber. Currently, only cars that are 3 years old or newer are allowed on Uber, but Cua said they’re eyeing to relax this as long as the vehicle is still in good shape. By doing this, drivers won’t feel compelled to get a new vehicle, he added. “Rather than having it sit in a parking lot or forcing people to buy new cars, let’s just use what’s out there and put them on UberPOOL, or even just UberX, or both. Now the concept of car-sharing can tap into more underutilized assets,” he said. Complementary government solutions With a new set of officials handling the Metro Manila traffic situation, Cua hopes that ride-sharing can be more widely adopted by Filipinos and readily supported by the new administration. He also said that Internet connectivity should be improved and made more reliable, so that transport solutions that rely on technology would be more efficient. Improving public transportation systems should remain a top priority, he added. In developed countries with efficient public transport, Uber plays a role in addressing the last-mile problem, or ferrying riders from the bus or train station to their final destination. “Here in Manila we know it’s already happening on some level, and as infrastructure gets better, Uber can also play a complementary role to help out those people who use those modes of transport,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/138787-uberpool-manila-tweak-system-carpool-challenges/","title":"Uberpool in Manila: Adjusting to the metro’s unpredictable traffic","date":"Jul 6, 2016 11:12 AM PHT","snippet":"Two weeks since its launch, Uber Philippines cites positive feedback from riders, but says tweaking the system to make it responsive to Manila traffic is an ongoing challenge","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Two weeks since its soft launch in Manila, Uber’s newest ride-sharing service has been enticing riders with the promise of cheaper fares – but it also has to contend with the challenges of an efficient and reliable carpooling service in a city with the “worst traffic in the world.”  On June 15, the transportation network company launched uberPOOL, wherein passengers heading the same direction can share a vehicle in exchange for fares that are about 25% cheaper than the Uber X service. Uber touts its new service as its contribution to the Philippine capital region’s horrendous traffic jams, as more passengers sharing vehicles means cutting the number of cars on the road, according to Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua. Two weeks since it began rolling out to Manila’s riders, Cua said the response so far has been generally positive, even generating interesting stories from passengers who unexpectedly enjoyed the experience of meeting new people through carpooling. “They find the experience to be somewhat fun…People have been sharing stories where they are matched with another passenger who is fun to talk to. There’s even one story where a passenger rode with a former high school classmate, and they got to reconnect,” Cua said. Any apprehensions about Filipinos not taking to the concept of sharing rides with strangers was eased out by the response to the new service, he added. “What’s happened in the last two weeks is we’ve seen people are very comfortable with that, and the great thing there is the adoption has actually exceeded our expectations. We expect this to keep growing. We do think a lot of people are seeing the value of being able to share a car and save money,” he said. “I think, more importantly, people are getting behind the idea of helping save Metro Manila from more traffic. So it’s a nice social benefit. I think that people feel that they’re also helping in their own little way, they’re trying to get more cars off the road,” he added. Longer travel time But it’s not all smooth sailing for Uber’s riders and drivers. While passengers get cheaper fares, the tradeoff is longer traveling time, as they wait for the driver to pick up new carpooling passengers or take longer detours to drop off co-passengers. (READ: UberPOOL in PH: How Uber’s carpool feature works) In theory, the formula strives to be efficient: Rider A books a ride, Rider B is picked up along the way, and along the route Rider C joins the carpool, while the first two passengers get dropped off at their destinations. The idea is to create a continuous stream of passengers being picked up and dropped off – so that more people get to move around the metro using only one vehicle. The problem, however, is that while the system matches riders coming from the same geographical location and headed the same way, the travel time builds up significantly because of Manila’s paralyzing traffic jams. For instance, an uberPOOL ride from Pasay City to Pasig City during the evening rush hour took over 2 hours, with a detour to Bonifacio Global City to drop off a co-passenger. The ride cost P50 less than usual, but added significant minutes in travel time due to the heavy traffic buildup in the area. Several riders have also expressed the same sentiment, posting messages on Uber’s Facebook page about their riding experience. Several commented that the service would be more suitable for those who aren’t in a hurry or those who don’t mind adding half an hour or more to their trips. Others were lucky: they requested an uberPOOL ride, but didn’t get matched with other passengers. They managed to book their own private vehicle, while still being charged the cheaper fare. Some Uber drivers also took to social media to complain about the system. One Vincent Bravo said on Facebook that Uber drivers are earning less on uberPOOL because of the hours they spend on the road stuck in traffic or making additional detours. Cua said that the uberPOOL model aims to have drivers earning the same amount they would have earned driving an UberX car, or even more. “That’s the model we’re going after. That’s the part where we are tweaking the system,” he said. Improving the system While Cua acknowledged that the company has received such complaints, he added that these were a “small minority.” “We’re very sensitive to feedback, we are continuously reviewing the data that we’re getting and tweaking the system in small and big ways to make sure it works even better moving forward,” he said. He added that part of their solution is to provide more information and educate the drivers on how the system works. Amid some social media sentiments that users would skip uberPOOL because of the longer travel time, Cua said that the soft launch stage allows the company to gather more data and comments to improve the system. “In order for uberPOOL to really work, we need a lot of users…As more people use it, it’s easier from a technical standpoint and for Uber as a platform in technology to match these people,” he said. Adapting the carpooling system to Metro Manila’s particular traffic situation has a “level of complexity that is very hard to describe,” Cua admitted, but added that traffic is among the many variables they are considering in tweaking the system and improve user experience. “Our traffic situation is slightly more unpredictable, and that does create sometimes a less than optimal experience, which is what we’re focused on, making it better,” he said. “Our traffic is the worst in the world, and how do you adjust around that is something that requires a bit more local attention. When there are changes in the road blocking system or when new routes are rerouted, we should be aware of these things and react accordingly,” he added. The challenge for Uber is to get riders to keep trying out the carpooling service and help make the system matching process better – but at the same time, to get those tweaks rolling out as soon as possible to ensure that riders won’t be too frustrated that they’ll skip out on choosing to carpool altogether. “Yes, you are getting a discount in exchange for getting a car off the road and at the same time a short detour, but we want to make sure that it’s not too inconvenient, otherwise we know you will not use it again,” Cua said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/137429-paymaya-expands-services-asean/","title":"PayMaya Philippines to tap ASEAN market","date":"Jun 24, 2016 11:56 AM PHT","snippet":"PayMaya Philippines plans to ink about 10 local and foreign partnerships this year","body":" MANILA, Philippines – PayMaya Philippines Incorporated – the digital financial services unit of PLDT Incorporated and Smart Communications Incorporated – is expanding its reach to two member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “We’ll start initially with ASEAN then target countries even outside Asia,” PayMaya Philippines President and CEO Orlando Vea told reporters on the sidelines of #NowNation campaign launch in Makati City.

The country’s turnaround – from being the perennial Sick Man of Asia to the fastest growing economy in the region – is President Benigno Aquino III’s claim to fame, though economists also point to the huge contribution of overseas Filipino workers to this end. (READ: Beyond the numbers: How Aquino fueled the economy) Some industries benefited from the new business climate more than others. Rappler talked to economists to assess the businesses that thrived and those that performed poorly under the Aquino administration, based on their gross domestic product (GDP) contribution from 2011 to 2015: Thrived: Finance and Real Estate (8%)   For Ronilo Balbieran, a research associate from the Research, Education, and Institutional Development (REID) Foundation, the construction, finance, and real estate sectors grew together as “one ecosystem,” as their activities signal each other’s potentials. “Moreover, the low interest rate regime – brought about by huge private sector savings coupled with low inflation environment – has actually encouraged more real estate development, whether it is residential, commercial, or retail,” Balbieran added. This is validated by the strong growth of big banks Metrobank, Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), and BDO Unibank, as well as real estate giants Ayala Land, SM Development Corporation, Robinsons Land, Megaworld, and Vista Land. The growth of the business outsource processing (BPO) sector has also fueled stronger growth in commercial real estate, Balbieran said. BPI research officer Nicholas Antonio Mapa said real estate has been booming because of the easing credit cycle, and sustained overseas Filipino workers remittance flows. This is evident in the higher income reported by Ayala Land, DMCI, and even SM. Thrived: Construction (7.5%) During the first few years of the Aquino administration, public construction had a very slow start, due to Daang Matuwid (Straight Path) growing pains – the new government underspent on infrastructure as it reviewed some unimplemented but funded projects of its predecessor. This, however, was compensated by private construction.  Over the course of 6 years, it has been a waiting game for the public and private sectors to grow together. “If we deduct the negative growth of construction in 2011, average growth of construction industry between 2012 and 2015 is at the 10% range,” Balbieran said. The industry’s growth can be seen in the healthy and growing competition among construction companies like DMCI, Megawide, and Datem, as well as property developers like San Miguel Corporation, Ayala Corporation, and Metro Pacific Investments Corporation. Thrived: Manufacturing (7%) The roller-coaster exchange rate, leaning towards more depreciation, increased the purchasing power multiplier of the dollar inflows from OFW remittances, BPOs, and tourism, Balbieran said. “The lower price of oil and improvement of roads throughout the 6 years have helped bring down the cost of logistics, and thus managed the low inflation across manufactured products,” he added. Thrived: Transportation, communications, storage (6.6%)  Lower oil prices and the higher wage of workers under Aquino’s watch helped the transportation, communications, and storage (TCS) industries grow substantially. “The air transport has really taken off since 2014 with double-digit growth rates (18% and 15%), and it seems it is there to stay as long as oil price is low. The local demand for tourism – greatly increasing by a massive average of 15% per year in the last 6 years – has really helped the TCS sector, particularly air travel, grow,” Balbieran said. Performed poorly: Agriculture (1.7%)   Due to lack of connectivity and inadequate farm-to-market roads, the agriculture sector performed poorly under Aquino’s watch, the REID research associate said.  He added insufficient irrigation facilities, most especially during the last two years of El Niño, had also led to a decline in the sector’s performance. (READ: How can the Philippines have a booming agriculture sector?) Performed poorly: Electricity, gas, and water (4%)  Lack of supply and strict regulations dragged the sector’s performance, according to some economists.  “Some companies in regulated industries did not do well,” said COL Financial Group vice president April Lynne Lee-Tan said. “For example, Manila Water Company and Maynilad did not do well because both had issues in raising their tariffs. Metro Pacific also did not do well,” she added. Performed well: Transport (8.3%)  In the past 6 years, the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines, Incorporated, has reported historical highs in sales, just in time for the boom of ride-sharing apps. “Every quarter, Toyota, Mistubishi, Honda, and others beat their previous records. Motorcycle sales are also through the roof as we scramble to find enough parking spaces and spend inordinate amounts of hours stuck in traffic,” BPI’s Mapa said in an e-mail correspondence. For REID’s Balbieran, lower oil prices, which translated into cheaper airfare and land travel, led to increased transport demand. What about jobs? “One knock against Aquino has been that the recent growth trend has not translated into a strong job creation trend,” Mapa said. A mismatch in job skills and lack of infrastructure are some of the problems incoming president Rodrigo Duterte has to address, to sustain economic growth. Moving forward, Mapa and Balbieran said the Philippines will need to graduate to a more balanced growth model. There is no basis to rely solely on the services sector, the economists said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/136477-uber-carpool-move-people-fewer-cars/","title":"Uber’s carpool service aims to move more people in fewer cars","date":"Jun 15, 2016 12:41 PM PHT","snippet":"uberPOOL aims to provide passengers with cheaper fares while using fewer cars – its contribution to help ease Metro Manila's traffic woes","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Transport network company Uber on Wednesday, June 15, launched its newest carpooling service that aims to provide on-demand rides to its passengers, while using fewer cars in a bid to avoid worsening the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  The newest uberPOOL service allows passengers to share their rides with up to 3 other people heading to the same destination, and pay fares that are typically 25% cheaper than the company’s cheapest service, UberX.  Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said riders only need to select the uberPOOL option on the app, select their destination, and choose how many people they want to share the ride with. The system then calculates a route to pick up and drop off the passengers.   Because it is a ride-sharing service instead of a point-to-point service, it may take a bit longer for passengers to get to their destination. But Cua said that the benefits outweigh a few minutes of waiting. (READ: UberPOOL in PH: How Uber’s carpool feature works)  “It does change a little bit of behavior, but we do think overall, in the bigger scheme of things, that additional 5 to 10 minutes is worth the effort. It’s not too big of an inconvenience, and it will help in taking cars off the road,” Cua said in an interview during the service’s launch at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) compound in Quezon City. Cua said the latest service is the company’s solution to Metro Manila’s traffic woes, which cost the Philippines P2.4 billion a day in productivity losses. Experts have also pointed to the boom of car sales as one of the causes behind the gridlock in the metro.  Currently, 40 cities around the world have the uberPOOL service. Since it was first launched in 2014, Uber said more than 100 million rides have been taken using the service.  Aside from providing cheaper fares for passengers, Cua said the new service would also benefit drivers and the environment. Since passengers share rides, drivers would have less idle time waiting for passengers. Fewer cars would also be needed on the roads – which, in turn, would cut harmful carbon dioxide emissions. Based on its estimates, Uber said that its carpooling service has saved about 1.8 million gallons of gas and 16,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions in the first 4 months of 2016 alone. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez also expressed his support for uberPOOL, noting its contribution to helping ease congestion in Metro Manila. He also clarified that there will be no new franchises issued for the new carpooling service. “UberPOOL will use UberX cars. This is not a new franchise. All those that were authorized already will be using the same authority, so no authority, no new license will be issued,” Ginez said. Meanwhile, Cua assured passengers that sharing their rides with others won’t compromise their safety. He said that all Uber users are validated because they are required to provide their credit card information and mobile number, among others, before using the ride-hailing service.  “Drivers on Uber cannot just pick passengers off the street. When you register, you have to have a credit card, mobile number, email. So everything is tracked. And besides that, we have a support system in the backend. If a passenger has a complaint, they can email and we respond very quickly,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/136375-paymaya-uber-uncarded-commuters/","title":"‘Uncarded’ commuters can now use PayMaya for Uber rides","date":"Jun 14, 2016 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"'Today, PayMaya has once again changed the game for digital payments by pioneering a unique partnership with Uber,' PayMaya Philippines president and CEO Orlando Vea says","body":" MANILA, Philippines – PayMaya Philippines, the digital financial services unit of PLDT Incorporated and Smart Communications Incorporated, has partnered with Uber Technologies Incorporated to give “uncarded” commuters a cashless payment option for their Uber rides.

Here's how it works","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Manila’s traffic situation has commuters frustrated and often spending hours on the road daily. Could options from popular ride-sharing apps like Uber offer a solution?  On June 15, Uber is uberPOOL – a ride sharing feature that they’ve launched in other countries and they say has been proven to cut down on the number of cars on the road. During a press conference on Wednesday, June 8, Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua and Uber policy research analyst Amy Smith told the media about the company’s upcoming service. If you’ll be using the feature, here are some things you should know about uberPOOL. What it is: You’ll be able to share your ride and fare with one to 3 other people who are headed in the same direction. Riders who choose to use the feature should expect to either pick someone up on the way to their destination or for someone to be in the car that picks them up. Uber will calculate a route so that the person you pick up is nearby and the detour won’t take more than a few minutes, but riders who use the service should still expect the drive to take a bit longer than usual. Like the other options, uberPOOL will show up as an option on the app. Users must enter their destination before requesting a ride, because the price of the ride is given upfront. You can also choose to share your ride with only one to two people or up to 4 people. Pricing Uber says that uberPOOL costs 25% less than a regular uberX, making that the cheapest feature they offer. As soon as you enter your destination and choose how many people you want to share a ride with, the fare will be calculated. Fares per trip are set at 25% less than uberX rides because the cost is split between riders. It’s possible for a driver to pick up a passenger using uberPOOL, pick another one up in the middle of the drive, drop off the first passenger, then pick someone else up, and so on.  Uber has another ride sharing feature called uberHOP, where riders can request a ride, walk to a designated pick-up point, and share the ride with 5 other people. uberHOP is different because it’s limited – it’s only available at certain times in Makati, Bonifacio Global City, and the Ortigas area. uberHOP also takes in up to 6 passengers, compared to uberPOOL’s maximum of 4. Both features will be available when uberPOOL launches 6 am on June 15 in Manila, though pool won’t be available in Cebu yet. Other commute options in Manila At the conference, Laurence was asked about the difference between uberPOOL and the UV Express, popularly known as the “FX,” a public transport service that uses Tamaraw FX cars that can seat at least 5 passengers. In response, he said that the difference is in the waiting time: “You don’t have to wait in a particular stop. There is no planning ahead, it just happens… It doesn’t require people to change their behavior. If you’re used to getting a door-to-door experience from the office to your house or from the mall to your office, then it’s gonna be the same thing.” Uber’s taxi app competitor in the Philippines, Grab, hasn’t launched their carpool feature, GrabHitch, in the country yet.

Uber halted the use of UberPOP in France last July amid a storm of opposition to the service from taxi drivers. UberPOP was subsequently banned in France. In the court case that ended Thursday, the company was charged with “the illegal organization of a system that puts clients in contact with providers of road transport for payment.” UberPOP’s chief executive in France, Thibaud Simphal, and the company’s director general in Western Europe at the time the charges were brought, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, were fined 30,000 euros and 20,000 euros respectively. Half of those sums were also suspended. Lawyers for San Francisco-based Uber said the company would appeal “immediately.” (READ: EU warns against curbing companies such as Uber) Uber was also accused of producing advertisements wrongly portraying the service as fully legal.

Online success stories like ride-sharing app Uber and Airbnb have caused major disruptions in Europe, with taxi drivers and hotel owners furious at the inroads made by the main actors of the sharing economy. In response, local governments and national regulators have moved to limit access to the websites, and in some cases, outright banning them. Uber has filed complaints with the EU against France, Germany, and Spain to hit back, arguing that the national or city policies are in violation of European law. The EU is currently deliberating a response to those complaints as well as another lodged by an individual in Berlin who is unhappy with a local law against websites like Airbnb. The EU’s Bienkowska warned against government overreach as she unveiled the European Commission’s recommendations on how the EU’s 28 member states should better regulate the sharing economy. “Absolute bans of an activity should only be a measure of last resort,” said the commission’s guidelines. While the advice from the EU executive is non-binding, it does offer an indication on how the commission will respond to the complaints by Uber. “We invite member states to review their regulation in the light of this guidance and stand ready to support them in this process,” Bienkowska said. In one idea, the EU encouraged regulators to differentiate “between individuals providing services on an occasional basis and providers acting in a professional capacity.” It also recommended that sharing economy actors “fully cooperate” with national tax authorities amid accusations that the services facilitate tax evasion. Uber welcomed the commission’s proposals. “The European Commission has made it clear that EU laws protect collaborative economy services against undue restrictions,” said Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman. “Member States should review regulations that undermine the development of such services,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/135092-uber-saudi-investment-fund/","title":"Uber raises $3.5B from Saudi investment fund","date":"Jun 2, 2016 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"The investment boosts Uber's cash holdings to more than $11 billion, giving its global expansion plans a lift","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber announced Wednesday, June 1, that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia has pumped $3.5 billion into the ride-sharing giant, helping fuel its global expansion plans. Terms of the investment give what was already one of the largest venture-funded startups a valuation, or implied value, of $62.5 billion, according to the company. The deal comes as Saudi Arabia strives to diversify its economy away from reliance on oil production to include more entrepreneurship, open markets, and productivity. The new funding also helps Uber’s global expansion, including in the Middle East and North Africa, which the company sees as among its fastest-growing regions. In addition to the investment, which will boost Uber’s cash holdings to more than $11 billion, the head of the Saudi fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, is joining the Uber board. “We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,” Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a statement. “Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.” Rumayyan said in a statement that the fund “is excited to have completed this important strategic investment with Uber, an extraordinary company with an inspiring mission.” He added that the plan fits with the kingdom’s Vision 2030, the blueprint for diversifying its economy away from oil. According to Uber, the company is committed to investing $250 million in the region, which includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Qatar, and Morocco. In Saudi Arabia, around 80% of Uber’s riders are women, the company said, explaining that the service can help improve mobility for women, who cannot drive in the country and typically avoid public taxis. Egypt tightens reins Egypt in March said it will regulate ride-hailing services Uber and Careem after they sparked protests by taxi drivers in Cairo over allegations the smartphone apps bypass regulations. Cab drivers contend that not only are they losing clients to Uber and Careem, but the two services use vehicles that are unregistered for ferrying commuters. Egypt’s Cabinet said the authorities would take steps to regulate the two ride-hailing services. Uber and Careem drivers would “have to pay taxes” and their apps would need to establish a “suitable framework for traditional taxi drivers to join them,” the Cabinet maintained. San Francisco-based Uber has expanded to hundreds of cities worldwide, despite complaints from established taxi operators and regulators. Eyes on oil Saudi Arabia’s push to diversify away from oil comes amid a significant global oversupply. OPEC, which pumps about a 3rd of the world’s crude, has contributed to the chronic problem, led by kingpin Saudi Arabia. Some OPEC ministers expressed hope that the oil market would improve in the second half of the year after prices took a beating from abundant supplies as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prepared to open its biannual meeting Thursday, June 2, in Vienna. However most analysts do not expect the 13-nation cartel will announce any measure to reduce output, especially since prices have rebounded nearly 90% from February lows. – Sophie Estienne, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/133657-uber-self-driving-car-test/","title":"Uber unveils testing of self-driving car","date":"May 20, 2016 12:26 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber says it is 'still in the early days of our self-driving efforts,' and is 'focused on getting the technology right and ensuring it's safe for everyone on the road – pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers'","body":" WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Uber unveiled its first self-driving car on Thursday, May 19, announcing it had begun testing an autonomous vehicle on the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “If you’re driving around Pittsburgh in the coming weeks you might see a strange sight: a car that looks like it should be driven by a superhero,” said a statement from the ride-sharing giant. “But this is no movie prop – it’s a test car from Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center (ATC) in Pittsburgh.” Uber said it was “still in the early days of our self-driving efforts,” and was “focused on getting the technology right and ensuring it’s safe for everyone on the road – pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers.” While Uber has said little up to now about its plans in the sector, the California group last month was among the founding members of an industry group called the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets which also includes Alphabet unit Google, Ford, Volvo and Lyft. Uber will be using a hybrid Ford Fusion that will gather mapping data as it tests the autonomous driving capabilities. The car will have multiple sensors including radars, laser scanners, and high resolution cameras to map details of the environment. Uber said that even when the vehicle is in autonomous mode, “a trained driver will be in the driver’s seat monitoring operations.” Like others involved in autonomous driving research, Uber said this could avert accidents, save lives and reduce congestion. “Self-driving cars have the potential to save millions of lives and improve quality of life for people around the world,” the company statement said, adding that “94% of (road) accidents involve human error.” Uber has a research center in Pittsburgh and said it chose the city because it “is an ideal environment to develop and test our technology across a wide variety of road types, traffic patterns and weather conditions.” Alphabet earlier this month announced an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in a major expansion of its fleet of self-driving vehicles. An array of automobile makers including Audi, Ford, Mercedes, Lexus, Tesla and BMW are working on building self-driving capabilities into vehicles. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/133576-traveling-misunderstood-mindanao/","title":"Traveling to Rody Duterte’s misunderstood Mindanao","date":"May 19, 2016 9:28 PM PHT","snippet":"'I am looking forward to the time when hearing of places such as Kidapawan, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga, Sulu, or Mindanao will not elicit fear but fond, beautiful memories.'","body":" My affair with Mindanao, like my greatest ones in life, started with the written word – poetry, to be more accurate. Two women writers from Cebu encouraged me to join the 17th Iligan National Writers Workshop, which took place at MSU-IIT. Except for the afternoon visits to BookSale, the journey mostly happened across pages: the slaughtering of our pseudo-poems and short stories. Our batch did not have the tours around Iligan’s famous sights, unlike the previous batches and the ones after ours. Obsessed with rivers, I looked forward to seeing Tinago Falls, which remained in my personal list of rivers and falls. It has been 6 years, and in each year thereafter, I found myself aboard a ship or a plane to somewhere I have never been to. Last month, I found myself in Mindanao once again – this time around, in Zamboanga del Norte, to spend my birthday with Rizal’s ghost in the shrine under his name in Dapitan. On the last minute, I decided to hop on the bus and check out Misamis Occidental. (READ: 7 breathtaking Mindanao destinations you shouldn’t miss)  I shared a tricycle ride with three young travelers from Dipolog to a beach in Baliangao, a peninsula in the northernmost part of MisOcc.  A woman traveling solo elicits curiosity, concern, and amusement: where is my boyfriend or husband, why am I traveling alone, am I brokenhearted, are the most common questions.  With the 3 travelers, theirs were: What brought me to this part of the country, what did I do back home, and was the canyoneering in southern Cebu really good? They were rather amused at what I was doing: navigating my way around Mindanao alone.  When it was my turn to interrogate, I asked them, why not explore Mindanao first before exploring the Visayas or the rest of the country? But they answered me with another question: have I been to other parts of Mindanao aside from Dapitan and Misamis?    I mentioned some places, the ones that popped into my mind. Lake Sebu. Kidapawan. Dinagat. Dahican. Aliwagwag. They laughed and congratulated me for reaching these remote-sounding places that they themselves had not heard of.   And there I was thinking I had not reached the places I considered remote: traveling to Sitangkai, a small island off the coast of Tawi-tawi – has been my dream for years. Or the little islands in Zamboanga Sibuyan. Or Sulu. Uttering these names brought images of men, in their camouflage uniforms, holding M16s.   To say that Mindanao was all-peaceful for a traveler would be a blatant lie. In GenSan, five years ago, news on a bombed car circulated around. The rumor was a car owner, a businessman, did not pay his revolutionary tax. Fear, my seatmate, was always there: what if our bus would be bombed next? What if the hotel we were staying would be targeted. Don’t stay in the lobby long – was the advice of a kind local. In the crowded Dipolog Baywalk – the longest I have ever seen – there were military men stationed in some places. For security purposes, one said. Their presence can further the paranoia caused by too much news consumption. But I had to contextualize their presence: I traveled in this part of Mindanao two weeks before the national election. But a fear greater than this is the fear of not knowing Mindanao beyond the limited, constraints of a 500-word news or a 3-minute TV report. The indifference, disinterest of the three young locals from Dapitan towards their homeland is a byproduct of too much bad press, of too much news on carnage and terrorism: the very reason other countries put the Philippines in their travel advisory list; the very reason most Filipinos rarely venture to the biggest landmass in the country. Mindanao – the land of blood, sadness, and warfare. Mindanao – the land of drought, of farmers killed, of Abu Sayyaf, of guns, of poverty. This is not entirely wrong. But truth has many faces; a place can have several versions of the truth; some do not make it to headlines and social media. Some are quietly lived. As a traveler, these are the stories I am after – the quiet ones, to some extent the mundane ones, the everyday that is lived every day. Stories to contradict, to put a balance on, and perhaps rebel against, a place determined by the degree of sadness it’s endured and suffered, a place defined by the words penned in hard news and opinion pages.   Every time I encounter horrifying news on Mindanao, I think of Sachi, a good friend, who went back home for her mom’s birthday and their new house’s blessing. Home was Cateel, Davao Oriental – a place where coconut trees lost their crowns, where people lost their homes, some lost their lives to Typhooon Pablo. I think of the fish hunter who was so kind to harvest some lato (a kind of seaweed) for us. I think of the family who invited my friend and I for lunch of utan bisaya and grilled fish.  I think of the Amihan Boys who invited me to go fishing with them at three in the morning so we could prepare our own kinilaw that early morning. With the recent sad news about Kidapawan and Mt. Apo, I think of the 3 boar hunters we met on our way to Mt. Apo; I think of how fresh the water was on the highlands.  I think of Nanay Anita, who helped the indigenous people in Lake Sebu in any way she could. I think of Al-al and Ate Lydia who helped me in exploring Siargao. I think of Mark and the Langit family who made my trip to Dinagat Group of Islands ­­– the land of the Ecleos – memorable. I think of the ordinary people, who one way or another, changed my views of Mindanao. (READ: 14 stunning photos of Siargao, a surfer’s paradise) This place is not as fearsome as media makes it sound;  that one saddening, tragic event should not define a place. That there is a great danger in a single story told, consumed, shared, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us in her TED Talk. But then again, sadness is easier to remember.  A first in our history that the country’s president is someone from Mindanao, and whose much-frowned rude mouth resembles the many bugoys’ in the countryside. As a traveler, I felt a surge of hope for this place. Perhaps having Rodrigo Duterte as the head manager of the country, Filipinos and foreigner travelers will see a different Mindanao. Perhaps Mindanao will be then included in everyone’s dream destinations. (READ: 9 spectacular places to visit in Mindanao) I am looking forward to the time when hearing of places such as Kidapawan, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga, Sulu, or Mindanao will not elicit fear but fond, beautiful memories.

The new board, including former EU commission for competition Neelie Kroes, held its first meeting this week, Uber advisor David Plouffe said in a blog post. “We had vibrant discussions about every aspect of our business and the unique challenges and opportunities Uber faces around the world,” he said of the meeting. “As ridesharing continues to grow, we look forward to the Board’s candid advice and insights.” The board also includes former Peruvian prime minister Roberto Danino; Quality Council of India chairman Adil Zainulbhai; one-time Australian competition and consumer commission chairman Allan Fels; Gesner Oliveira, who served as president of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense; and Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud. The board roster also includes former US secretary of transportation Ray LaHood and Melody Barnes, who was assistant to the president and director of the White House Domestic Policy Council from 2009 to 2012. “For decades, transportation policy has played second fiddle to the likes of the economy, education, and healthcare,” Plouffe said. “Yet transportation is key to all these areas of public policy.” Uber’s business has boomed since it launched in San Francisco in 2011. But the smartphone app has faced stiff resistance from traditional taxi drivers the world over, as well as bans in some places over safety concerns and questions over legal issues, including taxes. Thousands of taxi drivers disrupted traffic across Portugal last month as they protested against Uber, which they accuse of illegally undercutting their business. Licensed taxi drivers, who must undergo hundreds of hours of training in some countries, often complain that Uber drivers do not pay for permits or taxes. Uber says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/131147-disruptive-concepts-dominate-2016/","title":"#ThinkPH: 3 disruptive concepts that will continue to dominate 2016","date":"Apr 28, 2016 11:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Innovation is the new currency for industries. What tech trends will give your business or organization the advantage this year? Here’s a primer","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The most successful ventures of our age were backed by a vision to make things better. Whether the goal was to offer safe and convenient travel, provide quality entertainment, or simply to give the public some peace of mind, these organizations used disruptive thinking to reimagine the world they wanted to live in. Traditionally, the quickest way for an organization to succeed is to go against the rules. Innovation, backed by technology, has always been a formula for success. But now, disruption has become the norm.   How do we make sense of a world where reinvention is the new rule? How can your organization or business to keep up with the ever-evolving wave of ideas? Let’s take a look at some of the trends and key disruptions that have positively reshaped the way we hustle today.  Big Data The ability to crunch massive amounts of user data allowed organizations to discover new insight into audience behavior. In turn, this enabled them to make smarter business predictions, create targeted content, and improve interaction with consumers or an audience. Netflix’s entertainment on-demand model provided users the liberty to watch what they wanted when they wanted. Netflix harvested and analyzed tons of user information to come up with the concept for their first original series, House of Cards. This award-winning online series became so popular that it scored an average rating of 9.1 with the audience.  In the local scene, Grace Poe topped the May 2013 senatorial elections by maximizing social media and crowdsourcing. Poe’s team harnessed the power of digital to quickly spread information about her campaign and to build a community of supporters.  Mobile First As mobile devices are became more advanced and more accessible, people started spending more time on their mobile devices. The app market exploded as users started using their mobile devices for everyday tasks. Uber envisioned convenient commutes for Filipinos through a ride-sharing application that doubled as a platform for drivers. The app-based service utilized cashless transactions and rating systems to give riders a more convenient and secure experience. Worldwide, Uber is host to 1 million riders per day as of 2015.  Platform Thinking 2015 was the year that organizations shifted from “pipe” to “platform” models. Businesses became successful not by providing products but by acting as a platform for consumers to create and share what they needed. Kickstarter became a platform for organizations or individuals to pitch passion projects. The audience became the judge, with the power to choose whether or not to invest in a project. The company became an avenue for both innovators and investors alike to collaborate. Today, Kickstarter has raised over $2 million for a host of 100,000 projects.  What will be the next big idea? The potential for disruption is limitless. Organizations now have free reign to come up with new, groundbreaking ideas. Aside from what has been listed above, here’s the forecast of trends and ideas that will continue to make it big:  Of course, an innovative idea requires a solid core in order to truly take off.

Car makers Ford and Volvo along with ride-sharing start-up Uber’s rival Lyft rounded out a roster of 5 founding members of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. Former US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Strickland was named as coalition counsel and spokesperson. “Self-driving vehicle technology will make America’s roadways safer and less congested,” Strickland said in a release. “The best path for this innovation is to have one clear set of federal standards, and the coalition will work with policymakers to find the right solutions that will facilitate the deployment of self-driving vehicles.” The US Department of Transportation has estimated that self-driving vehicles could help significantly reduce the severity and frequency of crashes, the vast majority of which are caused by human error in this country, according to the coalition. “Self driving cars can help save millions of lives as well as cut congestion in our cities,” an Uber spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry. “That’s an exciting future, and one Uber intends to be a part of.” Google, Lyft, and auto industry executives urged lawmakers last month to help create a regulatory fast lane to facilitate the introduction of self-driving cars. In testimony at a Senate hearing, representatives of General Motors and auto-equipment maker Delphi touted what they said were numerous safety and environmental benefits of autonomous vehicles. Chris Urmson, who heads the Google self-driving car project, said a consistent regulatory framework is important to deploying those technologies, and that conflicting rules in US states could limit innovation. “The leadership of the federal government is critically important given the growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars,” he said. In the past two years, 23 states have introduced legislation that affect self-driving cars, “all of which include different approaches and concepts,” he noted. Five states have passed such legislation, all with different rules, Urmson said. But the Senate panel should exercise caution, said Mary Cummings, who heads the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She said it’s not yet clear that self-driving cars can operate safely in all situations. “I am wholeheartedly in support of the research and development of self-driving cars,” she said. “But these systems will not be ready for fielding until we move away from superficial demonstrations to principled, evidenced-based tests and evaluations.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/127968-asian-aerospace-air-transport-traffic-manila/","title":"Manila in 5 minutes? Businessmen turn to air travel to beat traffic jams","date":"Apr 3, 2016 8:30 AM PHT","snippet":"As ground traffic in Manila continues to worsen, traveling by helicopter has become an option for businessmen who don't mind the price tag to buy extra time for their business trips","body":"MANILA, Philippines – It took me a little over two hours to travel from Pasig City to Pasay City, crawling through heavy traffic around the airport area, including a particularly bad 2-kilometer stretch that had me stuck in a car for more than half an hour. But up in the air, onboard one of Asian Aerospace’s helicopters, we managed to fly across 4 cities in Metro Manila in a little over 10 minutes. With the Philippine capital region continuing to suffer from worsening traffic, making road travel between cities an hours-long trip, the rich and the powerful are turning to air travel as their preferred mode of transport. It’s fast, efficient, and hassle-free, but the price tag certainly doesn’t come cheap: For P50,000 a month, businessmen and multinational CEOs can access Asian Aerospace’s fleet of private jets and helicopters through its recently-launched service AirTaxi.PH. The cost may be too much for the ordinary commuter, but Asian Aerospace’s executive vice president, Peter Angelo Rodriguez, considers it an affordable deal for company executives who don’t want to waste entire business days stuck in Manila’s notorious traffic jams. AirTaxi.PH, launched in January 2016, promises stress-free travel to members of its Emerald Class. To book a ride, members only need to call up Asian Aerospace and specify the time and location where they want to be picked up. Rodriguez said the company currently has helicopters and planes stationed in Manila, Clark, Cebu, and Boracay. The P50,000 monthly fee is consumable, and depends on the type of aircraft requested by clients. For instance, an inter-Metro Manila trip using a 6-seater twin-engine helicopter will cost P42,000. Meanwhile, clients who book one other helicopter used in Boracay trips, which costs P13,500 a ride, can have 3 flights per month. Since launching in January, Rodriguez said there has been an increase in demand and positive feedback from their existing base of clients who are turning to air travel to avoid hours-long traffic jams and get to to their business appointments faster. The service is practical for use in Manila, he said, because of the availability of helipads in business areas such as Ortigas, Makati, and Bonifacio Global City. “Everything inter-Metro Manila is 5 minutes. If you need to go to Greenhills, or Makati, it’s just 5 minutes. It’s like you cut your driving time [by half] already,” he said.  Aside from providing faster travel for their clients, Rodriguez pointed one offshoot of more businessmen going the route of air travel. Since VIPs often travel in packs or with convoys of bodyguards, providing air transport will mean that these VIPs’ vehicles will be off the road, and won’t be adding to ground traffic congestion. “That’s going to remove them [from the road] and already bring them to the location where they need to be,” he said. Aside from its practical use, Rodriguez said the service can also be used for leisure, medical needs, and disaster relief and response. In the popular island destination Boracay, for instance, the company offers a service called Green Heli that offers helicopter rides for tourists. Asian Aerospace also has air ambulances, equipped with medical teams, that can respond to their clients’ emergency. In last year’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the company was tapped as support medical assistance for dignitaries and state leaders visiting for the regional meet. It was also involved in relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), bringing in relief goods and evacuating people from the disaster site.   Future plans Asian Aerospace’s offering of a helicopter service for Manila came about two months since two popular app-based ride-sharing services, Uber and Grab, announced that they would be offering their own helicopter services as an addition to their lineup of car-hailing services.  Grab’s pre-booking chopper service, GrabHeli, offers passengers an aerial tour of Makati City, Bonifacio Global City, and Pasay City for P3,888 per person. Passengers will be given GrabCar promo codes to take them to or from PhilJets’ helipad at the Manila Domestic Airport. The service, however, was a promotional one. The Grab mobile app no longer displays an option to select the GrabHeli service. For Rodriguez, Grab’s rate was “very very cheap” for a helicopter ride. But he also pointed out that it only offered an aerial tour instead of a point-to-point service.  Asked if AirTaxi.PH would introduce a similar scheme for its clients, Rodriguez said that they are eyeing a ride-sharing setup once they have built up their customer base. For now, they are focusing on expanding the areas where their air fleet are stationed around the country. “What we want to do is we want to station helicopters and planes around the country. Right now we’ve got Luzon and Visayas covered, next target is Mindanao,” he said. “As soon as this becomes  a regular thing, and we have enough customers, one of our programs here is that you can split your flight due with other members. For example, there’s 4 of you flying at 9 am. You can just go together, and we’re just going to put you on one flight,” he said. “In the end, you’re not going to pay P42,000, you’re just going to pay P10,500 each. So it’s a nice way of contributing a little bit to what we can do to ease the traffic,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/127404-taksi-aplikasi-online-perusahaan-teknologi-finansial-izin/","title":"Setelah taksi aplikasi online, perusahaan teknologi finansial harus urus izin","date":"Mar 29, 2016 10:33 AM PHT","snippet":"OJK belajar dari kontroversi bisnis taksi.

Ini disampaikan Jokowi saat kontroversi terkait operasional ojek daring atau Go-Jek pada Desember lalu.  Solusi yang dijalankan pemerintah mengikuti pola di sejumlah kota di Eropa yang pernah alami protes dari sopir dan perusahaan taksi konvensional, termasuk di Moskow, Rusia.  Di negara-negara Eropa, hal penting yang wajib dipenuhi oleh bisnis berbagi berkendaraan adalah sopir yang memiliki lisensi surat izin mengemudi untuk angkutan umum, aturan keamanan dan keselamatan kendaraan, mengasuransikan penumpang, dan membayar pajak di level kota. Jokowi jelas tak akan membuat pernyataan publik bahwa regulasi yang ada harus diterobos. Ia menyuruh pembantunya di kabinet mencari solusi. Rupanya, duduk bersama itu baru serius dilakukan setelah pecah ricuh demo pengemudi taksi konvensional pada 22 Maret.  Ricuh karena diwarnai perusakan taksi, sweeping, dan aksi kekerasan yang disiarkan secara langsung dan mendunia melalui video dan foto yang beredar viral di media sosial. Pemerintah mengakui lambat dalam mengantisipasi beroperasinya angkutan umum berbasis aplikasi daring. Sebelum ricuh memalukan pada 22 Maret itu, debat pihak Uber adalah,mereka bukan perusahaan angkutan umum —dalam hal ini taksi— dan karena itu tidak perlu tunduk kepada UU No. 22 tahun 2009 tentang LLAJ. Sementara aturan mengenai aplikasi daringnya sendiri belum ada.  Ini pintu masuk Uber, Grab, dan Go-Jek. Ini juga yang terjadi di berbagai kota di dunia ketika konsep bisnis berbagi berkendaraan ini diperkenalkan. Aplikasi keuangan harus mendaftar Kasus di bisnis transportasi menginspirasi industri keuangan. Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) mengingatkan agar perusahaan teknologi bidang jasa keuangan untuk mendaftarkan diri sebelum dianggal ilegal, pada Senin, 28 Maret. Laman bisnis.com melaporkan bahwa Deputi Komisioner Pengawas Industri Keuangan Non Bank OJK, Dumoly F. Pardede, mengatakan setiap perusahaan teknologi informasi yang bergerak dalam bidang jasa keuangan (financial technology) harus tunduk kepada regulasi sektor usaha tersebut.   “Mereka harus minta izin ke OJK agar dapat diatur dan diawasi,” kata Dumoly. OJK menganggap perusahaan fintech tidak lagi dapat mengatakan dirinya sebagai perusahaan teknologi sehingga tak mau tunduk kepada aturan sektor jasa keuangan.   Dumoly mengatakan bahwa keputusan pemerintah meminta penyedia aplikasi transportasi seperti Uber dan Grab, yang harus mengurus izin sebagai perusahaan angkutan umum, mempertegas batasan bagi seluruh perusahaan teknologi.   “Ini kan membedakan perusahaan teknologi sebagai layanan pendukung terhadap kegiatan usaha tertentu menjadi jelas,” kata Dumoly. Mengubah UU adalah proses yang lama, berliku, dan mahal. Ini dilema dari upaya revisi sebuah aturan setingkat undang-undang. Menteri Perhubungan Ignasius Jonan bersikeras bahwa aturan tak perlu diubah. Uber, Grab, dan Go-Jek yang harus memenuhi aturan yang ada.   Jonan mengambil risiko dikecam sebagian publik yang sudah merasakan manfaat layanan baru itu yang menawarkan tarif murah, layanan cepat, kendaraan dan sopir wangi, dan dilengkapi aplikasi penunjuk lokasi.   Bandingkan dengan taksi konvensional, termasuk Blue Bird yang menuai keluhan karena banyak memperkerjakan sopir yang tidak menguasai jalan di ibu kota. Ini pengalaman pribadi saya beberapa kali naik taksi Blue Bird. Tarifnya juga lebih mahal.   Bedanya adalah soal rasa aman. Bagaimanapun, jika ada sesuatu hal saat berkendara dengan taksi konvensional yang punya reputasi baik selama ini, maka kita tahu ke mana harus mengeluh atau meminta pertanggungjawaban.   Benarkah tarif taksi berbasis aplikasi daring lebih murah? Pengalaman di semua kota, demikian pada awalnya, karena injeksi kapital dari investor yang mengincar kenaikan valuasi dari perusahaan aplikasi. Subsidi harga terjadi. Grab yang beroperasi di Indonesia sejak 2014, misalnya, mendapat suntikan dana dari investor senilai Rp 9,6 triliun tahun lalu.  Pada 21 Maret 2016, sehari sebelum demo taksi konvensional, terungkap bahwa Lippo Group selama ini menjadi investor awal Grab di Indonesia. Lippo Group adalah salah satu konglomerat yang memiliki ragam usaha dari properti, mall, rumah sakit, sampai grup media. Euforia di awal beoperasinya Uber di berbagai kota akan turun. Kompetisi makin berat, kemacetan kota kian parah. Di New York, ini memaksa Uber memangkas tarif dan memicu protes dari mitra pengendara yang menganggap Uber menjadikan mereka sebagai buruh. Di India, Uber menggugat pesaingnya, perusahaan lokal, Ola, dengan tuduhan memalsukan akun dengan memesan sampai 400.000, namun mendadak membatalkan pesanan. Ironisnya, Uber dianggap melakukan hal yang sama terhadap pesaingnya di AS, Lyft. Ibarat senjata makan tuan.   Jadi, jangan heran kalau tahun depan atau berikutnya, kita akan melihat kejadian yang sama di Indonesia. Perang bukan antara taksi konvesional melawan taksi aplikasi daring, melainkan di antara sesama pengelola taksi aplikasi. Oh ya, tentu saja saya tak menutup mata terhadap kemudahan tarif pajak dalam mendapatkan kendaraan untuk angkutan umum, termasuk taksi. Ini yang tak pernah dijelaskan kepada pengemudi taksi konvensional bahwa majikan mereka juga mendapatkan kemudahan.  Begitu juga dengan keluhan para sopir taksi konvensional bahwa penghasilan mereka kian turun, dengan beragam alasan termasuk penumpang beralih ke kendaraan berbasis aplikasi termasuk Go-Kek, sementara target pemasukan kian mencekik leher.   Perusahaan taksi konvensional seperti Blue Bird dan Express yang membukukan laba cukup tinggi sebagaimana tercatat di pasar modal, misalnya, sudah sepatutnya membekali sopir dengan aplikasi yang tak kalah canggih, sehingga bisa bersaing dengan taksi seperti Uber dan Grab. Saya tidak ingin banyak membahas kontroversi soal makhluk apakah Uber, Grab, dan sebangsanya. Silakan membaca tulisan Ardi Wirdamulia mengenai kontroversi Uber vs taksi konvensional di sini.  Mengenai bagaimana Uber memosisikan diri sebagai ekonomi berbagi (sharing-economy), padahal yang dikejar adalah lonjakan nilai perusahaan untuk kemudian dilepas di pasar modal pun sudah banyak dikritisi, salah satunya adalah tulisan ini. Pemerintah perlu lindungi keselamatan publik Kontroversi taksi konvensional versus taksi berbasis aplikasi daring yang disediakan perusahaan teknologi, serta respon pemerintah dan OJK, menegaskan posisi pemerintah sebagai pihak yang wajib menjaga keselamatan dan keamanan publik.   Ini juga debatnya bisa panjang, karena jelas pemerintah dan Organisasi Angkutan Darat  (Organda) selama ini tak bisa berbuat banyak terhadap kondisi transportasi publik seperti bus angkutan kota yang menyedihkan. Mobil tua dan sopir yang ugal-ugalan. Ini peluang bagi munculnya bisnis semacam Uber, Grab, dan Go-Jek, bahkan ojek konvensional. Pelajaran ini dipetik hikmahnya oleh OJK dan industri keuangan, yang notabene adalah industri kepercayaan. Ini yang mengingatkan saya kepada pengalaman Bank Mandiri Tbk saat melakukan inovasi dengan memperkenalkan e-Cash, sebuah aplikasi teknologi di bidang finansial.    Dalam wawancara dengan Budi G. Sadikin, sehari sebelum dia lengser dari kursi CEO Bank Mandiri Tbk, pada 21 Maret, saya mendapatkan informasi bahwa ide aplikasi ini muncul pada 2012. Budi menghadiri sebuah acara di Hongkong, yang menghadirkan co-founder dan CEO Twitter, Jack Dorsey.   Dorsey saat itu memperkenalkan aplikasi SquareReader, alat yang bisa membaca kartu kredit yang dicolokin ke telepon pintar. Budi heran, SquareReader itu yang punya bank, Chase Payment Tech. Pendanaan untuk membuat aplikasi itu dari fund milik JP MorganChase.   Budi lantas diminta menemui Mike Davis, CTO JPMorganChase, di San Francisco pada 2012. Davis sudah meninggal sekarang. Waktu itu dia bilang ke Budi mereka punya anggaran IT besar sekali, miliaran dolar, kebijakan dari James Dimon — chairman, president, dan CEO JPMorganChase. Tapi orang IT mereka kerja lamban sekali dan mahal.  Akhirnya Davis bicara ke Dimon, dia mau buat private equity, dengan modal US$ 100 juta, setiap proyek yang diberikan ke IT, dikasih juga ke startup IT. Yang dikerjakan startup terbukti 10 kali lebih murah, 10 kali lebih cepat, dan 10 kali lebih bagus.   Setelah ketemu Davis, Budi belajar ke Berkeley, lalu Bank Mandiri membuat startup pertama kali pada 2012 dengan Agung Adiprasetyo dari Kompas. Bank Mandiri memasukkan modal Rp 2 miliar, yang membuat aplikasi e-Cash untuk Bank Mandiri. Ini aplikasi seperti WhatsApp, untuk mengirimkan uang.   Tahun 2013 jadi, belum dapat ijzn, Bank Mandiri melobi, baru dapat izin dari BI dan OJK pada 2014. Mulai akhir 2014, Bank Mandiri menjadikan e-Cash sebagai platform untuk menyalurkan bantuan langsung tunainya Presiden Jokowi. Jadi, wajib ada izin. Sejak beroperasi 2014, sekarang nasabah e-Cash sudah mencapai 2,5 juta. Budi yang kini “pensiunan” Bank Mandiri berharap pada 2020, Bank Mandiri sudah punya 50 juta nasabah, karena sekarang lebih banyak orang memiliki ponsel ketimbang rekening bank. Bertahun-tahun nasabah Bank Mandiri baru mencapai 16 juta orang. Jadi, di mata Budi, bisnis perbankan ini sebagaimana bisnis taksi dengan adanya Uber, toko CD dengan adanya i-Tunes, toko buku dengan Amazon.com, harus inovatif, adaptif terhadap fenomena distruptive economy.   Ini kaitannya dengan Fourth Industrial Revolution. Bisa di-disintermediate. Sebagaimana perusahaan telco di-disintermediate Google, Facebook, dan lainnya.   “Daripada kita di-disintermediate orang lain, mendingan kita lakukan sekarang. Sekarang perusahaan startup pembuat aplikasi e-Cash yang kami dirikan, value-nya sudah menjadi Rp 100 miliar, dari modal Rp 2 miliar. Sudah ada yang mau membeli 30 persen dengan harga Rp 30 miliar,” kata  Budi.   Wawancara lengkapnya dapat dibaca di sini. Melihat peluang yang ada, Bank Mandiri ingin lebih sistematis. Awal 2016, mereka mendirikan Mandiri Capital Indonesia, dengan investasi US$ 50 juta dolar sebagai private equity. Perusahaan ini serius membuat aplikasi finansial. Kalau bikin aplikasi seperti e-Cash, dikasih ke orang IT, bisa lebih mahal dan lama, bisa tiga tahun. Ini dibuat 6 bulan, modal Rp 2 miliar. Saya membayangkan perusahaan seperti Blue Bird yang tergolong raksasa transportasi harusnya melakukan hal serupa. Investasi Rp 2 miliar tak ada artinya bagi Blue Bird, Express, bahkan beberapa pengelola taksi konvensional lain.   Duit itu bisa digunakan memodali startup membangun aplikasi yang tak kalah reliable.  Membiarkan sopir dan armada terlibat dalam demo yang berujung ricuh dan membahayakan nyawa sopir, penumpang, maupun masyarakat di sekitarnya, adalah posisi yang tidak terpuji sebagai perusahaan publik. Ketika gajah melawan gajah, pelanduk kejepit di tengah. Pertarungan antara taksi konvensional vs taksi aplikasi daring adalah pertarungan antara pemilik usaha bernilai triliunan rupiah. Yang terjepit adalah sopir yang kian sulit membawa pulang duit untuk keluarga di rumah. —Rappler.com BACA JUGA:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/126117-uhop-tnc-accredited-ltfrb/","title":"Ride-sharing shuttle service U-Hop gets LTFRB accreditation","date":"Mar 17, 2016 10:44 AM PHT","snippet":"The Filipino-developed service uses the same app-based booking system model of Uber and Grab, but U-Hop offers a shuttle service that can seat up to 7 people at a time","body":" MANILA, Philippines – More than 6 months after it first applied for accreditation, Filipino-developed ride-sharing service U-Hop has been approved by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

His songs are a balm for hearts beating, taken, and broken – visceral, stirring, and soothing all at once. These days, Danao is busy preparing for an upcoming concert, #DAMA3D, featuring fellow singer-songwriters Ebe Dancel and Bullet Dumas on Friday, February 19, at the Music Museum. He is also recording his 3rd solo album later in the year. \n// <![CDATA[\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n// ]]&gt;\n   But sometime in 2015, Danao would take off the performer’s hat at daytime to drive his car as part of ride-sharing service Uber’s roster of partner drivers to help augment his income. “For 3 months, last year from March until June siguro,” Danao says. He would drive his car from morning until 6 pm around the metro. Danao’s stint with Uber was short-lived because the demands of driving and performing took their toll on him. However, his experience allowed him to examine – and understand – the odd, yet varying dynamics between driver and passenger. It is entertaining and awkward at the same time, he says, because there are days when he gets recognized, and there are others when he is virtually invisible. “When you’re a driver, parang you don’t exist sa passengers,” he says. “Kahit anong pinag-uusapan nila, hindi nila sine-censor, over the phone. Minsan, madidinig mo na nag-aaway sila ng boyfriend nila, they talk about personal lives, ‘yung parang wala ka.

And then he takes off the Uber driver hat, picks up his guitar, and serenades lovers in the moonlight. \n// <![CDATA[\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n// ]]&gt;\n   – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/118478-netflix-hooq-iflix-blink-comparisons/","title":"Why becoming the next Netflix is really, really hard","date":"Jan 9, 2016 4:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Luis Buenaventura spends some time bouncing between Netflix, Blink, iFlix and Hooq to see how they approach video-on-demand services","body":" My Australian friend’s 6-year-old doesn’t understand TV. She doesn’t really get why it seems to only show “random things,” instead of allowing its viewers to choose what they want to see. There’s no search bar, no related videos, no comments, no ratings. She was born into a world, you see, where Youtube and Netflix are the rule instead of the exception, where actively searching for videos has replaced passively mashing the remote, and this dumb old box, well, it just doesn’t entertain as well as it used to. It may not be true for everyone, but it certainly feels true amongst kids who were raised elsewhere. In the Philippines, as in most of the developing world, TV continues to enjoy its domination of the medium, no matter what Youtube growth statistics may tell you. It’s both an Internet penetration problem and, obviously, an economic one: TV is free, Netflix isn’t. But now that Netflix has debuted in the Philippines (amongst 130 other countries), that theory will truly be tested. The streaming giant’s absence was a window of opportunity for regional players, and in the past year we’ve seen three such video services make aggressive moves into the Philippine market: Hooq, iFlix, and Blink. All three are inevitably backed by large Philippine corporations (Globe, PLDT, SM/SolarTV, respectively). I spent the last two months bouncing between all four of these services, and assessing their respective approaches relative to their pedigree has been a truly riveting exercise.  Blink and you’ll miss it Of the four services, Blink is the biggest straggler. Their press release from August 2015 claimed that their service would allow viewers to “cavort with Tom Cruise,” “go wild with Mad Men,” or “run for your life from velociraptors,” and although I went through their entire catalogue I couldn’t find evidence of Cruise, John Hamm, or Sam Neill anywhere. Their library is mostly composed of ABC shows (the middling Agents of SHIELD, the seminal procedural Criminal Minds, the sci-fi ensemble classic Lost) and a truly odd smattering of Disney movies (Iron Man 1 & 2, Crazy Beautiful, Scary Movie 4). Perhaps because it’s doesn’t appear to have a deal with a local ISP, I found that it displayed video at a really mediocre bitrate and often couldn’t sustain a steady stream, even on a 50mbps DSL connection. If any of the shows or movies in the Blink catalogue are of interest to you, then the iFlix service is unequivocally the better deal. It has the same selection from ABC/Disney, and only costs P129 ($3) per month. Blink charges twice that – P250 ($6) for a far smaller selection – so if being able to watch old episodes of Castle is your main point of comparison, then there’s no arguing which service you would want to go with. Channel-surfing It’s only when you compare iFlix with its rival Hooq that the decision becomes slightly trickier. Both have licensed the ABC Studios On Demand library and are very similarly priced – Hooq is only P20 more expensive at P149 a month. The way the differences break down are downright bewildering. Where Hooq has Mad Men, iFlix has Homeland. They both have all 7 seasons of Lost, but only Hooq has episodes from the other JJ Abrams-produced shows Alias and Fringe. Hooq also has my all-time favorite TV show, The Shield, but iFlix seems stronger for TV shows overall, with Orphan Black, Doctor Who, The Americans, Hannibal, and Sherlock, rounding out their collection. The two services have each managed to acquire some new high-profile TV exclusively: iFlix has the must-watch Fargo, Hooq has Supergirl and the cult classic Ash vs Evil Dead. The biggest headscratcher: Hooq has Castle seasons 1 through 3, while iFlix has seasons 6 and 7. Why neither of them were able to acquire seasons 4 and 5 is a mystery. (And in case you were wondering, Blink only has season 7.) On the movie side of things, the differences only get wider. iFlix has a handful of the Star Trek movies, the complete Matrix trilogy, the complete Lord of the Rings, and two of the Harry Potter series, while Hooq has critically-acclaimed films like Das Boot, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Boogie Nights, The Social Network. Neither of the two have much in the way of documentaries, which is one of Netflix’s biggest strengths. The elephant in the screening room The Los Gatos-based company’s arrival changes the game for the regional players significantly. (READ: 93% of Netflix US titles not available on Netflix PH – Report) It’s pricey – even its basic plan is nearly 3 times more expensive than Hooq or iFlix – but it has some of the best original TV of 2015 in its collection (Narcos, Bloodline, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Orange is the New Black), and a truly vast collection of feature films and documentaries. It has nearly 70 million subscribers around the world, and single-handedly accounts for 37% of the entire North American continent’s internet bandwidth usage. (It doesn’t have a single episode of Castle, interestingly enough.) Hooq and iFlix do have a couple of advantages over their $50B rival though. First, they both bill their customers through their telco partnerships, so there’s no credit card dependency in their business models. Second, they also both focus on acquiring local content, something which Netflix is unlikely to put any effort into. What’s truly interesting is that we’ve seen this movie before. Back in 2013, GrabTaxi and EasyTaxi were two rival taxi-hailing services fighting for a foothold in the Philippine market. The two competitors were similarly aligned with telcos (Globe and Smart, respectively), and the marketing campaigns were fierce. Then Uber showed up, expanding its massive international ride-sharing footprint with huge driver and passenger subsidies. In a year’s time, the less spry EasyTaxi was relegated to a footnote, and only GrabTaxi remained. Counterintuitively, Uber continued to enjoy a dominant position even though it was completely dependent on credit card payments. It seems probable that we’ll see this same scenario play out in the video-streaming arena. Based on the level of competition, we’ll likely only have two services left by the end of 2016 – it just doesn’t seem possible to have three significant players in such a nascent market. Precisely which two services it will be, well, that’s the cliffhanger. – Rappler.com When not working on his fintech startup, Luis reviews new TV pilots available on Netflix, Hooq, iFlix, and elsewhere every week at Pilotfishing.org.

Improvements to the smartphone messaging application last year included ramping up speed, making it easier to send photos, adding video calling, letting businesses use it for customer service and adding the ability to send money to friends. Facebook also began testing on weaving its “M” digital virtual assistant into Messenger. The test of enhancing Messenger with artificial intelligence is “going well,” according to Marcus. Uber alliance  Facebook last month announced an alliance with Uber that lets people in the United States summon cars from the ride-sharing service using the Messenger application. The partnership was a major move for both California firms, further expanding Facebook’s stand-alone messaging service beyond simply communicating and putting Uber in touch with a huge user base. Uber was described as the first partner in the launch of “transportation on Messenger,” leaving the door open to add Uber rivals as options for users of the smartphone messaging service. “You can expect us to keep trying new things, too,” Marcus said. “There will be more innovative developments to come from Messenger this year.” Connecting with businesses  Plans for this year include doing more to enable businesses and services to connect with people using Messenger, according to Facebook. Messenger is working with players in e-commerce, travel, aviation and other industries to test modes of interacting with people on the service, Marcus told AFP in an interview here. He said that people appreciate being able to easily interact with companies in conversational manners on Messenger. Messenger is also keen to play a role in e-commerce globally, considering it a natural fit for the service but noting that international payments systems face “complications.” The ability of one person to send money to another using Messenger, however, is being developed country-by-country and will take “a little time,” according to Marcus. Facebook holds another messaging application, WhatsApp, which had more than 900 million users as of late last year.

The website of the company features a picture of a foreigner sniffing the armpit of an Indonesian man under the caption: “Sorry, if you have an armpit odor problem, you cannot be an UberJEK rider.” (READ: Trial starts for man who killed sex worker over body odor)  Motorbike taxis, known locally as “ojeks”, have been ubiquitous for years in the overcrowded city of 10 million known for its monster traffic jams, but it is all too easy for drivers to get sweaty and smelly working long hours in the tropical heat.  UberJEK founder Aris Wahyudi said he decided to include the test in the recruitment process after hearing many complaints from motorbike taxi customers. “This test will be conducted for customers’ satisfaction as there have been many complaints about drivers’ foul-smelling body odor,” Wahyudi said, according to reports. UberJEK – which is not associated with the popular US-based ride-sharing service Uber – hopes its pledge to hire only fragrant drivers will give it an edge in a crowded market that has been flooded by motorbike taxi-hailing apps over the past year.  Other services have also taken an innovative approach, such as Ladyjek and Sister Ojek, which offer female drivers for women travellers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/111636-uber-cars-now-accept-cash-philippines/","title":"Uber cars now accept cash in the Philippines","date":"Nov 4, 2015 8:37 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":" Popular ride sharing app Uber announced on Tuesday, November 3 that it now accepts cash payments in the Philippines. The company hopes the move will open up Uber to a wider rider base in the country, where credit card use is not as widespread.

Actor and model Jet Rai, who recently founded startup BikerX, thinks differently. Manila’s road space problems Rai founded startup BikerX in the hope of helping alleviate the traffic congestion in Metro Manila. “It banks on the idea of utilizing biker clubs and private individuals to maximize the potential of underutilized motorcycles and to effectively deal with road space problems,” Rai said. Motorcycles can be hailed via BikerX for individual rides, as with the case of other transport apps already operating in the Philippines, as well as “hatid-sundo” (drop-off, pick-up) arrangements and motorcade participation. It can also be used for parcel delivery in the same way that most motorcycles in the city are traditionally utilized.  For these various offerings, BikerX is priced based on such variables as distance of travel and peak hour costs, in addition to any promos that they may be offering. No matter the service, BikerX is an interesting solution for the ‘road space problems’ that Rai mentioned. To put it simply, motorcycles take up a less space than motor vehicles and thus may be a more city-friendly option over vehicles with only a single passenger. Still, while Filipinos may feel comfortable using motorcycles for logistics, they may not necessarily be accustomed to using it for their own personal transportation. Rai argued that motorcycles can be a fun way to travel, and with BikerX’s GPS tracking system, this form of transport can also be a safer and more efficient way of commuting.  As a new platform, Rai is still focused on growing BikerX to offer more services. “We are also in the verge of finalizing various partnerships with different brands and companies to create a better experience and have a good set of perks for our riders,” he said. The Uber of motorcycles To get Filipinos to try out BikerX and remain with the platform, Rai is banking on a rewards program for both ends of its marketplace. “BIkerX is developing different incentives both to its riders and users that would work through the course of their loyalty and use of the app,” he said, adding that they also plan to offer free rides to show the convenience and efficiency that their motorcycles can offer.  Though some may peg BikerX as the “Uber of motorcycles,” Rai does not believe his startup is a direct competitor of the Silicon Valley giant, nor even of GrabTaxi. He said that BikerX caters to a more diverse market segment that is not just limited to ride sharing, because it can appeal to the corporate industry with its delivery offerings. Though Uber is quickly foraying into logistics with UberRUSH, which is live – as of this writing – in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, and GrabTaxi has had parcel delivery available in Manila via GrabExpress for some time, BikerX is arguably different in that it’s focusing on logistics from its inception and its entire fleet is composed of motorcycles, which may be better suited for delivery. Rai cited safety and the need to secure their parcel delivery as the biggest challenge facing BikerX. “We have overcome this ordeal through having a unique tracking system for our riders,” he said, adding that they also have a screening and verification program to make sure that their riders are trustworthy to ride with.   Following the launch of BikerX, Rai’s immediate goals are to help both sides of the platform. “Our vision is not just providing an alternative method for transportation for commuters, but to also become a platform for collaborative uses of motorcycles that would help our transport industry,” he said. In trying to achieve this goal, BikerX would seem to have more in common with other ride-sharing apps – they need the government’s support to get there. On this front, Rai called on the Philippine government to be more collaborative. “The government could support the ridesharing industry by being more cooperative and supportive in terms of regulations and policies and to find a middle ground for everyone,” he said. “Because at the end of the day, we are all after one thing, and that is the safety of our commuters.” – Rappler.com Rappler Business columnist Ezra Ferraz brings you Philippine business leaders, their insights, and their secrets via Executive Edge.

The cause of the crashes remained unclear, but some appeared connected to trouble at a cloud service relied on by companies, although that did not stop the social media rumor and conspiracy mill from going into overdrive. “We’re aware that members are experiencing issues streaming on all devices,” streaming television service Netflix said in a tweet at its customer service Twitter account. “We’re working to resolve the problem.” Netflix spokesman Joris Evers told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the outage was the result of “technical issues” at an UltraDNS cloud service provided by Neustar and affected mostly US subscribers. “UltraDNS is working to address the issue,” Evers said. “We apologize for the inconvenience.” Neustar confirmed in a tweet that there was an issue with its UltraDNS. {source} <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>We recognize there&#39;s an issue w/ our UltraDNS service &amp; we are working on it. Our 1st priority is to bring back service to our customers</p>&mdash; Neustar (@Neustar) <a href=”https://twitter.com/Neustar/status/654780398287745024″>October 15, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src=”//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script> {/source} Internet trouble tracker CurrentlyDown.com displayed a list of two dozen websites that were or had been out of service during the day. The list also included Ameritrade — an online broker — and The Economist. It was unclear whether all those affected relied on UltraDNS, but ride-sharing service Uber blamed its problems on that. The outages sparked chatter at Twitter and other social networks. “Netflix, HBOGo, Chase Bank, Uber, ETrade… all websites down at the same time,” tweeted Joseph Colarusso from the Twitter account @jcolarusso. “Coincidence or Cyber Attack?” Problems sporadic The UltraDNS service was hit by an outage affecting customers in the eastern United States late afternoon local time, according to Neustar spokeswoman Lara Wyss. “We can confirm this is not a DDoS attack,” Wyss told AFP, referring to a style of cyber attack in which websites are intentionally overloaded with requests for service and crash under the stress. Most of the websites that stumbled or fell were back up and running by mid-evening East Coast time, according to CurrentlyDown. “Some of our clients experienced sporadic difficulty accessing some of our websites,” Ameritrade told AFP. “Once clients were able to log in there were no issues.” Netflix also noted that the UltraDNS did not hurt the entire service, just some people trying to tune in. Cloud-based DNS services essentially route traffic to websites. “It’s kind of a road map,” said Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. “The roads are still in place, but if the map goes away nobody knows where to go.” ‘Cascading catastrophe’ The economics of running large-scale online services, such as streaming television shows or summoning car rides using smartphone applications, has given rise to companies that work in the background to handle traffic, storage and other needs. Such cloud service providers often compete on price, meaning compromises might be made when it comes to quality of hardware or even levels of security, according to Enderle. Since datacenters or servers handle demands from multiple clients, a hardware failure or software glitch can knock out seemingly unrelated Internet operations. “The problem with a cloud service is you can’t be certain a failure will be isolated,” Enderle said. “You’ve got this potential for cascading catastrophe.” An outage at Amazon Web Services last month was blamed for causing problems at Netflix, Reddit and Tinder. As with the trouble on Thursday, that problem caused a frenzy of worried commentary at social media venues. Enderle warned that security breaches of cloud service defenses could also touch multiple websites relying on shared servers. – Glenn Chapman, AFP/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/107880-pldt-home-uber-partnership/","title":"PLDT HOME has a new, Uber exciting partner","date":"Oct 2, 2015 9:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The partnership reinforces PLDT HOME’s broadband leadership with free rides for subscribers","body":" MANILA, Philippines — City dwellers around the world would agree that Uber has shaken up the public transportation game.

The Philippines is the 9th worst place to drive, revealed the 2015 Global Driver Satisfaction Index conducted by Waze. The Philippines is only a little ahead of Costa Rica, and behind countries like Panama, Indonesia, and Romania.  Meanwhile, the top 5 countries with “most satisfying” driving experience are the Netherlands, Latvia, the United States, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. Waze surveyed the driving experience of 50 million users across 32 countries and 167 metro areas. The report, “Driver Satisfaction Index,”  is the first of its kind. Drivers were are asked to rate their driving experience from 10 (satisfying) to 1 (miserable). The Philippines did poorly at 3.9, a big leap from the Netherlands’ 7.9 score. The survey focused on 6 factors: traffic level by frequency and severity of traffic jams, road quality and infrastructure, driver safety, driver services, socio-economic aspect, and “Wazeyness” or the level of helpfulness and happiness within the Waze community. Traffic The top 5 countries with the best driving experience said they had an “easy, breezy driving experience.” The US and France, according to Waze, have very light traffic due to “smaller cities with appropriate infrastructure that’s easy to navigate.” This is a far cry from what many Filipino drivers and commuters experience every day. In the survey, an average Metro Manila commuter travels for over 45 minutes to get from home to work. Metro Manila commuters spent the most time on the road, the survey showed. Some netizens have shared, however, that they endure even longer commutes streching from an hour or more – depending on traffic, availability of taxis and buses, MRT functionality, and the ability to use apps like GrabTaxi or Uber. (READ: #CommuterWatch) With the country’s problematic public transportation system, many Filipinos have turned to ride sharing apps to ease their daily commute. But not everyone has access to this technology. (READ: The Filipino commuter is terrified) The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) earlier reported that the country’s traffic congestion cost the economy P2.4 billion every day in 2012. The cost of traffic will continue to rise if the government fails to provide adequate solutions, JICA said. The Philippines also ranked the lowest in the socio-economic category, which accounts for gas prices and its impact on living, access to cars, and the ratio of cars to the population. On the upside, the Philippines ranked first in terms of the best “driver services index,” pertaining to the number of gas stations, car services, and parking lots. It also ranked 4th in the “safety index,” which is based on the density of accidents and hazards. Among “big metros,” Philippine cities Manila, Quezon City, Makati, Dasmariñas, Bacoor, Taguig, Valenzuela, and San Jose del Monte fared poorly with a score of 3.9, the 3rd lowest among the surveyed cities worldwide. In an effort to ease the country’s many commuting woes, the government came up with a unified ticketing system for trains. The system, however, is yet to be fully operational across all stations.  The government also announced that it will be getting new MRT trains by January 2016 as part of its as part of its long-term rehabilitation plan. The MRT has been in use since 1999, with a less-than-amusing track record of delays, breakdowns, injuries, and derailment. The beaten-up train system carries over 500,000 passengers per day even if it has a capacity for only 350,000.  What is your driving experience like?

You’ll never know what’s around the corner,' says Paul Bettany, who also talks about his 'Avengers' role, why he loves Iron Man, and shares his message for Pinoy fans","body":" MANILA, Philippines – “Life is curly. You’ll never know what’s around the corner,” said actor Paul Bettany, who was still quite optimistic in the middle of one dark, however transient, episode in his life. According to him, it’s a story that’s “never gonna go away.” “I was sitting on the sidewalk of Sunset Boulevard, having just come out of a meeting in the building behind me, having been told that my career was over by a producer,” the Englishman told attentive fans at AsiaPOP Comic Con in a special panel at Hall D, which just moments before, was packed to the rafters to get an early glimpse of scenes from Captain America: Civil War. In a swift reversal of fortune, his phone rang and lo and behold, it was Joss Whedon. “Joss Whedon said, ‘Do you wanna be a superhero in the next Avengers movie?’ and I said, ‘Yes,’” Paul said, as he relived that moment, triumphantly flipping the bird towards an imaginary producer’s office behind his back. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-video” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>How Joss Whedon sort of saved <a href=”https://twitter.com/Paul_Bettany“>@Paul_Bettany</a> <a href=”http://t.co/fhcjwD85U6“>pic.twitter.com/fhcjwD85U6</a></p>&mdash; Out of Tune (@outoftunelive) <a href=”https://twitter.com/outoftunelive/status/645951584363372544“>September 21, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src=”//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source} Everyone was incredulous that someone would say something that mean to him. The voice of Tony Stark’s virtual assistant J.A.R.V.I.S. and now, the ultra-cool and imposing the Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however, was such a good sport about it. He said, “People say strange things sometimes, and what I noticed about Hollywood is that people have second acts and they have third acts.” The actor’s roles thus far have been diverse and point to his versatility – ranging from the edgy dramas like Gangster No. 1, Dogville, and The Da Vinci Code to light-hearted flicks like A Knight’s Tale (“You’ve seen me naked! You have me at a disadvantage”) and Wimbledon. Like a true Avenger, he rocked Comic Con with his mere presence, and thrilled fans as well as us, reporters, with his stories and thoughts on a variety of topics – including his love for food and travel. We highlight some of these: 1. Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino are among his childhood heroes, plus “all of those great films from the ‘70s and ‘80s that really made me wanna become an actor and eventually a moviemaker – directing films.” 2. Paul had an awkward Robert De Niro encounter. He once had to meet with De Niro, but the meeting got bumped off because the latter was filming. Although he hired a babysitter since his wife Jennifer Connelly was also away working, a two-hour window had already lapsed. “So, by the time I walked into the meeting, I had one of those BabyBjörn carriers with the baby, and I conducted this audition with him wearing a baby,” he said. Thankfully, De Niro was doting towards his kid. 3. He was once a struggling busker. “If I didn’t make money, I went to bed hungry,” he shared. He kind of reflects on this in his directorial debut, Shelter, a film about homelessness in New York City: “I do find myself thinking about how fortunate I am all of the time.” Like a call to action, he said, “In the world right now, if we look around [at] what’s going on, we will be judged on how we treat our needy.”  4. He’s a huge Blur fan. “I can’t think of an actor that I haven’t met, but I’ve had the opportunity to meet [frontman] Damon Albarn twice – and have always said ‘no’ because I’m too nervous to meet him,” Paul confessed. He even raved about Albarn’s first studio album, Everyday Robots, calling it “superlative,” “impeccable,” and “perfect.” 5. People have common phobias, but he said that he has an “irrational” one. He fears that The Walking Dead will end:“It keeps me awake at night, because I love it so, so very much. I love everybody in it. I’ve been watching it since the beginning. I’m so frightened of a life without The Walking Dead.” 6. He hates emojis with a passion and thinks it’s a “sign of weakness.” “I try and use words,” the actor said. “We used to be gaining words all the time, and now we’re losing words. I would never use an emoji.” {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Shit faced in Manila. <a href=”http://t.co/Ly3exS2C4B“>pic.twitter.com/Ly3exS2C4B</a></p>&mdash; Paul Bettany (@Paul_Bettany) <a href=”https://twitter.com/Paul_Bettany/status/645510938309718016“>September 20, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src=”//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source} He also abhors the exclamation point: “It means that you’re worried that your sentence wasn’t clear enough that you were trying to be funny. So make your sentence funnier. Don’t add a smiley face at the end of it.” 7. He’s a foodie at heart. His favorite is curry and grew up eating it, “as it’s the national dish of Great Britain.” He also loves Greek food, saying, “It’s so clean and honest and unpretentious.” Paul also claims to make “the best Spaghetti Bolognese in the entire world,” adding, “I blow my own trumpet, but it’s true.” 8. For him, food brings people together. When he visits any country, he wants to experience what the country is like, and for him, “it’s about eating.” He said, “I’ll go and eat in local places, and slip past my security and go off on my own. I’ve never ever got into any trouble. I tend to sort of meet people through food, so that’s what I’d like to do. 9. Paul wants Mark Ruffalo to be Jason Statham’s “acting double,” because “he made a funny joke.” {source}<iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB2n2q6lKb4” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   However, he was genuinely apologetic. “The Jason Statham comment – I got totally broadsided on Conan, and I made a funny joke in response,” he said. “It transpires that I offended one of my fans by making my joke about Jason Statham, so I’d like to apologize, Mum. I’m really sorry. Frankly, I can’t afford to lose 50% of my fan base.” 10. He is still proud of his work on the critically-acclaimed Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,and references it several times throughout his discussions. “I loved making [this] movie with Peter Weir, who is probably our greatest living director,” he said. 11. He puts in the same amount of effort in the Marvel films as his more dramatic oeuvre. “All movie sets feel the same in that you are all trying to fill in a huge puzzle together, and that’s a lovely feeling,” he said. He said that that only the approach differs: “Definitely there are some physical aspects to doing an action movie that are challenging. You would be wise to get yourself in shape because it’s a lot of work physically. And then, there are the roles that demand a more cerebral preparation.” 12. Paul’s acting method: “I ask myself what I know, what I have in that person, and then I try to make up the things that I don’t have.”  13. On getting to play a supervillain that embodied his most evil traits: “I’m English, so I tend to sound evil. It’s just one of the hangovers from our colonial past,” he joked, adding, “You know, I was so impressed with what [James] Spader did with Ultron, and I would relish the chance of doing something like that at some point.” 14. How Paul keeps up with comic book fans’ expectations from his portrayal of the Vision: “You feel a lot of pressure initially to deliver that, and then you realize, these characters are happening in every individual person’s head. I can’t possibly please the imagination of every person who’s read the Vision, so I’m just left with what I wanna do and what I find interesting,” he said. 15. On the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe: “America’s a very young country and it’s created its own mythology.” “It’s kind of fun, and yet great things can be spoken about using it as a template,” he added. “Now they’re beginning to talk about the fact that the more defended we are, the more conflict there is. That’s really interesting. 16. On his Marvel bosses Joss Whedon, Jeremy Latcham, and Kevin Feige: “You’re working with the professors of these comics… They know them intimately. When they bend the rules, people trust them because they have grown up as fans themselves and are essentially continuing that in their grown-up adult lives,” he said. “What is extraordinary, I think, about the pictures, is you feel that they’re made by fans.” 17. “There are Marvel agents everywhere!” Paul joked, “Every time I begin to reveal something, I see a red dot appear on my chest.” When he was coaxed into confirming or denying a Spider-Man appearance in future Marvel films, he quickly retorted, “I can’t corroborate any rumors, otherwise I’ll get shot.” “You’re sat down alone with the guy who chooses you, who says, ‘Don’t speak about your character. Don’t speak about the plot. Don’t speak about additional characters coming into the film,” he shared. 18. He is also excited to see Civil War himself. “[Marvel is] making the biggest movies of all time,” he said. “The scope is massive, and they’re filmed in so many different locations around the world. It’s hard not to get wrapped up in all of that excitement.” 19. If Paul had his own J.A.R.V.I.S., he would make it do his dishes and laundry. “There are a lot of chores that are kind of meditative and great, but unloading dishwashers and doing my laundry is just irritating,” he said. 20. Vision or J.A.R.V.I.S.? Paul chose Vision, but said, “It’s a double-edged sword.” He explained that he only had to do recording sessions as J.A.R.V.I.S. “They would give me a big bag of money, and I would sort of pick it up and leave like a thief,” he said. Now, he has to go through a grueling process of painting his skin beetroot-red and getting into a heavy but beautifully intricate costume. “Downey came in – he just came in ‘cause he knew I’d been having an easy ride for eight years,” he shared. “He came to see me trying to climb into my costume, and then just laughed his ass off.” It’s worth it in the end though: “J.A.R.V.I.S. can’t kick your ass. The Vision has such power, and with that power comes real responsibility. Frankly, JARVIS is a servant. There’s nothing servile about the Vision.” 21. The Vision vs. Iron Man: who will win? “Well, I can put my hand inside another human being and tear out their heart. I’m just saying!” Paul answered. 22. J.A.R.V.I.S. for Siri? “I couldn’t even walk down the street without people stopping me and asking me to do J.A.R.V.I.S. on their outgoing message,” Paul said. “I should do Siri. We should start a petition.” 23. Paul’s daughter loves Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man more than his own Vision character. “You know, the Marvel stuff is the only thing my kids have ever, ever been interested in [everything] I’ve ever done in my life – ever. So that’s slightly humiliating,” he told the Filipino fans. Because of this, plus the fact that “he’s the best paid,” he told reporters that he would happily swap roles with Iron Man. He also planned to send Downey a video message trying to get her to say otherwise, but instead, he had to send one that added insult to injury: “I love you. I love you. I love you more than my daddy!” He said, “It was a very bad and dark moment for me,” and grumbled, “Damn you, Downey!” Watch the video he shared with Conan O’Brien: {source}<iframe width=”100%” height=”360″ src=”http://teamcoco.com/embed/v/90999#playlist=x;eyJ0eXBlIjoicmVsYXRlZCIsImlkIjo5MDk5OX0” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   24. Does being able to pick up Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir, mean anything important for the Vision’s character? Paul throws the question back, and comically demonstrates how simple the answer is: it means that he’s worthy to rule Asgard. Is this a plot clue? {source} <blockquote class=”twitter-video” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>What does it mean that Vision is able to pick up Mjölnir? <a href=”https://twitter.com/Paul_Bettany“>@Paul_Bettany</a> <a href=”http://t.co/ZAnwq2GAYO“>pic.twitter.com/ZAnwq2GAYO</a></p>&mdash; Out of Tune (@outoftunelive) <a href=”https://twitter.com/outoftunelive/status/645949933518876672“>September 21, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src=”//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source}   25. He thinks that there is a dangerous edge to the Vision. “For him to be omnipotent and yet totally naïve at the same time, and experiencing the world in real time and his place in it – whether he’s gonna be a force for good or a force for evil – was really interesting and fun to play with because it’s dangerous,” he said. “You don’t know whether he’s gonna go one way or the other, and I’m continuing that theme in Captain America 3 [Civil War].” “I don’t think he knows anything about loyalty,” he added, on the matter of the Vision fighting on Tony Stark’s side. “His allegiance can flip if it’s logical, if he thinks that the outcome is correct. So that’s what’s sort of dangerous about the Vision.” {source} <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Cool poster.

Photos of soaked commuters lumbering through shin-deep water were soon posted on social media. Makati City, the country’s business capital district, “lit up like a Christmas tree,” a netizen remarked satirically. Urban Filipinos are becoming all too familiar with such episodes.  With Tuesday’s downpour, 4 flights were delayed, Light Rail Transit Line 2 (LRT2) trains were reduced to 5 from 8, the tunnel of the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3) between Buendia and Ayala was flooded, and thousands of commuters and motorists were stranded in horrendous traffic gridlock after several highways in Metro Manila were flooded, officials of the Transportation department said in separate mobile phone replies. With inadequate pumps and drains, even brief heavy rain can turn Metro Manila into a swimming pool, bringing traffic to a halt, Jose Regin Regidor, research fellow at the National Center for Transportation Studies at University of the Philippines Diliman (UP-Diliman), told Rappler in an email. The result: A nightmarish traffic that has been costing the Philippines a staggering P2.4 billion ($51.18 million) a day. This will likely increase to P6 billion ($127.96 million) a day by 2030 if the situation is not addressed, according to a study done by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The country’s urban sprawl has been expanding much faster than its drainage infrastructure could catch up, Rene Santiago, president of consultancy Bellwether Advisory Incorporated, said. “There is no way to prevent heavy rains. Road capacity decreases during heavy downpour, as vehicles have to slow down due to poor visibility and slippery roads – if not flooded roads. In one intersection I saw, traffic lights conked out. Most of our roads are already at saturation point – such that weather disturbance leads to gridlocks,” Santiago said in an email. According to Regidor, the government could do very little to prevent the congestion seen by a lot of people on Tuesday. “For one, we experienced intense rainfall that was comparable to extreme rain events like Ondoy in 2009. Road drainage – even assuming the designs followed standards – could not handle such amount of rainfall, leading to flash floods that ultimately caused the congestion and inconvenienced commuters,” Regidor, assistant professor at UP-Diliman College of Engineering, said.   The anatomy of the problem To make matters worse, the sorry state of public transport basically makes commuters want to own and drive or ride their own vehicles, leading to a “car-centric urban transport,” Regidor said. In a study Santiago presented to the National Academy of Science and Technology last year, he said the National Capital Region accounts for nearly 36% of the country’s economic output. The urban area has 17 cities and municipalities and is home to 12.7 million people. “The concentrated economic activities beget massive traffic congestion,” Santiago said in his study, and added that nearly 56% of the country’s 7.2 million motor vehicles run on 14% of the nation’s total supply of roads. “Metro Manila has nearly twice more vehicles per kilometer of roads than Singapore; its population density of 19,126 persons per square kilometer in 2010 is even higher than Tokyo metropolis or Singapore’s 7,100,” the study read. Santiago also said that Singapore has 5 MRT lines spanning more than 153 kilometers, Metro Manila only has 3 with a combined length of 50 kilometers.  “If we had good public transport, then there would probably be less cars on the road and public transport in the form of trains, and buses could convey people more efficiently despite flash floods on our roads,” UP-Diliman’s Regidor said in an email. According to Santiago, the limits to road building dictate that more people should share rides by taking public transport and minimize car use. “That would necessitate a radical re-invention of the public transport system that has been caught – with consent – on a low performance equilibrium trap in the last 40 years,” Santiago said. On this yardstick, Santiago said Metro Manila’s road network of 4,755 kilometers is already 80% on average. Thus, operating speed is generally below 20 kilometers per hour (kph), while 40 kph is deemed free-flowing.  The solution to the problem There is no silver bullet in solving traffic congestion, which requires a comprehensive set of measures implemented over several years, both Regidor and Santiago said. “The band-aid solution to this problem could be to declare a non-working holiday. Unfortunately, it works only if announced before noon,” according to Santiago. Santiago’s study showed that Metro Manila has not been lacking in decongestion plans. The study showed that the earliest plan was drawn up by Japanese consultants in 1972. “Imitating the Tokyo radial network of railways, the study proposed 11 underground rail transit lines. At that time, it was a fantasy plan – elegant engineering-wise but very impractical. Not surprisingly, nothing came out of that plan,” the study read. “Then came the Metro Manila Transport Land Use and Development Planning Project of 1975 which was funded by the World Bank. Its claim to fame – aside from framing the issue of transport with land use – was the LRT Line 1. While its proposal was for at-grade tramway, what got implemented in the 1980s was an elevated LRT,” it added. “The road pricing proposal never took off, fortunately perhaps, because it suffered from two basic infirmities: the CBD (central business district) was already moving from Manila to Makati, and the technology was not yet there to support effective implementation,” it noted. This, according to Santiago, was followed by the Metro Manila Urban Transportation Strategy and Planning Project in 1984 and the Metro Manila Urban Transportation Integration Study in 1998.  “Some components of these plans were implemented – but they were Sisyphean in character. All of these plans from 1975 to 2011 were constrained by small budget envelopes,” Santiago said. The latest is the Transport Roadmap for the Greater Capital Region of JICA, which includes a bold “dream plan” to vanish traffic congestion by year 2030.  It requires massive investments in infrastructure: 137-km of new roads, 78-km of urban expressway, and more than 200-km rail transit lines – elevated and underground.  “It also calls for a radical restructuring of the current surface public transport system comprising the jeepney and bus modes,” the study read. The dream plan is estimated to require P2.61 trillion ($55.71 billion) to fix traffic congestion that is costing the economy P2.4 billion ($51.18 million) a day. (READ: The cost of traffic in Metro Manila) “Unlike the previous 3 plans, this one can fit into the projected budget envelope to year 2030. The prospect of relief, however, is clouded by institutional arthritis – an inability to execute projects of the transport,” Santiago said. “It is hard to imagine 200 km of rail lines being built in 15 years, when 4-km could not even break ground 5 years,” he added. Changing the behavior of motorists, commuters, and public transport operators is less expensive but more difficult to execute, and it entails sustained efforts over a long period of time."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/105427-bandung-uber-ban/","title":"Indonesian city bans Uber","date":"Sep 10, 2015 7:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Just 3 months after launching in Bandung, a busy city known for its IT expertise, the popular ride-sharing service has been told it doesn't possess the right permits and can't operate.","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Uber has fallen foul of authorities in the Indonesian city of Bandung, with the local government banning the controversial taxi-hailing app, the latest in a series of setbacks for the company internationally.  Just 3 months after launching in Bandung, a busy city known for its IT expertise about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the capital Jakarta, the popular ride-sharing service has been told it doesn’t possess the right permits and can’t operate. “Uber has been officially banned, as previously instructed by the mayor of Bandung,” head of the traffic unit at Bandung police Asep Amar told AFP Thursday, September 10. “All companies must have the proper permits to operate.” It’s not the first time Uber has clashed with authorities in Indonesia, where local transport organizations and traditional taxi drivers have protested against what they claim is an unregulated industry. Last month 18 vehicles owned by Uber drivers were impounded in Jakarta, with the city’s mayor declaring the US-based taxi app illegal. Uber claims it plays by the rules in Bandung, as elsewhere, and has been given an overwhelming “thumbs up” by passengers and drivers so far. “It’s why we are also disappointed that the government of Bandung has declared that it is banning Uber,” the company said in a statement. Despite the opposition it’s faced, Uber still plans to set up a foreign investment company in Indonesia, and has a representative office in Jakarta. The smartphone-based ride service has sparked angry protests worldwide, with some taxi associations taking legal action while others have demanded the arrest of Uber operators and executives. Many traditional taxi drivers claim Uber poses unfair competition by flouting rules and restrictions imposed on their own vehicles. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/105203-smart-uber-free-wifi-ridesharing/","title":"Smart-Uber team-up brings in-car Wifi to ridesharing service","date":"Sep 9, 2015 1:01 AM PHT","snippet":"The team-up's free Wifi initiative will first occur with select Uber Black vehicles, rolling out to other Uber vehicles in the coming months","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Uber riders who want to stay connected on the road have one new option they can use. Smart Communications announced Tuesday, September 8 that it was providing free in-car Wifi on Uber rides, a move the company says is the first in Southeast Asia.

The company also announced that it was introducing “exclusive voice and data packages, bundles and add-ons for Uber partner drivers, as well as offer special promotions, discounts and on-demand experiences for subscribers.” In line with this, Smart is giving away two free Uber rides – P300 for each ride – to Metro Manila-based subscribers who are also first-time users of Uber. The rides can be used anywhere within Metro Manila from now till September 30. Those who wish to take advantage of the offer must register on the following site, then use the promo code given to them on the Uber app before requesting a ride. “Uber and Smart share the same vision – a world where transportation is smarter and more convenient to passengers,” said Ariel P.

This means more passengers are transported around the metro using fewer vehicles.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A new ride-sharing service plans to combine mass transport with the convenience of using technology and apps to book rides. U-Hop, a Filipino-developed service established last July, is similar to existing app-based transportation services like Uber and GrabCar. But unlike these two services where one car is deployed to every passenger who requests for it, U-Hop sends shuttles that can seat up to 7 people at a time. This means more passengers are transported around the metro using fewer vehicles. “We are not putting more vehicles on the road. We are maximizing the existing number of vehicles, so we won’t add to the worsening traffic,” U-Hop interim CEO Marvin dela Cruz said on Wednesday, September 2. U-Hop has applied for accreditation as a transportation network company (TNC) in order to operate legally under the new rules set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  Once granted, the company can begin registering its partner vehicles and starting operations in Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Metro Cebu. How it works On Wednesday, the LTFRB visited the U-Hop headquarters, where officials showed a demo of U-Hop’s control center and how the system works. To book a ride, passengers must first register with the system and download a mobile app. They pay fares in advance: roundtrip rides cost P693 weekly, while a monthly roundtrip pass costs P2,970. Unlimited weekly rides cost P1,400, while a monthly unlimited ride pass costs P6,000. Using the app, registered members can choose a pick-up point, time, and destination. The system will then generate a route to pick up the passengers and bring them to their destination. Dela Cruz said U-Hop would be useful for employees and students, who need reliable transport services to pick them up from their homes and drop them off at their offices or schools. “Some employees come from a particular area in Metro Manila. Why don’t they just share a vehicle to go to work? That’s what we’re targeting. They are heading to one destination anyway, so it would be practical for them to share a shuttle,” he said. LTFRB executive director Roberto Cabrera said he supports the company’s model, adding that it will help decongest the busy thoroughfare EDSA. “The vehicles that U-Hop will use can seat 7 people. My argument is that for every fully occupied van that hits the road, we’re taking out 5 or 6 vehicles from EDSA,” he said. Cabrera added that he will prepare a recommendation, to be signed by the board’s members, to approve the accreditation of U-Hop. Control center, security features What makes U-Hop different from GrabCar and Uber is that the Filipino-developed service identifies “service areas” around Metro Manila and matches the number of available vehicles with the number of passengers needing the service. “We will balance the operators and the members, so that operators will have enough income for them to make a living,” Dela Cruz said. Unlike the current transportation setup where jeeps, shuttles, and buses compete with each other for passengers, U-Hop shuttles will share the income generated in a particular service area. “Let’s say in Pasig, you have 100 operators and 700 passengers a day. Whatever is earned will be shared within the group. You don’t have to fight for passengers. You know your market, you know how many passengers will be needing your service. And from our estimate, they should make enough,” Dela Cruz added. The service also boasts security features for their passengers. Each registered member is issued a membership card, which will be used to verify their identity every time they ride the shuttles. Passengers will also be asked to provide school or company IDs and other proofs of identity as an added security measure. Each vehicle deployed by U-Hop will be monitored through the control center. The system will be able to track the shuttles’ location, speed, and whether or not they are traveling beyond their designated service area. The control center can even stop the engine of the vehicle in case of emergencies, Dela Cruz said. During his inspection, Cabrera singled out the control center as one main benefit of the U-Hop system. “The technology they are using is good because at any time, if there are emergencies, they will be able to turn off the engine. That would focus on the safety of the passengers,” he said. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/104290-heneral-luna-dakila/","title":"‘Heneral Luna’: Para sa bayan o sarili?","date":"Aug 31, 2015 1:17 PM PHT","snippet":"Heneral Luna may actually be just what we need to finally find the heroes of our times","body":"What makes a hero?   Heroism seems absurd in this time of hashtags and Facebook memes. In fact, calling someone a hero is to invite mockery, sarcasm and insult. So here we are now, living in a time we desperately need one.   More often than not, we associate heroes with monuments  – those cold structures intended to pay homage to the person whose heroic act made a contribution in our nation’s history. If monuments are the measure of how we value our heroes then one can only look at the Bonifacio Shrine in Caloocan, the Bantayog ng Mga Bayani in Quezon Avenue and the Rizal Monument in Luneta. That is the sad state of heroism in our country – often ignored and neglected.   Sometimes, monuments take other forms. In the recent years, we have seen a steady influx of films featuring our heroes – from ER Ejercito’s El Presidente to the Robin Padilla starrer, Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo. While the power of cinema as an art form can tremendously influence its audience, if we are to measure the success of these hero films to this generation of millennials then maybe, it have failed miserably. All that resonates are all those annoying “pabebe” viral videos, Vice Ganda and #AlDub that seemed to take over our national consciousness.   We are a nation of heroic people but we are easily destroyed by our own pessimism and apathy. We often look for heroes that will save us from our own destruction – saviors of the world willing to sacrifice their lives for their country. We subscribe to the western concept of heroes – mythical beings with superpowers.  So here we are, waiting again for a hero to save the day. In this age where information travels in a speed of light, connections are boundless and communication knows no end, the textbook hero we are looking for may not be actually the hero we need today.   History gives us another opportunity to learn from its lessons through Jerrold Tarog’s epic film masterpiece, Heneral Luna. It is your typical historical film only with your non-stereotypical hero. It aspires what El Presidente and Bonifacio aspired only the production team of Luna nailed it better. It does not have an ER Ejercito and a Robin Padilla. What it has are the brilliant portrayal of actor John Arcilla as Heneral Luna and a steady solid support of actors – both old and new. It does not have the frills of a Star Cinema PR machinery but it has cemented the support of history aficionados hungry for a good historical film; educators searching for good materials to use for teaching; and students fed up with the usual film garbage big producers feed.   Heneral Luna may actually be just what we need to finally find the heroes of our times. The film breaks the idea of a hero – the monument hero by presenting Luna’s flaws that essentially is his humanity. In the film, we are presented with Luna – isang bida na kontrabida. A character far from the good boy Rizal or the underdog Bonifacio, far from the image of heroes most of us learned from textbooks.   The film disturbs the idea of heroism – bayan o sarili? Is it really the question of our generation? Do we really have to choose between our country and ourselves? Or is it not that what we actually do for our country is also for ourselves? And what we do with our individual lives also serves the general interest of our country?                    The film questions the idea of nationhood. Ano nga ba ang bayan? A very relevant question that continues to haunt our nation – in the context of the prevailing regionalist attitude, the struggle of the Bangsamoro people for their identity, and the vast labor migration of Pinoys all over the world.  Sino nga ba ang Bayan?   In the past three months, Heneral Luna embarked on a journey together with the advocacy group, Dakila – sparking a conversation on heroism among Filipino youth. Traveling to 40 schools nationwide from Ilocos Norte to Davao and reaching 22,000 audiences to show a preview of the film and bringing along historians to present history and heroism through a pop culture inspired lecture, I have witnessed how millennials responded. Surprisingly, listening to a 45-minute lecture on historical facts and trivia did not bore them. In fact, they eagerly learned about Antonio Luna and his friends – Jose, Andres, Marcelo and Juan. They reacted enthusiastically to the 15-minute preview of the film – laughing at Heneral Luna’s antics and of course, screaming every time Paolo Avelino as Gregorio del Pilar appears in the screen even if he appears only for a fraction of a second. I believe Heneral Luna hits the spot – bringing the millennials along for the ride in the shared universe it created just like how Marvel did it with Avengers.   Heneral Luna ushered the millennials in the unfamiliar world of Luna, Rizal, Bonifacio, Aguinaldo and Mabini and placed them right at the center of it. The film does not dictate. It questions. And perhaps, that is probably its greatest contribution – to ask the difficult question. That probably, this is where we have failed miserably in igniting heroism among our citizens. We have forgotten to ask, to make them think on their own, and let them define what heroism is in this generation.   Luna and his friends have a visible enemy and war is upon them. In our time, we face a multitude of enemies, not often visible but nonetheless a force that tramples upon the very ideals our forefathers in the Katipunan fought for – kalayaan, kaginhawaan, kasarinlan. The revolution remains unfinished. It waits for the next heroes who will embrace it.   Today, we celebrate National Heroes Day. But is there really much to celebrate? How does a nation really pay homage to its heroes both immortalized and anonymous? Our nation will never start the tedious process to nationhood unless we know our own history, unravel long buried truths and learn from its lessons. The best tribute any Filipino can ever give to our heroes is to continue pursuing their unfinished revolution by taking part in the revolution.   In Dakila, we believe that a hero resides in every one of us. It begins in the mind, with one thought that says it can be done. To do all things with pride and dignity, to learn from the lessons of history, to realize that the deeds of our heroes are not fables but real, breathing examples of how to live our lives.   The challenge for our generation today is not to die for the Philippines but to live for it – because it is in living where we can act and do something to make the country a better place for each Filipino to live in. Today, where the country is faced with multitude of challenges, every little act of courage and selflessness counts, It is no longer “Ang Mamatay Nang Dahil Sa ‘Yo” but it should be “Ang Mabuhay Nang Dahil Sa ‘Yo.”   Heneral Luna will be screened in theaters nationwide on September 9. Not being a mainstream film, there is no guarantee that it will last long enough for you to catch it. We have no illusion that this film can really change Philippine society but perhaps it can change the way you view the world.   After the special screening held in Baguio, the great filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik whispered to me, “When you speak to people who will watch this film in cinemas, tell them, that when they watch this film, recognize the enemy from with in.”   If I may add then I will also tell them that there is a Rizal, Bonifacio, Mabini, Heneral Luna, Leon Kilat, Teresa Magbanua, Edgar Jopson, and Lean Alejandro in every one.  Lahat tayo ay #LahingDakila – Rappler.com   Leni Velasco is in the middle of all the hullaballoo in Dakila – Philippine Collective for Modern Heroism as its Executive Director.

This was a day before the LTFRB starts its clampdown on unregistered Internet application-based transport systems. The regulator will impose a fine of P200,000 ($4,283.68) and vehicle impoundment of 3 months for operators who are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise. In May, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. “There is a need to delineate and clarify the various transportation policies pertaining to the different transport administration components such as planning, policy making, data management, and enforcement,” Aquino, chairman of the Senate Committee on Trade, Commerce, and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement. “The main challenge of the different government agencies and offices is to align their rules and regulations, as well as policies, in order to solve the worsening traffic conditions in Metro Manila,” the senator added. Lack of communication In his resolution, Aquino said the lack of communication between the DOTC and LTFRB underscores a National Center for Transportation Studies report. This, according to the senator, shows the inability to coordinate overlapping functions among transportation and traffic related units of the national and local government. “The department order was issued in response to the call of Uber, GrabTaxi, other similar Internet application-based transportation networks, and the public to recognize this innovative technology and be able to operate legally,” Aquino said. “Let us continue supporting emerging industries and new business models, especially in our public transportation system that will enhance competition and provide better service to our fellow Filipinos,” he added. On Wednesday, August 19, LTFRB authorized US-based Uber as the second company in the Philippines to operate under new rules governing application-based ride-sharing service providers. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) GrabCar secured its accreditation as TNC in July.

Sought for comment, Uber spokesperson Karun Arya said in an email: “We are committed to ensuring every one of our thousands of partner-drivers fulfill all the requirements under the TNC/TNVS regulations issued in May.” TNVS applications of Uber partners, according to Arya, are now being submitted on a daily basis to LTFRB.  “Due to the sheer volume of drivers on our platform, as well as the fact that we received our TNC accreditation just yesterday, we are using a phased approach for our partners’ TNVS application submissions,” Arya said. “Many of our partner-drivers depend on Uber for a living, and we are working with them to finalize their submissions as quickly as possible in close consultation and with the guidance of the LTFRB; to ensure all driver partners are fully accredited,” he added. – Rappler.com $1 = P46.69"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/102634-luis-manzano-kris-aquino-involvement-taxi-business-lbr/","title":"Luis Manzano clarifies Kris Aquino’s involvement in his taxi business","date":"Aug 19, 2015 9:45 PM PHT","snippet":"Kris also addresses accusations that she is participating in 'unfair competition' and has 'selfish motives' and clarifies the extent of her investment in Luis' company","body":"MANILA, Philippines – TV host Luis Manzano took the opportunity to clarify the involvement of Kris Aquino in his taxi business.

During rush hour, McKinley road slowly leaks cars out on to EDSA like a dirty sieve, and the 90 minutes I’d waste every day traversing the 7-kilometer loop was time I’d never get back. I imagine I’m right within the target markets of both Uber and GrabTaxi, the Philippines’ two competing ride-sharing services. I live in one densely-populated business district and work in another, own a smartphone with a data plan, and absolutely loathe haggling with cabbies. The economics of my transition were pretty straightforward. Daily parking in Makati is 180 pesos, my building parking in the Fort was 5,000 per month, and my gas consumption was 1,200 per week. The average month saw about 15,000 in car-related spending, if you didn’t account for the upkeep and insurance costs involved in maintaining a 6-year-old Honda Civic. Nowadays, I use a ride-sharing service 12 to 15 times a week. The BGC-to-Makati route costs somewhere between 100–140 pesos in moderate traffic, so I save about 7,000 to 8,000 pesos per month by giving up my Civic. Perhaps even more importantly, I gained 90 minutes of productive time daily. Where I previously had to focus on the road, I could now write emails, work on my web apps, watch movies or TV episodes, or just doze off. It’s interesting to watch how Uber and GrabCar (GrabTaxi’s non-taxi brand) have differentiated themselves over the past year. There’s no question that San Francisco-based Uber has the better user-interface and better overall experience. Even against its other US competitors  – Lyft and Sidecar — the Uber interface looks professional and reliable. On paper, its origins make it fundamentally ill-suited to hitting the mainstream here in the Philippines however, because it only accepts credit cards as payment. In contrast, the Malaysian GrabTaxi (GrabCar’s parent company) was born in the developing world and, in theory, better understands how to address ASEAN markets where credit card penetration is substantially lacking (only 5% in the Philippines). These differences affect passengers in interesting ways. Although Uber requires a credit card, it feels cheaper in the long run because drivers never have to make change. Because you’re handing GrabCar drivers cash at the end of each trip, you’re also more likely to just leave change with them, especially when it’s less than 20 pesos. (When you’re taking 60 trips a month, that overage does tend to add up.) Additionally, it’s not clear to me whether allowing cash transactions differentiates GrabCar to a significant enough degree from its competitor. Ride-sharing services are always going to be upper- and middle-class-only solutions in the developing world, in the same way that Starbucks is a luxury available only to the top two brackets of our population. The people who can afford to spend 300 pesos a day on transportation tend to come from the same 3–5% of the population who are most likely to have credit cards and mobile data plans. No one in the C, D, and E economic brackets can afford to spend over 30% of their household income on transportation  – that’s over 90% of the country. The effect of this economic gap is interesting when you compare it to the ride-sharing situation in San Francisco. According to my ride history, I took over 3 dozen Ubers while visiting the Bay Area, and in most cases, the driver owned their vehicle. In the Philippines, the majority of Uber and GrabCar drivers are employees of the car’s owners, many of whom are subject to the same “boundary” agreements as regular taxi drivers. One of my recent GrabCar drivers related a very familiar set of daily requirements from his employer: Once the car had accrued 2,500 pesos in earnings for the day, the driver would earn 90 pesos for each booking above that. In practice, he would make about 500–800 pesos per day over a 10-hour, 18-trip shift. If the 2500-peso minimum isn’t reached however, the driver makes nothing. As the government-imposed deadline for Uber’s licensing in the Philippines looms, my transportation situation and the livelihoods of thousands of car owners and drivers hang in the balance. On August 11, the LTFRB has declared that all Uber and GrabCar cars will be apprehended on the road if the service and the operators aren’t properly licensed. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) I am reminded of the oft-repeated joke that “licensing” is what it’s called when a government “takes away your right to do something and then sells it back to you.” Admittedly it’s a reductive way to look at the situation, but it’s hard to beat such a colourful soundbite. Under the new licensing plan, platforms like Uber and GrabCar will need to apply to be Transport Network Companies (TNCs), and their individual vehicle operators will have to apply to be franchisees. Both the networks and the individual operators will need to register their businesses with the BIR. Accompanying these announcements was some rhetoric about the government’s continued commitment to public commuter safety, buses-falling-off-skyways and MRTs-crashing-through-barriers notwithstanding. (READ: LTFRB to Uber: No one is above the law)  Uber’s legal status has been questioned a number of times in the 59 countries it currently operates in. In May 2015, Italy banned the UberPop service as being “unfairly competitive.” In June 2015, police arrested the Uber country directors for France and charged them with “enabling taxi-driving by nonprofessional drivers, among other crimes of entrepreneurship.” The $50B company seems more than capable of defending itself however, as their recent campaign and resulting victory against New York Mayor Bill de Blasio indicates. On the west coast, meanwhile, there’s an ongoing debate about whether Uber drivers are in fact employees of the company and thus entitled to health insurance and other benefits. To your average Filipino, the notion seems almost quaint — the regular taxi fleet operators here aren’t exactly renowned for giving their drivers any employee benefits. At the heart of all this is the notion that traditional industry is being disrupted by technology, and regulation is racing to keep up with innovation. The same thing happened to information and entertainment in the late 90’s and early 2000’s respectively, and is currently happening in the finance sector with the cryptocurrency revolution. There’s no question that ride-sharing solutions are providing compelling alternatives that are both environmentally-friendly and cost-effective, and it’s not clear whether these additional licensing requirements will make our respective Uber or GrabCar rides any safer than they already are. (READ: #CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes’) I don’t relish the idea of going back to driving myself through heavy traffic again every day, even if it were financially viable. Regulating the innovators only serves to equalize the playing field for the incumbents, and does nothing to improve the situation for citizens.

Such discussions highlighted some of the most pressing #CommuterProblems – and it also created confusion among Filipino netizens.  On Thursday, August 13, automotive journalist James Deakin alleged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) of being “so unreasonably hard on Uber.” This comes after the Philippine government’s call for a nationwide clampdown on unregistered Uber and GrabCar vehicles, after licensed taxi operators protested unfair competition.  “They are starting their own service called premium taxi, which is just another racket and another inept way of reinventing the wheel! This is appalling,” Deakin said in his original Facebook post. His post quickly went viral, scoring over 3,000 likes and 6,000 shares as of Saturday, August 15.  LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez responded also through Facebook, clarifying that “the allegation that Premium Taxi was created to compete with Uber and GrabCar is without basis in fact and in law.” Ginez also stressed that the DOTC and LTFRB are not putting Uber and GrabCar out of business, but merely asking the two to apply for franchise. Deakin then wrote an open letter to the LTFRB and DOTC, saying he is not against the Premium Taxi service but only concerned that it may “replace” or “compete unevenly” with Uber. He also edited his original Facebook post: “In the spirit of fairness to the LTFRB, I have edited (at their request) the term ‘starting their own service’ to ‘starting a new service’ so that it is clear to all that it does not belong to them as operators, but solely as regulators. Hope this clears things up. The rest of the rant is a matter of opinion.” Misinformation? The debate, however, is yet to rest. On Saturday, lawyer Yves Gonzalez shared on Facebook screengrabs of his online discussion with Deakin regarding Uber and LTFRB. Gonzalez, a former traffic official of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), said that as an Uber customer, he wants the latter to comply with the government’s requirements. “But the disinformation that has spread recently regarding Premium Taxi has been grossly unfair to the government regulators, taking into consideration how accommodating they have been to Uber and the like,” Gonzalez added. “The ball is in Uber’s court now to comply with the ‘historic’ progressive regulations they hailed back in May 2015.”  Gonzalez emphasized the fact that while GrabCar has been able to follow LTFRB’s accreditation procedures, Uber has not done so.    Meanwhile, Deakin pointed out that the government should should not treat Uber operators like “criminals,” especially since they still have August 21 to meet LTFRB’s regulations.     The LTFRB itself also clarified that the Premium Taxi category is not new and is not owned by the board. Here is a timeline of events:"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/102632-commuter-watch-metro-manila-public-transportation/","title":"#CommuterWatch: ‘Choosy’ taxi drivers and other transport woes","date":"Aug 15, 2015 8:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Netizens weigh in on the MRT problem and the controversy regarding regular taxis and 'Transport Network Vehicle Services'","body":"  MANILA, Philippines – Frustrated commuters took to Twitter and Facebook to complain about  never-ending transportation woes in Metro Manila.

Myles Delfin, a designer and entrepreneur, wrote: Every single day, the problem of the commuting public is that taxis, jeepneys, and buses are so badly regulated that commuters are left at the mercy of whoever is behind the wheel, and now the LTFRB is going after the only reliable form of transportation available to the Filipino? I think, the people who lead this agency should try standing in line at any of the taxi stands in a shopping mall on a payday Friday – and every day thereafter, just to let them feel what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nonsense. They’re forgetting that it’s not only about the law, their job, if they decide to take it seriously, is to make sure that the Filipino gets the service they deserve. The reality of the situation is that it is time for public transportation to evolve because it doesn’t work and the government agency tasked to make it work has consistently failed. Independent innovators like Uber and GrabTaxi wouldn’t have any business if public transport actually worked, and the LTFRB has had decades to find a solution and make it work, and now they want us to entrust our safety, peace of mind, and time to an idea that is basically a knock-off of the service they’re trying to pin down. For what reason? The law? Regular taxi drivers mock the law every minute of the day whenever they disregard the regulations that are in place to make sure the riding public aren’t abused or taken advantage of, everybody knows this from experience, and where is the official concern there? Taxi drivers at the airport virtually try to rob people blind whenever they step out of the arrival terminal, isn’t that about the law too? Jeepneys cause traffic whenever they pick up and unload passengers at all the wrong places, why isn’t that a priority? Others shared some of their experiences on the road. Judy Marie Santiago, a communications officer, said: One time, I can’t find a cab on Grabtaxi and got desperate. Buses are jampacked, MRT queues are hopeless. I had to give a tip of 100 just to get one.  Hep Benitez, an author and teacher, commented: I always have to pay an additional 50 pesos or 100 pesos on top of the metered bill just to get a taxi. Edna Ledesma-Javier complained about the flagdown rate: Isn’t it that the flag down was already reduced to Php30? The first week it was announced all the taxis had this placard in front that says flag down is less than 10 pesos. Now, they do not have it. And when you ask for it they feigned innocence. Jordan Zamoranos shared his picture of a taxi driver who allegedly refused to take him from Ortigas to Glorietta.  Kaizel Sarabia said: Everytime we went to the Malate area and ride a cab from there to my house, we always encounter cab drivers like that. Mostly, they demand 100 percent increase in fare. James Habitan shared his experience:  The taxi driver asked for a deposit for 100 pesos so he could get me to ATC faster. Immediately, I know I was going to get ripped off so I threatened to leave the taxi to find myself a new one unless he charges me by the meter. Sure enough, as soon as I opened the door, the driver gave in to my conditions and turned his meter on. We got to ATC right away and I was only charged just under Php70.00. Dheejhae Flores urged LTFRB to be responsive on social media: Sana may Facebook Page din ang LTFRB na sumasagot gaya ng MMDA. May Twitter nga sila, never naman sumasagot.” Redi Briones reported many times to the LTO hotline after a UV express driver shouted at him for not having the exact fare. He wonders what happened to those cases with special codes. Briones also suggested that public utility vehicle drivers should undergo customer relations training, and that holding a professional driver’s license should not be the sole requirement for the job. “We always prefer alternatives over real solutions” A few netizens offered their own recommendations. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>I think the priority should be on the BRTs &amp; not on premium taxis.

I’d say it’s a win-win.

Taxis are threatened by Grab and Uber because of the quality of service those brands provide so it’s high time taxis should also reinvent the wheel. Why would the commuting public go for Uber and Grab if their services are as good as these brands? Quality of the vehicle is also in question. Uber and Grab utilize private cars that are well maintained and taken care of by the owners while Taxis are the exact opposite,” observed  Raymond Lam Ko, on the other hand, suggested: Fix the transportation system so people wouldn’t rely on taxis and uber like app services. Fix and expand the train system, fix or update the bus system, fix the taxi drivers and units, update jeepneys to non smoke belching if not to phase them out, tricycles can be maintained for small streets only or in subdivisions. But IMHO, if trains are fixed, traffic will lessen because more people will take the train rather than taxi. This was echoed by Gene Angelo Ferrer, National Coordinator of Aksyon Klima.

We all understand the need for regulation, so long as it not at the cost of innovation.'","body":"Editor’s note: This is an open letter to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). It is a rejoinder to LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez’ Facebook post clarifying allegations that DOTC and LTFRB are being “so unreasonably hard on Uber.” (READ: LTFRB to Uber: No one is above the law) Dear DOTC and LTFRB, Hi, I just read your official response to my post about the premium taxis. Firstly, thank you for your swift reply. I genuinely appreciate it. How I wish we could all enjoy the same response time when we complain about far more serious things, like reckless and speeding buses, cab drivers that rape, rob and extort their passengers, jeepneys that break every safety, environmental, and traffic rule ever written by God and man, as well as countless other blatant violations that assault us every time we hit the road. But for the sake of clarity, let’s go back to Uber and the Premium taxis. Regarding the allegation that Premium Taxi was created to compete with Uber and GrabCar being without basis, I think we misunderstand each other. I am not against premium taxis competing against Uber. To the contrary, I’m actually all for it. I’m only concerned about premium taxis replacing Uber. Or competing unevenly. Big difference. (READ: LTFRB to start unregistered Uber, GrabCar clampdown) Introducing fair competition into the market is what made Uber and Grab so successful so far, so I would be a hypocrite if I felt any other way. In fact, as inefficient and unsafe as our taxi system is as a whole, had Uber and Grab replaced it, I would be just as up in arms as I believe in the power of choice. And that is all that we, the riding public, are fighting for here. Nothing more, nothing less. To your credit, your reply was fair, very well-written and made a very strong argument about the DOTC and LTFRB being the only national agency in the world to issue the governing regulations for Uber and GrabCar to operate legally in a country. You also mentioned how Uber executives and some media hailed you as a progressive agency. And I agree. I was even one of those blowing your horn. I even did a special feature on CNN Philippines trumpeting just that fact and went on to spend a day in the life of an Uber operator to understand how it worked, and encourage others to look at getting into the business of ride sharing. Because I, like most users, believe in the concept. But with respect, I’m not the only one who feels that your argument is only very strong in words. In reality, and I’m not sure how aware you are of this, the operators are claiming anything but transparency or simplicity. Basically the words are sweet, but the experience is sour. Allow me to quote from an open letter written by the operators of Uber. Keep in mind, these are the partners/drivers who are on the front lines.  “Even after we seek information and advice from the LTFRB Head Office, no one knows the guidelines to implement these memoranda. No one can explain to us and give us definitive answers about the requirements we need to submit and what these all means for us. Isn’t there supposedly an Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) to outline the process? Even the Transport Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Grab have no idea how everyone should go about implementing and rolling out these memoranda, and how to implement this transition. Are we to accredit individually with LTFRB? Will the Transport Network Companies (i.e., Uber and Grab) facilitate the accreditation of all the partners for easier compliance? We are all at a loss. We hope you are not.” So while I commend your agency on creating the framework for these operators to legalise themselves, it is worth nothing until that is communicated down to the people who are actually tasked to facilitate it. As it is now, if we were to use the experience of the ones actually physically applying, those guidelines are as clear as something that was faxed to an email address. So in theory, it is all very straight forward, but in reality, like anyone who has ever applied for a franchise to operate a public utility vehicle will attest, it is anything but. So no, the issue was never about whether you have any right to set up a premium taxi service. Personally, I don’t understand how adding 5,000+ new cars on the road instead of allowing the current ones to share their ride will solve the problem. Nor do I see how a 2-litre sedan will hold any premium over a 1.6 or 1.8 equivalent in any other area except added fuel consumption and emissions, but if your studies show otherwise and your operators are willing to make the 25 million plus peso investment to reinvent the wheel, then may the G Force be with you all;  just promise us you won’t do it at the expense of denying the private sector from providing a tried and proven alternative. Basically, don’t force us to buy cassette tapes when someone is offering us MP3. (READ: Corruption at LTO, LTFRB) Your followers also accused my post of being “share bait.” Okay, I admit I was uncharacteristically emotional in my post, and in hindsight could have chosen my words better. But I was expressing those views on my personal Facebook page and not in any one of the national media outlets that I represent. Still, I will accept where I was wrong and will strive to improve by tempering myself when I publish anything on social media. And I urge you to do the same. Because as the operators themselves have pointed out in the same open letter, when it comes to dialogue, use the media in a positive, more informative way. Help us understand and guide us through this transition and we’ll help you implement this regulation the best and fastest way possible. It doesn’t help, and we don’t appreciate, hearing (negative) news on TV and social media about threats, deadlines and rules we don’t have any idea about. Instead make good use of media, publish news, issue statements and advisories to give us guidance re implementation and help us comply. We heard there was a publication on the newspaper about the deadline. Nobody has seen it, because seriously, how many people read the newspaper daily anymore? You could have published that online or made a proper public announcement on TV. Let us know who should help us. Would it be LTFRB? Would it be the TNCs (Uber, Grab,etc.)? Because we are more than willing to cooperate and help. We just need guidance and information. It is us who are braving the harsh streets of Metro Manila, we think we ought to know. We are already serving the public by providing safe and efficient transportation. Please spare us the bureaucracy. We do not need more red tape. Inform and guide us quickly, so we can comply faster.” Simply put, times are changing. And we need our government agencies to keep up. We all understand the need for regulation, so long as it not at the cost of innovation. You ended by paraphrasing former Mayor Fred Lim, when he said “The law should apply to all or to no one at all. Simply put, no one is above the law.” True. But I prefer how JFK (John F. Kennedy) put it when he asked not what your country could do for you. – Rappler.com James Deakin is a multi-media, Henry Ford Award hall of fame automotive journalist, who has covered the motoring scene for over 12 years and driven everything from an ambulance on duty to a Formula One car.

Below is LTFRB’s unedited reply: On May 8, 2015, the Department of Transportation and Communications ((DOTC) Issued Department Order No. 2015-11 creating new modes of transportation vehicles such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Airport Bus, Transport Network Vehicle Service (e.g., Uber and GrabCar) and Premium Taxi. The purpose of said policy issuance is to improve mobility of our people and provide high quality transportation services to our commuting public.  Pursuant to the DO, LTFRB held on July 24, 2015 a consultation among PUV operators, primarily taxi operators, regarding its draft Memorandum Circular to implement the roll out of Premium Taxi. The Notice of Public Consultation and the operating conditions for a Premium Taxi was published in major newspaper of general circulation, posted in LTFRB website and LTFRB Citizen Enforcer account in Facebook.  The allegation that Premium Taxi was created to compete with Uber and GrabCar is without basis in fact and in law. Premium taxis are of higher end since only sedans with engine displacement of 2.0 or higher will be accepted. No SUVs, AUVs and vans will be accepted. Thus, the cars that are acceptable are Toyota Altis 2.0, Toyota Camry, Benz, and the like. Notably, our neighbor Asean cities such as Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur and Singapore have Premium Taxis many years ago. It is high time that we offer the same kind of high quality and modern taxis to our people.  Unlike Uber and GrabCar, premium taxis are marked vehicles with common color (black), will sport YELLOW plates (unlike Uber and GrabCar, etc). Other operating conditions of Premium Taxi include: (1) a qualified operator is required to have minimum of 25 units each to ensure that only financially capable operators will be granted franchise; (2) they have taxi meters; (3) they have top lights identifying them as Premium Taxis; and (4) they can pick and drop passengers through street hail unlike Uber and GrabCar that can only be booked through online application. The goal of rolling out Premium Taxi is to provide alternative taxi transport to more discerning and higher end taxi passengers who are willing and ready to pay higher fare for better service. The target clientele of Premium Taxi are domestic and international tourists, professionals, millennials, and the like. The application for Premium Taxi under the draft MC will be open and transparent as it will undergo three stages: pre-qualification (legal, technical and financial), selection and application for franchise.  DOTC and LTFRB, in apprehending UNREGISTERED Uber and GrabCar vehicles, DO NOT and WILL NOT put Uber or GrabCar out of business. We just want them to apply for and be granted with franchise by complying with the Dept Order and MCs that were issued three (3) months ago. It is worthy to mention that after DOTC and LTFRB issued the governing rules for Uber and GrabCar to operate legally in the Philippines, Uber hailed the Philippines as a tech-forward country.   While in other countries Uber is either fighting government regulators or its drivers being apprehended and fined heavily by police authorities, the Philippines, through DOTC and LTFRB, was the first country in the world to issue comprehensive regulations to make its operations compliant with our public service laws. This was despite the lobbying of taxi operators for DOTC and LTFRB not to allow the operations of Uber and GrabCar in the Philippines. In fact, Uber urged other countries, such as Thailand, to use the Philippine regulation as basis of their own regulation of TNCs and TNVS. (Philippine regulation on TNCs to be used as a basis in Thailand.  Yet, despite that the Philippine regulations became effective on May 30, 2015 or more than two (2) months ago, Uber has not yet applied for accreditation. Its partner vehicles continue to ply our streets and engage in public land transportation without the requisite franchise. Though DOTC officials reached out to Uber officials urging them to comply with the registration regulations, Uber just kept on promising that it will file its application. Thus, in fulfillment of our sworn duty to implement our public land transportation law, DOTC and LTFRB gave Uber and its partner vehicles and the partner vehicles of GrabCar (which is LTFRB accredited already) until August 20 to apply for and be granted a franchise.  To paraphrase former Mayor Fred Lim, the law should apply to all or to no one at all. Simply put, no one is above the law. The Philippine government ordered a nationwide clampdown on unregistered online ride-sharing service providers like Uber, after licensed regular taxi operators protested unfair competition. Operators of Uber, and competitor GrabCar will be apprehended starting Friday, August 21, if they are unable to secure the necessary franchise or provisional authority from the LTFRB.  In October 2014, LTFRB stopped apprehending unregistered online ride-sharing providers, following an outcry from commuters. This paved the way for the DOTC and LTFRB to create new transport categories, legalizing the new public utility vehicle (PUV) players. Uber is a ride-sharing service where users can take advantage of an app to request rides, as well as track where their reserved vehicle is coming from. Users of the service pay using their credit cards, with the rate calculated by a measure of distance and time spent on the road. – Rappler.com Join MovePH’s Twitter Conversation on Friday, August 14, at 4:30 pm.

Operators of Uber, and competitor GrabCar will be apprehended starting Friday, August 21, if they are unable to secure the necessary franchise or provisional authority from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), chairman Winston Ginez said in a text message on Tuesday, August 11. It was in October 2014 when LTFRB stopped apprehending unregistered online ride-sharing providers, following an outcry from commuters. This paved the way for the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and LTFRB to create new transport categories, legalizing the new public utility vehicle (PUV) players. Accreditation issues In May this year, the Philippine government introduced new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion. One of these is Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which are vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi. But after 3 months since its implementation, there are still TNVS operators who have not applied for TNVS accreditation. Despite their non-compliance with the regulations, the private vehicles accredited by Uber and GrabCar are plying and earning from the service of public transportation, without the requisite franchise, the LTFRB chairman said. “Though the regulations were issued in May, only GrabCar applied for accreditation as of today. But despite its accreditation as a transportation network company (TNC), GrabCar’s partner vehicles are yet to apply for franchise with LTFRB,” Ginez said. Individual GrabCar operators will have until August 20 to apply for TNVS franchises and continue their operations. Starting August 21, the LTFRB said it will start apprehending unregistered TNCs and TNVS operators. Uber, according to LTFRB, has not applied for TNC accreditation yet. “3 months had lapsed but Uber has yet to submit its application for accreditation,” Ginez said. “I’ve been receiving public criticism. Despite this, we will continue to implement the law without fear or favor,” Ginez said. Under Joint Administrative Order (JAO) 2014-01, owners of private vehicles that operate as PUVs will be fined P200,000 ($4,346.90) each, and be impounded for 3 months. Sought for comment, Uber said it is confident of completing requirements by August 20. “We are working closely with the DOTC and LTFRB and are confident of completing the relevant formalities for accreditation in the time stipulated,” Uber spokesperson Karun Arya said in an email. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/100932-house-transportation-committee-report-proposals-dotc-agencies/","title":"House panel scolds transport agencies for not improving services","date":"Jul 29, 2015 10:03 PM PHT","snippet":"DOTC, LTO, LTFRB, LRT, MRT officials have until August 12 to submit reports on how they have improved their services, or their budgets for 2016 are in peril","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and its attached agencies got a scolding from lawmakers on Wednesday, July 29, for failing to act on recommendations to improve their services. In his “State of the Committee Address,” committee chairman Catanduanes Representative Cesar Sarmiento said most of their recommendations “were not taken into heart” by the transportation agencies. In his report, Sarmiento noted the number of bills and investigations the House panel had conducted on various issues in the transport sector, such as: Sarmiento ordered transportation agencies to submit by August 12 progress reports on how they addressed the recommendations raised by lawmakers during the committee hearings. Failure to meet the deadline would be taken into consideration during Congress’ deliberations on the agencies’ proposed budget for 2016, he added. In his address, Sarmiento reiterated the committee’s proposals for various transportation agencies. For the Land Transportation Office (LTO), Sarmiento said the agency must improve its tests for drivers’ license applications, noting that the number of road accidents and deaths could be prevented if only those who are fit to drive are granted the licenses. “Hindi lamang trabaho ng LTO ang pag-issue ng plastic licenses. Dapat siguraduhing karapat-dapat ang binibigyan ng lisensiya,” he said. (It is not the LTO’s job to merely issue plastic licenses. It must also ensure that only those who are fit to drive are given a license.) For the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Sarmiento recommended that it conducts a scientific study to determine what routes are used by the public, and to stop issuing new franchises for public utility vehicles “until there’s basis to do so.” He also reiterated that while Congress welcomes innovation in transportation – referring to transportation network companies like Uber and GrabTaxi – LTFRB must work with Congress to enact a law that will allow these services to operate legally. For the railway sector, Sarmiento urged the Philippine National Railways to implement and finish projects under its P2.4 billion budget for 2015. He also told officials of the Light Rail Transit and MRT3 to ensure the efficient implementation of its rehabilitation projects and upgrade of facilities. For the MRT3, which has been plagued by frequent glitches and breakdowns, Sarmiento demanded a plan to figure out how to repair and operate 20 train sets that were out of service. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/99429-rappler-undp-social-good-partnership/","title":"Rappler and UNDP to work together for ‘social good’","date":"Jul 19, 2015 3:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Rappler and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) agree to work together on a series of initiatives that will fuse innovation, social media, and technology for development","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A partnership for ‘social good’. Rappler and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) committed to pursue this on Monday, July 13 in Makati as they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to share knowledge and collaborate on the following: Titon Mitra, UNDP Philippines Country Director, and Maria Ressa, Rappler CEO and Executive Editor, lead the signing of the MOU. ‘Uber of the NGO world’ As the United Nations (UN)’s leading development agency, the UNDP aids countries in improving the quality of life of their people. In the Philippines, it has partnered with over 30 national and local government agencies, as well as private institutions such as Social Watch and the Ateneo School of Government. UNDP programs include the promotion of good governance, improvement of disaster management and risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). “UNDP has always done important work and I’ve covered it in the last 30 years in all of the countries of Southeast Asia,” said Ressa in her speech following the MOU signing. She added that Rappler hopes to help UNDP become the “Uber” of the non-governmental organization (NGO) world through the use of technology, referring to the mobile-based ride-sharing platform that has achieved global success since its launch in 2009. “I say the Uber model of the NGO world because Uber doesn’t own cars, Airbnb doesn’t own any hotel rooms. And yet, Airbnb is now the top hotel group globally,” she said. “This is what technology is doing.”  Innovation Ressa sees that the opportunity for UNDP lies in the potential for crowdsourcing and community building, and social networking. She cited examples such as the Million People March which mobilized thousands via social networks and MovePH’s own Project Agos which lets the crowd report critical information in real time. (READ about the discussion on technology in the 2013 PH+Social Good Summit). MovePH is Rappler’s civic engagement arm. “These communities will become communities of action when they get the right information,” she said. Ressa added that while organizations such as Rappler provide information or “the kernel around which action can happen,” action is ultimately driven by communities, partners, and people’s organizations. The matter of engaging with communities and having greater interaction with communities is an opportunity UNDP’s Mitra is looking forward to in the Rappler-UNDP collaboration. “This is about learning about how you interact in a new world of information exchange which is much broader than the socialness of social media. I see plenty of opportunities well beyond the traditional use of media, which is to use it for public relations – in other words, to wave a flag and tell a story about how well UNDP is doing,” he said. According to him, the thematic areas UNDP is currently working on include emerging global agendas such as the agreement on climate change at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris this December and the global agreement on Sustainable Development Goals, a new set of targets that follow and expand on the MDGs. In the Philippines, the UNDP is focused on sustaining local biodiversity, combatting the spread of HIV/AIDS, and anti-corruption and good governance. (READ: Climate change: Key dates on the way to Paris accord) These areas, Mitra says, need the attention and engagement that can come from the communities created by social media. “The most important part is not just getting the message out, but getting an interaction with our stakeholders and that is where the potential is. It’s expertise that we don’t have in UNDP and certainly Rappler does and we want to draw on that expertise to increase the level of engagement with our stakeholders,” he said. Potential According to Rappler Social Media Manager Stacy de Jesus, the potential for social media to amplify the work of international development agencies like the UNDP is immense. Citing Rappler campaigns such as #SharePH, #ShowThePope, and even the #SaveMaryJane campaign, de Jesus emphasized that the energy of social media users can be harnessed to fuel online and on-the-ground advocacies. “Believing in the capacity of social media,” she said, is the “first step and it makes a big difference.” “It’s not the tools that empower the people – it’s the people using the tools,” she added. “This is a time when social news networking becomes social collaboration – you work together for a cause. And social media brings together people with a cause.” Using the “new language” of social media is a matter Mitra sees as innovative and necessary for UNDP. “The challenge for UNDP is really [in] our ability to be innovative. In many ways, the way we communicate is old-school, we use old technology. So we really have to get to the ‘new school’,” he said. “The message [of UNDP] is actually a message that is very important to all Filipinos. It’s about the development of the Philippines in a global context, but we have to be able to open ways that resonates with the population and I think this is where the real opportunities are. We speak in old language and we now have to speak in new language,” Mitra added. – Rappler.com For more information about the UNDP in the Philippines, visit the UNDP country website.

Singapore-based GrabCar got the jump on US rival Uber which is still submitting documents to comply with the Philippines’ new regulations, said Mary Ann Salada, spokeswoman of the government’s land transport bureau. Ride-sharing services – typically Internet and mobile app-based alternatives to traditional taxis – are gaining popularity in the Philippine capital Manila, notorious for creaking train systems, decrepit buses and traffic jams. The government unveiled new guidelines for the industry in May after complaints from taxi cab operators. In some other countries, taxi drivers have held protests against ride-booking apps – arguing they represent unfair competition. But GrabCar and other “transport network companies,” will operate under different rules from taxi cabs, said Salada. “We consider the transport network companies as distinct from the taxi industry,” she told Agence France-Presse. GrabCar vehicles can now only be summoned via smartphones and the Internet, and cannot pick up customers who hail them on the street like taxi cabs, she said. She added that they can only accept credit card payments. But like taxi drivers, GrabCar drivers will have to get a franchise licence from the transport bureau and their customers will be covered under the same obligatory insurance as taxi passengers. GrabCar drivers will also have a higher franchise fee, which must be renewed annually compared to seven years for taxi drivers. Additionally, their vehicles will be allowed a shorter “lifespan” than taxi cabs, Salada said. “With full accreditation, more Filipino commuters will be able to use GrabCar and be confident that we offer a legitimate and safe private hire service,” GrabCar Philippines said in a statement on its website. “We will now focus on rapidly expanding our GrabCar service to serve more passengers across the Philippines,” it added. The head of GrabCar Philippines, Natasha Bautista, confirmed that her company had obtained government authorisation. She expressed confidence it would succeed even under the new rules. GrabCar is already available in the Philippine capital but Bautista declined to say how many vehicles were operating under their system. The Philippines is the first country to institute nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the transport department and ride-sharing companies.

The two Uber bosses handed themselves in to police on Monday for questioning in relation to a probe launched in 2014 of the San Francisco-based company. The investigation is targeting the UberPOP service offered by the company, in which clients are put in touch with cheaper, unlicensed drivers who are generally everyday people trying to make a bit of extra money. The service has raised the hackles of cabbies around Europe who complain of unfair competition from drivers who do not face the same regulations as they do, and undercut their pricing. (READ: Judge bans Uber in Spain) UberPOP has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and it continues to operate. A taxi strike in France last week turned violent as drivers set fire to vehicles and blocked highways, creating a headache for thousands of tourists. The French investigation is also targeting the casual UberPOP drivers for “illegally exercising the taxi profession,” the prosecutor’s statement said. One UberPOP driver in France has already been given a 15-day suspended prison sentence while 79 other cases are under way. A total of 202 fines have been handed out.  The Uber managers will appear in court on September 30.  The taxi strike in France last week saw some 3,000 cabbies block access to the capital’s Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports. Ten people were arrested, seven police officers were injured and 70 vehicles were damaged in clashes between Uber drivers and taxi drivers. And on at least two occasions in Strasbourg in eastern France last week, taxi drivers posed as customers in order to lure Uber drivers to isolated spots where they were assaulted by cabbies and their vehicles damaged. Uber, which offers several types of ride-sharing services, claims to have 400,000 users of its low-cost UberPOP service in France.

Because of this, Barrett wrote, Uber must “indemnify an employee for all that the employee necessarily expends in the discharge of the employee’s duties.” Berwick had requested the reimbursement of tolls and others expenses incurred while driving. But if all drivers are classified as employees, it could require Uber to pay hefty amounts for social security, workers’ compensation and other charges.

Regular taxi operators went through tedious process and inspection just to get franchise for our units. Foreign companies, like Uber, are given leeway, while local operators had difficult time just to get license,” Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) President Jesus Manuel Bong Suntay said in a phone interview. The government earlier announced the introduction of 4 new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.” These new categories are the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. After the announcement, the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) also in May laid out the rules and regulations for the new transport categories. Under the guidelines, those who want to operate a TNVS should always be in good standing with its accredited Transportation Network Company (TNC). “The franchise for the TNVS will be revoked if the accreditation is cancelled by the TNC or if the certificate of the TNC is revoked by the Board,” the LTFRB memorandum circular read. Equal, fair fight “That regulation is unfair. Why is the TNC accrediting TNVS? Shouldn’t it be LTFRB? Regular taxi cabs are being accredited by LTFRB. It should be the same with TNVS,” Suntay said. “In addition, LTFRB limited the number of units every regular taxi operator should have. But with TNCs, there is no limit. Why is that the case? This just goes to show that there is an unfair treatment,” Suntay said. “The government is even allowing them [Uber vehicles] to ply even if they still haven’t applied for accreditation. In fact, dapat hulihin sila because they are still considered colorum,” Suntay added. The chief of PNTOA, however, clarified that the taxi industry is “not against the ride-sharing service providers, we are just asking them to do it legally.” “The only thing we want is an equal and fair fight,” he added. Suntay said his association has already asked the transportation department and LTFRB “to change the regulations for TNVS and give us a fair fight, but they did not hear us.” Here to stay Despite the local taxi industry’s bid to change the TNVS regulations, transportation spokesperson Michael Arthur Sagcal said that his department accepts that ride-hailing applications like Uber, GrabTaxi, Easy Taxi and Tripda, are part of the contemporary landscape. Sagcal added that technological developments that enabled Uber “are here to stay.” “We understand the threat that taxi operators feel due to the TNVS classification as concern about their business interests. The government’s concern, however, is providing better commuting options,” Sagcal said. Rather than fight the government over these ride-sharing service apps, the taxi industry should modernize and improve its services, he said.  “The public taxi operators should improve and modernize their servces rather than deprive the public of an efficient safe comfortable transport options,” Sagcal said. – Rappler.com Black and yellow taxi card with taxi car image from Shutterstock  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/93725-mmda-carpooling-app-congestion/","title":"On Facebook?

There’s an app for that. After launching its traffic navigation app in 2011, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is now tapping social media in another bid to ease traffic congestion and pollution in the city. On Monday, May 18, the MMDA launched “Friend Trip,” a free mobile app that allows carpooling among Facebook friends. MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino said the new app aims to help ease traffic congestion by encouraging friends heading to the same area to share a car and reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.  This would also help reduce pollution in the city, Tolentino added. “Some cars only have one or two occupants. These vehicles eat up a lot of space on the road. They contribute to a high level of pollution and increase road traffic,” he added. Drivers offering rides post their route, time of trip, number of seats available, car type, and plate number of the vehicle.To use the app, riders and drivers must both be Facebook users and friends with each other. Upon launch, users need to key in their phone numbers and log in to Facebook. Passengers looking for rides will need to search for trips heading toward their destination, send a “join” request, and wait for approval. A red indicator means the car is already full. A yellow indicator means the request is pending, while a green indicator means there’s an available seat in the car. Because the app works among users who are already Facebook friends, Tolentino said both passengers and drivers are assured of safety. “You won’t take someone on as a passenger if he’s not a friend. Likewise, you won’t ride along if you’re not friends with the driver,” Tolentino said. The MMDA chairman also said the agency is mulling incentives for frequent users of the app, such as exempting their vehicles from the number coding scheme or extending window hours. Meanwhile, the Philippine National Police (PNP) expressed support for the newly launched app, but reminded motorists to exercise vigilance in broadcasting their activities on social media. In a statement on Tuesday, May 19, PNP spokesperson Senior Superintendent Bartolome Tobias advised motorists to verify the social media accounts of their friends and family to avoid being duped by fake accounts. “Criminal elements may pose as your friend and know the exact details of your travel activities,” Tobias said. MMDA’s Friend Trip app is currently available on Google Play for Android devices. It will soon be available on the Apple Store for iOS devices. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/93345-destination-music-festivals-summer-summer-wave/","title":"How destination music festivals ride the summer wave","date":"May 17, 2015 5:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Adventure travel companies are combining the allure of the beach and live music to create unique experiences","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Here’s a typical scenario in the country, especially Metro Manila, during the scorching months from April to July: It’s hot and humid in your house and you want to find something to do somewhere to escape. Adventure tour organizers have hit upon a new formula to address this by combining their usual repertoire of offering adventure packages with the quintessential summer destination – the beach. Add a live music component and you now have a destination festival, a new trend sweeping the country. “It’s a great way to combine the allure of the beach during the summer, the sense of adventure that young people want and the ever popular live music,” said Pat Valera, co-producer of the Summer Siren Festival together with his brother, who is Managing Partner at adventure travel agency Travel Factor. There are a few established destination music festivals right now, including Malasimbo in Puerto Galera, Soul Surf in La Union, Summer Siren in Zambales, and some in Cebu and Davao, he said. Adding value to the mix The Manila festival scene is congested and they couldn’t find a way to add value for their participants, so they decided to venture into holding the festivals in places people would usually visit, explained Valera. The beach is the ideal venue because aside from its allure during the summer, it also gives organizers different ways to entice participants. “Esentially all of the destination festivals are the same. They generally combine a concert at night with various beach activities during the day like surfing, yoga. Regardless of whatever you have there, it will be fun because you’re at the beach,” said Jackie Yap, co-founder at Fliptrip, organizers of the Nalu Music Fest, held at the Nalu surf resort in Baler, Aurora over the Labor Day weekend. Social marketing The beach component also has the benefit of drawing in communities, like the local surfing community – which is why many are held at surfing destination like La Union, Aurora, and Zambales. “The networks of local Philippine surfers are very wide. Everyone knows each other. So if they go, everybody will go along with them,” Yap said. Since the target market for these events is college students and young people between the ages of 21 and 35, this kind of word of mouth plays a key role, and social media amplifies this. Valera confirmed that 90% of the publicity for their recently concluded Summer Siren event was done exclusively through social media, as young people trust their networks.  More sponsorship avenues The day activities provide organizers with lots of unique ways to attract a wide variety sponsors that target niches rather than just the usual mix. If an event features a surfing competition, then you can get specialized companies that cater to that segment, like Quiksilver, Fluid Surf, and Stoked, Yap said. The Summer Siren festival incorporated camping for instance, with the tents provided by goods manufacturer Coleman while co-organizer Lifestyle Network sponsored dreamcatcher-making and ukele workshops. Since the event involves traveling, another unique way of covering costs is to partner with new transportation providers. Fliptrip intends to partner with ride-sharing platform Tripda for future events to help with the logistical burden, and also because the unique experience Tripda offers dovetails well with the vibe people have when attending a festival, Yap said. Ideally, an organizer would want as many sponsors as possible to cover the expenses of the event, she added.  It’s the music Both Valera and Yap agree that the concerts at night draw the most participants. Since most festivals are held over 3 days, one strategy involves fielding artists of different genres on different nights to attract different crowds. “Most of the older attendees who are already working are attracted to bands, while Electronic Dance Music (EDM) artists really bring in the college crowd,” Valera explained. A common thread running through these festivals, with a few exceptions, is the focus on homegrown artists. This is deliberate, Valera said, to provide a platform to showcase local talents and because they really connect with local audiences. Featuring local artists also helps with costs, with the average local artist fee ranging from as low as P20,000 to P60,000 ($450-$1350) while an average international act will cost around P300,000 ($6750) and up, plus the cost of flying them and their crew in, Valera estimated. This is significant, said Valera, since the average expenditure on music is about 40% of the overall cost of the festival – if you find the right mix.  Planning is crucial Because of the complexity, planning ahead is crucial. Valera said they planned this year’s Summer Siren event 6 months ahead, for instance. “Being very hands-on to find the right mix is essential. You can’t just throw money and hope it works,” Valera said. This approach led to several high-profile festival failures last year, where attendance was either well below expectations or the cost of organizing spiraled out of control. “If an organizer meets his overhead costs by getting the sponsors, and gets the mix right, then every ticket sold should be profit,” Valera said. Heating up Valera thinks that despite some failures last year, the prospects for destination festivals are brighter than ever. “The word is out and people are really responding, as can be seen from the established festivals increasing their attendance every year,” he said. Travel Factor, having doubled its attendance this year from its first year, is planning on taking on the Siren brand in different parts of the year.  Fliptrip is planning a couple of festivals in the next few months to establish itself: one in Zambales in June to July of this year to kickoff the surf season, as well as one in Baler at the end of the summer when the weather cools. “It will be a light-hearted, quirky event featuring a surf competition in costumes, and it will be for charity with all the proceeds going to local communities,” Yap said. The start-up sees these festivals as the ideal way to get its name out as it creates the vibe they want on their other trip offerings. “Festivals are always exciting, even if it doesn’t turn a profit. It’s a lot of stress but it’s fun and that’s what travel is really,” Yap said – Rappler.com $ 1 = P44.45"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/92857-new-transport-categories/","title":"Taxis beware: Gov’t introduces 4 new transport categories","date":"May 11, 2015 8:45 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The new transport categories are meant to ease traffic congestion, not kill the taxi industry, DOTC says.","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Traditional taxi companies may soon face increased competition, as the government on Monday, May 11, announced the introduction of 4 new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.” These new categories are the “Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit,” Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said in media briefing. ‘TNVS’ ride-sharing services Vehicles of application-based, ride-sharing service providers, like Uber, GrabTaxi, Tripda, and EasyTaxi, will now fall under the category TNVS.  TNVS will cover vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation, using an online-enabled application or platform technology to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles, Abaya said. These new rules will also allow ride-sharing service providers to accept regular passengers heading to any point of destination in the country, Abaya added. Operators of TNVS, called Transportation Network Companies, are also required to screen and accredit drivers and register them with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).  All TNVS vehicles will also be required to install and use global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices. Only sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles, Sports Utility Vehicles, vans, or similar vehicles will be allowed, and these should not be older than 7 years. The new framework makes the Philippines the first country to have nationwide rules on ride-sharing, according to both the Philippine transport department and Uber. Previously, only local and city governments have regulated the services. In a statement, Uber Senior Vice-President David Plouffe hailed the Philippine action, which he said would “advance urban mobility, create new economic opportunity, and put rider safety first.” DOTC will on Wednesday, May 12 publicly issue the new country-wide guidelines for the likes of Uber and GrabTaxi. Premium taxi, airport bus Other than TNVS, DOTC said it will also introduce another transport category for traditional taxi companies to allow them “to compete with TNVS.” Called Premium Taxi, vehicles with a 7-year age limit under this new category will be equipped with GPS, online and smartphone booking capability, and cashless transactions through credit or debit card payments. Like TNVS, premium taxis will be allowed to accept regular passengers heading to any point of destination in the country, Abaya said. To meet high demand during peak hours at the terminals of the Ninoy Aquino International Airports (NAIA), the DOTC also created a new transport category called Airport Bus. This was after the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) started allowing unaccredited white metered taxis to pick up passengers at the arrival areas of NAIA terminals 2 and 3 due to the passengers’ appeals. Vehicles under the Airport Bus category “should have fixed schedules and off-street stops, low-floor height and adequate luggage space, CCTV cameras, GPS device, free WiFi, and must run on Euro V or clean alternative fuel.” Abaya pointed out that Green Frog has expressed interest in the airport bus service that would ply three areas including Makati City, Mall of Asia (MOA) as well as Bonifacio Global City (BGC) or Ortigas business center. Bus rapid transit The government is also planning to build more bus rapid transit (BRT) systems in the country, prompting it to dedicate a separate transport classification starting week of May 11. The DOTC awarded in April the design and construction supervision contract of the P10.62-billion ($237.88 million) Cebu BRT to South Korea’s Kunhwa Engineering & Consulting Company Limited. Cebu BRT is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2018. “We’re eyeing more of BRTs in the country, as it is seen to help decongest traffic and modernize the transportation services in the Philippines,” Abaya said. Other than Cebu BRT, Abaya added that a detailed engineering design on a BRT between Quezon City and Manila is set to be completed, per the National Economic and Development Authority’s approval. “The third BRT we’re eyeing is the C5 Modern BRT System, which is also for NEDA approval,” he said, and added that DOTC is still finalizing the route for this. BRTs use dedicated lanes for buses and are intended as a cheaper substitute for commuter trains. “We can boost mobility by promoting high-quality systems that efficiently transport large volumes of passengers. These new bus categories are cost-effective solutions that can cut down travel time, aid in decongesting clogged streets,” Abaya said in a separate statement. Current modes of public land transportation service are bus, jeepney, UV (utility vehicle) express, school transport service, and taxi. Operators of the new transport categories “will still be required to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) for every vehicle. Drivers must also be screened, accredited, and registered with the LTFRB,” Abaya said. “These new categories aren’t created to ruin the old taxi industry. We’re implementing these new categories to promote innovation and modernization,” he added. – with a report from Agence France-Presse / Rappler.com $1 = P44.65"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/92096-indonesian-aceh-bans-unmarried-couples-motorbike-rides/","title":"Indonesian district bans unmarried couples from motorbike rides","date":"May 4, 2015 5:25 PM PHT","snippet":"'Unmarried people sitting closely together on a motorcycle is clearly against Islamic sharia as it could lead to sinful acts.'","body":" BANDA ACEH, Indonesia — A district in Indonesia’s Aceh has passed legislation banning unmarried men and women from riding together on motorbikes, a lawmaker said Monday, the latest new Islamic regulation in the conservative province. Members of parliament in North Aceh district last week approved the regulation, which will come into effect in a year, said lawmaker Fauzan Hamzah, adding that authorities were making “efforts to implement sharia law fully”. “Unmarried people sitting closely together on a motorcycle is clearly against Islamic sharia as it could lead to sinful acts,” Hamzah told AFP. Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra island, is the only province in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country that is allowed to implement Islamic law, and gay sex, gambling and drinking alcohol are already punishable by caning. The province began implementing sharia law after being granted special autonomy in 2001, an effort by the central government in Jakarta to quell a long-running separatist insurgency. (READ: Aceh’s strict new Sharia law applies to non-Muslims)  The latest move to ban shared motorbike rides, which will affect more than 500,000 people on North Aceh, came after one city in Aceh in 2013 prohibited women from straddling male drivers on motorbikes, requiring that they ride sidesaddle instead. The new regulation was the most eye-catching in a series of Islamic bylaws approved in North Aceh on Thursday, which also included a ban on live music performances and the separation of male and female students in school. The new rules will take effect in May 2016 after a one-year grace period. Hamzah did not say what punishments would be meted out to unmarried couples caught together on a motorbike. (READ: Aceh approves caning for gay sex) He did list several punishments that could be implemented for all the new Islamic laws, which ranged from a formal reprimand to fines and people being expelled from their villages. “We will make efforts so that deeds which can lead to sin are eliminated gradually in North Aceh district,” he added. The provincial parliament in Aceh, as well as district parliaments, can pass their own Islamic bylaws. —Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/89213-uber-us-dismiss-india-suit/","title":"Uber asks US court to dismiss India rape suit","date":"Apr 7, 2015 11:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber B.V., a Netherlands-based entity with no US operations and which isn't part of the suit, is the company the alleged assailant had a contract with, asserts Uber US","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The United States branch of ridesharing company Uber asked a US court Tuesday, April 7, to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the alleged victim of a rape and assault case in New Delhi, India.  Reuters reported the woman sued the US service in a federal court, claiming insufficient safety procedures were in place. Uber US claims that that court should dismiss the suit, arguing that they are not the correct party. Uber operates a ride sharing application where riders can be paired up with drivers via the app and pay for their ride using a credit card on file on their user accounts. “While Plaintiff undoubtedly can state a claim against her alleged assailant, she cannot state a claim against Uber US, which is the wrong party. Nor does California law govern a dispute involving an alleged wrong committed by one Indian citizen against another Indian citizen, in India,” Uber US said in its filing. Uber claimed it had no relationship with the alleged assailant whose contract was with Uber B.V., a Netherlands-based entity with no U.S. operations and is not part of the lawsuit. According to The Next Web, Uber’s corporate structure appears to shelter the US company from potential overseas liabilities.  The Next Web also said Uber’s terms of service revealed it took no responsibility for the actions of drivers on the platform, according to the following quote:  “Uber does not guarantee the suitability, safety or ability of third party providers. It is solely your responsibility to determine if a third party provider will meet your needs and expectations. Uber will not participate in disputes between you and a third party provider.

On the streets of Manila, vendors can be found selling anything to motorists stuck in traffic – from washcloths, peanuts, water to things as random as coat racks and iPhone chargers. A recent article in Forbes featured a Filipino living in San Francisco, USA, named Gavin Escolar, who demonstrated just that quality. He is an Uber driver who uses his car as his mobile showroom for his jewelry business. For this, he is called an “ubrepreneur.” The writer discovered Escolar’s story when the Filipinio immigrant picked him up on an Uber booking. He writes: “Then it hits me: I’m not in Gavin’s car. I’m in his mobile showroom. He’s not just an Uber driver. Nor is he just an entrepreneur. He’s an Uberpreneur, using the ridesharing app to promote his jewelry business.” The same report said Escolar was able to earn over $250,000 – or about P10 million – in one year.  Escolar immigrated from the Philippines to start a jewelry company in San Francisco and became an Uber driver to make ends meet. He recalled of his early days as an Uber driver, “My passengers surprised me…. I thought they would be silent or on the phone. But most people wanted to talk. When I mentioned my jewelry, they asked for business cards, but I didn’t have any.” Then it struck him to go beyond business cards and actually sell the jewelry in his car. “I never solicit. I only keep subtle hints to spark conversation if they notice,” Escolar was quoted in Forbes. “If they don’t notice, they probably wouldn’t be my customer anyway.” Escolar designs all his jewelry himself. “As a child, I was intrigued by the technical watercolor renderings of jewelry that my father kept on his desk, and I have been fond of gemstones ever since,” he wrote on his website. And it turns out that the global ride-sharing app does not discourage their drivers from being entrepreneurial.  Uber spokeswoman Kristin Carvell told Forbes, “One of the greatest things about the Uber platform is that it offers economic opportunity for a variety of drivers…in more than 260 cities around the world.” According to CBS News, there are now over 160,000 Uber drivers across the United States. In the Philippines, Uber is only available in Metro Manila. Without giving an exact figure, Uber regional manager Michael Brown told the Inquirer that Uber will be signing “tens of thousands” of new drivers in Metro Manila.  Will we then find the next “Uberpreneur” in the Philippine capital? – Rappler.com    Uber Philippines’ Laurence Cua is one of our speakers in #ThinkPH The Next Big Idea: Platform Thinking.

Apple’s Tim Cook. SpaceX’s Elon Musk. What do they have in common? They are the faces of the companies they lead. They are the leaders of such pioneering companies. They spread their company’s vision beyond the boardroom. They lead changes that not only impact their own companies and industries, but the world as a whole. They dared to dream and led to achieve. In the Philippines, there are budding names – in start-ups – in established technology firms or social enterprises who, like Bezos, Cook, and Musk, are also daring to dream and leading to achieve, not only a name for themselves, but for the businesses they lead and the industries which landscape they are helping to change for the better. Who are they? In alphabetical order (by surname), remember their names; learn from their leadership and management styles; and watch out how they will tackle the challenges ahead. Natasha Bautista, acting general manager of GrabTaxi Philippines The biggest challenge for Bautista and GrabTaxi Philippines is maintaining their lead over competitors. “We understand that we have existing and upcoming competitors that are even bigger than us, but we plan to simply be laser-focused in this David versus Goliath battle,” she said. Competitors of GrabTaxi Philippines include Rocket Internet’s EasyTaxi, which has recently exited several markets in Southeast Asia, and Uber, which is currently facing regulatory issues in the Philippines. Bautista believes that one advantage GrabTaxi has is that – in all 6 countries they operate in – their teams are all locals. “We believe that being hyperlocal is key and that decision-makers of the company need to really understand the needs and wants of our passengers and drivers,” Bautista said, adding that GrabTaxi is an app made by Southeast Asians for Southeast Asians and they have been proud of this fact since Day 1.  Erick Coser, country head, Tripda Philippines As the country head of carpooling platform Tripda, Coser is tasked with getting Filipinos on board with the idea of sharing rides with one another. “The biggest business challenge for me and Tripda in 2015 is to start a public conversation about how carpooling can help the Philippine authorities solve a big part of the problems with urban mobility,” Coser said. Coser believes that this conversation needs to happen. According to him, there is a lot of unused capacity in Manila streets in the form of cars with solo drivers. There is also a corresponding demand for that unused capacity as we can see in the long lines for the LRT, MRT, jeepneys, and UV expresses.  But Coser and Tripda are well poised for this battle. “With the great round of funding we’ve just raised, we’ll be able to scale up our operations in the Philippines, intensifying our presence inside universities (where the trend-setters and more open minded brains are), launching even bolder campaigns to raise awareness about carpooling and closing high level partnerships with the government, big companies, and these universities,” Coser shared. Gabby Dizon, co-founder and CEO, Altitude Games Dizon and the team at Altitude Games re-released their mid-core title, Run Run Super V, late last year with the help of investor Xurpas. (Editor’s note: Nix Nolledo, president and CEO of Xurpas, is also a board member of Rappler).  Dizon sees their 2015 goal as releasing the game worldwide and making it one that millions of people around the world can play and enjoy. “We have to iterate countless times on the gameplay using test markets and make sure that we meet our internal metrics goals before going live worldwide,” Dizon said. Given the enormity of this task, Dizon emphasized that the team needs to remain focused and confident. “This also requires a strong belief from the team that we’re creating a great product, a game that can stand up on its own with the best games in the app stores around the world,” he concluded. Stephen Jagger, co-founder and head of business development, PayrollHero PayrollHero provides analytics, attendance, payroll, scheduling, and time tracking services to other businesses, and they have signed some of the largest brands in the country, including The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, FamilyMart, and Krispy Kreme. For 2015, Jagger identified international expansion as the biggest challenge for PayrollHero. From their beachhead in the Philippines, the firm has already expanded into Singapore and they have plans to expand into more countries in 2015. “As with any expansion there are challenges, but especially in Southeast Asia and some of the emerging markets,” Jagger said, citing corruption, culture, customs, language, tax law as examples of local problems that PayrollHero has to deal with. Jagger said that PayrollHero can overcome these challenges through its unique business approach and practices, such as the fact that they make some of their code open source or that they hire what they call #AdventureEngineers. Lyle Jover, co-founder and CEO, Raket.ph As Internet penetration increases in the Philippines, more Filipinos will turn to the digital world to try to make money. They may opt for international platforms like Freelancer.com or Elance-oDesk, or even homegrown sites. One of the most promising of the latter is Raket.Ph, which is led by CEO Lyle Jover and now boasts of more than 7,000 users.  Jover felt that the biggest challenge over the past year was introducing the brand and building this user base. He sees the main challenge ahead as something slightly different. “For 2015, the tides have changed – I would say this time our biggest challenge now is establishing our brand as the go-to website whenever anybody needs freelance help,” Jover said. “We’d like to look at this not as something to overcome but rather something to accomplish for Raket.ph,” Jover said.  Kenneth Lingan, country manager, Google Philippines Newly appointed Google Philippines country manager Kenneth Lingan said that the biggest challenge facing the company is the task of helping the industry navigate to mobile in 2015, that this shift will happen and will open a lot of opportunities for Filipinos. “Half of our country’s population will be connected to the web as smartphones and data packages become more accessible,” Lingan said. “The question is whether companies and businesses are prepared for this massive consumer shift,” he added. Lingan envisioned Google Philippines as a kind of steward for all ventures in the country. “We’ll take on the challenge by sharing our expertise in the digital economy and providing thought leadership in mobile and digital to both large businesses and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) on how they can make the most out of the web,” Lingan said. Carl Mamawal, co-founder and CEO, Nytfi Nyfti is a foldable bicycle proudly designed and manufactured in the Philippines. The company was founded by Carl Mamawal and Isidro Antonio “Ingko” Marfori III after the latter wanted a foldable bicycle for his roughly 3-kilometer commute to De La Salle University. The ones out on the market did not suit him, so he set out with Mamawal to create one that did. Nyfti was soon born. The foldable bicycle is currently available for sale on their site, and the team has been dutifully fulfilling the first batch of bike orders due in February. Not surprisingly, Mamawal identified scaling as their biggest challenge for 2015. To meet the growing demand for their Nyfti bicycles, the team has to scale operations without sacrificing quality.  “But we’re finding it difficult to find local skilled workers to help us make bikes to the quality that our customers deserve,” Mamawal shared.  “Fortunately, we’re in discussions with key local manufacturers who also believe in creating export quality products. With their help, we can truly create a world-class bicycle,” Mamawal said. Ralph Regalado, co-founder, Senti Social media predominates the lives of many in the Philippines, so it may come as a surprise to learn that there are very few corresponding social media tools for Filipinos. One promising social media analytics tool is Senti, which can decipher Filipino and even text-speak. Senti should thus allow brands to learn more about their customers who prefer to communicate in Filipino. Regalado is now focusing on getting brands to see this value. Regalado admitted though that the team was very lax last year at executing their customer acquisition strategy, most of which was focused on content marketing and joining exhibits. “Though we got a good number of interested clients, conversion was really low,” he shared. “This year we plan to execute more strategies actively, at the same time wisely. Getting and talking to the right clients and sustaining their interest in our service,” Paul Rivera, founder and CEO, Kalibrr Kalibrr is a tech start-up that aims to change the way that business recruiting is done in the Philippines, and in turn, the world. Rivera sees the biggest challenge that Kalibrr faces is serving both stakeholders in this marketplace. “I would say that our biggest challenge will be to ensure that as Kalibrr’s talent marketplace scales, both jobseekers and companies get measurable value from our platform,” Rivera said.  To measure Kalibrr’s success with this task, Rivera said the company is focused on a single core success metric for each. “Are our jobseekers finding work and are our companies finding the talent they need to grow their businesses on Kalibrr?” he said. “We are extremely excited to bring innovation to recruitment in the Philippines in 2015.” Reese Fernandez-Ruiz, co-founder and president, Rags2Riches   Ruiz recently had the distinction of making it to Forbes’ 2015 list of social entrepreneurs under 30, and when you look at her body of work leading social enterprise Rags2Riches, it is clear why. Rags2Riches experienced a 100% annual growth rate from 2007 to 2012, according to Forbes. In identifying the challenges for 2015, Ruiz names cash flow, inventory, and logistics. “Our team is very entrepreneurial to begin with so I believe we are all capable of learning quickly, experimenting, and refining our systems to become more efficient,” she said.  Ruiz admitted that these problems are not necessarily the sexiest. “These all sound quite ‘unsexy’ but the truth is, the ‘materials’ to build viable and sustainable social enterprises, or quite simply, enterprises, are the lesser known but crucial business systems,” she said, and added that the positive impact they want to achieve deserves nothing less than their dedication and discipline. – Rappler.com     Rappler Business columnist Ezra Ferraz is also the chief content officer at ZipMatch, a tech company backed by Ideaspace Foundation, Hatchd Digital, IMJ Investment Partners, and 500 Startups.

The deal – which makes the Swedish startup the exclusive provider for Playstation Music and Sony’s smartphones and tablets – sees the companies link up in 41 markets. “Music is a core component of the entertainment offering that consumers expect from Sony,” Andrew House, head of Sony’s Network Entertainment Business, said in a statement.  “This partnership represents the best in music and the best in gaming coming together, which will benefit the vibrant and passionate communities of both Spotify and PlayStation Network.” The deal strengthens Spotify’s position as the world’s biggest music streaming service as competition from US-based services such as Pandora and YouTube Music heats up and Apple prepares to launch its own service later this year.    “Gaming remains a sort of final frontier of music. It’s still locked in a quite old fashioned model… sourcing content from different labels,” Mark Mulligan, a music industry analyst, told AFP. “And Sony is bringing in the biggest mainstream digital music streaming brand into the games console environment.” The deal also eliminates potential competition from Sony, a pioneer in mobile music with its Walkman players that has had difficulty moving into the digital music age, which said it would close its Music Unlimited service in all 19 countries where it is currently available.  “Natural heirs to digital music” “Sony always thought that they should be the natural heirs to digital music because they pioneered portable music with the Walkman. They’ve tried many things over the last 15 years but nothing has really worked on any meaningful scale… the music experiences haven’t been the best,” said Mulligan.  Spotify has become a major powerbroker in the music industry since its US launch in 2011 and there have been widespread reports in recent months that the unlisted company plans to go public.

You could, after all, rank companies according to a variety of intersubjective metrics, such as profits or users. Unfortunately, most of this data is confidential – it playing into business strategy – and a company’s stature in the press can oftentimes be misleading. On the one hand, a company can make little noise in the media but is making tremendous waves in its industry. On the other hand, a company can be a media darling but is struggling to get any traction. For this list, I thus focused on ventures that have publicly documented and nationally significant success, and from within this group, I picked those that, in my view, have had the most impact on their respective spaces. In alphabetical order, my choices are: Four Eyes Many pundits say that the Philippines is poised to become an Asian tiger for a variety of reasons, including the fact that we are an English-speaking country. Thus, the country can be a testing ground or gateway to other markets in Southeast Asia. No company proved this idea better than Four Eyes this year. Four Eyes is an online optical store, not unlike Warby Parker in the US, that features home try-on of eyeglasses and donates a pair to someone in need for every pair bought. A little after raising more than $350,000 from Future Now Ventures, Kickstart Ventures, Wavemaker Partner, and other angel investors, the company expanded into Singapore. While Singapore already has its share of online optical stores, Four Eyes looks to make a splash with its home try-on feature and its measurable social impact.GrabTaxi I remember attending the GrabTaxi launch in July, downloading the app shortly thereafter, and then finding few, if any, taxis in my area. This did not surprise me. As a taxi-hailing app, the company had the challenge of growing a marketplace from two ends – it needed to sign taxi fleets onto the GrabTaxi platform and somehow find users willing to avail of those newly-minted GrabTaxi cabs. Of course, growing a two-sided market in somewhat lockstep is not an easy feat, but the Malaysian-based company has seemed to have taken to the task swimmingly. The firm – one could argue – is now the most visible tech startup in the Philippines. It is hard not to be impressed by the numbers: in the Southeast Asian markets in which it operates, GrabTaxi has 500,000 users out of 2.5 million app downloads, and these users are serviced by more than 60,000 taxi drivers. Perhaps most astonishingly, there are 3 GrabTaxi bookings made every second. Not surprisingly, GrabTaxi said that it is the market leader in more than 17 cities across Southeast Asia, including some in the Philippines. With a record-breaking $250 million Series D funding round, GrabTaxi only looks set to convert more cabs into its partner vehicles. SALt Among companies that have a strong social impact, one of the most promising to emerge in 2014 is Ideaspace Foundation’s SALt, which stands for sustainable alternative lighting. The company makes a saltwater powered lamp. SALt excites me because it is one of only a handful of companies truly targeting the people who stand to benefit the most from new technology – the saltwater powered lamp can potentially improve light access to millions of Filipinos and other people living off the grid around the world. The world, too, has taken notice. SALt was selected to represent the Philippines in the Young Entrepreneurs Society competition in South Korea. The future of SALt fittingly appears bright. Uber It’s hard to predict who will eventually win the most market share in 3-way transportation battle among GrabTaxi, EasyTaxi, and Uber in the Philippines, but ride-sharing service Uber unquestionably scored one of the most impressive political (and public relations) victories this year. Earlier this year, a sting operation conducted by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slapped a P200,000 ($4,471.78) fine on one of Uber’s partner cars. The official rationale was that the partner car had no franchise to operate as a public vehicle. When I first heard of this case, I immediately assumed Uber was simply going to have to bow down to the politics of a government still learning how to deal with gray areas brought on by new tech, so what happened next truly surprised me – people spoke out against the action. While they did not necessarily take to the streets, they did air their grievances en masse out on social media. Amid the public pressure, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) called on the LTFRB to work with companies like Uber rather than against it. Even Senator Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV threw his weight behind Uber. That there was such an outpouring of support for Uber is as much a testament to how much Filipinos like the ride-sharing service as to how much they would hate to see it fold under the weight of a political and legal standstill. Xurpas While Xurpas may not yet be a household name, it’s definitely known to any tech entrepreneur in the Philippines. The company, which creates digital products and services for mobile users and platforms for mobile operators, counting Smart Communications and Globe Telecom as two of its biggest clients, recently had an initial public offering (IPO) at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). By trading 344 million shares, which amounts to approximately 20% of its equity, Xurpas hopes to raise as much as P1.24 billion ($27.73 million*). In his celebratory speech, Nix Nolledo** placed this successful IPO into a wider context. “Today is a victory for all technology startups in the Philippines,” Nolledo said, believing that Xurpas can be the first of many Philippine-based tech startups to make a splash globally. – Rappler.com *$1 = P44.73 **Nix Nolledo also sits as a board member of Rappler Rappler Business columnist Ezra Ferraz is also the chief content officer at ZipMatch, a tech company backed by Ideaspace Foundation, Hatchd Digital, IMJ Investment Partners, and 500 Startups.

In Thailand, black plates are meant to be used for private vehicles but Uber’s application has allowed individual fare-paying customers to connect with a registered private driver under their “UberX” brand.  A slightly more expensive option allows users to locate cars with green plates, which are used by taxi and limousine services and driven by people with licences to take passengers.  The ban does not apply to licensed cars, Teerapong said.  UberX is a significant part of the firm’s Thailand business – although the company would not be drawn on how much of its revenues come from regulated journeys. Nonetheless the Uber smartphone app was still taking bookings for both green and black plate cars in Bangkok on Wednesday.  Uber is as adored by start-up watchers for its stellar rise as it is loathed by the established taxi industry for undercutting prices. A company statement said Uber “respects the Department of Land Transportation and its important role as a key regulator” adding the firm would continue talking about the legal framework for its business. “Over the past few months, more and more Thai people have been cruising the streets of Bangkok and Phuket, using (the) Uber platform and they are loving the experience,” it added, without referencing the part-ban. Uber is valued at around $40 billion despite facing a cascade of regulatory worries with authorities spanning the US, to Spain and India, mainly linked to possible breaches of competition law. This week the city government in New Delhi banned Uber from operating in the Indian capital after a passenger accused one of its drivers of rape. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/77517-portland-oregon-sues-uber/","title":"US city of Portland sues Uber","date":"Dec 9, 2014 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The US city of Portland, Oregon, sues ride-sharing startup Uber, saying it is operating illegally, and asks the court to order the service to stop operating in the city until it is in compliance with city rules","body":"LOS ANGELES, USA – The US city of Portland, Oregon, has sued ride-sharing startup Uber, saying it was operating illegally, officials said Monday, December 8. The suit also asked the court to order the service to stop operating in Portland until it is in compliance with city rules. “Uber is subject to and in violation of the city of Portland’s Private for Hire Transportation Regulations and Administrative Rules,” the suit said.  Uber is the most prominent of many new smartphone-dependent car services seen as bypassing strict regulations faced by licensed cab drivers. “Our main concern is public health and safety, because the state invested in the cities the responsibility to do that,” Mayor Charlie Hales said. “Beyond that, though, is the issue of fairness. Taxi cab companies follow rules on public health and safety. So do hotels and restaurants and construction companies and scores of other service providers. Because everyone agrees: Good regulations make for a safer community. Uber disagrees, so we’re seeking a court injunction.” The company sought to play up widespread public support. “Uber has received a tremendously warm welcome from riders and drivers in and around Portland. We appreciate the way residents have welcomed Uber,” said company spokeswoman Eva Behrend. She said that almost 7,000 Portland residents had signed the petition in support of Uber in just a few hours. Uber said last week that it had raised a fresh $1.2 billion in funding, giving the popular ride-sharing startup a reported value of some $40 billion. Founded in California in 2009, Uber is best known for its smartphone app that lets people who need a ride connect with local drivers. The app uses GPS to put the user in contact with the nearest driver. Uber charges a commission for each ride. Its fast expansion has riled taxi drivers in countries where it operates, since they often face significant rules and regulations, and attendant costs.

A court ordered Uber to stop its UberPOP service, which allows non-professional drivers to register with Uber via a mobile phone and offer trips in their own cars at half the price of a regular cab. “Drivers who transport people for payment without a license are breaking the law,” said the decision from the Hague-based Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal. Uber could be fined up to 100,000 euros, and drivers could face fines of 10,000 euros for continuing to work, up to a maximum of 40,000 euros. A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it “will continue to offer UberPOP.” Monday’s decision “is simply the first step in a long-running judicial battle,” the San Francisco-based company added. UberPOP is one of several services offered by the online taxi startup, which appealed a Dutch government decision in September to have it banned. Uber said that it was merely offering a “car-sharing service.” But the judges sided with government on Monday, pointing out that Uber receives a 20% commission for each trip. Uber launched UberPOP as a pilot project in Amsterdam between July and September. In late November, Uber extended the service to The Hague and Rotterdam. Several drivers were arrested in Amsterdam in October and fined 1,500 euros. Drivers were also arrested on the first day of operations in Rotterdam. Uber has expanded at breakneck speed since it launched in 2009 and is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries. But its rapid growth has caused tensions, especially in Europe where rival taxi companies have protested that Uber cars are not subject to the same regulations. A tribunal in Paris, France, will decide on Friday, December 12, whether Uber’s services constitute unfair competition to traditional taxi drivers.

Uber chief Travis Kalanick announced the latest funding in a blog post, saying the money will fuel expansion, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. “It was just a year ago that Uber was operating in 60 cities and 21 countries – today we are in over 250 cities in 50 countries,” he wrote. “We are 6 times bigger today than 12 months ago – and grew faster this year than last. This progress is remarkable, but it is in the coming years that Uber truly scales and the impact in cities becomes visible.” Kalanick added that “this kind of continued growth requires investment. To that end, we have just raised a financing round of $1.2 billion… This financing will allow Uber to make substantial investments, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.” Earlier this year Uber raised $1.2 billion, giving it a value of $17 billion, but a spokesman Thursday said the company was now valued at more than twice that at $40 billion.

Taxi-booking and ride-sharing apps like Uber, Hailo and Lyft have spread rapidly in recent years, drawing protests from cabbies in cities from London to San Francisco who say it has led to soaring competition from unlicensed drivers.  Singapore’s Land Transport Authority said the apps will have to apply for a three-yearly “certificate of registration” starting from the second quarter of next year. “Third-party taxi booking services facilitate more efficient matching of taxis with commuters and have become increasingly popular,” the LTA said, adding the new rules are designed to “safeguard commuter safety and interests”. Apps operating in Singapore will need to agree to dispatch only licensed taxis and drivers, while information on fare rates and other fees payable for a ride must be disclosed to passengers. The apps will be barred from requiring passengers to disclose their destinations when they make bookings due to concerns some taxi drivers may try to avoid certain routes, the LTA said. Operators are also required to provide “basic customer support”, including lost and found services and a platform for customers to file complaints.  Passengers in Singapore can only use Uber to connect to registered taxis and limousines, unlike in some other cities around the world where the app is used to hire private cars and ride-share to cut fares. Other similar apps operating in Singapore include Britain’s Hailo, regional player Easy Taxi and Malaysia-based GrabTaxi. At present, these apps already comply with Singapore’s new requirement for the taxis to be licensed. Michael Brown, Uber’s Southeast Asia general manager based in Singapore, on Friday welcomed the new rules. “We appreciate that the LTA has acknowledged the benefits our technology brings, and like Uber, is putting the interest and safety of consumers and drivers first,” Brown said in a statement to AFP. Uber has been battling scandal in recent days, scrambling to allay fears that its employees have spied on passengers through a “God View” feature that shows where riders are located at any given time.  Emil Michael, Uber’s executive vice president of business, also sparked anger by outlining a vision of spending $1 million on digging up dirt on journalists critical of the start-up.

Buzzfeed reports that during a dinner on Friday, November 14, Michael thought about “spending ‘a million dollars’ to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists” to “fight back against the press” by investigating journalists’ personal lives and families. Michael reportedly cited one target in particular – Sarah Lacy of PandoDaily, who has written some unfavorable pieces on Uber. Michael did not suggest that the company actually did this snooping or planned to, but presented it as a supposedly sensible idea that the company should pursue. An Uber spokeswoman later released a comment from Michael: “The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner – borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for – do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach. They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.” Lacy denounced Michael’s statements in a column, saying, “Uber’s dangerous escalation of behavior has just had its whistleblower moment, and tellingly, the whistleblower wasn’t a staffer with a conscience, it was an executive boasting about the proposed plan. It’s gone so far, that there are those in the company who don’t even realize this is something you try to cover up.” Irene Koehler, a social media strategy consultant and public speaker, also took screenshots of an apology from Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Kalanick also apologized for Michael’s remarks, saying that Michael’s remarks “showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals.”     {source} <div id=”fb-root”></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = “//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1”; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, ‘script’, ‘facebook-jssdk’));</script><div class=”fb-post” data-href=”https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203188007996001&amp;set=a.2521960723308.118898.1082028412&amp;type=1″ data-width=”466″><div class=”fb-xfbml-parse-ignore”><a href=”https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203188007996001&amp;set=a.2521960723308.118898.1082028412&amp;type=1″>Post</a> by <a href=”https://www.facebook.com/irenekoehler”>Irene Koehler</a>.</div></div> {/source} As of this writing, Emil Michael remains in his position, with Kalanick noting in his Twitter apology that he believes “folks who make mistakes can learn from them – myself included and that also goes for Emil.”  {source} <div id=”fb-root”></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = “//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1”; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, ‘script’, ‘facebook-jssdk’));</script><div class=”fb-post” data-href=”https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203188009156030&amp;set=a.2521960723308.118898.1082028412&amp;type=1″ data-width=”466″><div class=”fb-xfbml-parse-ignore”><a href=”https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203188009156030&amp;set=a.2521960723308.118898.1082028412&amp;type=1″>Post</a> by <a href=”https://www.facebook.com/irenekoehler”>Irene Koehler</a>.</div></div> {/source} – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/75397-nov-18-2014-binay-condo-imelda-paintings-uber-shutdown/","title":"Binay condo, Imelda paintings, Uber shutdown | The wRap","date":"Nov 18, 2014 8:29 PM PHT","snippet":"Is there a Michelangelo painting in Imelda Marcos’ office?

Or they will take rides very selectively, and then only at a negotiated premium. Clearly, this is an unpleasant experience. Notably during peak traffic hours, rides are unpredictable, many are left stranded, and for those who do get a ride, one can’t help but feel like a victim of extortion—meters are no longer used, and rides become much more expensive than the regulated metered fare. Add to this that many taxis are typically very poorly kept, and the service leaves much to be desired. While most taxis have signs with phone numbers to call the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) if one has any complaints, most realize the futility of this, as the bad behavior of drivers (not all but a good number) goes unabated. In recent years, innovations in technology have enabled new ways for commuters and drivers to connect, enabling riders to send market signals to drivers who do provide better services by choosing to ride with them. Uber is one such innovation. It’s a ride-sharing smartphone application that connects car owners and taxi drivers with people willing to pay for a ride for pre-specified pick-up points and destinations. It has the additional function that riders can rate their drivers (and their vehicles), providing information for other riders so they could choose those with better services. It has become so successful, in fact, that taxi companies and regulators have taken notice.  Crackdown Last October 22, 2014, a partner car of Uber in the Philippines fell in the first sting operation conducted by LTFRB. The car owner was fined ₱200,000 due to the absence of a franchise to operate as a public vehicle. This was not the first instance of Uber-reaction. The company was founded in March 2009 in San Francisco, California. Users must be connected to the internet to get their locations. Drivers get a rating from 1 to 5 stars from passengers, which can also be seen by customers as they wait for a ride. Passengers are billed through their credit cards based on the time and distance spent on the road. These drivers often use well-maintained private cars. Uber drivers can charge up to three times the fare from a normal taxi ride. But some commuters seem to find the value of convenience, reliability, and comfort from using Uber far outweighs this additional cost. Uber has expanded to over 200 cities in 45 countries with a value of more than US$18 billion. Since its expansion, Uber has triggered both praises from the public and scrutiny by regulators. Just this year, cities in Belgium, Australia, and recently Nevada in the United States have banned the app and fined Uber drivers, describing the service as illegal. Yet, there have also been instances wherein Uber was initially banned and eventually allowed to operate, such as in Germany, Washington State, and Virginia. Seattle has also allowed Uber and other similar companies to operate as well but with a cap on the number of allowed drivers. The California Public Utilities Commission went so far as to create a new category, “transportation network companies”, in order to cover such companies as Uber, Lyft, SideCar and Summon. Anywhere Uber and the like operate, public transport groups who face competition from it are predictably initiating moves to ban it. In the Philippines, LTFRB received complaints from the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association about Uber for running illegal (or franchise-less) for-hire vehicle operations in Metro Manila. The main reason the agency cited was “concern for the safety of passengers.” Monopoly vs competition Regulating competition is a key aspect of work for the LTFRB. Franchises granted to taxi owners are a means to manage the number and quality of services provided by this mode of transport. By granting a pseudo-monopoly of taxi services (only those with franchises can ply the streets) one can make sure that prices are stable and predictable (through metered fares) and the quality and safety of transport services are ensured (through periodic franchise review and renewal). That’s how it works on paper—reality is vastly different as noted earlier. Understanding the economics of the taxi business might also yield some insights here. It’s possible that the taxi drivers’ meager income is triggering their predatory behavior, i.e. choosing rides and forcing higher prices on riders notably during peak hours. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that taxi operators earn almost ₱500,000 a year just from one taxi versus ₱162,000 earned by the taxi driver. Hence each taxi driver earns roughly around ₱13,500 a month only, net of gas and other expenses operating the cab. Taxi owners, on the other hand, earn an internal rate of return of up to 122% from their taxi investment, net of the franchise cost and other expenses. (Just for comparison, power projects are lucky to generate 15% to 20% IRR.) And as traffic worsens during peak periods, drivers burn more gas that eats into their income, while the “boundary” of taxi owners is fixed (usually at around ₱1700 per day). The system favors the taxi owners heavily, while at the same time creating strong incentives for drivers to flaunt regulations by abandoning their meters and seeking negotiated fares during peak times. This also compels many drivers toward the behaviors we described earlier. Think of each driver “shopping” for riders as a mini-monopolist (we have all seen how drivers negotiate with one rider after another during rush hour); and consumers as their choice-less counterparts. This is highly predictable “price discriminating” behavior (in the lingua of economists), as higher variable costs of operation prompt drivers to find ways to charge more. This behavior is probably among the reasons why some customers appear to prefer Uber. The app effectively puts choice back in the hands of riders, by allowing them to scan the vicinity for alternative rides. And even if they still choose the normal taxi, at least they figured alternative options. Perhaps for a growing number of smartphone toting riders, Uber offers a safe, predictable and higher quality alternative to the normal taxis. In other cities where Uber operates, drivers are able to break free from the middle man (the taxi unit owner) enabling them to enhance their income. A better understanding of the economics of the taxi industry suggests that LTFRB may be targeting the wrong issue here. If it claims to protect riders and improve their welfare, they should focus on the rigid boundary system and how, combined with traffic, this is eroding the daily incomes of taxi drivers and possibly fueling the predatory behavior that harms public welfare. The interesting thing here is that Uber offers alternatives and could actually be tempering this predation through competition. Targeting Uber appears to miss the point completely. – Rappler.com Ronald U.

Hopefully, we can integrate these solutions into the DOTC’s taxi reform program,” Abaya said in a statement on Thursday, October 30. On Wednesday, October 22, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) fined a Fortuner P200,000 for partnering with Uber. The vehicle could also be impounded for up to 3 months. This infuriated netizens who said LTFRB should not be picking on cars that serve commuters, and instead run after abusive, price-gouging drivers who drive either franchised or colorum, and worse, rickety taxis. According to Uber, LTFRB’s October 22 operation was not fairly conducted, and asked government to look for ways to help companies like Uber in its aim to provide convenient transport to commuters. In response, Abaya urged LTFRB to reach out “and seek ways to modernize our transportation rules.” “While the LTFRB was only doing its job in implementing the law, we also have a duty to push for modern solutions to archaic problems,” Abaya said.  Uber has attracted criticism among taxi drivers in different parts of the world. In Europe, taxi drivers protested against the smartphone app which, they say, has shaken up the industry. The online app service is now being used in 128 cities in 37 different countries. Through the service, customers can hire cars with geo-tagging technology connected. A similar booking app, GrabTaxi, also launched GrabCar in Manila in May to compete with Uber, which has a dedicated fleet of limousine drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/72980-ph-regulator-fines-uber-netizens-furious/","title":"PH regulator fines Uber; netizens furious","date":"Oct 24, 2014 12:32 PM PHT","snippet":"","body":" A Fortuner that has partnered with Uber, a ride-sharing service, fell a sting operation conducted by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in Manila, and was fined P200,000, and may be impounded for 3 months.

The franchising board said a Fortuner was fined P200,000 in the Metrowalk area of Pasig City because it didn’t have a franchise to operate as a public vehicle. In an interview with GMA, LTFRB officer Dennis Barion said fines of P120,000 for sedans and P200,000 for utility vehicles could be imposed on cars used by Uber drivers . The vehicles may also face up to 3 months of impounding. “It’s not the service but it’s because of…not having a franchise,” Barion added.  Barion also said that the LTFRB was looking into going after similar transport services, like Tripid and Grabcar, which also use vehicles that do not have land transportation franchises. LTFRB executive director Roberto Cabrera further explained in a story on Astig.ph that the LTFRB is “just being fair with legitimate franchise owners.” While the LTFRB is supportive of Uber’s cause, it is concerned about the safety of its passengers, he said. Uber’s Philippine team responded, noting in a letter: “One of our partner’s drivers was apprehended today in a sting operation by LTFRB in coordination with local media. We believe this was unfairly done.” “As we have always assured you – and all our partners in the 220+ cities we operate in globally – we will support you and seek swift resolution to this incident. Ever since Uber launched in Manila almost a year ago to introduce the safest and most reliable way to get around the Metro, Filipino riders have unanimously rallied behind you by taking more and more trips with you every day,” Uber’s statement added. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) advised the LTFRB Thursday, October 23, to “find ways to reasonably assist transport services,” such as Uber. It said the initiatives like Uber’s help “ease traffic in Metro Manila pending the availability of a modern mass transport system, among other things.” MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino reasoned, “The muscle of the law and the procedural and technical arms of government agencies alone cannot resolve the lack of alternate means of transportation problem, they can only increase apprehension records.” “Uber or hybrid carpooling is a well-meaning technology-driven effort intended for public safety and convenience that’s why people are patronizing it. We cannot curtail their mobility rights. This is similar to private bridal cars and private ambulances for rent which is a private transaction between the rider and the owner of the vehicle,” Tolentino said. Uber is a ride-sharing service where users can take advantage of an app to request rides, as well as track where their reserved vehicle is coming from. Users of the service pay using their credit cards, with the rate calculated by a measure of distance and time spent on the road. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/69161-lord-makati-binay-explain-wealth/","title":"The Lord of Makati: Can Binay explain his wealth?","date":"Sep 16, 2014 1:49 PM PHT","snippet":"Corruption is an issue that has been raised against Jejomar Binay in every election since 1988, but proves immaterial to voters, according to this Newsbreak investigative report published March 28, 2001","body":"Editor’s Note: Since allegations of corruption were again thrown the way of Vice President Jejomar Binay recently, netizens have been citing this Newsbreak report – published in 2001 and awarded the top prize in the Jaime V. Ongpin Award for Investigative Journalism in 2002.  Newsbreak came up with this report on March 28, 2001, just when Binay was set to run again for Makati mayor after a 3-year “break” due to term limits. In the succeeding years, the allegations in this story or shades of these would again surface – now the subject of a complaint before the Ombudsman and a Senate investigation.   MANILA, Philippines – In less than a decade, Jejomar “Jojo” Binay, former chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and former mayor of Makati, accumulated at least P80 million worth of real estate properties in Makati and Batangas, which he kept undeclared, our investigation shows. The amount excludes P12 million in declared investments, as well as other businesses that he and his friends reportedly control through dummy corporations. In addition, Binay and his wife, Elenita, current Makati mayor, also own at least two Hidalgo condominium units, located inside the posh Rockwell Center in Makati. A 208-square meter unit in Rockwell, like the ones occupied by each of the two Binay daughters, costs around P28 million. The three properties alone, worth at least P79 million, were never declared in the couple’s statement of assets and liabilities. This is in violation of Republic Act 6713, which mandates all officials to file every year the acquisition cost and the assessed and fair market values of their real property. They are also required by law to list other personal property, investments, cash on hand or in banks, financial liabilities, and their business interests and connections. Violation of the law carries certain penalties – a P5,000 fine and disqualification from public office. Unfortunately, officials take the law lightly as none of them have been put behind bars for their transgressions. Former President Joseph Estrada himself was previously caught committing the same mistake. We interviewed at least 15 contractors, former employees and farm hands, sources privy to transactions, and local residents who saw Binay inspect the properties, and who all confirmed his ownership of these properties. Without these testimonies, it would be difficult to trace ownership to him because documents, if they are available at all, do not link him or his family members to the properties. Appointed MMDA chair in 1998 and replaced early this year after the Edsa 2 uprising, Jojo Binay wants to go back to City Hall. Perhaps the most popular politician among Makati City’s poor who constitute the majority of the city’s voters, he is the natural target of political opponents. Makati’s coffee shops are bursting with stories about Binay’s alleged unexplained wealth, which he supposedly acquired during his three consecutive terms as mayor from 1988 to 1998 (he served as OIC mayor in 1986 until the 1988 local elections). And he has a lot of explaining to do, considering that, as mayor, Binay received a monthly P32,000 salary, and as MMDA chairman, he received P46,000. Elenita received the same salary as mayor. “These charges are a rehash of old election issues,” says Binay in a written response to questions, brushing aside the allegations of misdeed. In a city where there is an accumulation of tremendous wealth, it is said that Binay himself had amassed riches by tolerating the collusion between the city’s building contractors and permits officials. It is common knowledge in Makati that permits that City Hall gives to builders of condominiums sometimes come with a hefty, under-the-table price. The local opposition says they have the goods on the former mayor. In fact, it spent a hefty sum on recent paid ads in the Inquirer that alluded to Binay’s posh residences in and out of Makati City. But the tough-talking, sometimes brusque Jojo Binay is unfazed. He says he does “not feel alluded” in the ads anyway. Landed family The Binays acquired the first chunk of the land – 16.6 hectares – in 1991. Former farm hands recalled having started working there in 1993, disclosing that they saw the former mayor there almost every week at the time.Two hours away from Makati City, in the agricultural town of Rosario in Batangas, a sprawling, modern, 66-hectrae farm is owned by the Binays of Makati. A conservative estimate of the land’s worth is put at P23 million, excluding the improvements made in recent years such as the construction of two huge houses, a piggery, orchidarium, a cock farm; and the paving of a hilly road that would connect the farm to other areas in the town. But the couple never declared this in their Statement of Assets, Liabilities (SAL) of 1996, 1997 and 1999, which Newsbreak obtained. The Office of the Ombudsman did not have a copy of his 1998 SAL. The Binay couple is scheduled to file their new SAL next month, as mandated by law. As of December 1999, the couple declared a net worth of only P20.06 million. In the same period, they declared P12.24 million in business investments – without identifying which these are. In fact, the Binays said their real properties are worth only P3,183,445 as of December 1999. The only real estate property that the Binays declared as acquisitions since Jojo Binay became mayor in 1998 was a residential property in Alfonse, Cavite. Acquired in 1994, its fair market value as of 1999 was pegged at P59,580. The couple, however, declared in their 1999 SAL that they spent P3 million in improving the Cavite residence. The other real assets declared by the couple in their most recent SAL were either inherited, purchased, or mortgaged to them before they dabbled in public service. Two of these properties were inherited – one in 1951, in Cabagan, Isabela; and the other, with an unspecified date, in San Pascual, Batangas. Three were purchased – Alabang Hills, Muntinlupa (1964); Mariveles in Bataan (1965); and San Antonio Village in Makati (1977). Of the eight declared properties, three are classified as agricultural while five are residential. The residential properties include the ones in Cavite; Makati; Muntinlupa; San Pedro (acquired in 1964) and Calamba (1984), Laguna. The Bataan, Isabela, and Batangas properties are agricultural. Their 1999 SAL does not say when the San Pascual, Batangas, property was inherited. San Pascual is in the second district of Batangas, very near Batuan, where Binay’s father was born (Binay’s mother comes from Isabela, which should explain his Isabela property). Rosario, Batangas Along the main road of Barangay San Roque in the Rosario town proper, a huge blue-and-white sign sits in front of heaps of huge fruit baskets. It says: “Jobin B. Mango Station.” A caretaker of the Jobin B. Mango Station, an old man, refused to answer queries about his benefactor. The most he could say was that “taga-Maynila ang kapitalista (the capitalist is from Metro Manila).” At harvest time in June, he said, they bring the mangoes to business establishments in Binondo. This is the first time workers will harvest from the capitalist’s mango farm, whose location the caretaker gestures to be far-flung – he acquired in only recently. Three barangays away, nearly a hundred mango trees line the mountainous expanse of greens and dirt roads. “Kabibili lang niya ng manggahang iyan (He has just bought that mango farm),” said a farmer-resident of Barangay Maligaya. By “he” the farmer meant, “si Binay, iyong mayor ng Makati (Binay, the mayor of Makati).” Barangay Maligaya is just one of three barangays that Binay’s farm traverses. The other two are Mayuro and Bayawang. The Newsbreak team saw that within the same property is a sprawling farm known in the area as Binay’s property. The undeclared property is in the fourth district of Batangas. Although Binay traces his father’s roots to Bauan town, and inherited from his uncle a feed mill in the farther town of San Pascual, he acquired the Rosario land only in 1991. He bought the first 16.6 hectares from a certain Donato Almeda, a brother of the Makati assistant city treasurer who resigned his job two years before the sale. Through Renato Comla, one of his security aides who hailed from Rosario, Binay learned about the parcels of land which were up for sale around his property, according to a relative of Comla himself. Binay expanded the land over the years by buying out neighboring farms. Former employees in the farm and residents of the barangays also told Newsbreak that among those who sold their properties to Binay for about P35 per square meter were the Patulays, the Goyenas, the De Toreses, the Quezons, and the Aldays. Except for the Patulays, none of these families are natives of Batangas. Comla’s relative recalled that it was Comla himself who recruited farmers, including some of his other relatives from the surrounding barangays, to work in Binay’s farm. Speaking on condition of anonymity, Binay’s former farm hands complained that each time Binay bought the parcels of land, these would be put under their names and they would be made to sign documents to that effect. Binay got all the documents, however, they said, depriving them of the right to pursue their claims. The agrarian reform law bars a landowner from owning five hectares of agricultural land. Beyond that, he or she must distribute the land to his workers. By 1993, Binay had already acquired 38 hectares of land in the area. It was also then that he started his own hog raising business with 60 pigs. The following year, Binay decided to build honest-to-goodness structures in the farm, which required him to secure a building permit from the municipal government. At the time, the “owners” of his properties – farmworkers, actually – were no longer employed in his farm and therefore refused to sign any documents that would facilitate the release of the permit. “Pineke nila ang pirma namin. Tuwing kailangan, ‘yon ang ginawa nila,” said one of those formerly assigned to the piggery. “May kakutsaba sila sa munisipyo.” (Binay’s aides just forged our signatures. Every time these were needed, they would just forge them. Somebody in the municipal hall connives with them.) A Manila-based source, one of those who sold his property to Binay, in fact, warned that the moment inquiries about the property are made in the assessor’s office in Rosario, Binay is immediately tipped off. The vacation house inside the farm, which according to a farm insider, is “being patterned after the Palace in the Sky” project of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, rose simultaneously with spacious pens to house about 10,000 hogs, an expansive orchidarium, and hundreds of teepees for fighting cocks. The property, based on farmers’ estimates, now spans 66 hectares and, at P35 per square meter when the first parcel was bought, should be worth at least P23.1 million. Comla resigned as caretaker of the farm a few years ago due to his frequent conflicts with Elenita Binay’s aides. “There was a time when Doctora visited the farm more often than the mayor did because she had to check on her flowers. And her aides were commandeering people around, something which did not sit well with Ato,” a friend of Comla recalled. Former farm workers recalled that, in 1999, suspected communist guerrillas raided the farm because Binay reportedly maintained an armory there. They seized 10 different types of guns, according to farm employees at the time. Comla’s brother, his friend said, happened to be a member of the New People’s Army in the province. The farm is now heavily guarded, a farmer in nearby barangay said, with security guards coming all the way from Makati and General Santos City. Farm workers from surrounding barangays have been replaced by aetas from Mt. Pinatubo in Zambales and Tarlac who stay in quarters inside the farm. “Batanguenos complain a lot,” a former farm worker said, recalling the reason they were dismissed from their jobs. He said they were made to work from 7 am to 5 pm every day, and were made to choose between two salary arrangements – P150 a day without free food, or P3,000 a month with free food. To further secure the farm, Binay’s chief chief security, Lito Glean, frequently visits the place and has been befriending local leaders in the area. The chairman of Barangay Maligaya, Danilo Recto, is now Glean’s kumpare after he stood as sponsor in the wedding of Recto’s daughter. At present only one Batangueño, Pepito Carrido, remains employed in the farm. Carrido, who started out as bookkeeper in the farm seven years ago, is, by all indications, now a trusted man of Binay, in charge of releasing the salary of farm workers. Even if Carrido was present when we visited his house one Sunday evening, his wife, who had orchids as fine as Mrs. Binay’s in her mini patio, said her husband was out, that she did not know the number of his cellular phone, and that they never talked about his work in the farm. Carrido lives in a middle-class subdivision in Barangay San Roque. A stone’s throw away from the gate of his village is the Jobin B. Mango Station. Without these testimonies from residents of Rosario and former workers of Binay, it would be difficult to trace the ownership of the land to the returning mayor. This is the same difficulty that Newsbreak encountered when it investigated reports that Binay, through dummy corporations, also owned several business establishments in Makati. However, people privy to the transactions or who have seen the Binays in posh residences in the city have spoken with Newsbreak to confirm his ownership of these companies and residences. The papers of incorporation were mostly unavailable at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and, in instances that documents could be accessed, they listed non-incriminating names. Land titles remain in the names of former owners or fronts, according to people privy to Binay’s style, but the documents are all with him for safekeeping. The Makati properties A real estate broker, who had just shared the elevator ride with the doctora, was impressed that she seemed to be on a condo-buying spree. For that was the impression created by the Saturday afternoon visit some six months ago. The mayor at the time had just visited two of her daughters occupying two units on the 19th floor.Wearing a house dress which indicates her domestic familiarity with the place, Mayor Elenita Binay emerged from the elevator at the lobby of the Hidalgo condominium building at the plush Rockwell Center. The security guard acknowledged her with a respectful nod, which she returned with a casual inquiry, “May units pa bang for sale dito?” (Are there other units for sale here?) These days, the family reportedly already owns four units in the P100,000-per-square meter structure. However, Rockwell employees could confirm ownership of only two of these. Company officers declined to talk about the matter. Only one of the daughters, the Ateneo law student, stays in the place now. The other was asked by her parents to go back to their old house on Caong Street in Barangay San Antonio. The Binay couple still live in the same house and in the same tough neighbourhood where the father grew up. Orphaned at an early age, Binay was raised by his uncle who exposed him to simple living. But said a former trusted aide of Binay, “He keeps cash by the millions in that house.” And that is not his only house. Residents of Bel Air Village 2 attested that the “yellow house” at number 212 Orbit Street belongs to Binay. “It’s some kind of a safehouse, a place for meetings,” said a resident. “There are days when the place is quiet, and there are days when so many cars are parked outside the house.” Over in the less affluent Barangay West Rembo, a huge house, known to residents as being occupied by Binay’s newlywed daughter, has also been built. Just last February 24, squatter families were alarmed at the sight of engineers surveying the area for a possible widening of the road that leads to what they will call the “mansiyon” (mansion). Paving the roads means a possible demolition of their shanties. However, except for the fact that these houses are either occupied or frequented by members of the Binay family, there are no documents to show that they indeed own them. How could he have done it? Non-governmental organizations campaigning against Binay asked realtors to explain the most likely scheme that Binay, a former human rights lawyer, must have used to hide his ownership of these houses. The realtors explained it this way: He forms a company, which buys or builds the house for him. He then lists down unknown names from different addresses as incorporators of the company. After buying the property, registration papers do not bear his name. Instead, the original owner is asked to either issue a mortgage in Binay’s favor or sign a paper bestowing him with a power of attorney over the property. Only Binay has copies of the pertinent documents, such as deeds of sale and land titles. A former aide of Binay who worked with him for three years under the Aquino government claimed that the former mayor used this scheme to acquire more than 10 houses and lots in Dasmariñas Village, all of them being rented out. “There are these people from Bulacan whose names he’s been using [to acquire some properties],” the source, now retired from government, said. “In fact, he and Doctora are special guests of those people during fiestas.” Homeowners, however, could not confirm whether Binay indeed has properties in the neighbourhood. SEC records of holding companies involved in recent purchases of properties in the village did not point to Binay or any of his close associates. A contractor said the “usual SOP” is that, in exchange for a building permit, contractors give a representative of the office of the mayor one condominium unit. This is aside from the requirement for most contractors, until 1998, to hire the services of excavation contractor NJ Bautista Enterprises, which, according to three contractors interviewed by Newsbreak, is owned by the couple Noel and Celine Bautista. Both are said to be close to the Binays. Another contractor, who built at least two buildings recently, said his company had to give an undisclosed amount of money to an unidentified City Hall official before it got “accredited” to do work in Makati during Binay’s last term. He said the condominium payoffs, although made several years ago, remains “a very sensitive issue” which he could not discuss in detail. Despite persistent talk, however, nobody has come out to openly accuse Binay of pocketing commissions from these deals. The returning mayor has repeatedly denied this, claiming that his first mission was precisely to clean up the permits unit at City Hall. Pointing out that “everybody’s hassling everybody” in City Hall anyway, a third contractor contacted by Newsbreak said, without elaborating, that his company has opted to just comply with Binay’s extra-legal requirements so it could continue building in Makati. By doing so, he said, “we have not encountered problems so far.” Business ventures Called Apex, the five-story commercial complex on the corner of JP Rizal Extension and Sampaguita Street sits where a city government-owned sports complex used to stand. It houses on its first floor a Chowking restaurant, a Mercury drugstore, and a few RTW stalls. A bookstore occupies part of the second floor, while two cinemas share the third floor with a computer school, which also occupies the rest of the building.Just beside the barangay hall of Comembo, residents of Makati’s poorer communities have their own Glorietta to troop to. What makes the mini-mall popular among residents is that they know it belongs to former Mayor Binay. The name of the company, JOBIM, is a dead giveaway. City Hall insiders said it stands for Jojo Binay, Irasga (the last name of Nelson, his former chief city engineer and trusted aide with whom he had a falling out in 1998), and Mercado (the last name of former councilor Ernesto, who is widely recognized in Makati as Binay’s alleged bagman). The Chowking branch on the first floor of Apex which opened in 1996 is registered under the name BIMECH Food Chains Corporation, which, reliable sources said, again stands for Binay, Irasga, Mercado, and , possibly, one Lilia Chavez, whom SEC papers showed is a resident of Barangay Guadalupe in Makati. Chavez owns the most number of shares in the corporation, which, in 1998, reported a total net income of only P181,644, which dropped to P59,390 in 1999. However, as in the case of his alleged houses, documents on the ownership of these and other business establishments do not bear the name of Binay or any of his close political allies. In some cases, there are no papers of incorporation at the SEC at all. And as in the case of the houses, only employees and people privy to Binay’s business deals will attest to his ownership of the companies. For instance, two McDonald’s outlets along JP Rizal – one at the corner of Reposo Street, very near the City Hall, and another at the corner of Pasong Tamo, near the Sta. Ana Race Track – are widely known in Makati as Binay’s. A check on the papers, however, revealed that the franchise of the said outlets remains with McGeorge Foods Corporation, the mother company of McDonalds in the Philippines. A source knowledgeable about the deal said Binay earns from McDonald’s because he owns the lots on which the said outlets stand and also leases them to McGeorge. The Makati assessor’s office refused to reveal the identities of the owner of the said properties. The Dreyers ice cream booth in Glorietta at the Ayala Center, the franchise for which is pegged at P1 million, is also widely known to be Binay’s. The company’s name, BIMET Manufacturing Corporation, is quite similar to the JOBIM acronym of a mall that Binay reportedly co-owns with Mercado. The SEC, however, has no records on the company. No registration papers could be dug up either at the SEC for two more widely known businesses of Binay: the two-story Areflor Funeral Homes on JP Rizal Extension, and the Christine’s water purifying plant in Barangay Pembo. A Montessori school and a number of shanties were torn down to provide space and an access road to the said plant. The Binay couple reported in their SALs from 1996 up to 1999 that they had investments in business which grew at an average of P2 million annually. No details on the nature of these investments were given. Election issue Corruption is an issue that has been raised against Binay in every election since 1988, including the one held three years ago, when he fielded his wife while he was waiting for his term limit to pass. Each time, the charges – bloated payrolls, overpriced equipment and supplies, grease money demanded from businessmen, and hefty commissions from projects and purchases – would prove immaterial to voters, as Binay would always win hands down. To the poor who compose almost half of Makati’s 505,203 population, Binay is the champion who has delivered to them the goods and services by pounding on the rich to pay their taxes. The local opposition recognizes that it would be a “difficult climb” trying to downplay what Binay has given the poor, patronage politics being a concept that voters do not seem to regard as negative. Free education in a university that would shame private institutions in terms of structures and equipment, access to free medical care in the expensive Makati Medical Center, burial assistance for families who have lost loved ones, basketball courts and paved roads – as long as they benefit from these, residents of depressed barangays are unlikely to question whether these are their rights and not acts of goodwill from Binay. “We cannot deny the fact that Binay has been delivering to Makati’s poor more than what they ever had before,” said Councilor Mark Joseph, one of the only two oppositionists in the local legislative body. “What our constituents should be made aware of is what he is not delivering. Where people need medicine, they are given roads. Where people training for livelihood, they are given cement.” – Rappler.com This report was first published in Newsbreak magazine on March 28, 2001."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/66228-entrepreneurs-lessons-jollibee/","title":"What entrepreneurs can learn from Jollibee’s ‘Chickenjoy’ supply problem","date":"Aug 16, 2014 5:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Jollibee’s failure to anticipate the problems that would come with an IT system overhaul highlights the importance of business continuity planning","body":" MANILA, Philippnies – According to a Jollibee disclosure more than a week ago, they had to temporarily shut down 72 stores due a supply disruption caused by a major IT system upgrade. Some experts estimate that the closure cost the food giant millions of pesos in losses per day.While these losses are staggering (and come as a bummer to Filipinos everywhere who love their “ChickenJoy”), they provide a valuable case study in the making to local entrepreneurs and businessmen. Jollibee’s failure to anticipate the problems that would come with a system overhaul highlights the importance of business continuity planning (BCP).You’re never too big to plan aheadBusiness continuity planning, which is a term used interchangeably with business continuity and resiliency planning (BCRP), represents the need to identify internal and external threats to a business, so that it may continue to stay competitive in the market and avert any possible crises.In simple terms, BCP is not just a venture’s plan B – it’s plan B, plan C, and everything up to plan Z, covering all possible bases in their particular industry. An airline carrier, for example, would have ideally planned for emergency contingencies (what happens if a plane crashes?) to far less newsworthy, but no less as important of situations (how will we comply with this piece of aviation regulation if it is passed?).As the Jollibee situation proves, no company is so big that they can successfully operate without a thorough BCP. Evan Tan, who is the regional director for Southeast Asia of Freelancer.com, which competes internationally and locally with rival job platforms Elance and oDesk, echoes this sentiment.According to a business article that he read, 90% of tech startups fail due to their inability to respond to the challenges facing their companies. “In the tech industry where even giants can easily be toppled by budding companies (Facebook killing Myspace and Friendster ring a bell?), one’s incapability to adapt and innovate can be disastrous to one’s business,” he said.To not go the way of Myspace and Friendster, Tan says that Freelancer.com has entire teams dedicated to performing research on how to improve their products. As a whole, the company also tries to stay attuned to industry trends, in addition to listening to their users and engaging with them on how to get better.Tan advises other businesses and entrepreneurs to do the same, even when doing so is not easy to swallow. As an example, he invokes the case of users that publicly say negative things about your company on Twitter or other social media networks.“It’s easy to dismiss people who lash out on social media as rabble-rousers out to destroy one’s company, but some of them could actually have been your fiercest supporters who have grown frustrated with your service,” Tan pointed out. According to him, you need to make it a priority to find out what made them feel that way.The risks that come with being an entrepreneurBut BCP should not just be an exercise of large corporations. Even early-stage startups would benefit tremendously from some form of BCP, as Kickstart Ventures president Minette Navarrete shared. Kickstart Ventures invests in and incubates such notable companies as dating platform Peakwoo, ecommerce shopping site Ava.ph, and recruitment platform Kalibrr.Navarrete said that early-stage investing is an inherently risky proposition to begin with, so BCP is a critical component of what Kickstart does. According to her, there are many clear risks associated with startups, such as market risk, execution risk, and regulatory or policy risk, such as with what ride-sharing platform Tripid is facing with the Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB).However, some potential risks that come with startups are less obvious. “There is also the personnel risk (i.e. the risk that a key person – whether a member of the investment firm, or a founder in a portfolio company – leaves),” she said. “As much of early-stage investing relies on small teams of uniquely skilled individuals, the loss of a critical team member could be particularly crippling.”The fact that Kickstart invests in and incubates more than a handful of startups reduces that risk that would come with any single startup. “The portfolio approach is the classic way of mitigating investment risk, even if our day-to-day operations – especially working as intimately with startups as we do – will often feel like the portfolio multiplies rather than mitigates the risks we need to live through!” Navarrete revealed.In addition to addressing business continuity risks in their annual business plan, Navarrete said that each investment decision considers the risks that their due diligence has surfaced.“Some startups might have a greater regulatory risk (e.g. financial services, transport, etc.); others would be more susceptible to technology risks, or market disruption,” she said. “In each case, we assess both the vulnerability of the startup, as well as the odds that it could weather the discontinuity, and the risk management / mitigation plan.”Navarrete pointed out that the benefits of BCP come not only in how well you plan, but in how well you carry out that plan.“The strategy piece is only as good as the execution: we keep close to the community and the market; we watch for early patterns that could signal trends, and early warnings of discontinuity,” she said. “We speak to experts and share insights and experiences. Through constant and candid sharing, we are able to weave a bigger picture, and better able to understand underlying currents.”Toward this end, Kickstart has brought in such luminaries as (Pollenizer CEO and co-founder) Phil Morle; (Innosight Managing Director) Scott Anthony; (political economist) Toti Chikiamco; (National Competitiveness Council Private Sector Co-Chair) Bill Luz; (Scan.me founder) Garrett Gee; and the Dropbox product team.BCP to the extremeSome high tech startups require even more BCP than normal. VMoney, which was founded in 2013 by CEO Ralph Santos, is an end-to-end financial platform, offering everything from debit Mastercards and scratch cards to point of sale systems and tap and pay solutions.As part of their BCP, Santos and the VMoney team keep track of where to direct their R&D by monitoring market needs, the challenges faced by their partners and other providers, and security advancements across the ecommerce world.The startup now works with some of the largest brands in the country, including Guess, Gold’s Gym, EasyTaxi, Mango, Mossimo, and TeamManila, so continuity of the services they do currently offer is of the utmost importance.Given the complexity of VMoney’s hardware and software, Santos and his team have ensured that there are many checks in place, including everything from “infrastructure fail overs to the transition and activation of support plans to immediate notification of potential security concerns with proper communication processes throughout.”To test their systems, Santos said that the VMoney team performs integrity checks, quality checks, and security checks on their systems, applications, and databases – some of which are done on schedule, and some of which are done as random reviews. Santos expressed that the goal here is to not only meet regulatory requirements, but to exceed industry standards (which is a particularly fitting remark in the wake of the Jollibee situation).So what would constitute an operational disaster for VMoney on the order of Jollibee’s current one?“Our business relies on data and transaction integrity and not so much on tangible products or brick and mortar inventory,” Santos responded. “A disaster for us is a breach in our systems, applications, or databases.”Lucky for him, VMoney has yet to experience such a problem. “I have no business disasters to share at this point and hopefully ever,” Santos said, before adding, “Knock on wood.” – Rappler.com   Rappler business columnist Ezra Ferraz graduated from UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California, where he taught writing for 3 years.

The San Francisco-based startup set up shop in Metro Manila last week with a unique proposition. They get you a car and personal driver, but you only pay per use. The idea is not only innovative but green, and with the impending “carmageddon,” timely. Private cars spend most of their lives parked, while shared cars are more utilized. The concept of a shared economy hugely impacts congestion and the environment. Uber Regional Manager Michael Brown said these are values that are very important to the company – “to innovate in order to make transport less expensive, to reduce congestion in cities, and to make transport more environmentally sane so we don’t ruin our planet.” The concept behind the new service is simple and familiar. You do everything on the Uber app (available on iOS and Android) – sign-up, order a car, track the car, contact the driver, and rate the experience. But Uber shouldn’t be confused for a taxi. On its network is a mix of high-end cars, “everything from a Mercedes E Class to a Toyota Camry.” Imagine a premium car, black, without any branding and with a leather interior. Of course luxury comes at a price. Brown says the price of an Uber is about 1.25x the cost of a taxi but that’s a conservative estimate. Expect your Uber ride to cost up to 2x of what you’d normally pay for a cab ride and about 1.3x the cost of app-based taxi booking services like GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi. Frills aside, Brown said other key differentiators of his company are “convenience of payment and the accountability” that Uber brings to transport and safety. Booking a car and a driver   The most tedious part of the process is signing up, a 5-minute process which entails having to key in your credit card details and verifying your email address.  The good news is you only have to do it once. Next time you launch the app you’ll immediately see a pin with your current location and the estimated wait time. Click on “set pickup location” which loads another screen where you can either get a “fare quote” and/or “enter a promo code” before you finalize your order by clicking on “request pickup here.”  Soon you’ll move on to another screen that says “driver confirmed and en route” with a real time map for tracking the car. You’ll also get the driver’s name, plate number, and contact number and options to call and message the driver himself.    Josh: We didn’t tell Uber we were doing a test and decided not to use any of our promo codes for this particular piece. I was a bit disappointed that the wait time was 30 minutes. I had loaded the app from home and got estimated wait times between 8-10 minutes. I was told that 10 minutes is also the average wait time in Makati too.  I did like how easy it is to use the app. I use app-based taxi booking services all the time and it’s never as straight forward as this. Soon after our booking was made, the driver was texting and calling to make sure he got the exact pick-up point. I also liked the split fare option, which allows you to invite a second passenger to share the ride and costs with. On this trip I shared a ride with my car-pool buddy and colleague Jessica who immediately after I clicked on split fare, got an invite on her iPhone. Jessica: It took 26 minutes for the car to arrive. Good thing we were at a mall and were not in a hurry, otherwise waiting would have been an inconvenience. The driver took the initiative to text and call to clarify where the meeting point would be, so we were assured we would get a ride and that there was no glitch in the system. What I loved most about booking an Uber ride is that specifying the dropoff location is not a requirement. This means you won’t get discriminated against by drivers who decide to take you (or not) based on where you’re headed. I had very few expectations from this ride because I wasn’t very familiar with the app. In fact, I only installed it because Josh wanted to try the “Share the Fare” feature. All I knew was that it wasn’t going to be the usual taxi and that we what we were waiting for was a Toyota Camry. The ride We travelled from SM Megamall in Ortigas to Katipunan in Quezon City on a black Toyota Camry. Our trip covered a distance of 12.59 km and took 27 minutes and 3 seconds.   I had interviewed Michael Brown a few days before our first Uber ride so my expectations were built up. I was told the chauffeur would open the door for me and then offer me a bottle of water – none of this happened, but maybe that’s nitpicking. The ride was comfortable, leaps and bounds from a taxi. But unlike a taxi that knows the city streets well, our driver, who in a pre-Uber life shuttled banking clients to and from work, didn’t know the city like the back of his hand and relied on us for directions. And because we were too engrossed in our conversation, we , for example, the driver takes you off course. A representative will recalculate the route and give you a credit refund. I wanted to give the experience 3 of 5 stars but Jessica stopped me because the driver supposedly rated us 5 star passengers. The car arrived on time and at the exact pickup point we specified. It had really nice leather seat covers and didn’t look or smell filthy. The driver greeted us and asked if we wanted the radio on and if it was too loud, and if the air-conditioning was too cold or too warm. I was surprised to see the driver using an iPad mini to book and navigate instead of the low-end Android phones used by drivers of GrabTaxi and Easy Taxi of which I am a regular user. What can be disappointing for some customers is the driver’s lack of route knowledge. This is acceptable or may even be better if you’re headed in a familiar destination and prefer to direct the driver to take your preferred route. However, if you’re going somewhere for the first time you’ll both end up lost. Post-ride thoughts   I got off at the corner street by my house, not wanting to make it difficult for the driver to have to drive in 10 meters just to make a u-turn to get back on course. The driver hesitated, he wanted to get me home safe. Props to him for that (okay maybe he doesn’t deserve just 3 stars). Because I wasn’t the final stop I didn’t know how much the total fare was. But as soon as Jessica was dropped off we both got emails informing us that our credit cards were deducted half of the actual fare. From SM Megamall to Katipunan via EDSA, Kamias and Xavierville, our total fare cost just under P330. The same route on a regular taxi costs us P180 on average. We could have saved an extra P20 had we not decided to split the fare. If you plan on regularly using Uber to carpool (which you can up to 4 people), we recommend you don’t use the app’s sharing feature and work out the costs internally. Each passenger added to the split fare list is charged P10. After the ride is over you are asked to rate your driver. If you give him 3 stars and below you’ll be asked what didn’t work, with the option to pick arrival time, driving, car quality, professionalism, and trip route as factors.  The trip cost above P300, which is about twice what we pay for cab rides and only a few pesos more expensive than GrabTaxi and EasyTaxi. Another unique Uber feature that I like is the two-way feedback system – something I find lacking in taxi booking apps – for which the driver gave us 5 stars. Lastly, and this is what will probably make me want to book an Uber ride again, the driver offered to open the door for me before I got out of the car – something that you don’t get a lot as a commuter. There’s nothing like the feeling of safety when you go home every night at an ungodly hour.  Despite their company motto, Uber isn’t for everyone, at least for now. The biggest barrier to universality is the credit card requirement. Brown said the company is looking into other forms of payment. “Ultimately we want people to ride and are looking into other payment gateways to make Uber universally accessible,” he said. A company that prides itself in its ability to innovate, Uber is also looking into solving the “last 100-meter problem” with even better mapping solutions to help connect drivers with riders.    While our 30 minute wait, and not so route-savvy driver signal that the company is still going through birthing pains, the idea is one worth looking into. The service is perfect if you don’t have a car and/or driver and want to travel in style to a party, business meeting or some other important event, or if you just feel like you deserve a travel upgrade but don’t want to spend on a car just yet. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/17186-a-modern-mobile-way-to-commute-in-manila/","title":"A modern, mobile way to commute in Manila","date":"Dec 3, 2012 4:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Via route-sharing on an online-based community platform, Tripid.ph promises a new alternative for going from point A to point B in the metro","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Here’s an idea: What if you need to find a way to your destination by hitching with someone going in the same direction? How do you find that person? Check out Tripid.ph, an online site that supports a new way of traveling: route-sharing. “People were thinking about transportation incorrectly,” theorizes Tripid’s founder, Michael Ngo Dee. “People were always thinking in terms of how to maximize transportation assets — that meant car sharing.” The premise is simple: to utilize an open carpooling system that involves car owners who want to rent out transportation real estate (that is, empty car seats) and passengers who have a specific need based on schedule and destination. “We thought, ‘It would be really awesome if people could find out if there was somebody going the same direction through their phones,’ and that was basically how we started off pitching it,” Ngo Dee shares. “We were thinking of getting everybody to become aware of how and where people are going.”  Going mobile and social “Tripid has an open platform where passengers and drivers can bid for [the cost of] rides,” explains Ngo Dee.  The bidding for rides involves a one-time offer and counter-offer that, in a way, is settled by an agreed perceived value by both parties. Dee illustrates: “You can actually say, ‘I want to travel from Ortigas to Makati and I’m offering a P40 payment as a passenger.’ “A driver can make a counter-offer on Tripid and say,  ‘I’m willing to give you that ride for P30.’ What if another guy says, ‘I can give it to you for P100 but, guess what, I’m driving a BMW’?” Creating a community of commuters Tripid.ph assumes that both passengers and drivers will see the benefit from predicted schedules of trips as well as the value of integrating an actual transaction into the carpool system. It allows a user to work within a select organization — a chosen community of users — utilizing privacy settings, and be more efficient with travel time and its related logistics. Think of it as the social media platform of hitchhikers but in an organized, thought out, and transparent manner.  The power, though, lies in the software itself: a collaborative engine that lets users have crowdsourced options to get from point A to point B. The first way to look at Tripid’s big idea is from the perspective of the shared expense. By sharing the ride, the cost gets distributed among the passengers in a vehicle. But there’s more: It also assumes that there is shared responsibility in time management. One of the website’s features is Tripid Time — one clock for all to use, to enforce punctuality and eliminate excuses. Making safety a priority It may take a bit of a leap to embrace Tripid’s concept. After all, how do you put yourself in a stranger’s car or let someone you don’t know join you for a ride? This is why Tripid has made it a point to put security features on the top of its list.   One key feature is the Trip Ticket functionality that requires both passengers and drivers to log the beginning and end times for the trip. The technology is, then, able to monitor a trip’s progress. Secondly, there is a ratings feature for both parties. This feedback system helps create a more substantial description of the persons behind the profiles. Most importantly, there is a distress feature: the Community Call. Each Tripid user is prompted to create a list of Community Call Contacts and add that list to his profile. “If something happens to me,” explains Ngo Dee, “I can press the Community Call button on my phone. It then extracts my location and sends an email [to the emergency contacts].” The Community Call — as well as Tripid’s other mobile functions — has some requirements: Promising perks Currently, Tripid on mobile is available through web browsers only. According to Ngo Dee, “the mobile web version is like an app experience where you can view Tripid on your mobile browser.  This means that the experience is shared homogeneously between iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian or BB users.” Tripid.ph launched in February 2012 and went live in October. Though it was a quiet unveiling, the first month was instantly promising with around 400 users who signed up and more than 100 rides recorded. This proves Tripid’s assumption that there is a need to shift the way we travel around the city. That said, the carpooling model is still not the norm, and it may take some time for that to happen. The team behind Tripid.ph knows this and is planning to push the paradigm shift more aggressively. Very soon, Tripid will provide its users with networks relevant to them. They may also be enticing perks, like parking slots for Tripid drivers.  For added convenience and security, Tripid is also rolling out secured mobile payments before year-end, which will provide an added safety function for all parties involved.    Needless to say, the Tripid team is planning several exciting revelations to make the commuter experience better and more enjoyable.  For Ngo Dee, however, developing Tripid goes beyond the transportation problem per se.  “It is more about my passion with mixing technology [and lifestyle]. It is more than just about commuting, but about how we can make things more efficient.” – Rappler.com   For more information and to sign up, go to www.Tripid.ph.
