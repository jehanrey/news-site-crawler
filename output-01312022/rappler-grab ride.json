It operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region.","body":"Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and food delivery firm, listed on the Nasdaq on Thursday, December 2, following its $40-billion merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth Corporation. The deal is the world’s biggest ever by a blank-check company and the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian firm. Founded in 2012, Grab is Southeast Asia’s largest startup, valued at just over $16 billion last year. It launched as a Malaysian taxi-hailing service and now calls itself a “superapp” after expanding into food, grocery, and parcel delivery and to digital payments, lending, and other financial services. Singapore-headquartered Grab operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region, counting Indonesia as its biggest. Its venture with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd was awarded a digital bank license in Singapore last year. Grab gained the global spotlight in 2018 when it bought the Southeast Asian business of Uber Technologies in return for the US ride-hailing company taking a stake in Grab. With some 8,000 employees, Grab has tech centers in Singapore, Beijing, Seattle, Bengaluru, and other places. Early investors include Japan’s SoftBank, China’s Didi Chuxing, and venture capital firms Vertex Ventures Holdings and GGV Capital. Grab raised about $12 billion ahead of the listing. Investors range from venture and hedge funds to automobile companies and other ride-hailing firms, and include Uber, Booking Holdings, China Investment Corporation, Coatue Management, Hillhouse Capital, Hyundai Motor Company, Invesco Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, Ping An Capital Company, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Yamaha Motor Company. In the SPAC deal, about three dozen investors came on board including Temasek Holdings, BlackRock, Fidelity International, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, and Malaysia’s Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Altimeter Capital. GoTo Group, formed by the merger of Indonesian ride-hailing and deliveries firm Gojek and local e-commerce leader Tokopedia, is Grab’s biggest competitor. Singapore-based Sea Ltd, which has e-commerce, gaming, and a digital payments business, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Sea has also won a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab is likely to increasingly start competing with banks as it expands its financial services. It also competes with such delivery companies as Foodpanda and Deliveroo PLC. Grab’s third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $157 million. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. Gross merchandise value hit a quarterly record of $4 billion. The delivery business has emerged as the biggest segment as more consumers shifted to online food delivery during the pandemic. Grab forecasts it will turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. Anthony Tan, 39, is the company’s chief executive officer and co-founder. Fellow co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, 38, runs Grab’s operations, including corporate strategy and technology. Both Tans, unrelated, met at Harvard Business School, where they conceived the idea of the ride-hailing company. Grab’s president, Ming Maa, is a prominent dealmaker from SoftBank, who joined the company in 2016. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-nasdaq-listing-united-states-december-2-2021/","title":"Southeast Asia’s Grab slumps in US debut after record SPAC deal","date":"Dec 3, 2021 9:45 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab makes the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian company. Its shares rise as much as 21% minutes after listing on the Nasdaq, before retreating to trade 23% lower.","body":"SINGAPORE – Shares in Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, slid more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday, December 2, following the company’s record $40-billion merger with a blank-check company. Grab’s shares rose as much as 21% minutes after the listing before retreating to trade 23% lower at $8.51 by 1834 GMT. “The price makes no difference to me. I’m going to celebrate tonight and get back to work tomorrow,” chief executive officer Anthony Tan told Reuters just after the shares started trading. The backdoor listing on Nasdaq marks the high point for the nine-year-old Singapore company that began as a ride-hailing app and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, insurance, and investment products. Grab kicked off the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian company with a bell-ringing event in Singapore, hosted by Nasdaq and Grab’s executives. The event was attended by about 250 people including its investors, drivers, merchants, and employees, with many dressed in the company’s signature green. Thunderous handclaps reverberated in the hotel ballroom as an emotional Tan thanked them for putting Grab and Southeast Asia’s tech economy on the global map. CEO Tan and Tan Hooi Ling developed the company from an idea for a Harvard Business School venture competition in 2011. The two Tans are not related. The listing comes after Grab’s April agreement to merge with US tech investor Altimeter Capital Management’s special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Altimeter Growth Corporation, and raise $4.5 billion, including $750 million from Altimeter. Grab’s flotation “will provide a bigger cash buffer” to its “cash burn,” S&P Global Ratings said in a note. But it said the company’s “credit quality continues to be constrained by its loss-making operations, and free operating cash flows could be negative over the next 12 months.” Southeast Asia’s internet economy is forecast to double to $360 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025, prompting Grab’s rivals, including regional internet firm Sea Ltd and Indonesia’s GoTo Group, to bulk up.  GoTo plans a local initial public offering in 2022 after completing an expected $2-billion private fundraising, sources have told Reuters. A US listing will follow the Jakarta offering. “Longer term, we’re really excited about Grab Financial Group,” said Chris Conforti, partner at Altimeter Capital, referring to Grab’s financial services unit. “I think the bell curve on that is much wider in terms of what the outcome could be, but it could be extremely large.” CEO Tan, 39, expanded Grab into a regional operation with a range of services, after launching it as a taxi app in Malaysia in 2012. It later moved its headquarters to Singapore. “What we have shown to the world is that homegrown tech companies can develop great technology that can compete globally, even when international players are in town,” Tan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, December 1. “We can compete and win.” He will control 60.4% of voting rights along with Grab’s co-founder, and president Ming Maa, but hold only a 3.3% stake with them. Grab’s listing brings a payday bonanza to early backers such as Japan’s SoftBank and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, which invested as early as 2014. They were later joined by the likes of Toyota Motor Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Japanese megabank MUFG. Uber became a Grab shareholder in 2018 after selling its Southeast Asian business to Grab following a five-year battle.     In September, Grab cut its full-year adjusted net sales forecasts, citing renewed uncertainty over pandemic curbs on movement.  Third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier and its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. GMV in the quarter rose to a record $4 billion. It aims to turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were the lead placement agents on the fundraising, while Evercore and UBS were the co-placement agents. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/government-suspends-move-it-grab-rides-partnership-september-30-2021/","title":"Just a week into operations, Move It rides on Grab suspended","date":"Sep 30, 2021 10:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The government says Grab and Move It failed to follow guidelines when they entered into their deal. But Move It denounces other companies for allegedly orchestrating the suspension.","body":"The Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) ordered Grab and Move It to suspend their partnership starting Thursday, September 30, just a week after operations began. The partnership is premised on users being able to book Move It drivers through the Grab app. In a statement on Thursday, the TWG said the parties “were not operating in accordance [with] agreed parameters and guidelines.” “Grab’s application instead of Move It’s application was used to avail, book, and pay for the ride service; and that the entire process of training, driver onboarding, marketing, issuance of official receipts, and the use of the Grab Driver app was all undertaken by Grab,” the TWG said. It added that the partnership makes it appear as if Grab is a “de facto member” of the pilot study on motorcycle ride-hailing services. “Grab’s entry is a circumvention of the processes and guidelines that had been laid down at the start of the study,” the TWG said. The TWG claimed that Move It and Grab “were not prepared to engage” in the collaboration. But Move It maintained that it has been transparent with the TWG and other stakeholders. “Our partnership has gone through several rounds of discussions with the TWG where all of their concerns were addressed. So bakit ngayong naka-launch na kami, tsaka kami ipapa-suspend (So why are they suspending us after we’ve already launched)?” asked Move It. Move It also said the “maneuvering,” which it blamed on “complaints” by other members of the pilot study, was tantamount to bullying. “This suspension was orchestrated by a number of stakeholders in the motorcycle taxi pilot against Move It – the smaller player in the pilot,” it said. “We strongly condemn this maneuvering by other stakeholders resulting [in] this suspension as it is anti-consumer, anti-Filipino, and is tantamount to bullying.” While Move It did not name the companies, the other two members of the pilot study are Angkas and JoyRide. Move It disclosed that the partnership it sealed with Grab was offered to Angkas and JoyRide as well, but the two declined. “Mahirap na po ang buhay kaya dapat tayong magtulungan – at hindi naman po masama ang humingi ng tulong,” Move It said. (Life is very difficult right now that’s why we have to work together – and it isn’t bad to ask for help.) Grab, meanwhile, said discussions with the regulators are still ongoing.  “Grab is committed to empowering local businesses, and our partnership with Move It is consistent with our ongoing efforts to help everyday entrepreneurs thrive and succeed,” it said. Grab said it hopes that the partnership will be given the green light again soon. “The pandemic has brought upon many challenges to the transport industry, and these challenges would require a whole-of-industry solution,” it said. “As a community partner, Grab Philippines will continue to do right by our consumers and partners, encourage constructive dialogue using facts and objective information, and help contribute to the recovery of our transportation industry.” Aside from studying the legalization of motorcycle taxis, the government allowed their operations to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/motorcycle-taxis-available-grab-philippines-starting-september-23-2021/","title":"Motorcycle taxis available on Grab starting September 23","date":"Sep 22, 2021 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines partners with Move It for its motorcycle taxi services","body":"Commuters will be able to book a motorcycle taxi on the Grab app starting Thursday, September 23. In a statement on Wednesday, September 22, Grab Philippines said it partnered with Move It for its motorcycle ride-hailing service. Move It will still offer motorcycle rides through its app, but the partnership will allow its riders to have a wider market given Grab’s large user base. Similar to Grab’s transport bookings, cashless payments will be implemented. Commuters can pay through credit or debit card, GrabPay credits, or by cashing in with the driver. “Through this landmark partnership, we are confident that many Filipinos will experience and enjoy its many benefits, and we are hopeful that the bike-hailing industry will continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic,” said Move It president and chief executive officer Francis Juan. Since the service is being offered during the coronavirus pandemic, commuters will have to bring their own helmets. Commuters can book Mondays to Sundays, from 5 am to 10 pm, in the Greater Manila Area. “Our partnership with Move It is a hallmark expression of how transport stakeholders can come together for the common good, and we invite all companies to join us towards this mission,” said Grab Philippines head Grace Vera Cruz. Grab said statistics required by the Department of Transportation’s motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) will still be submitted. In 2020, Grab had said it was “seriously considering” entering the motorcycle taxi market “if given the chance.” The motorcycle taxi TWG, however, did not seem keen on granting authority to other players outside of the original participants in the government’s pilot study. Aside from Move It, Angkas and JoyRide were authorized to offer motorcycle ride-hailing services. The Philippine government allowed motorcycle ride-hailing services to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/grabpay-perks/","title":"Still not using GrabPay? Here are the valuable perks you’re missing out on","date":"Sep 21, 2021 6:59 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s one: There are no transfer fees","body":"Just like how the world has shifted into a more digital landscape, Filipinos have swiftly adapted to online transactions and cashless payments. Though it’s unfortunate that the pandemic served as a catalyst, it provided the right opportunity for most of us to take advantage of the convenience of e-wallets, such as no more pila (long lines), and being granted insta-access to bank accounts and due date-beating bills payment services, among other things. To be fair, all market players deliver on their promise; each one has its strengths depending on your needs. Consumers are now provided with a one-stop shop for their transactions, and seem to have an endless stream of deals. Banks are also stepping up their game, with their apps carrying e-wallet-like capabilities. (READ: Cashless payments 101: Starting out with a digital wallet) As with all bright and shiny things, everything isn’t spotless. With the increasing dependence on e-wallets and online banking comes a glaring compromise that we can’t escape from – those inconvenient “convenience fees.” Towards the latter part of 2020, we all watched in horror as PESONet and InstaPay slowly engulfed big names, leaving only a handful without fees. If you’re using one of the “affected” services, there seems to be no choice, and it’s hard to give up on their benefits. Or so we thought. How about considering GrabPay, the Grab app’s native e-wallet? Most of us are familiar with it as Grab’s preferred mode of payment on rides – a significant attempt to lessen physical contact between driver and passenger – but it’s so much more than that. Once you’re aware of its perks and advantages, you can harness it to become one of your most valuable digital wallet accounts. For starters, and perhaps its best feature, GrabPay has no convenience fee when you transfer to other banks and e-wallets, which saves you at least P15 per transaction. Likewise, you can spend less on those extra fees when you cash in from one of its partner institutions – BPI, BDO, and Unionbank – by simply linking your online banking account.  Pro-tip: You can turn your GrabPay wallet into a “halfway point” between accounts to avoid those insidious fees. If you have a BPI account, for example, cash in your intended amount to GrabPay, then transfer it to another bank. That way, you’ll regain that no lugi (loss) feeling that you once enjoyed. Is that possible? You best believe it. With each in-app or outside transaction that makes use of GrabPay as a mode of payment, you earn GrabRewards points! When accumulated, these can be used to save on future GrabCar rides, GrabFood orders, GrabMart groceries, and GrabExpress deliveries. There are even more perks awaiting as you progress the GrabRewards tiers – from “Member” all the way up to “Platinum.” You’ll gradually unlock and redeem more offers and prizes, such as free coupons, food items via GrabFood, and a premium Spotify subscription. If we’ve piqued your curiosity, know more about the hows of earning points, the tiering system, and the range of benefits by visiting the GrabRewards site. Most of all, by simply using GrabPay on purchases from its partner brands, including adidas, ShopSM, and Zalora, you’ll be able to shave off prices through loads of exclusive discounts. And lest we forget, your next Lazada or Shopee check-out sprees have been taken into consideration, making you eligible for up to P500 off in savings too. Just how sulit (worth it) can GrabPay be? We can’t thank e-wallets and online banking enough for making our transactions easier and faster at such an inconvenient time. But as you use one (or some), continue pushing your luck by going for a service that’s flexible, yields more value for your money, and leaves you without a lugi feeling. And GrabPay is the key. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/public-transportation-commute-difficult-ecq-august-2021/","title":"‘Sobrang hirap ng unang araw ng ECQ. Paano pa sa mga susunod na araw?’","date":"Aug 6, 2021 11:25 PM PHT","snippet":"Commuters endure the long lines at different checkpoints because of the new policies in the third lockdown episode in Metro Manila","body":"Kay Anne Reubal started her day an hour earlier on Friday, August 6, the first day of the lockdown in Metro Manila.  By 2 am, she was already waiting for a jeepney to take her from Antipolo City to Cubao in Quezon City. But she got her ride some two and a half hours later. Reubal found relief when she finally boarded a jeepney going to work. It was still daybreak but her commute nightmare was just about to start when they reached a checkpoint along Marcos Highway. The police manning the checkpoint inspected the jeepney she was in and reprimanded the driver because of overloading. Road-based transport vehicles like jeepneys were only allowed to have passengers half of their original capacity. Reubal, who was already late for work at the time, was getting worried. She hoped that the police would let them pass through. Instead, all of the passengers inside the jeepney were asked to go down in the middle of Marcos Highway to look for another ride. “Pinagalitan din kami. Bakit daw kami sumaskay nang puno na? Noong sumakay naman ako maluwag pa talaga. Siyempre, hindi naman namin kasalanan iyon ng mga pasahero kasi depende iyon sa nagpapasakay. Hindi ko naman akalain na pupunuin niya (driver) iyong jeep,” Reubal said. (We were reprimanded. We were asked why did we have to ride a jeep if it was already full of passengers? When I rode it, it was not that full. Of course, it wasn’t the fault of the passengers because it really depends on the driver. I didn’t have any idea that the driver would take in more passengers.) Reubal waited for almost half an hour just to find a vehicle that would bring her to Cubao. Her work starts at 4 am. But on Friday, she arrived at 6 am – two hours late for work. As the National  Capital Region slipped into the first day of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), different checkpoints were set up around its the borders to limit entry of people. The government said public transport supply during the previous general community quarantine (GCQ) would be retained during ECQ. The railways around the metro though seemed empty given the stay-at-home order. But at the outskirts of the metro, commuters and motorists had to bear with heavy traffic and long hours of travel because of the new rules. On the other side of the metropolis, Marielle Esguerra started looking for a vehicle on superapp Grab at 2:30 am. She took a chance for a possible jeepney or taxi outside her home in Tondo, but even those were not available. Esguerra knew that the lockdown meant her commute would be even more difficult, so she decided to start early. From Tondo, she also had to get to Cubao.  When she finally booked a Grab ride at 5:30 am, she and the driver encountered multiple checkpoints along the way.  This was because of the so-called “tiny bubbles” policy of the police, banning inter-city travel for non-APOR or authorized persons outside of residence. “Sobrang hirap ng unang araw ng ECQ. Paano pa kaya sa mga susunod na araw hanggang August 20, hindi ba? Hindi man lang inisip iyong mga tao especially kaming mga nagta-trabaho,” Esguerra said. (It was already difficult to commute during the first day of ECQ, how will it be the coming days until August 20? Right? It seemed like we, the workers, were just an afterthought.) Reubal and Esguerra were only two of the many workers who struggled to get to their offices because of the imposition of the ECQ. Lou Gepuela of Move As One Coalition said the focus of checkpoints should be across the borders of Metro Manila and nearby provinces – not within the cities. “I’m not seeing the point of checkpoints between LGUs (local government units). I am also wondering, hindi ba naka-bubble (NCR Plus) na tayo (weren’t we already part of the NCR Plus bubble)? I think the emphasis should be more on the borders of the bubble itself,” Gepuela said. Gepuela said that the government should have implemented the service contracting program so that passengers were assured of a ride while drivers were also confident that they would earn despite the lockdown. The service contracting program of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was halted on June 30, when the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act expired. The LTFRB has funds for the program, but they have yet to revive service contracting. Instead, the Department of Transportation has been implementing a free ride program for vaccinated APORs at the railways. However, only over 30% of Metro Manila’s target population have been vaccinated. And many of those vaccinated were senior citizens or have comorbidities – thus, not necessarily APORs. For Esguerra, she said the government should have thought about the plight of the commuters who relied on public transportation to get to work, before instituting new rules. “Sana bago nila gawin iyong isang bagay, pag-aralan muna nila. Hindi naman kasi kaming mga tao ay pagpa-practicean lang ng mga ginagawa nila,” Esguerra said. “Hindi kasi nila nararanasan iyong mga nararanasan namin,” she added. (I hope before they implemented rules, they should’ve thought about it. We are people and they shouldn’t trying out these new rules on us. They put little thought into it because they don’t experience what we are going through.) – Rappler.com Jezreel Ines is a Rappler intern.

Called GrabCar Bayanihan, the service will be cheaper than the regular GrabCar 2-seater service, although specific rates were not mentioned.  There will be two types of Bayanihan: “GrabCar Bayanihan From” and “GrabCar Bayanihan To.” The former is what commuters will see on their app if they’re booking from the vaccination center to their desired destination. The latter is what commuters will see on the app when booking from their point of origin, going to the vaccination center. GrabCar Bayanihan rides are driven by vaccinated drivers, lessening the risk that a passenger will be infected by COVID-19 on the way to getting vaccinated.  To book the service, type the vaccination center you’ve registered to. Grab says it usually starts with the word “Vaccine.” Once the location is confirmed, tap the GrabCar Bayanihan option. Grab has a full list of locations serviced by GrabCar Bayanihan here.  There will be about 1,000 vaccinated drivers on the service, plying Manila, Las Pinas, Taguig, Pasig, Makati, Quezon City, Pateros, and Marikina.

Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, the people said, potentially offering its customers, drivers and merchant partners easier access to trade its shares. Grab, a household name across Southeast Asia, is in the early stages of considering a secondary listing in the city-state, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. The potential Singapore listing plans come after Grab this week agreed to a $40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), making this the world’s biggest SPAC deal. Grab, which began as a ride-hailing business in 2012, now operates in 8 countries and more than 400 cities and has expanded into food and grocery deliveries, as well as digital payments. Last year, it won a digital banking license in Singapore. It wasn’t clear how much Grab might aim to raise in any secondary listing, with financial terms and timetable still in the early stages of consideration, the sources said. The company with the top valuation on the Singapore bourse is bank DBS Group Ltd, currently worth about S$74 billion ($55.4 billion) by capitalization. Grab and SGX declined to comment on the listing plans. One of the sources said that while Grab has sufficient cash reserves and could end up raising only a small amount on SGX, a listing would mark a big win for the exchange. SGX has mainly only seen large IPOs from real estate investment trusts. Hindered by a small base of retail investors in the city-state, it has struggled with low liquidity and valuations, forcing a spate of delistings and also discouraging big-ticket listings from regional high-growth companies. The Hong Kong bourse, however, has benefited from diplomatic and political tensions between the United States and China that have led many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. Global fund managers have also been swapping China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong. SGX has taken many steps to try to bulk up its stock market in recent years, and under Chief Executive Loh Boon Chye, who was appointed six years ago, it has acquired firms to transform itself into a multi-asset exchange. Currently, there are 28 companies with a secondary listing on SGX, including Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare and Top Glove Corp and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings. Last year, AMTD International became the first NYSE-listed firm to list on SGX. It also became the first to take advantage of a dual-class share structure in Singapore. For Grab, as part of the SPAC merger, it’s raising $4 billion from global investors including BlackRock, Temasek Holdings, Fidelity International, Malaysia’s Permodalan Nasional Bhd and some of Indonesia’s richest family groups. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-upsizes-debut-term-loan-strong-investor-demand/","title":"Grab upsizes debut term loan to $2 billion on strong investor demand","date":"Feb 1, 2021 4:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab group CEO Anthony Tan says investors recognized the value of the company's super app platform","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab has raised $2 billion from its first term loan, in what it said was the largest institutional debt in Asia’s technology sector, as the company expands its regional services. The 5-year senior secured loan was upsized from the initial $750 million after the company secured commitments from international institutional investors, Singapore-based Grab said in a statement on Monday, February 1. Anthony Tan, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Grab, said that investors recognized the value of Grab’s super app platform, as “we continue making consistent progress in achieving our growth and sustainability milestones.” Backed by investors including Softbank Group Corporation, Grab has evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. Ranked as Southeast Asia’s most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $16 billion, Grab recently won a digital bank license in Singapore. Last month, Grab said its total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year-on-year in 2020 and recovered to comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. The loan will be used for general corporate purposes and will allow Grab to diversify its finances. Grab said the interest rate on the loan was lowered by 100 basis points from the original launch guidance to 450 basis points over LIBOR. Grab’s food business, which has benefited from a sector-wide boom in food delivery as countries imposed lockdowns, accounts for more than 50% of its revenue. Grab expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. JPMorgan was the lead bookrunner on the loan facility, while Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mizuho, MUFG, and Standard Chartered were the joint bookrunners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-considering-united-states-initial-public-offering-2021/","title":"Southeast Asia’s Grab considering US IPO this year, sources say","date":"Jan 18, 2021 8:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab's initial public offering plans have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, sources tell Reuters","body":"Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs), 3 sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Grab’s IPO could raise at least $2 billion, one of the sources said, which would likely make it the largest overseas share offering by a Southeast Asian company. “The market is good and the business is doing better than before. This should work well for public markets,” he said. The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO. Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region’s most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion. The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab’s total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. Moody’s said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency “expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses, and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next 2 to 3 years.” One of the sources said he expects Grab’s IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board. Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed. Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for an $18-billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month. As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders. Grab caught global attention when Uber sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly 5-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab. It now operates in 397 cities across 8 Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab’s food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company’s biggest segment last year. “It’s quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,” said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming, and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-extends-ride-hailing-operating-hours/","title":"Grab extends ride-hailing operating hours","date":"Sep 2, 2020 1:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing giant extends the operating hours for GrabCar and GrabTaxi","body":"Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said the operating hours were being shortened.

In a video posted on Facebook on Thursday, July 16, Cu announced that he will leave the firm to pursue other entrepreneurial interests and to make more time for his family. Cu will step down on August 14. “I decided to pursue other business interests and focus on my family, sa aking mga anak na lumalaki na (my children who are growing up). It’s with a heavy heart that I have to tell you all that I decided to leave Grab,” Cu said. Grab managing director for operations Russel Cohen said transport head Ronald Roda will continue to lead Philippine operations, while lawyer Nicka Hosaka remains as spokesperson. “We send our heartfelt thanks to Brian for managing the Grab Philippines business for the past few years, where he’s grown the business from a fledgling startup to where it is today,” Cohen said. It is still unknown whether Grab will appoint a new country president. Cu gave assurances to Grab drivers and merchants that the current leadership will continue to assist them. “Susuportahan po namin kayo sa inyong mga kabuhayan at tuloy-tuloy ang aming pag-coordinate sa inyo para mag-grow kayo with the Grab platform,” he said. (We will continue to support your livelihood and coordinate with you to help with your growth within the Grab platform.) Grab entered the Philippine market in 2013 as GrabTaxi – the first foreign destination for the Singapore-based start-up. Under Cu’s watch, Grab Philippines expanded to 9 key cities around the country after its Metro Manila launch. The firm also became the dominant ride-hailing company in the country, after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.

In spite of all this, we recognize that we still have to become leaner as an organization in order to tackle the challenges of the post-pandemic economy,” he added. Tan explained the measure was done in line with other initiatives – such as shutting down some non-core projects and right-sizing teams – to reduce the number of jobs cut. To save more jobs, Grab also refocused its efforts on redeploying Grabbers “to meet the increased customer demand for deliveries.” (READ: Grab expands grocery delivery service GrabMart) “We were able to save many jobs through this redeployment of resources and it helped limit the scope of the reduction exercise to just under 5%,” he said.

Under Memorandum Circular 2020-18 signed on Thursday, May 14, the LTFRB said that  its regional offices will determine the number of vehicles to be deployed, depending on “demand.” Taxis and TNVS are still prohibited in Metro Manila because of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), but the memorandum said that the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases will determine the number of vehicles once the capital region is under GCQ. The LTFRB also required operators to enforce a cashless payment scheme. Which taxis and TNVS can operate? The memorandum covers all taxi and TNVS operators that have a valid certificate of public convenience or provisional authority from the LTFRB, as well as those whose permits expired starting March 17. As LTFRB will determine the number of allowed units, transport network companies will have to submit a list of qualified TNVS operators. The regulatory board, meanwhile, will provide the TNC the final list of qualified taxi operators, after the firm submits the initial list of taxi drivers within their system. This means that all taxi operators must be under a TNC, such as dominant ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines and taxi-hailing app MiCab. To date, there are 9 accredited ride-hailing companies, including Owto, Hirna, ePickMeUp, GoLag, Hype, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. TNVS operators must submit to their home TNCs photocopies of their certificate of registration, Land Transportation Office (LTO) official receipt, and passenger insurance policy. TNCs must provide the LTFRB the taxi and TNVS operator’s name, case number, plate number, chassis number, and type of electronic payment in case of street-hailed passengers. \n\n Health measures: Under the Department of Transportation guidelines, TNVS and taxis should only be allowed 3 passengers, apart from the driver. The LTFRB also set safety protocols to minimize the risk of infection: Starting May 16, Metro Manila, Laguna, and Cebu City will be under modified ECQ.

If House Bill 78 eventually becomes law, it will mean that only a handful of sectors (namely, electricity transmission and distribution, as well as water pipeline and sewerage distribution systems) will be deemed “public utilities” subject to the Constitution’s 60-40 ownership rule. All the rest will be open to foreign investments, and can only be considered public utilities upon the recommendation of two economic agencies, and if Congress passes separate laws to that effect. Lots of people, including economists, support House Bill 78. By defining exactly what “public utility” means, they hope amendments to the 84-year-old Public Service Act will promote economic competition and bring down costs. Opponents fear, however, that opening the floodgates to foreign investments could jeopardize our national security. There are good arguments on both sides. But here I want to point out that one country in particular – China – has already taken hold of key segments of our utilities, specifically telco, electricity, and water. This, despite the supposedly stringent foreign ownership restrictions in our Constitution. In short, China is encroaching not just on our territories and resources in the West Philippine Sea, but also on our vital infrastructure. This should give some pause for thought among lawmakers moving to liberalize our public services and utilities any further. Let’s start with Dito Telecommunity, which was selected by government in 2018 as the third telco player to break the incumbent duopoly of PLDT-Smart and Globe. Competition in telco is very much welcome. We can all attest that signal and data speeds can often be spotty, and customer service downright crappy. But I noted before that the bidding for the third telco wasn’t really a bidding at all. Competitors dropped out mysteriously in the run-up to bidding day. In the end, the only firm that came forward was Mislatel, later rebranded as Dito Telecommunity. (READ: Disturbing red flags in the 3rd telco selection) The key fact about Dito Telecommunity is that it’s a consortium between Udenna Corporation (owned by Davao-based tycoon Dennis Uy) and Chinatel, the largest fixed-line provider and the third-largest mobile telco provider in China. Crucially, Chinatel is a company owned by the Chinese government. Through this firm, China owns 40% of Dito Telecommunity. Chinatel’s involvement in Dito Telecommunity is unsettling for a number of reasons. First, Chinese law mandates that state-owned companies like Chinatel submit intelligence to the Chinese government. One study found that Chinatel had misdirected large amounts of internet traffic from the US to China, allegedly for surveillance purposes. Second, Dito Telecommunity signed a deal last year with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) allowing the firm to “build facilities in military camps and installations,” ostensibly to help beef up the AFP’s ICT infra. Military experts themselves admitted in an internal report this deal could lead to interception, eavesdropping, and jamming – but ended up saying the overall risk was “low.” Independent cybersecurity experts say the deal is far more dangerous than the military cares to admit. Dito Telecommunity also wants to erect similar structures in police camps, but this plan hasn’t come into fruition yet. Less known but equally disturbing is the fact that another state-owned Chinese firm managed to gain substantial power in our electricity market, particularly in its transmission segment. Transmission towers – those rows of steel towers crisscrossing expressways and delivering power from the mountains to towns and cities – are massively expensive. It makes economic sense for just one firm to provide them, and that so-called “natural monopoly” is called the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Disturbingly, NGCP is a consortium involving the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) – yet another firm owned by the Chinese government. Akin to Dito Telecommunity, 40% of NGCP is owned by China (via SGCC). How did that happen? NGCP secured a 50-year franchise from Congress back in 2008, during the term of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo – a known China ally. Last year CNN obtained an internal report warning our lawmakers that Chinese engineers maintain tremendous control over “key elements” of NGCP’s transmission grid system. Ominously, the report said “power could in theory be deactivated remotely on Beijing’s orders.” China’s outsized role in the transmission sector has long been a source of worry, even for the previous administration. The recent leaked report tells us the security risks aren’t going away. In fact, they may be compounding. It should be “cause for concern,” said retired justice Antonio Carpio. Finally, under the Duterte administration, China also tapped into a third vital sector: water. But here China entered using a loan agreement, unlike in telco and electricity. Despite the current lovefest between Manila and Beijing, only two loan agreements have been signed so far between the two: one for the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, another for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Kaliwa Dam is notable because government is touting it as a much-needed solution to the growing water problems of Metro Manila. I wrote before that the bidding for Kaliwa Dam bore many red flags. Metro Manila’s water regulator bid out the project exclusively to Chinese contractors, and ended up selecting China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC) – again, a firm owned by the Chinese government. (READ: Kaliwa Dam: Is China’s involvement cause for concern?) The notoriously austere Commission on Audit (COA) itself reported that the bidding for Kaliwa Dam was likely rigged. According to them, “the two bidders/contractors were included merely to comply with the at least 3 bidders requirement as stated under the procurement law.” Far from being competitive, the bidding was “a negotiated contract from the inception of the bidding process.” CEEC also failed to submit required documents on time, and COA said this might invalidate the loan agreement for Kaliwa Dam, which amounts to P11.05 billion from China Eximbank. Although famous for its majestic Three Gorges Dam, China also has a spotted track record in building dams especially in poor countries. China is also known to leverage on such projects politically in what’s known as “hydro-diplomacy.” Don’t get me wrong. Opening up some sectors of our economy to foreign investments is not necessarily bad. It may even work wonders. For instance, Indonesia’s Go-Jek sought to break the current monopoly status of Grab in the ride-hailing business. But our government denied entry to Go-Jek because it’s a foreign-owned company. Initial opposition to Angkas, a well-loved motorcycle-hailing service, was also grounded on foreign ownership issues. Yet China’s creeping influence and encroachment in our vital infrastructure shows we ought to be extra careful about greater openness – especially where the nation’s security is at stake.

I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.'","body":"  I never really felt that being Chinese-Filipino was any different from being a pure-blooded Filipino. I call the Philippines my motherland; I respect, more than any other, the Philippine flag; I memorize both the Panatang Makabayan and national anthem by heart; I speak Filipino as well as any other fellow Juan; I love eating sinigang and lechon; and I have always embraced our polluted, traffic-choked, sweltering Metro Manila streets as home. But recently, I found this notion crumbling whenever I would see fellow Filipinos, whom I have always considered family, treating each and every Chinese national (including those originally from the Philippines) with disgust and prejudice because of the sudden mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV). Indeed, the virus originated from the city of Wuhan in China, but China being ground zero for the virus has resulted in numerous adverse effects for all of its citizens, the most rampant of which is (extreme) xenophobia. In the past few weeks, unfortunate stories of Chinese individuals all over the world, including the Philippines, have constantly been making rounds on different social media platforms. I see and hear of Chinese nationals being shunned and treated with utter disgust for being who they are. All individuals who “look” Chinese are ostracized and stayed away from. Many are also refused basic services such as cab rides and the use of certain facilities such as public comfort rooms and elevators. Once an individual is classified as Chinese, no matter what their citizenship, he or she is automatically denied these rights. (READ: [OPINION] Like us, the Chinese are victims of the virus and a despotic government) Selected schools and offices have also issued a notice for mandatory self-quarantine that singles out only Chinese individuals. Recently, Adamson University was mired in controversy because of this issue. Many more stories like these abound, both locally and internationally. I have never seen the Chinese be more sorry just for being Chinese. I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.  As a Chinese living in the city of Manila, which serves as a home to many Chinese locals in the country and houses renowned hospitals (e.g. San Lazaro Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital – which both reported and confirmed cases of the coronavirus), discrimination, however disheartening, was to be expected.  Recently, I noticed how some Filipinos have become more wary of me. For example, when staff at food establishments ask for my name and I tell them my family name, they always seem to give a certain look or make an awkward pause. Similarly, the other day, when I went to the grocery store with my mother and she spoke in Chinese, I noticed how the people around us looked our way, when in the past it didn’t matter. So I just put my head down and hurriedly spoke in Filipino to show them that I was from the Philippines – that I’m Filipino, like all of them, and free from the virus.   Through this whole ordeal I have constantly felt that Filipinos have this ridiculous and untrue notion that Chinese families such as mine all feast on exotic mammals at home, like how they perceive those in mainland China, and that we could thus carry the virus and infect them. Instead of doing proper research on the topic to curtail its spread and help the masses be aware and alert of the virus, some Filipinos choose to blow things out of proportion and throw their own baseless opinions here and there.  I see posts on Facebook claiming that being infected by the virus equates to automatic death, when in fact Chinese public officials have stated time and again that although the virus has a high contamination rate, its mortality rate, on the other hand, is very low. In fact, most of those affected make a full recovery and the others who died didn’t not because of the virus per se, but because of old age or other ailments that compromised their immune system. Public health experts also noted that panic over the virus outside of China is “unproductive and unwarranted,” asserting that there are reasons for hope during the coronavirus outbreak. (READ: WHO launches campaign against China virus misinformation) First, the virus was identified and determined more quickly than ever before. Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with laboratories around the world only a week after it was discovered. Second, advancements in medical technology since the discovery of coronaviruses in the 1960s have allowed clinical laboratories and virologists to conduct thorough research into the way these viruses work.  Fear will not stop the spread of the virus and will only lead to negative social impacts. Instead, the public should take precautions to avoid getting sick, with the most effective preventative measure being everyday actions such as increased handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who is sick.   In the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, along with keeping up with news regarding any development with the epidemic, I find myself re-evaluating what it means to be a Chinese-Filipino in the Philippines. Having lived in the Philippines the entire 17 years of my existence, I have never considered being able to function normally, in its most basic sense, as a privilege. Walking the streets peacefully, hailing a Grab ride, ordering food in my name, speaking in Chinese to my family in public places – all of these were mundane tasks that were simply part of my daily life, and which I considered basic rights.  But the masses’ reaction to the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak made me realize that there lingers a divide between Chinese-Filipinos and pure-blooded Filipinos despite having shared one home country for hundreds of years. It dawned on me that my view of Filipinos as a family might have only been one-sided, and that the notion is not shared by everyone.  Experts claim that a cure for the coronavirus is in rapid development. It is my hope that we may also soon see an improvement in cultural acceptance wherein all individuals, no matter what race or nationality, are treated with empathy and respect (and not ostracization) even and especially during times of crisis. – Rappler.com Col Tiu is a Chinese-Filipino grade 12 senior high school student and a proud Manilenya."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/249709-road-legitimizing-motorcycle-taxis/","title":"The long road to legalizing motorcycle taxis in the Philippines","date":"Jan 20, 2020 1:01 PM PHT","snippet":"At least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seek to amend the 55-year-old Land Transportation and Traffic Code","body":"AT A GLANCE {source}<hr />{/source} MANILA, Philippines – Every day after work, Jenlain Impat, 26, finds herself rushing to go home to take care of her one-year-old baby. The fare is cheap. It would only take a total of P25 for her to travel from her office in Urdaneta Village in Makati City to her home in San Juan City – but that’s the case only if she’s willing to spend more than an hour stuck in EDSA and another 30-minute jeepney ride to their house. She’s not. “Alam mo [ang] traffic sa Makati, hindi uubra ang normal commute. Sayang oras mo,” Impat told Rappler. (You how the traffic is in Makati. Your normal commute won’t do. Your time is wasted.) As a new mom, Impat started using the pioneer motorcycle taxi app Angkas to book trips, even if that meant a higher fare. By booking a motorcycle taxi, her commute time is now down to 30 minutes. “Before kasi umuuwi ako ng San Juan or Antipolo, super traffic ‘pag rush hour. And being a mom, gusto ko mabilis makauwi sa baby ko for quality time, kahit ‘yung pamasahe is P25, if naka-Angkas ako, P150 to P170 depende sa surge,” Impat said. (Before, whenever I go home to San Juan or Antipolo, traffic is heavy during rush hour. And being a mom, I want to get home immediately to spend quality time with my baby, even if that increases fare from just P25 to, if I would choose Angkas, around P150 to P170, depending on the surge rate.) Ana Lubiano, 25, is another regular user of motorcycle taxis. She found it as a cheaper option than other ride-hailing services such as Grab. “Kaya talaga ako gumagamit ng Angkas is to beat traffic, lalo na ‘pag nakikita ko na malala na ‘yung traffic. Mase-save ka talaga ‘nya para hindi ka ma-late, kasi nga motor. So p’wedeng sumingit-singit, hindi katulad if naka-4 wheels, ka stuck ka na – stress ka pa talaga – sa traffic,” Lubiano said. (The reason why I’m using apps like Angkas is to beat traffic, especially when I see that traffic congestion is bad. It will really save you so that you won’t be late because you’re using a motorcycle. Motorcycles can cut in between vehicles, unlike 4-wheeled cars that can get you stuck – and stressed – in traffic.) Whenever she finds it hard to book a ride on Angkas, which is usually the case now since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) imposed a 10,000-rider cap per firm, Lubiano would “book” habal-habal on Facebook. “‘Pag mahirap mag-book and walang available na Angkas within the area, no choice na kundi ‘yung sa FB group or mga Habal sa daan,” Lubiano said. (When it’s hard to book and there’s no available Angkas within the area, I don’t have a choice but book on Facebook or hail one on the streets.) Mobility as service The prospects of a “dignified commute” in Metro Manila seem bleak in the short term, as the population growth rate continues to accelerate to a point that is beyond the current public transportation’s capacity. According to a report by Bloomberg, driving a kilometer in Metro Manila has worsened in 2019. In September 2019, data from navigation app Waze showed that it took an average of 5 minutes per kilometer to travel around Metro Manila, longer than the April record of 3.8 minutes per kilometer. The population outlook for Metro Manila is not seen to decrease in the coming years either, as a United Nation report in 2018 showed that the metropolis is projected to have an annual increase of 1.9% in the next decade. Because of heavier traffic in cities, “mobility as a service” has been on the rise to provide an alternative mode of transportation that is faster than current options, according to a 2017 report by United Kingdom-based financial consultancy firm Deloitte. “Mobility as a service” is a model taken on by ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber, and the new motorcycle taxi firms JoyRide and MoveIt, along with Angkas. While more Filipino commuters shift to motorcycle taxis as their preferred mode of transportation because of its ability to “beat traffic,” the motorcycle-hailing industry may hit a dead-end, pending the passage of a law that would allow its permanent operations. The long and winding road to legalization As early as 2017, the government led the crackdown on motorcycle-hailing services of Angkas because it is illegal. (READ: Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition)   But even then, underground habal-habal operations were already widespread, it’s just that Angkas was able to train the bikers to drive more safely. Romeo Maglunsod, who used to be a habal-habal driver before joining Angkas, said this in one of the public consultation hearings at the LTFRB in 2017. The point is to regulate instead of turning a blind eye, Maglunsod said. Under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was enacted 55 years ago, motorcycles can only be registered as private or government vehicles. Therefore, it can’t be used by its owners to carry passengers and be paid for it. In the 17th Congress, bills amending the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was tackled by the House of Representatives and the Senate. House lawmakers passed their version of the bill in February 2019, but it remained pending under the Senate committee on public services, which Senator Grace Poe headed. In one of the Senate hearings in 2019, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to just issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate, just like what it did with Grab and Uber (when the latter was still here). Arguing that legislation is the way to go, the DOTr started the 6-month pilot run, which was extended by 3 months to March 23, 2020. The point of this pilot implementation is to “collect” data that may be used by lawmakers when crafting the bill. However, on Monday, January 20, the inter-agency technical working group overseeing the test run terminated it – more than two months earlier than end of the extension period. The announcement was made just as Senate committee on public services was about to start its hearing on the matter. Proposals In the 18th Congress, there are at least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seeking to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. All of these carry more or less the same language: {source} <blockquote style=”border-left: 5px solid #FFD700;“> Section 7. Registration Classification. Every motor vehicle shall be registered under one of the following prescribed classifications: (a) XXX (b) XXX (c) XXX … (j) XXX and (k) motorcycles-for-hire. </blockquote> {/source} At the Senate, Poe, Recto, and senators Juan Edgardo Angara and Imee Marcos have filed separate proposals to legalize motorcycle taxis. Poe and Recto propose that motorcycles-for-hire must be less than 1,000 kilograms in weight, can travel more than 50 kilometers per hour, and has an engine capacity of 125 cubic centimeters. In the proposals of Poe, Angara, and Marcos, government regulators would be mandated to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycle taxis before registration. No modification shall be made apart from the luggage carrier at the back, a saddlebag, a foot peg, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring devices. In Poe’s bill, there is a section on fare setting, specifically saying that LTFRB should “determine, prescribe, approve, and periodically review and adjust” reasonable fares for the operation of motorcycle taxi services. Meanwhile, Marcos, in her proposal, “urges” local government units (LGUs) to issue guidelines for the operations of motorcycle taxis in their jurisdictions. She also proposed that the Land Transportation Office require insurance for passengers and cargo. Similar measures have been filed by Muntilupa Representative Ruffy Biazon, Batangas 6th District Representative Vilma Santos-Recto, Quezon City 2nd District Representative Pecious Castelo, and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas. Meanwhile, majority of the bills in the House of Representatives include the proposal for motorcycles-for-hire to only be allowed “for a limited period, with limited number of units and in specific routes only,” which should be determined by the DOTr and the LTFRB, in coordination with LGUs. At least 11 congressmen argue that the transportation department should give priority to higher-capacity vehicles or mass transit sytems. This specific measures have been separately filed by Makati City Representative Romulo Peña Jr, Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Barba, Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, South Cotabato 2nd District Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, Bohol 1st District Representative Edgar Chatto, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Luis Villafuerte, Cebu City 1st District Representative Raul del Mar, the late LPGMA Representative Rodolfo Albano III, and Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio Albano, and Quezon City 6th District Representative Tyrone Agabas. Instead of adding another classification specific to motorcycles-for-hire, Makati City 2nd District Representative Luis Campos’ bill proposes to amend Section 7 (c) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to allow the registration of motorcycles “either as private or public utility vehicle.” ‘It’s needed’ As traffic congestion worsens, Impat and Lubiano said it’s even more important for lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow commuters like them to have options to beat traffic, save their time, and use it somewhere else. “[Motorcycle taxis like] Angkas helps commuters to beat the traffic, especially in Metro Manila. I can say, they can be considered as part of the solution,” Lubiano told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. “Regulations lang din [kailangan] kasi sa super traffic ngayon. Heaven-sent ‘yung may option ka na mas mapabilis ‘yung travel time mo, given na ‘pag rush hour talagang almost two hours ang b’yahe na ‘pag sa Angkas 30 minutes mo lang makukuha,” Impat said. (Authorities only need to regulate them. Because of the heavy traffic nowadays, it’s heaven-sent to have an option that would make your travel faster, especially during rush hour when you would have to spent almost two hours, but which an Angkas ride can shorten to 30 minutes.) Public Works Secretary Mark Villar says some road projects will be done by 2020, removing private car volume along main roads. But in terms of public commute, majority of big-ticket railway projects are set to be in partial operations only by the end of the Duterte administration or in 2022. However, if commuters are to escape horrors of current state of public transportation between now and 2022, lawmakers will need to make motorcyle taxis stay on the streets – legally. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/248737-thewrap-january-7-2020-evening-edition/","title":"Duterte offers Maynilad, Manila Water new deals | Evening wRap","date":"Jan 7, 2020 9:32 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler’s evening newscast with Acor Arceo","body":" Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte gives water companies Maynilad and Manila Water the option to accept new deals crafted on his term, after lashing out at the companies over supposed ‘onerous’ provisions in their government contracts.

The High Court, meanwhile, has designated special courts that will focus on trying cases involving Republic Act No. 10667 or the Philippine Competition Act. RA 10667 ensures markets remain competitive, so that consumers can enjoy lower prices. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is a quasi-judicial body tasked to implement the law.

The refund will be disbursed through the passengers’ GrabPay wallet accounts, after accomplishing a basic “Know-Your-Customer” (KYC) process in the GrabRewards catalogue. Those who have yet to go through the basic KYC process will have to submit personal information such as his or her full name, email, date and place of birth, ID number, and home addresses, as part of the requirements by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Grab said that the disbursement is computed from the proportion of the total fare of the passengers within the time period, then multiplied by the total fine to be disbursed. The PCC slapped Grab close to P40-million in fines for its failure to comply with its price commitments. Twice this year, Grab was also ordered by the anti-trust body to refund passengers for violating its price undertaking.

The Oro Transport Services Cooperative (Orotsco) acquired 15 modern coasters as their first fleet for the government’s Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP). Valeriano Constantino, Jr, chairman of Orotsco, said that it used to be sad to accept that the old traditional jeepney would vanish from the streets. “Not only because of the sentimental value but also the losses of the every day income remitted by our drivers,” Constantino said. Orotsco first became a public transport coop in 1987 and through the years grew to serve public tranport drivers. “That is the reality because we have to tranform, accept the challenges of change, we have to innovate and tranport the tranport system of the jeepney sector,” Constantino said. Only 10 of the 15 of the coasters will have airconditioners. Orotsco general manager Samuel Abello said that that decision is to provide options for those who do not like riding in airconditioned vehicles. “The non-airconditioned ones are for the riding public who come from public markets, carrying them food items which may put off fellow passengers because of the smell,” Abello said.  Modern transport The new vehicles are equipped with close circuit tv (CCTV), automatic fare collection system (AFCS), a GPS, and wifi onboard. The interior has spacious room, there is a 6 feet headroom, and it can carry 23 seated passengers and 5 standing. There are also hand grabs available. During its test ride from Plaza Divisoria to Barangay Bugo, the city’s easternmost barangay, commuters found the new vehicles as refreshing and very good. Zhe Bañes, a student at the University of Science and Technology in Southern Philippines (USTP) along with her 4 classmates, was among the first to take the free ride. “This is very good, the space is good, airconditioned too. Very refreshing,” Bañes said. Joel Cael also praised the new transport system. “It should be like this. We deserve this, not the old jeepneys,” Cael said. Another commuter asked why it took so long for the government to implement the plan. “This should have been implemented a long time ago,” the commuter said. Two routes The current development route provided by the LTFRB is from Barangay Bugo to Igpit, Opol, Misamis Oriental in the western part. It has 2 routes: But according to LTFRB Region 10 director Aminoden Guro, based on this city’s Local Public Tranport Route Plan, there are at least 32 routes in the city that would consolidate all old routes. “We have consolidated all routes into the LPTRP and this address the city’s need of modern tranport,” Guro said. In Mindanao, there are 3 cities which already have a modern transport system in place – General Santos, Butuan and Cagayan de Oro. But the biggest fleet is in this city. Abello said that the coop’s initial investment was just P35,000 for each unit while the government subsidy is P80,000 per unit as equity. The Development Bank of the Philippines provided the loan of P35 million to Orotsco for the 15 vehicles payable in 7 years. Abello said that the each unit cost P2.33 million pesos. More units needed Abello said that Orotsco would acquire more units as the demand increases. “We need to adopt because we are serving the commuting public,” Abello said. As a drivers-operators owned cooperative, Orotsco is employing members as drivers of the units which they project would operate 16 hours a day with just a respite at dawn. Guro said that once the operators and drivers overcome their resistance, the LTFRB is expecting a surge of cooperatives availing of LPTRP routes and the modern vehicles. “With the new vehicles running by December 15, 2019, the riding public will experience a safe, convenient, accessible transport system which would benefit the people,” Guro said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/245181-philippine-competition-commission-orders-grab-refund-riders/","title":"Antitrust body orders Grab to refund P5M to riders","date":"Nov 18, 2019 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The new disgorgement mechanism will require Grab to refund any excess fares to riders through their GrabPay accounts","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) ordered Grab Philippines to refund an amount of P5.05 million to its riders for breaches in its pricing commitments. In a press conference on Monday, November 18, the PCC said that, during the period of February to May 2019, Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from before its merger with Uber. This means that the increase of Grab fares from before its acquisition of Uber to its current operations exceeded by more than 22%, under its old set of voluntary pricing commitments to the PCC. This violation incurred a P5.05-million penalty. The PCC amended its conditions so that Grab will refund the penalty to its riders instead of paying it to the antitrust authority. In the new round of monitoring, a 22.5% allowable fare deviation has been imposed on Grab. Riders can check if Grab is breaching its pricing commitments by comparing what they were paying before March 2018 to the fares they are paying now, checking if the increase is more than 22.5%. Should Grab breach this deviation, the company will have to pay P2 million to the PCC as well as refund any penalties to riders within 30 days. According to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, riders will directly be given a rebate through their individual GrabPay accounts.  For the current P5.05-million penalty, Grab can file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days, and the PCC will be allowed 30 days to submit a final resolution. After this period, Grab is required to refund the amount to its riders within 60 days. This measure is in line with a newly-approved disgorgement mechanism that will take effect on the second year of PCC’s monitoring of Grab operations, to prevent the company from having a “virtual monopoly” on the ride-hailing market. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion reiterated that only the recipient of the penalty payment has changed, not the formula for computing the penalties. In a statement, Grab said it “looked forward” to paying the passengers who took Grab rides during February to May 2019. Further, the company maintained it complies with the fare matrix imposed by the Land Transportation Regulatory and Franchising Board (LTFRB). Grab will announce the payment mechanics to the riders at least 5 days prior to paying. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/244697-singapore-targets-e-scooters-after-accidents/","title":"Trundling into trouble: Singapore targets e-scooters after accidents","date":"Nov 12, 2019 9:48 AM PHT","snippet":"E-scooters are already banned from Singapore's roads but they are now prohibited on all pavements and other footpaths, and can only be used on cycle paths and a network of routes connecting parks","body":" SINGAPORE, Singapore – Tiny Singapore had embraced electric scooters in a big way, but deaths and fires linked to the two-wheelers have prompted authorities to introduce tough rules that could put a brake on their runaway success. The contraptions have popped up in cities worldwide but pedestrians in many places have come to see the silent machines as menaces, and authorities have been scrambling to regulate them. Tens of thousands flooded Singapore, becoming particularly popular among commuters and workers delivering food, but apartment fires blamed on charging devices and the death of an elderly cyclist after a September collision stoked public anger. Last week, officials announced a ban on the trendy two-wheelers on all footpaths. To start with, most riders caught breaking the rule will be given a warning but from January, offenders face being jailed for up to 3 months and fined. The move surprised observers after a panel advising the government had recommended weaker measures, such as a mandatory theory test – and angered some who have come to rely on the scooters. “It is definitely over-regulation,” Venkata Goruganthu, who rode his e-scooter to his office in the business district every day, told AFP. “There are car accidents and people are dying, are we going to ban cars on the streets now?” The 41-year-old technician will now have to commute by public transport, which will take him 45 minutes – twice as long as a scooter ride. ‘Reckless’ riders  But many others approved of the effort to rein in the scooters, which now number about 100,000 in the space-starved country of 5.7 million. “People are not responsible, they are reckless,” Vasukie Mayandi, a 51-year-old bank worker, told AFP. “They feel they want to move somewhere fast, but they’re not considering others who are using the same pathway.” E-scooters were already banned from Singapore’s roads but they are now prohibited on all pavements and other footpaths, and can only be used on cycle paths and a network of routes connecting parks. It drastically reduces the area where people can ride the contraptions – Singapore has about 440 kilometers (275 miles) of cycle paths compared with 5,500 kilometers of footpaths. Officials, however, say cycle paths will be extended to cover 750 kilometres by 2025. Following the announcement, regional ride-sharing giant Grab said it was suspending its scooter-sharing set-up in Singapore while the government said it would reject applications by other firms hoping to start such services. International clampdown  Singapore is just the latest country trying to get control of the scooters. Last week, the French government issued new rules, including a ban on using them on pavements – unless a city permits them in certain areas – and a 25 kilometer per hour speed limit. Germany does not allow them on pavements while London has taken the most extreme approach of major European cities, prohibiting the two-wheelers entirely unless a rider has a driving licence, insurance, road tax, a helmet and a number plate. The hardest hit in Singapore by the new rules is the army of people using e-scooters to deliver food across the city for companies such as Deliveroo, Grab and Foodpanda, although authorities have taken steps to help. On Friday, November 8, the transport ministry said the government and companies were offering grants for e-scooter delivery riders to switch to other devices including regular and power-assisted bicycles. Benjamin Goh has already changed to a bike for his food delivery job – but said his income would be affected as cycling is more exhausting, meaning he can complete fewer orders. “It’s very tiring for me to use a bicycle,” said the 26-year-old single father, adding that he would also end up fatigued and potentially less capable of caring for his young son after work. Goh said he felt food delivery workers were being punished for the bad behavior of some recreational riders, but conceded: “I can understand why people hate us.” – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/242234-panelo-this-marikina-resident-wakes-up-3-am-get-to-school/","title":"Mr Panelo, this Marikina resident wakes up at 3 am to get to school","date":"Oct 10, 2019 7:31 PM PHT","snippet":"We ask Marikina residents to react to Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo's no-transportation-crisis remark: ‘Ano’ng aga pa ba ang gagawin ko para hindi na ako ma-late? ’Yung ’di na ako matutulog?’","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Kyla Clarette Villanueva, a 19-year-old college student, has a one-word reaction to Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo assertion that there’s no transportation crisis in Metro Manila: “Nakakagalit (enraging).”  Villanueva, like Panelo, resides in Marikina City. Like Panelo, she goes to Manila every day – she studies at the Far Eastern University (FEU), not very far from Malacañang Palace, Panelo’s office.  The difference is, Panelo has a car – most likely, with a driver – and Villanueva commutes.  On Friday, October 11, President Rodrigo Duterte’s spokesman will take on the challenge of militant youth group Anakbayan for him to commute before dismissing the plight of commuters. He said he’d do it away from the limelight, and without publicizing the details.

If you want to…arrive early to (sic) your destination, then you go there earlier.” ‘How early does he suggest I wake up?’ “It was a very insensitive comment. We all have different circumstances on why we commute, and for Panelo to easily say to just wake up early makes me think that he doesn’t understand how difficult it is to commute,” Villanueva told Rappler on Thursday, October 10.  “Ano’ng aga pa ba ang gagawin ko para hindi na ako ma-late? ’Yung ’di na ako matutulog?” she asked.

Niño, Marikina, used to get up at 4 am to prepare herself for her first class at 7:30 am in FEU Morayta.  She would walk 5 minutes from her home to the main road and take a jeepney or a UV Express van to the Katipunan Station of the Light Rail Transit Line 2 (LRT2). She explained that most PUVs were already full by the time she got to the main road, so she would often walk another 15 to get to a PUV Terminal. From Katipunan, she would take the train to Recto Station, and walk to her school. The commute took at least an hour. But, she said, “Ever since the LRT operations were suspended, the amount of people waiting doubled, [and so did] my time of waiting to get a ride.” That started last October 4, a day after fire hit two LRT2 rectifiers and forced the closure of 3 stations for the next 9 months.  Now, Villanueva’s commute takes around 3 hours. Now, she wakes up at 3 am and leaves her house at 4 am. In her latest commuting experience, it took an hour just to catch a jeepney. “Back then, the usual travel time from Marikina to LRT Katipunan would be around 15 to 45 minutes only. But, again, because of the traffic, it now takes about 1-2 hours,” she said.   Next option: More costly Grab, Angkas  Bryon Senga lives along Marcos Highway. A fresh graduate, he’s on a job hunt, and the required commute from home to potential workplace is a big consideration for him. This means crossing out a few job opportunities in the Sta. Mesa, Taft, and Makati areas. For now, he does research projects for organizations, and commutes for 45 minutes to an hour to attend meetings in Katipunan or San Juan. He’s fortunate not to have to go during rush hour all the time.   From Marikina, Senga would take two jeepney rides to get to Katipunan. The traffic is really heavy around the SM Marikina area because of constructions that have been going on for months. Thus, he said, in catching jeepney rides, timing is key. “May time slots na madaming jeep, may time slots na pahirapan sumakay, so minsan nag-e-LRT ako,” he said on Thursday. (There are time slots when jeeps are aplenty, but other times, it would be hard to catch a jeep, so I opt for the LRT instead.) But since the LRT2 suspended operations from Santolan to Anonas, Bryon would book rides with Angkas or Grab. This option is more expensive by the hundreds of pesos, especially now that these rides are in demand. “Before kasi sinasaktuhan ko talaga ‘yung time na walang agawan masyado, ngayon napapansin ko super puno lagi tuwing morning. Do’n kasi ‘yung usual na nag-e-LRT, nagdi-jeep, or ‘yung bus na eh. Ako nag-a-Angkas. Medyo iniwasan ko rin kasi since alam kong mas lalala ‘yung commuting experience,” Senga said. (Before I would try to catch a jeep when there wouldn’t be a lot of passengers waiting, but now I’ve noticed that jeeps are always full in the morning because those who usually take the LRT now take jeepneys or buses. I take Angkas rides. I avoid going for jeepneys because I know the commuting experience will be worse.) The same went for his trips to San Juan, which previously took more than a half hour via LRT2 from Santolan to J. Ruiz stations. Since he does not have that option anymore, he takes Angkas or Grab. But he said, even before the LRT2 incident, it already took time get a ride: “Ang bilis magbago. ‘Pag, let’s say, 7 am ka nakaalis, wala pang agawan masyado. Pero after 15 to 30 minutes, agawan na sa jeep.“ (The situation changes so fast. Let’s say you leave at 7 am, there’s not a lot of passengers around yet. But after 15 to 30 minutes, they’re elbowing each other out to get onto a jeep.)

Grab is the biggest ride-hailing firm in Southeast Asia, and has strengthened its hold on the market since buying US rival Uber’s operations in the region last year.  But the Singapore-headquartered firm has come under scrutiny from regulators in several countries due to concerns about its dominant position.  The Malaysia Competition Commission proposed fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company’s competitors. This had the effect of “distorting competition” by creating barriers to Grab’s rivals, it said. “It is important that barriers to entry for new players remain low, and for existing players to have the ability to grow and compete on merits to ensure that competition can remain healthy,” said Iskandar Ismail, the watchdog’s chief executive. In addition, a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit will be imposed should Grab fail to take action to address the competition concerns. Grab has 30 days to respond to the watchdog, after which a final decision will be made. The company said they had complied fully with competition laws and were “surprised” by the proposed fine. “We believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms,” a Grab statement said. Last year, Singapore fined Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/238743-grab-investment-vietnam-august-2019/","title":"Grab to invest $500 million in Vietnam","date":"Aug 28, 2019 2:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing firm Grab is making a fresh investment in Vietnam for new services and expansion of existing offerings","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing giant Grab said on Wednesday, August 28, it will invest $500 million over 5 years in Vietnam, the company’s latest expansion in a key Southeast Asian market.  The Singapore-based firm has grown rapidly since it ended a bruising battle with Uber last year by buying its US rival’s ride-hailing and food operations in the region. Grab, which operates in 8 Southeast Asian countries, has already invested more than $200 million in Vietnam since entering the market in 2014.  The fresh investment will be used for new services in areas such as financial technology and logistics, as well as expanding existing transport, food, and payment offerings. With a population of around 100 million, Vietnam is among the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia. Last month Grab said it would invest $2 billion in Indonesia over the next 5 years, as it seeks to take on local ride-hailing giant GoJek, with some of the money coming from Japan’s SoftBank Group. Grab has received investments of more than $4.5 billion over the past year, with Toyota, Hyundai, and Microsoft among the other firms providing support.

Here's a 4-day itinerary and travel guide to help you out!","body":" Hanoi, Vietnam is an uncommon travel destination for many Filipinos, with Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) being the more popular destination for most. Most of us might assume that Saigon is the capital, when in fact, it’s actually Hanoi.  This city’s got this Old-World, laid-back charm and was branded as the little Paris of the East (Ho Chi Minh City is the modern pulse of the country). It is also known as the gateway to Ha Long Bay, but what you’ll really like in Hanoi is the city itself. It’s full of romantic, poetic places – if there’s such a thing. The locals always seem to put poise into things – nooks and crannies of a humble café located at a crumbling French colonial building are typically decorated with fresh roses in vases, and undisturbed locals drinking lotus tea in the afternoon pepper the sidewalks amid the traffic rush. There’s almost a feeling of contentment and solace in most of these places despite the chaos in the city. These simple things are what make Hanoi charming.  Forget the usual touristy haunts – the Temple of Literature, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, or even Ha Long Bay. Enter the quiet and relaxing side of Hanoi and explore relaxing cafes, peaceful spots, and hidden gems which will lead you back to its old-fashioned allure.  Here is a sample itinerary together with some guides and tips for when you visit Hanoi. This was also inspired by a question randomly asked by a friend who’s planning on going on a solo trip, but couldn’t decide whether to see Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) or Hanoi. Hopefully, this guide will help you decide in choosing if Hanoi is the best fit for your travel preference. The goal of this trip is mostly to explore Hanoi’s quiet spots and quaint cafes, and photowalk at the Old Quarter. Upon arrival at Noi Bai international Airport Terminal 2 at 12 midnight (I flew in via Cebu Pacific), the first few things you should do:  Tips when sleeping at Noi Bai airport Terminal 2:  How to go to Old Quarter from the airport via public bus. Just outside the Arrivals entrance doors is public bus #86 (color orange), which drops you off at the city center. Bus # 86 stops nearest to Old Quarter: Other tips: If you have heavy luggage or are with a group, it’s better to get a taxi. Alighting from Long Bien station still requires a 20-30 minute walk going to Hoan Kiem Lake area, so it’s not a recommended stop and you’ll be dropped off at a bus stop located along a busy road with lots of tours. It’s better to alight at 142 Tran Quang Khai or Hanoi Opera House which seems to be nearer Old Quarter. Day 1 What to eat:    Day 2    What to eat:  Day 3    What to drink:  Day 4  Despite the confusing buzz from countless motorbikes, at almost every corner there is grace and stillness in Hanoi. The locals sure know how to make use of every inch of space in Vietnam, and they don’t get so stressed about it!  Life goes on, the traffic flows, another ca phe pours. This capital is indeed a welcome relief from our stressful daily grinds. – Rappler.com If you have other questions when traveling in Hanoi, feel free to send a message via Instagram (username: @janricasio).

Some will hold vigils, conduct a caravan…. But one thing is sure: hindi sila papasada (they will go offline),” Inton said. Inton apologized in advance to commuters and explained the reason for the transport holiday. “Ginagawa lang nila ito dahil darating ang panahon na kung mananatili ang mga pahirap policy na iyan, wala tayong masasakyang TNVS dahil malulugi ang negosyo,” he added.

During a hearing held by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said that of the supposed 8,000 drivers who were told that they will be removed from the platform by Monday, June 10, only 5,000 were deactivated. “As of yesterday, there were around 5,000 drivers who were deactivated because [they don’t have] documentation. They weren’t able to submit proof that they walked through the LTFRB process in securing a provisional authority (PA) or a certificate of public convenience (CPC),” Cu told reporters in a press briefing after the hearing. The remaining 3,000 were able to submit proof to Grab that they are in the process of applying for a PA or CPC. To lawfully operate, drivers and operators need to secure a PA – the initial authorization – and then a CPC. On top of the 5,000, the ride-hailing firm also removed some 10,000 drivers from January to May this year, bringing the total deactivated units to 15,000. Cu said during the hearing that they did this to ensure that there are no “colorum” vehicles on their platform. “This is really because of a regulation that we need to comply with. We have been wanting to comply with this regulation that TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should have [a] PA or [a] CPC to operate,” Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “But we find it difficult to enforce because we do it manually. We talked to them one by one. We reached out to them,” she added. To ensure that there will be enough drivers despite the deactivation, Cu said they will roll out a new incentive scheme. “If there will be 10 cars that drive an extra hour, then it would supplement. It covers the hours lost [due to deactivated vehicles]. Over the next few weeks, we’re trying to structure out incentives and promos to be able to do that,” he said. More cars needed In a separate statement on Tuesday, Grab urged the LTFRB “to find ways to quickly increase the number of drivers.” On Monday, the LTFRB opened 10,000 new slots for the application of a TNVS franchise. All slots were already filled up that day. “If LTRFB will allow the deactivated drivers to resume work while it processes the application of 10,000 new drivers, that would be the best win for the Filipino people,” Cu said in a statement. Grab is now left with around 40,000 drivers. Before the deactivation, it had served only 60% to 65% of the total bookings daily. Grab urged the regulatory board to maximize the 65,000-franchise cap, to be able to allocate more cars to passengers. With the deactivation of “colorum” vehicles, Cu said passengers will bear the brunt of the inconvenience. “This inconvenience will be felt even after the 10,000 new slots, as twice that number is necessary to provide the 70% allocation rate they said they (LTFRB) want to maintain,” he said. But Cu said fares will remain the same, to comply with the conditions set by the Philippine Competition Commission over the March 2018 buyout of Uber’s operations.

This alternative, however, doesn’t mean carpooling or hailing rides on Grab or Angkas. Aldrin Pelicano, 35, turned to biking in 2014, cycling from his home in the eastern side of Pasig City to Ortigas Center to “improve his quality of life.” “Nagsawa na ko (I got tired of public transportation),” Pelicano told Rappler. “I’m a father of two kids who decided to bike commute, because it made my life so much better,” he said. Those living in the East know just how bad the state of public commute it is there. “East Ortigas” – as they call that side of the city now – is the gateway to Rizal and serves as an alternative route for those going to Marikina City or Antipolo City. During rush hour, jeepneys are overloaded with some 3 or 4 passengers seated on benches in the middle of the vehicle, while about 4 males hitch at the back apart from the fare collector. Of course, the buses are already packed too. This was Pelicano’s daily commute then. Most of the time, he would be one of those males hitched at the back of the jeepney enduring his 4-kilometer ride. “Palaging sabit. Palaging siksikan. At lagi akong late. Ang trabaho ko, 8 am, pero darating ako 9 am. Pero ang lapit-lapit lang. Kung walang-wala na talaga akong masakyan, nasubukan kong maglakad. Nakakapagod,” he told Rappler. (I always hitch. I always fit my way through. And I’m always late. My work starts at 8 am but I arrive at 9 am. If you think about it, it’s really near. If I can’t find a ride, I walk. It’s very tiring.) This brought him to start a daily journey pedaling through metropolitan Manila’s traffic, which eventually inspired him to share to his learnings online.  Making the shift The sorry state of public transportation, the undignifying commute, and the desire to spend more time with his son and daughter pushed Pelicano to shift to bike commuting. “I only rode a bike once in my life, perhaps during high school, but not for commuting. I didn’t have a bike. I didn’t really bike. Naglakas loob lang ako (I just took the courage to do so),” he said. After finally deciding to make the shift, Pelicano, who worked as a program manager in an Australian firm then, said he looked up for groups in Facebook to read about biking. He started reading about folding bikes, which for him, would “make sense” as he wanted to be able to bring it inside the building where he works. In August 2014, he joined the Facebook group of Tiklop Society of the Philippines (TSP), a non-profit organization that aims to “promote the use of folding bikes as a means to better oneself and achieve cleaner air and more liveable cities,” according to its description. “I went one Sunday morning during their monthly general assembly. The people were nice and so I was encouraged to finally do it. I bought a bike,” Pelicano said. Before braving the metro’s vehicular traffic, Pelicano posted on Facebook who can accompany him on his first bike commute to Ortigas. “Sabi ko lang, ‘Pwede ba magpasama? Kung taga-Pasig kayo, magpapasama akong mag-commute. So one guy, si Christian, taga-Pasig din siya. And he works in Tektite. So ‘yung route na dinaraanan niya, sa Julia Vargas Avenue. Sinamahan niya ako once lang,” he shared. (I just asked, ‘Can somebody come with me? If you’re from Pasig, I would like to ask if you can accompany me to [bike] commute. So one guy, Christian, he’s also from Pasig. And he works in Tektite. So his route was along Julia Vargas Avenue. He biked with me once.) ‘Not bike-friendly’ During his first months bike commuting, Pelicano tried to avoid pedaling along other motor vehicles on the streets. Since he’s coming from the eastern side of Pasig, Pelicano had to cross C5 Road to reach Ortigas. He said he could’ve just biked through the U-turn slot across Tiendesitas to reach the central business district. But he didn’t. “Hindi ko pa kayang tumingin pagilid. So ang ginawa ko, binibitbit ko yung bike ko sa footbridge sa may Shell, tapos baba, at bike sa Julia Vargas Avenue. Lagi ako sa kabilang side. Counterflow ako every morning,” Pelicano said. (I couldn’t check my view sideways. So what I did was, I carry my bike up to the footbridge near Shell, and then go down, and then bike again along Julia Vargas Avenue. I always ride at the other side. I do counterflow every morning.) The road condition along Doña Julia Vargas Avenue wasn’t as great at that time too. Pelicano said that the asphalt overlay was an issue because it leaves a gap between the old and the new one, making the road uneven. He said it could be dangerous, as bikers might slip. Another challenge was that the building where he used to work wasn’t friendly to bike commuters.  In 2011, the Pasig City government passed an ordinance promoting bike use. It also ordered private establishments to install bicycle parking racks within their premises. Since there weren’t any bike racks at the office building, Pelicano had to park their bikes at a particular corner where all the other bikes are. Whenever he would bring his smaller folding bike to work, he would have to use the service elevator from the basement to reach the floor where he worked. “One time, I had to squeeze my way in the service elevator. The building manager got mad at me and since then he didn’t allow me to bring my bike in the office. I felt really bad,” he said. In November 2016, Pelicano switched jobs which made him report to work in Makati. This meant additional kilometers for him. From his daily bike commute of about 6 kilometers, it’s now about 13 kilometers. Intermodal commute was not ideal too, as city buses don’t have compartments where he can place his bike. “Sabi ng wife ko, kapag umayaw ako, eh paano ‘yung ibang manong, araw-araw? I realized ‘yung iba, wala talagang choice. ‘Yung iba gamit pa nila surplus bikes lang. So sinabi ko, kakayanin,” he told Rappler. (My wife told me, that if I give up, what about the older men who bike everyday? I realized, others didn’t have a choice. Some even use surplus bikes only. So I said, I can do it.) MNL Moves Pelicano was the brain behind the Facebook page “MNL Moves,” where he shares tips on bike commuting, reviews on bicycle parts, or urban planning proposals that would benefit bikers. He started the page in December 2017 when he was working on his Masters’ thesis for Urban and Regional Planning at the University of the Philippines. “I read a lot of literature for my thesis and I thought, ‘Why don’t I just post it? Just so I can share my learnings?’ That’s how I started it,” he said. As of writing, MNL Moves is followed by over 3,600 people and reaches over 200,000 people. With the hopes of “paying it forward,” Pelicano shares videos of his ride, to serve as a guide to other people who want to explore biking in those areas. {source} <div class=”flex-video widescreen”> <iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fvideos%2F1933942196727752%2F&show_text=0&width=560″ width=”560″ height=”315″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allowFullScreen=”true”></iframe> </div> {/source}   As a licensed urban planner, Pelicano posts about low-cost interventions that the government can easily implement. One of them is “bike boxes.” According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, these are designated areas at a signalized intersection “that provides bicyclists with a safe and visible way to get ahead of queuing traffic during the red signal phase.” Pelicano’s idea is for these to be painted at signalized intersections so bikers are easily identified. “If there are bike boxes, it would greatly help bike commuters. At least they would know where they should go at signalized intersections, especially when they want to take a turn. Motorized vehicles will have to wait until the cyclists have safely crossed to the other side,” he told Rappler. In one of his many posts about it, Pelicano shared his frustration about a comment, saying that “vehicles should be prioritized.” “We got a long way to go Metro Manila. And it’s not even about bicycle policies and infrastructure. It’s about building a culture of bicycling, and walking, and/or other means of sustainable mobility,” he said in a post on October 2018. {source}<iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fposts%2F1770051726439210&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”623″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe>{/source}   In a recent post, Pelicano shared about a government official who would not buy his proposal of painting bike boxes, after explaining its benefits. {source}<iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fposts%2F2066545556789824&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”794″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe>{/source}   Building a culture All of these challenges are easily managed if biking is a priority in the Philippines, but it is not – at least not yet. For Pelicano, it takes a village to realize that. “It’s really about building a culture. Of course, it starts with the self and eventually finding a community that can support you,” he told Rappler. Government support is important too, he said, noting the experiences of other countries such as Netherlands that gives a premium on biking than other modes of transportation. National and local governments launched initiatives in the past to promote biking in the country. But some initiatives seemed to be a band-aid solution to the lack of bicycle infrastructure in the country, with some bike lanes painted right in the middle of a sidewalk. In some areas, it seemed like lip service, with some bike lanes blocked by electrical posts or trees along the road.  The Department of Public Works and Highways pledged to build more bike lanes across the country, incorporating this to new infrastructure projects. In February, DPWH opened a protected bike lane along the Laguna Lake Highway. Other protected bike lanes can be found along Doña Julia Vargas Avenue in Pasig City and Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr Avenue or Diversion Road in Iloilo City too, thanks to the initiative of these local governments. In an opinion piece published on Manila Times, development economist and transport advocate Robert Siy said that it’s time for the Philippine government to support a “Bike, Bike, Bike program,” a play of words on the country’s infrastructure program “Build, Build, Build.” “More cycling will benefit all Philippine cities, big and small. Low cost, pro-poor, quick-to-implement, environment-friendly, and health-promoting! If city mayors and national officials are looking for projects that can be delivered within the next 3 years, cycling infrastructure should be high on the list,” Siy said in his column. Another expert even said that biking could also help reduce traffic congestion, as the shift would free up road space. As the online discussion pushing the government to “move people, not cars” grow louder, Pelicano still thinks that action speaks louder than words. “We want to translate our online presence into tangible and real-life actions, as we try to build better communities for ourselves, our loved ones,” Pelicano wrote in his Facebook page, inviting more people to bike to work. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/232035-expert-provincial-bus-ban-worsen-metro-manila-traffic-congestion/","title":"Expert says provincial bus ban to worsen Metro traffic congestion","date":"Jun 1, 2019 11:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Transport economist Jedd Ugay says that if MMDA wants to reduce traffic congestion, the effect of the provincial bus ban is the 'total opposite'","body":" MANILA, Philippines –  Implementing the ban on provincial buses along EDSA would only worsen traffic congestion, an expert said. In an interview with Rappler, transport economist Jedd Ugay said that the provincial bus ban is not economical and would push Filipinos to shift to a more “unsustainable” mode of transportation. “In macroeconomics, alighting at the terminal is an additional unnecessary trip kilometers. It will cause more traffic for everyone,” Ugay said. “The government should look at the bigger picture, not only improving traffic flow, but reducing the vehicle volume. The best way to reduce that is to shift people from using private vehicle to more sustainable modes of transportation which is public transport,” he said. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is set to close provincial bus terminals along EDSA this June and has since prohibited the said drivers to drop off passengers along the main thoroughfare in a bid to “reduce traffic congestion.” The new policy would force commuters to alight at an interim terminal in Sta Rosa, Laguna and the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange for those from the South, and another interim bus terminal in Valenzuela City for those from the North. That’s where commuters should ride the city buses and jeepneys that would bring them to their desired destinations, the MMDA earlier said. But Ugay said that if the traffic agency aims to reduce traffic congestion with this policy, the effect of the ban is the “total opposite.” “If your aim is to reduce traffic congestion, this is not what you should do. You have to reduce every trip kilometer generated per commute,” he said. “Once you reduce convenience of commuting, you’re discouraging people to use public transport and rather have them bring their own private vehicles, which again, would result to more private vehicles on the road,” he added. Longer commute With the MMDA policy, commuters aired their frustration online, saying that the ban is “anti-commuter.” Bicol lawmakers even filed petitions before the Supreme Court to stop the implementation of the policy, arguing that it is “utterly oppressive and unfair.” Ugay echoed the same sentiment that commute will be longer as an additional “trip kilometer” is generated. “For example, I’m going to ride a bus in Batangas and I want to go to Makati. Instead of going directly to Makati, I still have to ride again at an interchange. There’s still waiting time to buy a ticket and then boarding the vehicle. Instead of having a shorter trip, it became longer. If the terminal is farther to your destination, you would have to backtrack that additional trip kilometers,” he added. Ugay, a former project development officer at the Department of Transportation, explained that the policy does not match the “origin-destination pattern” of commuters. “Normally for people, hindi lang naman point-to-point ang gusto niyang puntahan (they don’t always want to travel point-to-point only). Although it might serve a fraction of the total population, but they still want to board from somewhere in the middle of the route and alight in the middle too,” he said. According to MMDA, there are 12,000 buses in Metro Manila, 8,000 of which are provincial buses. The remaining 4,000 constitutes the city buses. “There are more costs with this ban. You have to add congestion, pollution, chance for road accident, fuel cost or fare, and the most expensive of all, the time costs; when you board another vehicle from the terminal to your destination,” Ugay said. Public vs private In a previous interview with Rappler, MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago defended the policy saying that only 3% of the total vehicle volume count will be affected by the ban. “MMDA is looking from a vehicle perspective, but you have to compute the number of people using the buses and the economic benefit of that. Private vehicles has more share of road space along EDSA but they only carry less people, as compared to buses,” Ugay said. In Albay 2nd district Representative Joey Salceda’s petition before the High Court, he said that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is “expected” to give thousands of permits to the following vehicles: On top of that, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines is urging the LTFRB to open 15,000 more slots for franchise applications. But increasing the road share of private vehicles and two stop off points would benefit less commuters, Ugay said. “You need to increase the throughput of a road. For example, a lane can carry 2,000 vehicles but if you change the occupancy of each vehicle, that’s how you can move more people,” he said. Next steps? For him, the government should focus on more sustainable policies. Ugay said that the improving public transportation would definitely push more people to commute. “Travel time and safety are the top things people think during commute. If you won’t get late because of commute, you are more enticed to make the shift to use public transportation. People are willing, but they don’t want to wait,” he said. While infrastructure and rehabilitation works on public transportation are on the way, Ugay said that the government should also focus to making the roads bike- and pedestrian-friendly. “Improving sidewalks and providing bike lanes are easy and quick to implement. Once people see that these are prioritized, more and more people will use bikes too. It would use up less space and not as dangerous as cars in terms of road safety and don’t emit pollutants,” he said. Ugay is also a co-founder of Alt Mobility, a group that promotes sustainable transportation. One of Alt Mobility’s platforms is the Facebook group “How’s Your Byahe, Bes?” (How’s your travel, friend?), which brings lively discussions on commute, policies, and anything related to transportation. “Let’s try to reduce the number of vehicles by making them shift to public transport, walking, or cycling. If you improve walkability in an area, you also reduce the number of trips there,” Ugay said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/231519-grab-7th-year-promos-freebies-2019/","title":"Grab celebrates 7th year with P7-M promos, rewards","date":"May 25, 2019 7:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines will also launch carpooling services within Makati and Ortigas zones in June, and between those zones in July","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab is celebrating its 7th year anniversary in business giving away P7 million worth of promos, discounts, and rewards on its platform.

In a statement early Friday, May 10, the DOTr said they issued a guideline on the pilot implementation, which was signed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade on Wednesday, May 8. “Patunay ito na nakikinig ang gobyerno sa publiko. Patunay ito na bukas ang aming mga isip. Noong Disyembre ay inatasan natin ang pagbuo ng TWG (technical working group), at itong general guidelines ang bunga ng mga pagpupulong na iyon,” Tugade said. (This is proof that the government listens to the public. This is proof that we are open-minded. In December, we ordered the creation of a TWG, and these general guidelines are the result of those discussions.) Based on the document, the service will be rolled out in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu one month after the secretary’s approval, or on June 8. The DOTr has set the fare that motorcycle taxis should charge, as well as safety requirements that should be provided by the drivers or operators.    The pilot operations should run on a ride-hailing app, according to the guidelines. The DOTr said the data that will be collected from the pilot operations will be used when drafting the bill on legalizing motorcycle taxis. The pilot implementation will be done in partnership with motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas. Currently, Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. This is the reason why Angkas has been facing legal hurdles in its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) Guidelines For the pilot implementation, the DOTr has set the fare for the two areas. In Metro Manila, P50 is the base fare for the first two kilometers (km) of the ride. An additional P10/km will be charged for succeeding kilometers up to 7 km. Beyond 7 km, there will be an additional charge of P15/km. {source} <iframe title=”Metro Manila motorcycle taxi fare” aria-label=”Short Table” id=”datawrapper-chart-KWwXH” src=”//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KWwXH/1/” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ style=”width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;” height=”250″></iframe><script type=”text/javascript”>!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var e in a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.getElementById(“datawrapper-chart-“+e)||document.querySelector(“iframe[src*='”+e+”‘]”);t&&(t.style.height=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][e]+”px”)}})}();</script> {/source} In Metro Cebu, the base fare for the first kilometer is much cheaper at P20, but the additional charge up to the succeeding 8 km will be P16/km.

The DOTr has given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board the power to change the fare matrix or to revise the surge cap. Meanwhile, below are the safety requirements included in the guidelines:  The DOTr said that riders should not drive for more than 10 hours. They are also asking for operators to have an accident insurance. Legalization up next? The DOTr said that certain key performance indicators were set by the department in studying the viability of motorcycle taxis for transport. The accident threshold was set at 5% of the total rides. If this figure is met, the TWG will conduct an emergency meeting to investigate the situation and decide whether to suspend the pilot operations. The DOTr will also look into violations of traffic policies, as well as commuter feedback. Senators earlier urged the DOTr to just issue a department order that will allow the operation of motorcycle taxis for hired transport, similar to what they did to ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber before. In December 2018, the DOTr created the TWG to flesh out these issues but maintained that there is a need to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code or pass another law that would allow such. In the 17th Congress, the House of Representatives passed on 3rd and final reading House Bill 8959 or the Motorcycles-for-Hire Act. Its counterpart measure in the Senate, Senate Bill 2180, already passed the committee level. The DOTr said the safety of passengers is the top priority during this test run. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride)  “Pangunahing responsibilidad natin ang kaligtasan ng publiko.

Net profits for the financial year ending March at the telecoms and investment group came in at 1.41 trillion yen ($12.8 billion), up 35.8 %. The company hailed gains of 1.26 trillion yen from its investment funds, led by SoftBank Vision Fund, estimated to have firepower of around $100 billion with heavy Saudi Arabian backing. Under CEO Masayoshi Son’s leadership, the SoftBank Vision Fund has embarked on a series of investments, one of the most recent being a $1 billion joint injection with Toyota into ridesharing giant Uber to develop driverless cars. The value of SoftBank Group’s stake in Uber gained 418 billion yen. The company did not offer any formal projections for the year to come but Son said he was confident net profit would top 1.0 trillion yen for the fourth consecutive year. The fund has also plowed $1.5 billion in fresh financing into Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab. Overall, the fund has set a goal of investing at least $100 billion in firms promising new technological innovations and has taken stakes in some of the hottest companies in the tech world, including Slack, WeWork and Nvidia.

Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday giving it an estimated valuation of some $80 billion, one of the biggest tech listings in recent years but rather lower than its earlier hopes of around $100 billion. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in cities around the world. It will also come in the rear-view mirror of a troubled market debut for Uber’s largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15% of its value since its March IPO. Strikes that took place Wednesday highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange, where Uber is set to list shares, with some signs reading “Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.” Similar actions took place in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington and in Uber’s home town, San Francisco. Protests were held in Britain as well with drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow called on to log off apps and demonstrate outside Uber offices, according to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “UBER” sometime next month. “We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and ‘little brother’ to Uber,” Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is “paving a similar road” to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. Uber’s platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/229588-grab-comelec-partnership-voter-education/","title":"Grab partners with Comelec for voter education","date":"May 3, 2019 1:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says Metro Manila and Cebu voters will also enjoy a discount on Election Day, when they head to polls","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to promote voter education, ride-hailing firm Grab Philippines partnered with the Commission on Elections.

And they’re aggressively competing to be adopted by both consumers and merchants. It’ll take some time before we determine who emerges on top – right now, only a portion of the population is using e-wallets. But here’s how the competition is playing out so far. The cream of the crop Among standalone apps, GCash ranks number one on both Google Play and App Store, according to data from analytics firm App Annie. Take note that Android accounts for roughly 83% of mobile operating systems in the Philippines, so you may want to pay more attention to the Google Play column. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259176/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:400px;’></iframe>{/source}   Longtime player GCash and rival PayMaya were created by the innovation units of the country’s powerful telco duopoly: Globe Telecom’s Mynt and PLDT/Smart’s Voyager Innovations, respectively. Coins.ph, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Hose in 2014, is a blockchain-based mobile payments startup that recently sold a majority stake to Indonesia’s ride-hailing behemoth Go-Jek. PayPal probably needs little introduction. Set up in 1998, the US firm is a pioneer that introduced the world to the idea of sending funds to anyone across the world – online. It’s also a staple secure payment method for e-commerce sites globally. Another force to contend with is GrabPay, the e-wallet embedded in the app of Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing firm. Grab tops the “Travel” and “Maps & Navigation” categories in the Philippines. App ranking is a good gauge of an app’s performance. It doesn’t just count downloads, but also factors in things like uninstalls, rating, usage, and more. However, it doesn’t give you the full picture. Other factors – such as monthly active users, transaction volume/value, competitive differentiation, financial muscle, stickiness, user acquisition costs, revenue, user experience, and so on – matter, and we’ll look into some of these later on. Same same but different First, let’s check out the compelling e-wallet models that have popped up worldwide. In emerging markets with a large unbanked population, a common model is one focused on financial inclusion. Here, an e-wallet is possibly the user’s first experience with a formal financial service, rather than a bank account. The e-wallet can perform basic functions – cash in/out, money transfers, as well as micropayments (e.g. phone credit top-ups). Then you have the ecosystem play. This e-wallet is part of an app that’s engaged in segments such as transportation, logistics, and shopping. Its users are already kind of digitally savvy, likely banked but do not necessarily qualify for credit cards. The app operator accepts cash as a mode of payment, but its e-wallet offers convenience and greater benefits. Philippine telcos kicked off their e-wallet services – GCash and Smart Money – in the 2000s with a wider financial inclusion goal. They initially offered SIM-based remittance and micro payments, making use of a vast network of agents – mostly sari-sari stores – to facilitate the transactions. This kind of remittance works this way: a customer hands a store cash, the store sends the amount via mobile phone to another store where the customer’s recipient can claim the money – also in the form of cash.  Years after introducing SIM-based e-money services, the telcos launched app versions to boost use cases and cater to the rapidly growing, digitally savvy base of smartphone owners in the country – whether they’re unbanked or banked. Coins.ph started out as a cryptocurrency exchange (buying and selling cryptocurrencies) and evolved into a suite of payments services similar to the telco apps. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/5857203A97624D1C8426325943F475E6/coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Meanwhile, GrabPay is part of the Grab ecosystem, which started with ride-hailing and branched out into more services, including courier and food delivery. Now, all these apps are aiming to transform into a third model: the lifestyle super app. Many e-wallet providers are eyeing this as an end-state, but few have been able to achieve it. Lifestyle super apps are ecosystems of services that have built an extensive base of active users – unbanked and banked – and have become indispensable in daily life. They’re not just used to pay online, but also in physical stores. Sitting on volumes of customer transaction data, these apps monetize that data by offering adjacent services like micro-loans. The greatest success stories can be found in China, where Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba-backed Alipay are used by people to pay for almost everything in the country. An outlier in the local scene perhaps is PayPal, which falls under another model that hinges on payment convenience. Largely targeting the banked segment, PayPal’s early solution stored and safeguarded bank card details, enabling users to shop on websites via their PayPal accounts without giving away those sensitive details to sellers. For sellers, the US company provided a checkout system for accepting online payments. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/1ED17AD5396F4A779AD4016924D33A9F/paypal.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, PayPal’s app works the same way, storing card details that users can use to pay other users or businesses with PayPal accounts. It can’t be used for payments in physical shops, but its balance can be transferred to other mobile wallets that are accepted by stores. What makes them stand out Though still a ways off, GCash seems to be leading the race to become a lifestyle super app in the Philippines. That’s thanks in part to its progressive and first-mover approach. Thinking that direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are the future, for instance, GCash decided to move away from sari-sari store-facilitated remittance as soon as it launched its app in 2012. The reason was simple: how do you persuade people to go cashless and digital if you don’t eliminate – or at least try to reduce – cash and human intervention in the transactions?  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/E8598F9B04734E54A88C95A1561035B6/g-cash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   While some may argue the move could mean missing out on the base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market in rural areas that’s reliant on agents for money transfers, it has allowed GCash to capture more of the urban consumers who are receptive to mobile technology and have higher-value transactions. Other moves that makes this progressive approach evident: Playing catch-up, PayMaya, which was launched in 2015, has yet to introduce such features. And its SIM-based counterpart Smart Money has maintained the biggest network of agents – 26,000 as of last count, most of which are sari-sari stores. But that’s due to the strong demand that its Smart Padala service has enjoyed from the BOP market, who are mostly located in rural areas with no stable internet connection, and still own feature phones. On the upside, this means a healthy revenue stream for Smart Money and a potential new base of users for PayMaya – if the latter successfully persuades the former’s users to migrate to the app, that is.  Nevertheless, the competition is still in its early days, and GCash and its rival camp are expected to extend well beyond their current focus segments. Moreover, both GCash and PayMaya – by virtue of being owned by the telcos – could have the strongest brand recall and consumer trust among the apps. Since Tencent, Alibaba’s chief competitor, made an investment in Voyager last year, you could say that the GCash-PayMaya battle is an extension of the war between China’s tech giants. What makes Coins.ph unique, on the other hand, is its underlying blockchain technology. What this means is it can store, transfer cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum), and convert them into pesos, helping it capture a niche. Coins.ph probably got a boost when Bitcoin prices were hitting record-highs a couple of years ago as more people got in on the action. However, the Bitcoin hype started fading as prices slumped.  While cryptocurrencies are considered volatile investments due to wild price fluctuations, blockchain has real utility for cross-border money transfer. Two reasons: it’s quick and cheap. Settlements using blockchain are instant, versus about an hour through a service like Western Union, or two to three days through banks. That’s because money transferred the traditional way goes through financial intermediaries, which are subject to strict regulation and charge fees. Blockchain keeps track of transactions using a digital ledger where entries cannot be fudged, so it eliminates intermediaries from the picture and lowers the costs (if you want to know more about blockchain, here’s a good resource). At the moment, Grab’s strength lies in ride-hailing where it has monopoly after beating Uber in Southeast Asia. On-demand transportation is a daily use case that’s hard to beat. The Singapore-based firm’s food delivery and courier features are also gaining a lot of traction among users in the region. While Grab is a frontrunner in launching financial services, including credit scoring and micro-loans, in markets like the Lion City, it’s still in the rollout phase for such services in the Philippines. This means it has to play catch-up with most of the local apps. But Grab’s regional presence also means it has economies of scale – it’s able to share costs over several markets.  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9E230ABABC234F329B97C2DB0CED5965/grab.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   For its part, PayPal’s global payments service has become the method of choice among individuals catering to overseas clients. Next to the US and India, the Philippines’ gig economy is ranked third in the world, with more people opting for online jobs to avoid long commutes and work flexible hours. Citing data from the Global Freelancer Survey, PayPal claims that its platform is widely used by freelancers in the Philippines (92%), Indonesia (88%), and Singapore (76%). Although domestic clients opt for bank transfers, about 76% of payments from international clients are made via PayPal, the survey notes. Here’s a comparative look at most of the finance apps’ features: {source}<iframe class=”app-features” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259205/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Here are Grab’s features in the Philippines at the moment: Increasing stickiness In theory, the more services an app has, the stickier it gets since existing users have more reasons to use it (how frictionless and efficient the services are is another story). Developing new services is also a way to add users and reduce the risks posed by regulatory changes in one sector – for example, transportation. This suggests improved long-term viability. In the same way, having a vast network of merchants who accept this mode of payment is critical to accelerate usage.  The ease of cashing in is important, otherwise there’s really no incentive for people to fund their e-wallets. Here are ways to add funds to the different e-wallets: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashin” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263579/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The ability to convert e-wallet balances into cash or return them to bank accounts is also just as crucial in driving adoption, especially if the market has yet to overcome the trust barrier. Without this ability, it’s like having unused miles stuck with an airline company. GCash and PayMaya allow users to withdraw cash via ATMs using their linked prepaid cards. These ATM withdrawals, however, come with the usual bank charge. Speeding ahead of other players, GCash now lets users transfer their balances to more than 30 banks in the country for free. Although PayPal allows transfers to banks, the minimum amount required without incurring fees tends to be relatively high for the general population. In the Philippines, the transfer will not incur charges if the amount is P7,000 (US$138) and above. On top of that, banks impose fees which further reduce the amount to be received by the user. Below are the different cash-out options offered by the apps: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashout” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263583/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Apart from drivers’ takings, Grab does not allow users to change GrabPay credits into cash or transfer them into bank accounts. This means Grab will have to contend with providers that offer cash redemption. Attracting merchants E-wallets are impractical for people without stores that take them, and no merchant will accept e-wallets if their customers don’t use them. Players have to find a way to build both sides of the marketplace. If an app collects a critical mass of users and merchants, it becomes harder for a competitor to lure them away. Merchants would find it tough to ignore Grab and GCash’s user base. Grabbers come from across Southeast Asia, where the firm controls the ride-hailing sector and is increasingly encroaching into the travel space through its partnerships (Booking.com is an investor in Grab, for example). Hence, Grab’s local arm is poised to capture tourists visiting the Philippines from neighboring countries.  For its part, GCash has integrated with affiliate Alipay to allow the latter’s users – mostly Chinese nationals – to make purchases from merchants that accept GCash. It’s uncertain whether PayMaya has done the same with its ally WeChat. In the Philippines, where most payments still happen offline, offering physical stores a mobile payment system that doesn’t require huge capital expenditure is a sound step toward sweeping adoption. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9504C856932C4236AD521F864470667E/paymaya-checkout.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   QR code tech is way cheaper than near-field communication (NFC) and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Except for PayPal, all local apps have QR code capabilities.  {source}<iframe class=”qr-merchants” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/274752/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Though Grab’s QR can’t be used in stores yet, the company has struck a partnership with retail titan SM to offer it in malls soon. Another key selling point is the fact that apps charge merchants lower fees (% of transaction value) for payments compared to credit cards. Heavy ammunition With an extensive user and merchant base comes significant revenue potential. Most apps charge users minimal transaction fees for things bought or paid for on their platforms to fuel adoption. Even without those fees, there’s potential to earn from users’ balances. In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay hold billions of dollars in funds that accumulate in their apps when users do not immediately use the funds or transfer them to a bank or investment account. The firms invest those funds to generate returns. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/712272D9E64A4B409F0BFDEC42CAC0E9/ali-pay-we-chat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   However, the companies are said to be losing that revenue after the Chinese government required that all e-wallet funds be deposited in non-interest bearing accounts with the central bank, rather than private institutions. More than the user fees, players earn from taking a cut of merchant sales – online and offline. Ultimately, the lifestyle apps serve as e-commerce platforms where third-party merchants and the apps themselves or their parent companies sell their products and services. In this case, payments essentially act as the backbone that allows the transactions to happen. For instance, Globe and Smart are using GCash and PayMaya to sell phone credit top-ups. Coins.ph is offering its crypto exchange and trading services – akin to how a foreign currency exchange service and stock exchange work. Here’s how many e-wallet accounts there are in the Philippines, as per government data: {source}<iframe class=”ewallet-accounts” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} And here are the companies’ own user stats: {source}<iframe class=”companies” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259234/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The picture looks rosy if we go by the players’ numbers. However, it’s uncertain how much of their user acquisition is organic. App companies spend not just on ads but also marketing promos – cashbacks and price discounts, among other things – to hook price-sensitive Filipinos and foster frequent use.  That’s not to say those subsidies are at all bad. For new technologies, subsidies are a potent – perhaps necessary – tool to acquire users and increase adoption. However, they’re costly to maintain, so winning the payments war will require deep pockets. The road to making money will be long and hard, but there are enormous rewards for becoming the dominant player. The question then becomes: who will last in the game? All the key players in the market right now have heavy war chests and high-profile investors in their rosters. {source}<iframe class=”high-profile” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263586/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The risk with cashbacks and discounts is that they may not necessarily inspire loyalty to a particular brand. In a situation where two players offer exactly the same services, people tend to gravitate towards the one that gives out more promos. So organic approaches like growing your merchant base and differentiating your product to entice users, as well as robust loyalty programs to keep users engaged are vital. Grab has a rewards program that lets users gain points as they use the app and progress up the tiers. The higher their tier is, the more rewards they can access. In Singapore, Grab has begun to offer subscription plans wherein users pay a fee upfront to avail of bundled discount vouchers across its services. The plans lock in customers for a longer period: the vouchers are already paid for so people are inclined to use them. What’s even more interesting is that the subscriptions are linked to the rewards program. Rides booked under the subscriptions earn reward points. On GCash, credit scoring and micro-loans will only be unlocked after a certain level of usage. The app, which currently has the most number of QR merchants, also introduced a program where users get vouchers after a purchase, to keep them coming back. To better gauge how an app is performing, one can look at active users and transaction volume/value. Unfortunately, the local apps are keeping those numbers under wraps. GCash claims that its active user base has grown 4x from 2017 to 2018.  We reached out to the other players for stats and other info, but have yet to receive a response. What consumers are saying Overall, companies will have to compete in terms of the quality of their products and services, including the crucial user experience. To know more about what people think of the payments apps, TheNerve used its natural language processing tool to monitor and analyze Twitter posts about them. The analysis spanned January 1 to December 31, 2018, with posts geo-tagged in the Philippines. Here’s what the team found. GCash and PayMaya {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/251672/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Both GCash and PayMaya’s social maps are dominated by clusters of tweets about:   {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/257704/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Announcements and news coverage are focused on partnerships with malls and brands that have started accepting the apps as modes of payment, as well as referral and cashback programs. Zooming in on the user conversations, here are some key findings: GCash {source}{module 4131}{/source} PayMaya {source}{module 4132}{/source} Coins.ph {source}{module 4133}{/source} PayPal {source}<div style=”text-align: center;”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/D3F4D8BA56F74FD19E7FA1671AFA59E5/img/15B5CD41997843FC805732EDD8B17907/2_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   GrabPay {source}{module 4134}{/source} Survival of the deepest pockets As the local race is still in a relatively early stage, there’s room for players to co-exist and share the market. Having several e-wallet firms that spend for marketing campaigns raises consumer awareness and expedites adoption. At this point, players are fighting a common stubborn enemy: cash. Today, cash still makes up 99 percent of Philippine transactions. That means the market may remain fragmented, with more players potentially throwing their hat into the ring. Yet having too many options can also hinder adoption. It’s tedious for a user to maintain dozens of apps. In the long run, consolidation is bound to happen (we’ve actually seen a form of consolidation when Go-Jek acquired control of Coins.ph). In China, which is past the tipping point for mass e-wallet adoption, it’s evident: this is a sector where only a couple of players hold the majority of the market.  Players are expected to heavily burn cash to compete for market share so that means those with the deepest pockets will survive. It also means that profitability may be a long way off.  As e-wallet adoption grows, banks will be gravely affected. Apart from losing out to e-wallets in the unbanked market, existing transactions in their credit and debit card systems may shift to mobile as well. To stay relevant, they must determine how to compete and collaborate with new payment methods. Seeing the onslaught ahead, the country’s lenders have led the talks to come up with a national QR code system with the goal of having the codes readable across financial apps – bank or non-bank. So this means that a merchant can display a single QR code that all payments providers will be able to scan. This kind of interoperability will level the playing field. How the landscape will evolve when banks join the fray is definitely something to watch.

It may seem like a scene straight out of the Netflix show Black Mirror, but it’s no longer science fiction. In China, cash is considered almost dead. Mobile payments have become so ubiquitous that even beggars are collecting handouts by apps. The country’s e-wallet giants, Alibaba-backed Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat, have 700 million and 1 billion monthly active users, respectively. That covers almost the entire China population, and a chunk of those numbers came only in the past 5 years. For comparison, Apple Pay, which comes pre-installed on every iPhone, has only 127 million users globally. The Philippines hasn’t come close to the dizzying adoption that China has seen (to be fair, though, probably no other country in the world has). Cash still accounted for 99% of local transactions as of 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) earlier said. A poll by data insights company TheNerve confirmed that cash remains the preferred payment mode of Filipinos. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237783/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   On top of that, only 1.3% of Filipino adults own electronic money accounts, according to the BSP’s 2017 Financial Inclusion Survey. BSP’s own data pegs e-wallet accounts in the country at about 12% of the adult population.  {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   If we go by industry players’ claims, here’s how many e-wallet users we have: (Stats on other players are hard to come by.) The sum of those figures translates to just over 31% of the total population and this is how it compares to some of the Philippines’ neighbors:  China’s e-wallet success will be hard to replicate elsewhere, but there are many lessons that can be drawn from its experience. While the Philippines was slow to adopt mobile payments in the past, it’s likely reaching a tipping point, especially as Alibaba and Tencent export their expertise and technology here via their strategic tie-ups with GCash and PayMaya. China was uniquely primed for mobile payments For context, mobile payments leapfrogged in China because of insufficient banking infrastructure. The size of the country and its population meant consumers had to contend with long lines in city branches and long journeys to those in the countryside. Credit card usage was also low, partly because America’s Visa and Mastercard – and many other international firms – were banned in the Middle Kingdom. Mobile apps became a convenient way to transfer money and pay for goods and services. Widening internet and mobile phone penetration, and rising incomes were also prerequisites. China’s smartphone market took off when cheaper Chinese alternatives to the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy began to sprout. Today, smartphone adoption stands at 63%, while cellular subscription is 104 per 100 people in the country. The Philippine market’s fundamentals are quite similar to China’s early days. While the local market isn’t highly protectionist like China – and Visa and Mastercard are the two dominant credit card companies – cards have not seen that much take-up. It’s hard to get approved for a credit card if you don’t have any credit or banking history. With 77% of Filipinos unbanked, mobile payments offer the perfect case for people to sideswipe the plastic. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239880/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Like China, the Philippines has a rising middle class and is touted as a mobile-first market, with smartphone adoption at 59%, thanks to affordable phones – a lot of which are made by Chinese brands themselves. Cellular subscription is at 110 per 100 people. Filipinos also spend the most time on the internet and social media among countries in the world. Facebook is practically their internet. As consumers become digitally savvy, they begin to browse and purchase goods and services online and on-the-go. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”http://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A/pinoys-smartphone.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   One roadblock perhaps is the country’s slow internet speed. It’s hard to create the habit of paying for goods anytime without a constant, stable connection, particularly in rural areas. Though the speed has improved, it still lags behind other Asia-Pacific countries. That can be blamed on a lack of internet infrastructure. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/D9ECB2C6F0B342B5A20E16D6DB190406/asia-pacific-internet-speeds-akamai-q1-2017-report.png” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Source: Akamai Q1 2017 report” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Creating the habit of mobile payments through strong use cases To boost the user count of its eBay-like e-commerce platform Taobao, Alibaba in 2004 launched Alipay, which held payment in escrow until buyers received their online purchase. Providing users with a go-between and guarantor catapulted Taobao to massive popularity. Alibaba, which also owns business-to-consumer marketplace Tmall, is China’s most prolific e-commerce firm – the one responsible for the world’s biggest shopping holiday known as Single’s Day or 11.11. About a decade later, the escrow service was spun off as a separate company called Ant Financial to consolidate Alibaba’s various finance activities under one roof. Ant began to run mobile wallet Alipay as one of its units. By that time, Alipay already had a large user base. Since then, Alipay dominated roughly 80% of mobile payments in China, where 75% of online sales were expected to happen through smartphones by 2018. Till Tencent’s WeChat Pay entered the picture. If e-commerce was the driving force behind Alipay, WeChat Pay’s main weapon was social interaction. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5CFB321FFDA24818BA79B19F4C1381F6/alipay-wechat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   The payments service is integrated into the WeChat social app and responsible for all the transactions happening there. It launched riding on the back of China’s longtime tradition of gifting cash-stuffed red envelopes. On Lunar New Year in 2014, WeChat allowed its users to send a virtual version of the red envelopes to fellow users. The app quickly became a key method for people to send money to each other. That same year, WeChat made a big e-commerce leap by allowing any merchant – not just well-known retailers – to set up storefronts in its app under an open platform strategy. To defend its turf, Alipay followed suit. The rivalry only grew from there. The next battleground was China’s online-to-offline market (i.e. offline services being booked online) which saw the firms include a gamut of services into their apps. You name it, they have it: ride-hailing, food delivery, movie-ticket buying, etc. Payments were the glue that held their ecosystems together. By 2017, the firms had split the payments market: Alipay had a 54% share, while WeChat had 40%. They had become lifestyle “super apps” embedded in Chinese daily life. WeChat boasts of an unrivalled 1 billion active users network in China (to this day, Facebook has failed to leap over the Great Wall). The social aspect made it a lot stickier than Alipay and brought strong network effects, allowing it to catch up fast. The more users WeChat got on board, the more people wanted to join to be connected with their friends and families. And with more users came more sellers. The Philippines, however, has no homegrown brand as powerful as WeChat or Alipay that could spark that kind of awareness about mobile payments among Filipinos. The SIM-based payments services of Globe and PLDT (GCash and Smart Money, respectively) have been around since the early 2000s and the app versions (GCash and PayMaya) came starting 2012. Yet as of 2017, 40% of banked Filipinos were still unaware of electronic payment methods, according to the BSP Financial Inclusion Survey. That could partly explain the slow pace of adoption in previous years. Apart from lack of awareness, security is another concern. In TheNerve’s recent poll, most survey respondents said they don’t use mobile apps to pay. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237787/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Most think mobile app payments are unsafe and that their money and personal details might get stolen. But of course, security concerns may have more to do with Filipinos’ inherent distrust of new financial technologies than the apps themselves (transactions with the top apps have proven secure thus far). The country has seen countless fraud incidents like ATM card skimming and online scams. So you can’t deny the appeal of dealing with a person – there’s someone to hold liable if the transaction goes wrong. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237788/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   E-commerce is a booming Philippine sector, posting a 42% surge in gross merchandise volume from $500 million in 2015 to $1.5 billion in 2018, according to a Google report. It’s expected to grow to $10 billion by 2025. Despite this, cash-on-delivery is still the number one way to pay for online purchases – similar to how China’s market started before Alipay was introduced. The escrow service was a game changer for China, specifically Alibaba’s Taobao, assuring users that they wouldn’t get cheated on the platform. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/70B431BAC541481CA2E2E3058DF1CDB6/ph-bank-notes-coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, regional players Lazada – which was acquired by Alibaba in 2016 – and Shopee have been in a neck-and-neck race. Lazada’s payments feature, HelloPay, has merged with Alipay and rebranded to the latter. However, the companies said at the time that HelloPay’s features would be unchanged. It doesn’t seem like Lazada has adopted Alibaba’s escrow service, but it would help build trust among Filipino shoppers and push them into the habit of online payments if this happens. Local payments players will have to work much harder to hook consumers. These days, that means ads and integration with massive platforms like Facebook, cashback and other promos, as well as strong use cases. The marketing efforts will entail high cash burn, so players need substantial backing to last in the battle. Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat play a key role, as they take their fight for dominance to other markets. Both have bankrolled their international expansion not just by targeting globe-trotting Chinese consumers, but also through investments in local markets. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial (parent of Alipay) has made a major infusion in GCash’s parent Mynt and Tencent in PayMaya owner Voyager Innovations – both moves mean deeper know-how and capital to kick off the local apps’ aggressive growth. GCash and PayMaya started out with their telco groups’ core product – phone credit top-up (this made sense since the Philippines is a largely prepaid telco market) – money transfer, and bills payment. Now they’re gung-ho developing their own ecosystems of services. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/CA4037A87FC84A449D5F5C2B43A0593D/paymaya.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Other players with huge investor backing have also launched their bids to replicate China’s success. Ride-hailing company Grab has introduced GrabPay. Coins.ph, a blockchain-based e-wallet, has been acquired by Indonesia’s Go-Jek, Grab’s archrival that has its own payments feature called Go-Pay. Grab and Go-Jek are racing to become Southeast Asia’s leading super app that offers everyday services on-demand. All these companies have been flooding the market with promos to capture users. Here are some top e-wallet use cases, based on TheNerve’s survey: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237789/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Here’s the breakdown of e-money payments by key use case, as per BSP data: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239908/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   QR codes are the way to go China’s tech giants are battling not just for online payments, but also offline transactions. Mobile wallets can’t win users if merchants don’t accept this kind of payment in-store. This is something that Alibaba and Tencent knew very well, so they’ve been slugging it out for brick-and-mortar shops, restaurants, and other offline outlets. They understood early on that sellers located outside cities might not be willing to accept mobile payments that would require them to shell out a big amount and upgrade equipment. In the US, many vendors had to migrate to payment terminals compatible with near-field communication tech or NFC to accept Apple Pay and Google Pay. The QR code is a black-and-white, two-dimensional barcode that stores data in codified format and can be read by a scanner or the camera of any mobile device. It’s a way to skip the step where the payer and payee’s account details must be inputted for a transaction to go through. The system is way cheaper than NFC and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Merchants in China could purchase a QR code scanner – commonly referred to as the “little white box” – for a quarter of the price of handheld POS terminals. Merchants without scanners can just print out a QR code that consumers can scan using their phones to pay. This means anyone can become a merchant since hardware isn’t necessary. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/5A142193C0A34456920AC7DCA25EC452/qr-payment_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   It also means faster checkout time – no need to count bills and coins. Soon enough, QR code payments began taking China’s offline stores by storm. The technology has reached Philippine shores, raising the prospects of mobile payments finally taking off among vendors. A few months after Ant Financial’s investment in 2017, GCash introduced QR code payments. Not to be outdone by its competitor, PayMaya launched the feature on the same day. Before 2017, both e-wallet providers offered Visa and Mastercard prepaid cards that their users could use to pay at physical stores. So essentially only merchants with card terminals were able to accept the payments. The SIM-based mobile payment service, on the other hand, involved sending a text message with the amount and store’s code to a 4-digit access number. Lower fees are encouraging Another factor that should drive faster adoption of mobile payments is lower fees. In the US, Apple Pay and Google Pay don’t store money – instead, they work by charging directly to credit cards linked to the apps (the US is largely a card-based market). So it means those card firms take a percentage of each transaction from merchants. Alipay and WeChat are undercutting those card companies by giving users the ability to pay using their app balances, which can be sourced directly from bank accounts. This doesn’t mean no charges for merchants, though. Alipay takes a commission of 0.6% on sales, but that’s far lower than credit card commissions, which run between 1% and 5%. GCash and PayMaya work the same way as the China e-wallets, charging competitive rates. Both offer cash-in through physical stores. GCash alone offers the option to link and unlink bank accounts within the app. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5B40E0F0A415438E86479274B2977572/gcash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Users can also top up both GCash or PayMaya via the InstaPay option offered by banks. InstaPay is an electronic fund transfer service initiated by the BSP that allows people to transfer money almost instantly between accounts of participating BSP-supervised banks and non-bank e-money issuers in the Philippines. While going through InstaPay admittedly adds another step (users have to log into their bank app first), being able to wire money online and instantly will prove handy for consumers. InstaPay is one of the two automated clearing houses (ACH) for electronic fund transfers set up by the central bank under the National Retail Payment System. The aim is to promote interoperability among industry players so consumers can easily transfer money across different financial accounts. {source}<table border=”1″ style=”width:100%”> <tr> <td style=”padding: 1em; width: 20%; text-align: center;”>InstaPay</td> <td style=”padding: 1em;”> <ul> <li>Alternative to small-value cash payments</li> <li>Especially useful for purchasing retail goods, paying toll fees, and for e-commerce</li> <li>Limit: P50,000 per transaction</li> <li>Funds transferred get credited in real-time</li> <li>Enables merchants to accept e-payments from both e-money and bank accounts even without the usual point-of-sale device used for cards.

It employs a test-and-learn regulatory framework where players are relatively free to innovate. Among the things the central bank has allowed are: Will we ever get rid of cash? Clearly, the BSP sees the benefits of going cashless. Cash is costly to handle – you need to employ people to count, store or transport it, hence the fees banks charge consumers. It can also be dangerous to carry around. On the other hand, mobile app payments are quick and easy to scale, which translates to lower fees. They’re also transparent, as transactions are recorded electronically and can be tracked. With lower fees and simple know-your-customer procedures, the poor and unbanked could participate more broadly in the financial economy through the apps. What’s more, the apps provide a way for low-income households to save for emergencies and other needs, and for small businesses to access capital to grow. That’s why the central bank is doing its best to pave the way for a cash-lite society. It may be some way off, but experts believe the Philippines is on the cusp of a digital payments revolution. The BSP itself is optimistic that digital transactions could surge to 20% of total local payments by 2020.  Still, there are headwinds along the way. The promise of eliminating cash takes away the anonymity of every single transaction made. This is expected to be met with strong resistance from unscrupulous parties. It also brings about unsettling worries among consumers, given that volumes of their data are controlled by a few tech companies. With the vast amounts of personal information and transaction histories on Alipay, its parent Ant Financial has developed a proprietary platform called Sesame Credit, which calculates people’s credit scores based on that data. Ant then uses those scores in extending loans to consumers who are otherwise ignored by banks. China has a grand plan to implement a social credit scoring system that would judge its citizens’ behavior and trustworthiness. Concerns abound that it could access tech firms’ data, though the companies assert they won’t release it without users’ consent. A bad score could mean the loss of certain rights, such as boarding flights or riding the train. Again, it’s eerily reminiscent of the show Black Mirror, but that’s how the future may really be shaping up.

Go-Jek had filed an application to be a transport network company (TNC) through its subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines. In a text message to Rappler on Monday, March 18, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III confirmed that Velox’s application was denied due to foreign ownership. “[It] did not meet [the] citizenship requirement,” Delgra told Rappler. Back in January, the LTFRB’s pre-accreditation committee rejected Velox’s application for being 99.99% owned by its parent company Velox South-East Asia Holdings, which is Singaporean. The LTFRB said the Department of Transportation recognizes transport network vehicle services (TNVS) under public transport, thus requiring firms to be at least 60% Filipino-owned. Documents acquired by Rappler from the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Filipino firm Pace Crimson Ventures Corporation (PCVC) is the registered majority shareholder of Velox, with a 60% stake in the firm. But the LTFRB pre-accreditation committee said in its decision that only 20.4% out of 1.2 billion common shares were “actually sold” to PCVC, therefore concluding that Velox is “not-Filipino owned.” {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-conversation=”none” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>LOOK: LTFRB Board Resolution No. 16 rejecting Go-Jek’s local subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines’ application as TNC. <br><br>Velox can still appeal their case directly to the DOTr. <a href=”https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@rapplerdotcom</a> <a href=”https://t.co/DIWlrOobf2″>pic.twitter.com/DIWlrOobf2</a></p>&mdash; Aika Rey (@reyaika) <a href=”https://twitter.com/reyaika/status/1108668422764654593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>March 21, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source}   In its decision, the LTFRB further said that Velox “failed” to present Proof of Payment of Capital Gains Tax and Proof of Payment of Subscribed Shares allegedly subscribed by PCVC. Velox can still appeal its case directly to the Department of Transportation. PCVC is owned by Paulo Campos III. Campos is the chief executive officer of Zalora Philippines, where Ayala Corporation acquired a 49% stake in 2017. Ayala Corporation and Go-Jek had acquisition talks, sources familiar with the matter said earlier. In a statement sent to Rappler on Monday, Go-Jek said it is “disappointed” with the regulatory body’s decision. “Go-Jek is disappointed with the LTFRB’s decision to deny our motion for reconsideration and our offer to address Filipino commuters’ urgent need for more transportation options,” the company said. “Commuters in Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand as well as Indonesia benefit from our technology every day, but due to this decision, it seems drivers and commuters in the Philippines will have to wait a bit longer. We will now explore our options,” Go-Jek added. The Indonesian ride-hailing giant maintained that competition is important to provide better services to commuters. “The standard of [TNVS] can only be elevated if there is competition among TNC players. We want to provide real options to people who spend more hours on the road than necessary as well as to drivers, whose welfare is always improved by more competition in the sector,” Go-Jek said. Despite the rejection, Go-Jek said that it “hopes to arrive at a fruitful working relationship” with the LTFRB, to deliver ride-hailing services in the Philippines as soon as possible. The LTFRB’s latest decision means ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines remains at the forefront of the industry. Currently, it still dominates the market with 49,000 active drivers on its platform as of February 2019. Almost a year has passed since Uber sold its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. Since then, the LTFRB has accredited 8 other firms – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto, GoLag, ePickMeUp, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. But these other firms have yet to make a significant impact on the ride-hailing market, with the Philippine Competition Commission saying that the LTFRB should “look outside” for a viable option for commuters.

The shooting simulator will equip HPG troops with up-to-date training on enforcing road safety and security. It will also train the highway cops to have a better grasp of the use of force for threats outside normal shooting ranges. It will also have a scenario maker where training scenarios can be modified, depending on the current modus operandi of threat groups.

Navigatú, taken from the word “navigation” and inspired by Butuan’s “balangay” boats, offers an idea incubation program and business skills course for startups in the region. Just recently, Navigatu acquired P2 million in funding from an investor. Aside from providing a safer commuting alternative for the public, the application also hopes to increase the income of tricycle drivers. Users can quickly book a ride with a few taps, while Transeek will search for the nearest available tricycle using GPS (Global Positioning System).

In Pangasinan, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines also launched a premium service for tricycles, in partnership with AutoItalia Philippines, aiming to “fill in the gap for short-distance commutes.” (READ: LOOK: Grab launches premium tricycle service) Transeek aims to uplift A survey of 100 tricycle drivers in Butuan found their average income ranged from P400 to P500 a day. Transeek hopes to increase their income up to 300% by helping in decreasing delays and standby hours. The base fare for a maximum of 3 passengers per ride will be P30, with a service charge of P5. Drivers will get P25 for every ride from the system. “We have interviewed drivers during Tricycle Operators and Drivers’ Association (TODA) meetings and most of them liked Transeek since they don’t have to waste time roaming around to look for passengers,” said Cubillas. According to the app makers, drivers’ registration into Transeek’s system will be free. They will be required to comply with insurance requirements, however – something most of them fail to adhere to. (WATCH: [Right of Way] Why the PH doesn’t have enough mass transport options) In 2017, several bills such as senate Bill 1284 and House Bill 4334, sought to modernize the transport sector, though they remain pending.

Grab Philippines recently introduced their new leadership structure, with country head-turned-president Brian Cu still at the helm of the ride-hailing giant. Lawyer Nicka Hosaka, the newest public affairs manager, will be working with its head Leo Gonzales. Before joining Grab, Hosaka served as the chief of staff and legal counsel of PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe from April 2017 to May 2018. After her stint with the PCC, she became the legal counsel for e-commerce platform Shopee for about 6 months. Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March 2018 prompted the PCC to review the deal. It bound the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. Compliance monitoring is still ongoing, with the antitrust body imposing another P6.5-million fine on Grab for violating its commitments to the PCC. Conflict of interest?  Section 7 (b)(1) of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees does not allow government workers to: Own, control, manage or accept employment as officer, employee, consultant, counsel, broker, agent, trustee or nominee in any private enterprise regulated, supervised or licensed by their office unless expressly allowed by law The law states that it “shall continue for a period of one year after resignation, retirement, or separation of office.” In an interview with Rappler, Bernabe said Hosaka is “not covered” by the rule. There’s no conflict of interest, he said, with Hosaka being with Grab now. Bernabe explained that despite reviewing the Grab-Uber buyout, the PCC is neither regulating nor supervising Grab. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) Bernabe also added that the PCC did not give Grab the license to operate because that falls under the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. “The code of conduct is not applicable in this case. In terms of optics it might create, Nicka never worked on the Grab case. She was never part of the team that conducted the review,” Bernabe said. The commissioner also said that Hosaka had already left the PCC when the antitrust watchdog was reviewing Grab’s voluntary commitments. “Nicka is a very good lawyer and she was a very good staff member. We trust that she will not be involved in anything still pending with the PCC. That’s a commitment she made when she went to Shopee,” Bernabe told Rappler. No work overlap Bernabe expects Hosaka to be hands-off the Grab-Uber deal in terms of lending her legal expertise.  “That’s our expectation. Out of sense of propriety or delicadeza,” Bernabe. Hosaka, in an interview with Rappler, maintained that there is “no conflict whether legal or personal” with her new role in Grab. “In so far as the transaction was concerned, it was ongoing but it just started when I left. I wasn’t involved in the review team. I wasn’t even part of any discussions with the parties with Grab or Uber,” she said. When she first met with the ride-hailing giant, Hosaka said she had informed Bernabe of the role. She said the height of the Grab-Uber buyout issue was when she was at Shoppee. “Now, I am working with [Grab’s] public affairs team. With the PCC, I was acting as chief of staff and was doing some legal counsel work for Commissioner Bernabe. There’s no overlapping in terms of duties and obligations there,” she said. Hosaka assured that she will not be handling any PCC-related matter while she’s working with Grab. “Right now, while I’m with Grab, Im not handling any PCC matters, also because out of propriety. We don’t want to taint anything, even if I am not privy in terms of the Grab-Uber transaction itself,” she said. “Just for propriety and professionalism, I’m not handling any PCC matters,” she added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/222521-grab-philippines-prohibit-campaign-ad-car/","title":"Grab Philippines prohibits election campaign ads on cars","date":"Feb 2, 2019 1:31 PM PHT","snippet":"'We request the public to reach out to us for any sightings of these vehicles,' says Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Have you ever hopped on a Grab ride with political campaign advertisements plastered on it?

He said that Grab should be able to submit “correct, sufficient, consistent, and timely” data to be able to monitor pricing commitments. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe explained that the failure to submit the needed data “prevented the PCC and the 3rd party body’ from monitoring the pricing commitments.

The decision was issued Tuesday, January 22 but Grab received it on Wednesday, January 23. The PCC said Grab should submit the necessary data 5 days after receipt of the order which will be on Monday, January 28. The ride-hailing giant has until February 7 to file a motion for reconsideration on the fine. The PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines. It chose top UK audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor Grab’s compliance. In October 2018, the anti-trust body had fined both Grab and Uber a combined P16 million for causing “undue difficulties” in the review of the acquisition deal. ‘We will appeal’ Grab Philippines in a statement Friday afternoon, January 25, said it will file a motion for reconsideration on the penalty. The ride-hailing giant said that it was “working under very limited timelines” to meet PCC’s deadline on the required pricing data after the Uber buyout. “Three out of 4 penalties were set at a maximum amount of P2 million pesos each. Given the breakdown of the fines vis-a-vis the severity of the lapses alleged by the PCC, we would like to better understand PCC’s rationale for imposing a maximum penalty,” Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said.

The resolution was signed by Jardin, and panel members Carl Marbella, Nida Quibio, and Joel Bolano.  Under the Constitution, franchise for public utility should be granted to Filipinos who own at least 60% of its capital. Velox’s article of incorporation showed that it is 99.99% owned by its parent company Velox South-East Asia Holdings which is Singaporean.

Previously, DO 2015-011 under the Aquino administration – which allowed TNVS to operate – only “recognized” ride-hailing services as “new forms of transport services.” Uber at that time was mostly foreign-owned, registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission as a telecommunications service under “foreign stock.” In a statement, Go-Jek said they will continue to work with Philippine government agencies to improve the transportation situation in the country. “We continue to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines,” Go-Jek told Rappler.

Maybe it’s time to detoxify","body":" MANILA, Philippines – How do you feel about your life right now? Are you struggling to get through every day? Does it feel like work never stops? Or do you feel like you’re wasting away your life every time you’re trying to book a Grab or waiting in line to ride the van, bus, MRT? A lot of things can make you feel stressed especially if you’re living in the 10th most stressful city in the world. And when you’re stressed, you tend to make rash decisions like quitting your job, for example, or spending a month’s worth of salary on clothes and shoes. But it doesn’t have to lead to that. You don’t have to suddenly be jobless or penniless every time you feel stressed. It can be as simple as organizing your closet or bookshelf and start giving away those you don’t need or want anymore. Studies show that when your environment is clean, you tend to do and say the right things. So, cleaning and putting away excess things is an effective way to detoxify your life. Here’s how to start doing it: Computer desktop Are you the type of person who puts every file on the desktop so you don’t forget where it is? Then your screen is probably so full of these icons, you don’t really know where that important Powerpoint presentation is anymore. Try sorting them into folders with proper labels. Choose a nice wallpaper that you wouldn’t want those pesky files to cover. Better yet, take a few minutes to delete files you’re no longer using. Your desktop won’t only look cleaner, you’ll also get additional computer space. Facebook friends list Are you annoyed by the endless selfies that a friend keeps on posting? Or do you have friends whose opinions you don’t agree with? Seeing these on your newsfeed can add unnecessary stress to an otherwise good day. So, do yourself a favor and unfollow – if you think unfriending would be too rude – these people. That way, you won’t see their posts on your feed anymore but you can keep them in your friends list. You can always go to their profiles if you need to! Makeup kit When was the last time you checked up on the contents of your makeup kit? If you can’t remember anymore, now is the time to do it. These things have expiration dates that you should be aware of, too. Items like lipsticks and concealers can be kept for as long as over a year but mascaras and eyeliners should be thrown away after just three months. Make it a habit to check which items you need to dispose of every time you have to clean your brushes – that’s every week by the way, in case you haven’t washed yours for months. Bookshelf If you’re a booklover, then that means you never miss a book fair or sale. And your bookshelf is probably already bursting with new books. Make space for all the new ones you know you’re still buying by donating some of the books you didn’t really like or have no plans of reading again to book drives or to public schools. Helping others can give you an instant happiness boost.     Closet Does fixing your closet feel too burdensome to do? That probably means you have way too much clothes already. Maybe it’s time to let go of that sweater you haven’t worn in two years or that suede vest that’s gone out of fashion. You can either sell these clothes online and earn extra bucks or better yet, donate these to those who are in need. Once your closet is free from the clothes you don’t like anymore, it’ll be easier to find those that you do. Mind and body There’s another, more important thing that needs cleansing – your mind and body. You might have been feeding your mind and body with junk as well (remember that bag of chips and can of rootbeer you finished in one sitting last weekend?). Too much junk food affects not just our physical health but as well as our mental well-being. Take a break from potato chips and soft drinks. Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and drink lots of water. The simple act of drinking clean water like Wilkins Pure can help cleanse your body toxins away and boost your energy. So, the next time you feel like life is being too hard on you, don’t resort to making decisions you might regret later on. First, cleanse and detoxify. – Rappler.com Start detoxifying!

It doesn’t require a minimum order. The service is available in Metro Manila, and is currently being tested in Cebu City and Mandaue in Cebu. There are over 4,000 locally-based restaurants to choose from. Currently, the only available mode of payment is through cash. Grab’s mobile payment GrabPay will soon be integrated in its system. Philippines is the 6th country where Grab launched the service in the region, after Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. “We want their GrabFood experience to be more convenient and more rewarding. Food is such as basic necessity but is also very personal to every consumer,” said Cindy Toh, Grab Philippines marketing head. Digital economy With the new service, Southeast Asia’s unicorn said that they are “accelerating their ability to leverage the opportunities of a shared digital economy.” \n\n Grab said that consumers are now able to connect thousands of restaurants only with their smartphones, as merchants get additional income from the in-app orders. The firm also highlighted better earning opportunities for delivery partners. Grab said they can earn up to twice more than the average minimum national wage.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said on Monday, November 5, that the Euro-4 compliant tricycles aim to “fill in the gap for short-distance commute.”  “[GrabTrike] will fill in the short distance commute from the villages. The 3-wheeler would be able to service those areas in a much more efficient and budget-friendly manner,” Cu said. GrabTrike Premium is an upgrade from GrabTrike, which currently uses regular tricycles in Angeles, Pampanga, and in Balanga, Bataan. The firm will be fielding 2,000 Piaggio Ape units, a light commercial vehicle based on Vespa scooters. Since franchises for tricycles are under the supervision of local government units, Grab will be partnering with LGUs to roll out the service.  The Binalonan municipal government in Pangasinan is the first to adopt the premium tricycle service with 24 units. Cu said the fare scheme for GrabTrike Premium depends on the rates approved by the LGU, on top of a P10 booking fee which will go directly to the driver. For Binalonan, the local government approved a fare of P40 for the first two kilometers, and an additional P10 per succeeding kilometer. Modern transport More than being an “everyday app,” Grab aims for transportation modernization at its core, said Cu. The P185,000 Piaggio Ape can reach up to 38 kilometers on a liter of gas, which is Euro-4 compliant. Its transmission has reverse gear and has a maximum climb of 20.5% gradient – features a regular tricycle does not have. Because of the Piaggio Ape’s relatively low acquisition cost, Grab and AutoItalia offer easy ownership access with little to no equity to driver-operators. LGUs may also opt to partner with the ride-hailing firm to modernize their local tricycles. Grab said the package comes with a smartphone, preloaded with the app. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/announcements/215463-responsible-grab-commuting-tips/","title":"Always running into Grab-related commuting problems?","date":"Oct 29, 2018 3:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Here’s how you can ensure a smoother ride the next time you book","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Ever been on a Grab ride where your driver couldn’t find you? Do you double-check if you’ve placed the right pick-up pin as a response? This is the sharing economy at play. Like Grab drivers, Grab passengers play a part in what is called a shared economy. Shared economy, shared responsibilities A shared economy is defined as a peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services – usually owners rent out properties like their cars or houses that they don’t often use. #GrabResponsibly espouses the concept of shared economy. For Grab, the passangers, drivers and Grab itself each have their own responsibilities. To observe this, Grab drafted a manual of do’s and don’ts to guide both partner-drivers and passengers on the proper behavior and etiquette that will help ensure a smooth experience every Grab ride. We all have to deal with traffic and booking struggles, but doing your part can ensure a significantly smoother ride for you and other passengers. Here’s a few ways you can help lessen commuting woes, according to Grab’s manual of do’s and don’ts: When booking  ● Overloading is illegal. Go for the 6-seater option if there are more than 4 riders. ● No surprises — let the driver know if you’re bringing a furry friend. Bring your pets in a kennel or cage, and prepare for the worst-case scenario by having rags and poop bags ready. It’s still up to the driver, however, if they will allow you to ride with your pet or not. ● Refrain from cancelling – especially if it’s because of reasons like pinning the wrong pick-up dress. Did you know that if your cancelled bookings exceed the successful ones, your account may get suspended? While in transit  ● There’s a smoking ban, so don’t whip out cigarettes inside the car. ● All forms of sexual harassment towards drivers and passengers are punishable by law. Consensual acts such as flirting, PDA, and sexual intercourse are also strictly banned while inside the vehicle. ● Did you know that you can call 911 using the app? Click the sidebar, then choose the Emergency tab. You also have the option to add 3 emergency contacts, who can be set to receive auto-alerts from Grab. Upon dropping off  ● Remember to rate your driver. This will help Grab know how else they can improve the quality of your ride. Grab takes your feedback very seriously. ● Don’t ask the driver to go beyond the pinned drop-off point. For instance, avoid asking to be dropped off at the basement of the building instead of the lobby. ● Take your trash with you, and don’t forget to check all your stuff! After the trip ends, Grab and its drivers aren’t responsible for the items you leave behind. Remember, you don’t own the car you booked — you’re sharing it with other people. All you need to do is practice basic social etiquette!

The company's plan is for them to become emergency first responders and aid in busting crime, too.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab drivers are going the extra mile and may soon save lives in road accidents and help bust crime. The ride-hailing company launched its Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap on Monday, October 22, which features various programs, including a commitment to train drivers to be part of a pool of first responders. Drivers will be fully equipped with first aid kits and safety training guides. Grab also entered into a collaboration with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for crime and accident prevention. Grab, together with the PDEA and the LTFRB, will synchronize efforts to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs. The partnership also aims to identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations as well as keep the ride-hailing service drug-free. Grab will also conduct road safety, anti-carnapping, and other anti-criminal seminars and training with the PNP-HPG. “Safety in the TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry should be a collaborative effort between transport network companies, government agencies, driver-partners, and passengers. Our passengers and driver-partners deserve a safer ride-sharing industry,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. Analytics for safety The roadmap also features enhancements on Grab’s driver platform, which tracks driver fatigue for them to “learn their driving patterns” and “identify how to drive more safely.” The driver fatigue monitoring system gives drivers reports on their patterns, such as in speeding, acceleration, and braking. The firm said there has been a 50% reduction in speeding incidents and a 20% reduction in hard braking and sudden acceleration since it rolled out the feature. “Our goal is to bring to zero the number of incidents that are completely preventable, and as far as possible, reduce the number of road accidents. Key to achieving our goal is to make it easy for users to make an actual change to their road behavior habits,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling. Grab said its roadmap is aligned with the Department of Transportation’s vision to reduce the road accident death rate by at least 20% by 2020. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/214819-facial-recognition-advertising-admov/","title":"Tech start-up uses facial recognition for ‘meaningful’ ads","date":"Oct 21, 2018 4:28 PM PHT","snippet":"Tech start-up AdMov installs tablets in the backseats of cars of ride-hailing services.

For instance, people are bombarded along EDSA with too much information, at times irrelevant to them.  On the other hand, advertisers are unable to reach their intended audience due to saturation and visual fatigue. A start-up in the Philippines claims it may have found the solution, and says it’s a win for both advertisers and consumers: facial recognition. {source} <iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHLdIOip8yA” frameborder=”0″ allow=”autoplay; encrypted-media” allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source}   How it works Tech start-up AdMov installs tablets in the backseats of cars of ride-hailing services like Grab. The drivers apply for the installation and get incentives for every playback of advertisement on the tablet.  But the magic begins once a passenger hops on the car. The tablets use their cameras to scan the faces of passengers in the backseat. Using facial recognition technology, the tablets can estimate the gender, age, and even mood of the passenger. Using the information generated, the tablet then is able to curate the appropriate content and advertisements that are intended for the passenger.  “When we show ads, it gives data to advertisers as well. We use this for targeting and for brands. There is no wastage,” said Bobby Cristuta, co-founder of AdMov. The artificial intelligence (AI) software also takes into consideration the location of the vehicle. For instance, if one is in Pasig City, it shows a presentation that features a brief history of the area.  For advertising purposes, it also shows passengers recommended restaurants. If one is near malls or passing through EDSA, the tablet can also alert passengers if there are sales nearby. Ellard Capiral, founder and CEO of AdMov, said that they offer a “right mix” of advertising and “meaningful content” to keep the passengers glued on to the screen. “The program also tracks eyeballs. If you are no longer paying attention to the ad, we mix it up and offer content like trivia and that pulls the passenger’s attention back,” Capiral said. Security concerns Since the technology uses the camera and facial recognition, is there a privacy breach? Capiral and Cristuta claimed there is none, since it only scans and approximates the age, gender, and mood of passengers. “We do not store photos and videos, the camera is there just to scan. Advertisers only have access to estimates, but they won’t see your face,” Cristuta said. They also claimed that their legal team ensured that the technology does not breach the provisions of the data security act. (READ: Data privacy 101: What businesses should know about systems registration) AdMov’s tablets are currently installed in some 500 ride-sharing vehicles in the Philippines. They plan to expand to Singapore and Taiwan next year.  Trends and future applications Based on the data-driven advertising approach, AdMov is able to provide a “geekier” insight on consumer behavior. “We had a client that was able to tweak their advertisement to have more impact through the analytics,” Cristuta said.  They also found that the trivial and funny are a big hit for consumers. “We also screen the ads and content. If we feel the ad does not fit in our lineup of content, we outright reject and do not include it since we want the attention of passengers. If it does not catch attention, it hurts our other advertisers as well,” Capiral said. The company says they see the future of their technology for news applications as well. “If a passenger passes through an area and there is a major accident or fire there, they can be alerted. But we need more partners for that type of content,” Cristuta said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/214502-philippine-competition-commission-fines-grab-philippines-over-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust watchdog fines Grab P16 million over Uber deal","date":"Oct 17, 2018 11:08 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Philippine Competition Commission slaps Grab with a fine of P12 million and Uber with P4 million for causing 'undue difficulties' to the review of their deal","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the country’s antitrust watchdog, imposed P16-million ($296,741) worth of penalties on ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines for failing to maintain operations before it acquired Uber. When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the PCC warned of a “virtual monopoly” of the industry. The commission launched its own review of the acquisition deal between the two companies, which led to PCC imposing interim measures. Following the review, the PCC slapped Grab with a fine of P12 million ($222,586) and Uber with P4 million ($74,195) for causing “undue difficulties” to the review. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) “While we’re reviewing [the deal], you revert first to your pre-merger situation. Why? Two things: Don’t prejudice our ability to impose remedies. It also prejudiced our ability to make an assessment of the situation,” PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo said. “If you want to exit the market, you can sell of course. But don’t do it right away. In this situation, when Grab purchased Uber, Uber already exited. We would have a more difficult time imposing the possible solution. That’s why we said come back first,” Quimbo added. On April, the PCC released interim measures while they were reviewing the Grab-Uber deal. Quimbo said that the ride-hailing companies violated two measures, for a total of 10 counts. Under the law, PCC can impose penalties of, at most, P2 million ($37,097) per violation, which led to the P16-million total. The PCC left it to both firms on how they will settle the penalty. The order, which was sent to Grab on October 11, can still be appealed. The ride-hailing firm must submit a motion for reconsideration 15 days since receipt.

We will continue to provide additional information as it becomes available,” Gonzales said. In August, the PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines.

These are part of the integrated transport system project of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) in Boracay. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said the vehicles are compliant with the specifications under the public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program. (IN PHOTOS: How new jeepneys, buses, tricycles could look like) The more environment-friendly options, he said, would “protect and sustain” the beauty of the famed island by reducing the carbon footprint from transportation. Hop-on, hop-off Come October 26, Boracay residents and visitors will be able to ride a hop-on, hop-off bus for free until the end of the year. The DOTr has worked with ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines to bring in 50 modern vehicles that would offer the services. On Monday, Grab initially provided 4 buses as part of its P100-million investment for transportation in the island.  By January 2019, Tugade said passengers would be using either a card or a wristband to pay their fare, under an integrated fare collection system similar to Beep which is used for Metro Manila railways. The fare is P300 per person, which will be good for 3 days with unlimited rides. Tugade said rides for minors below 12 years old, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be free. The vehicles are equipped with Wi-Fi, a closed-circuit television camera (CCTV), and a global positioning system (GPS). Tugade said having a single operator in the island would help regulate traffic. The buses will only be allowed to stop at certain waiting sheds. The DOTr will also work with Grab to construct at least 20 sheds.   Solar-powered shuttle Tourists also have another option – Southwest Travel & Tours will be shuttling passengers through solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles do not have air-conditioning.  E-trikes Another ride-hailing firm, Hirna, will also offer transport services within the island. Unlike Grab which is providing the vehicles, Hirna will function as a fleet manager for hailing electric tricycles (e-trikes) – much like how it functions now for booking taxis. The Department of Energy will donate 200 e-trikes to the Malay local government, under an Asian Development Bank-funded project which costs P1.73 billion.  Tugade said drivers for the e-trikes will be hired to provide jobs to those affected by Boracay’s closure. These e-trikes will operate in addition to the nearly 600 e-trikes currently in the island. Starting last August, the local government had already shifted to e-trikes. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/214370-grab-exercise-recipe-videos-idooh-active8me/","title":"Exercise, recipe videos coming to a Grab ride near you","date":"Oct 15, 2018 5:00 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Soon, Grab riders will be able to watch people in motion and yummy dishes while enduring the traffic","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Exercise videos and recipe videos are coming soon to Grab rides in the Philippines.  Singapore-based out-of-home advertising firm IDOOH International and fitness-oriented tech company Active8me have partnered to show instructional fitness videos and recipe videos on Grab rides.

MANILA, Philippines – Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go-Jek is poised to expand its services in Southeast Asia, bringing its rivalry with Grab to the Philippines. Go-Jek started in Indonesia in 2010 as a call center for on-demand “ojek” or motorcycle taxi service. Two years after it launched its ride-hailing app, it became a unicorn in the industry. Currently valued at about $5 billion, Go-Jek functions as a “superapp,” offering services ranging from rides, logistics, and bills payment, among others. Operating in 66 cities in Indonesia, it is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent, and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek. Go-Jek seeks to expand to Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines by yearend as part of its $500-million overseas expansion. Go-Jek opened shop in Vietnam in August, capturing 35% of the market in just 6 weeks. In the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia, Grab remains the dominant player for ride-hailing services, after Uber exited the region.  There are 7 other ride-hailing firms in the Philippines – Hype, Owto, Hirna, MiCab, Go Lag, ePickMeUp, and U-Hop – poised to challenge Grab but have been struggling to do so. The entry of the new players was seen as an opportunity to break Grab’s dominance in the country. Does Go-Jek stand a chance in the Philippine market? Applications in limbo? As early as May, Go-Jek expressed interest to enter the Philippines and met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada expressed concerns then, saying that the entry of a foreign firm “would displace” the new local transport network companies (TNCs). Go-Jek plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis around Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao. The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-016 on August 9, freezing accreditation applications for new TNCs. It said it issued the order so it can focus on the pending applications and to monitor existing players. As of the MC’s publication, there were 5 firms listed vying for accreditation. Go-Jek was not on the list. “All applicants with applications for TNC accreditation pending before the pre-accreditation committee are hereby directed to submit their complete and compliant requirements within 10 days of receipt or on August 5, whichever is later, otherwise their applications shall be denied by the committee,” the order said. The order was effective August 29. {source}<iframe class=”scribd_iframe_embed” title=”LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2018-016″ src=”https://www.scribd.com/embeds/389914607/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-rCmHfY18iidmGdeqDmcv&show_recommendations=true” data-auto-height=”false” data-aspect-ratio=”0.706342991386061″ scrolling=”no” id=”doc_97777″ width=”100%” height=”600″ frameborder=”0″></iframe>{/source} In previous messages to the media, the LTFRB said that Go-Jek’s application was “on hold,” as it passed its accreditation papers on August 13 – days after the memorandum circular was issued. Rappler clarified this with LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, noting that Go-Jek’s submission date was before the MC’s effectivity date. Delgra said that Go-Jek “did not apply” but Velox Technology Philippines did, along with two other firms. Velox is the local subsidiary of Go-Jek. “The memorandum circular sets a deadline as to when they can file their accreditation requirements. They were able to make the cut. It is Velox applying,” Delgra told Rappler in a phone interview.  The regulatory board chief said the fate of the applications rests on the pre-accreditation committee. There are 4 firms awaiting evaluation of the committee while one has a pending resolution on its application. “The deliberations are ongoing. They are set to deliberate the first 4. The remaining 3 will be deliberated hopefully starting next year,” Delgra said. More competition Some local TNCs have expressed some reservation over the possible entry of another multibillion-dollar company in the Philippine ride-hailing market. But Go-Jek believes that competition drives other firms to give better services to its customers. “Go-Jek does not believe in a winner-takes-all approach to ride-hailing. That enough space exists for many different approaches and ideas from companies both large and small,” Go-Jek said in a statement sent to Rappler. “Smaller companies have more of a chance to succeed, learn, and grow in a competitive market, than a market with a single player controlling most of the market,” it added. Go-Jek was awaiting for the LTFRB’s green light “before anything else,” such as hiring employees for its local operations. “Go-Jek is ready and waiting to provide the Philippines with a new mobility solution as soon as we are given the go-ahead,” it said. Economist JC Punongbayan said that Go-Jek’s entry would be healthy for the market, given that new players have yet to make a difference in the market. “We should actually embrace Go-Jek’s entry as a way for our local competitors to innovate. It has been a major player in Indonesia for quite some time. It could bring its expertise in technology and inform policies,” Punongbayan said. He added that another big player would hopefully help bring down the average prices of ride-hailing services, as the firms would compete for riders. On the part of the consumers, Laban Konsyumer Incorporated president Vic Dimagiba said that the best way is still to open up the market. “If you really want the consumer to have better choices, then open up the market with those as good as Grab. But of course, we don’t know yet what will happen to the smaller companies,” Dimagiba, a former trade undersecretary, told Rappler. Bring in what works Was the LTFRB right in freezing the accreditation application of TNCs? The antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission would agree on some points. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo acknowledged Grab’s dominance over the 7 other local firms. Asked if another big player poses a threat to the smaller players, Quimbo said, “There’s no one to threaten.” “It’s all speculative. At this point, who’s going to be threatened? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,” she said. But Quimbo pointed that the test of viability in the market is important, and that might mean looking for other options outside the country. “We want entry plus viability. [But] what’s the test for viability? In the history of the Philippines, we’ve only had two viable ones. If you want to look for an alternative that is also viable, we have no choice but to look outside of the country,” Quimbo said. In August, the PCC approved Grab’s acquisition of Uber, but has bound the former to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. The antitrust body may release Grab from the commitments if there is already “sufficient competition in the market.” Quimbo said, however, that the PCC can still hold Grab accountable “if they abuse their dominance” after the commitment period. The LTFRB said that Go-Jek’s application may be reviewed in 2019.  This would mean more time for the consumers to wait for another option on the same scale as Grab. As the new TNCs continue to adjust to the challenges of the ride-hailing market, until when will Filipinos wait for a viable option? – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/213523-where-are-the-new-ride-hailing-companies-philippines/","title":"Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?","date":"Oct 6, 2018 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Almost 6 months have passed but the new firms have yet to make a dent in the ride-hailing market","body":"AT A GLANCE  Part 1 of 2 MANILA, Philippines – Users of ride-hailing services were promised new options after Uber exited the Philippines. Almost half a year has passed but the firms have yet to make a difference in the market. When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the country’s anti-trust agency, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), warned of a “virtual monopoly” of the industry. Grab Philippines offers ride-hailing services for sedans, taxis, 6-seater vehicles, and premium cars. It also introduced ride-sharing in the market. In a bid to “break the monopoly,” the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 6 new transport network companies (TNCs) – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto and GoLag in April; and ePickMeUp in June. They were set to challenge Grab’s dominance in the ride-hailing industry, as drivers, too, had more choices on companies to link up with. But the companies are faced with problems that keep them from making a difference in the market, ranging from capital investments to recruiting drivers and getting riders. Where are they now?  Taxi apps ‘are okay’ In the case of taxis, the LTFRB recently recalibrated meters to implement the fare hike that would include a P2-per-minute travel charge. The flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer.  The LTFRB also now requires operators to have a mobile application from an accredited TNC. It leaves them to choose from taxi-only firms Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated and MiCab Systems Corporation, or those with mixed services such as Grab or Hype Transport Systems. In separate interviews with Rappler, executives of MiCab and Hirna said that they have been faring well since they were accredited in May. For one, both firms do not charge booking fees, which they think should attract riders as they would only have to pay for the amount on the taxi meter. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Coco Mauricio, Hirna’s founder and managing partner, said the LTFRB should review the cap on the franchises given to taxis as public utility vehicles. “We’re doing okay. But it can be better if more taxis would be joining us; if the cap for the taxis are increased,” said Mauricio. MiCab, for its part, currently has 7,000 registered taxi drivers and operators in some key urban areas such as Metro Manila, Baguio, Cebu, and Iloilo. Hirna has some 6,500 partners operating in Davao City, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Bohol, Bacolod, and Iloilo. But MiCab acknowledged the fierce competition, especially with the taxi services being offered by Grab under GrabTaxi. “Competition is fierce, especially with global multinational companies and very rich companies in the Philippines. There’s Hype, and Grab is a multibillion-dollar company,” Kris Montebon, MiCab’s head of operations, told Rappler. In July, MiCab accused Grab of “phantom bookings” on their platform, and of  creating fake accounts to sabotage MiCab operations. MiCab accused the company of  attempting to poach its drivers too. Montebon said that MiCab’s key advantage is its particular focus on the taxi industry. In a way, he said, it is “improving its service quality,” as there has always been a negative commuter perception of taxis. There are an estimated 42,000 taxi operators nationwide but the figure has never been adjusted for the longest time. When the LTFRB suspended Uber for a month in 2017, it said it was studying a proposal to increase the cap on taxis in Metro Manila. Competing with the giant Other ride-hailing firms competing head-on with Grab for riders and drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) face more challenges. Despite having thousands of drivers registered on their platforms, Hype and Owto are having a hard time keeping their drivers online because of incentive schemes “not at par with Grab.” On top of financial constraints, both firms still experience minor glitches on their apps. Hype chief operating officer Jen Silan told Rappler that only 30% of their 10,000 to 15,000 bookings per hour are being served. Hype has 13,000 taxi and TNVS drivers combined. “Bookings served are still quite low. Honestly, not all the 13,000 drivers are going online so we were not able to serve a big percentage of the total bookings yet. Of course, there is still the perception among the riders that if there are no drivers in your area, then it would be hard to book,” Silan said. She also noted that competing with Grab is a challenge in terms of capital investments. Hype’s commission per ride is set from 5% to 15%. (READ: [OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters) “It’s really a challenge, especially if Grab is giving incentives that are not sustainable for the company (Hype). We’re not into that kind of competition. What we are offering to our drivers is permanent commission,” she said. Owto chief executive officer Joel Gayod said that the company also suffers from lack of drivers, making it unable to cater to its 86,000 booking requests daily.  Gayod complained that the “playing field is not fair” due to the “predatory practices” of Grab. “We’re facing a lot of challenges mostly because of the predatory practices of Grab. We can come up with an incentive scheme but what they do is practically giving away top-up that we cannot match. This kind of practice will kill us, the new TNCs,” Gayod said. While Grab takes up to 20% of the driver’s earnings, the ride-hailing giant gives a considerable payout through incentives to its TNVS partners, which Hype and Owto cannot match. “The LTFRB should always protect the new players. There should be some safeguards against these practices. Or else, we will die sooner or later and Grab will remain as a monopoly,” Gayod said. Some still adjusting Go Laguna (Go Lag) is the sole ride-hailing service offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by  TNVS drivers because of the distance. But it has yet to be fully operational, partly because of backend payment schemes being sorted out by the company, said Go Lag operations director Willie Bercasio. Bercasio told Rappler that there are currently 700 drivers that have signed up with them and there are around 150 on board. But Go Lag has been fielding only 50 rides per day in Laguna to avoid losing money. “We are still beta testing. If we take on more rides, we would start losing money because we also pay for our infrastructure like the bandwidth system,” Bercasio explained. He disclosed that they haven’t earned from the business yet, as they have not asked for service fees from the drivers so far. Meanwhile, ePickMeUp, the latest addition to the accredited firms, has yet to be launched. It used to be a logistics firm but it decided to venture into the ride-hailing industry. Viable competition The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2018-016 suspending applications for accreditation of new ride-hailing firms effective August 29. The LTFRB said it issued the order so it can focus on pending applications and to monitor existing ones.  This means that there are only 8 apps to choose from, including U-Hop, until the regulatory board accredits a new firm. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo pointed out that it’s not so much about the number of apps available for consumers, rather the viability of such firm to enter the market. “On paper, they are there. But have they made a dent in the market? We know that they haven’t, right? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,” Quimbo told Rappler in an interview. There were some 65,000 active drivers on Grab’s and Uber’s platforms, merged in a masterlist submitted to the LTFRB earlier this year. When Uber left, Grab mostly answers to the full demand despite the “undersupply” of drivers because not all drivers moved to its platform. Grab said that it only has 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day. To maximize the available number of franchises currently open, the LTFRB allowed 10,000 new drivers to apply as TNVS drivers. Quimbo acknowledged that current local players challenging Grab face a difficult task. She said the ride-hailing industry is a two-sided market – both drivers and riders should be satisfied enough to grow. “[They] need to attract the drivers and the riders. That in itself is a heavy capital requirement. The cash flow requirements are big if it comes to giving out incentives to both sides of the market. That’s the challenge,” she said. Grab has recently pulled in $2 billion worth of investments that brings its total funding to $6 billion – $1 billion of which is from Japanese car giant Toyota. The Financial Times reported the firm is looking at an $11-billion valuation.

Grab is among the 11 non-banks with EMI license so far. “With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps,” said Ooi Huey Tyng, managing director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines.

Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber’s ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.” In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly. Malaysian authorities are also examining the deal. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/211230-ride-hailing-companies-can-now-charge-2-pesos-per-minute-every-ride/","title":"LTFRB allows all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min of travel","date":"Sep 5, 2018 5:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines, among other ride-hailing companies, can once again charge P2 per minute of travel, 15 days after the publication of Memorandum Circular 2018-019 on September 5","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The  Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has allowed all ride-hailing companies  to charge P2 per minute of travel.   Memorandum Circular 2018-019 takes effect 15 days after its publication on Wednesday, September 5.

Grab has 15 days to file their appeal since they received the order on Tuesday, September 4. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

And we just did the right thing and we’re just defending our right,” he said.

But Grab has sinced appealed to the LTFRB to lift the suspension of the charge, saying that drivers have suffered through low earnings in the past 4 months. “The lifting of the suspension of the P2-per-minute fare component will make our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) partners see a path towards more sustainable income and will help end the wait for passengers who deserve a ride when and where it is needed,” Gonzales said. “We respectfully ask the Board to immediately restore the P2 per minute time component, so that TNVS partners who went offline will be encouraged to go back and help address the TNVS supply crisis,” he added. Under the government-approved scheme issued in December 2016, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The ride-hailing app implemented the P2-per-minute travel duration charge on June 5, 2017, prior to the issuance of a DOTr order which allowed LTFRB to regulate fares by transportation network companies.  The DOTr on June 11 issued an order giving LTFRB the full authority over fare regulation of ride-hailing companies. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/211133-ltrfrb-approves-grab-petition-riders-reimbursement-per-minute-charge/","title":"LTFRB OKs Grab’s petition: Riders will not be reimbursed of P2/min charge","date":"Sep 4, 2018 5:09 PM PHT","snippet":"But the P10-million fine against Grab still stands","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Riders of ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines will no longer be reimbursed of the P2-per-minute travel charges from their previous trips.

In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. “What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares… but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,” Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab’s pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is “sufficient competition” in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. “The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it’s providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,” Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB’s franchise cap at 65,000 units. “To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of ‘maximum supply’ – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,” Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as “demand exceeds supply.” To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/209258-philippine-competition-commission-pricing-service-grab-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust body OKs Grab-Uber deal, sets conditions","date":"Aug 10, 2018 1:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Any breach of the fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments set by the Philippine Competition Commission will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has bound ride-hailing company Grab Philippines to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments for acquiring Uber.

Around half of the funds came from Japanese car giant Toyota, which announced last month it was pumping $1 billion into Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-share company. Grab said a “significant portion” of the proceeds would go to developing operations in Indonesia, where it has partnered with local firm Ovo to offer what it said was the country’s most widely accepted mobile payments system. The announcement comes after Grab’s regional rival, Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, said in May it was investing $500 million to expand into Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.

Under the new fare scheme, the flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer, higher than the previous P3.50 for every 300 meters or around P11 per kilometer. On top of that, taxi operators can now charge a travel duration rate of P2 per minute, to replace the waiting time charge of P3.50 for every two minutes. The LTFRB started the recalibration of taxi meters on Tuesday, July 31, at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Parañaque City. There are about 21,000 taxi units in Metro Manila. Only taxis with recalibrated meters can charge higher fares. A taxi meter calibration certification sticker will be placed on the top right corner of the windshield to show that the driver can apply the new fare scheme. Recalibration comes with a fee of P1,110, which covers the sealing of meters, testing, and administrative matters. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III Delgra warned drivers and operators against charging higher rates without the authoritzation sticker. Violators would be liable for “overcharging,” and a fine of P3,000 on the first offense, he said. Delgra explained that the P2-per-minute travel charge was added to cover time spent in traffic.

Grab allegedly created fake accounts on Micab to hit them with a “firestorm of phantom bookings” that sabotaged their operations and attempted to poach their drivers. “Drivers waste time and money going to a pick-up location for passengers that will never come, and they ultimately become wary about accepting trips.” In a BusinessWorld report, Ybañez said the number of “phantom bookings” has reportedly reached 29,000 since June.

The IP addresses of the fake accounts reportedly traced back to Grab. Apart from the similarities to the Ryde incident, Ybanez said he knows his local rival is behind the attacks because drivers on his platform are being called to join Grab. “After booking one of our cabs, then waiting as usual before canceling, our drivers will receive a call a few minutes later inviting them to a driver’s orientation for Grab” “If this occurred one or two times, you could easily dismiss it to coincidence — perhaps Grab obtained the driver’s number through some under means — but it’s happened several thousand times,” he added.

Nograles demanded that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in supposed overcharged fares in 5 months alone. The lawmaker’s allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing and the suspension of the charge. Grab said that the additional charge was “legal” and that LTFRB knew about it.

In a press briefing on Thursday, July 5, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said they have lowered commissions from rides driven by top drivers, to help augment driver incomes. “In terms of how much we’ve lost, it’s hard to say, we haven’t quantified it. But what we’ve seen is a drop in driver income of around 5-10%, which we came back with by lowering our commissions for the top-tier drivers, working that up to our subsidy, ‘yung mga luging biyahe.

Grab earlier said that they will be providing subsidies to drivers, especially to trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour, which is the ideal amount a driver should earn. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspended Grab’s P2-per-minute travel charge last April 18, after a hearing on PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accusation that Grab illegally charged its customers. Cu also stated that the LTFRB will standardize the pricing policy of transport network companies (TNCs) this month. Ride-hailing companies met with the LTFRB on Thursday morning for the policy. According to Leo Gonzales, Grab Public Affairs Manager, all TNCs will be placed under a certain range of fares under this standardized pricing policy. “We don’t know yet exactly how [the standardized fare structure] will affect our [fare hike] petition, but the petition as of now is still pending with the board,” Gonzales said.

Singapore-based Grab in March agreed to buy Uber’s food and ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing companies. But Singapore’s competition commission found that the deal created a virtual monopoly in the city-state’s ride-hailing market, with Grab raising prices after the merger was completed, it said in a statement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticised both companies for going ahead with the “irreversible” deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway. “CCCS’s investigations also revealed that the parties had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties,” the statement said. The Singapore commission asked Grab to revert to pre-merger pricing and end its exclusive contracts with drivers so other players will find it easier to enter the market. It also suggested a series of potential “remedies” to ensure fair competition and called for a public consultation on the proposed measures. “CCCS may require the Parties to unwind the transaction unless the… public consultation confirms that any of the proposed remedies… are sufficient to address the identified competition concerns”, it warned. The deal has come under scrutiny across the region, with Malaysia and the Philippines also launching investigations. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, California-headquartered Uber received a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Grab said in a statement that it disagrees with the commission’s findings, calling it a “narrow approach in defining competition”. “This provisional decision and proposed remedies are overreaching and go against Singapore’s pro-innovation and pro-business regulations in a free market economy,” it said, adding that it will appeal the decision.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/205888-grabfood-philippines-soft-launch/","title":"GrabFood now on soft launch in the Philippines","date":"Jun 27, 2018 3:07 PM PHT","snippet":"The service's delivery fee is P49, with no minimum order","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Users of ride-hailing service Grab can now have food delivered to them as the company puts their food delivery service, GrabFood on soft launch this week. The service initially launched in the company’s home country, Singapore, in late May, where it also announced future availability in other Southeast Asian territories – Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines. The app takes the place of Uber Eats, the food delivery service of former regional rival Uber, which it acquired in March of this year.  In the Philippines, GrabFood will compete with the likes of Germany-headquartered Foodpanda and Honestbee, also from Singapore.  For its soft launch, GrabFood says they will be delivering to areas in BGC, Makati, Ortigas, San Juan, and West Quezon City, with plans to expand to more areas in the future. Operating hours for the service are from 11 am to 9 pm except holidays. Payments are currently cash only.  The service automatically makes suggestions for nearby restaurant partners from which to choose. Opening the service, the app showed a healthy selection of restaurants within a 2-kilometer radius, and a delivery rate of P49 with no minimum order. Grab says on their website that to “keep your food fresh and ensure speedy deliveries, we limit the available restaurants to those within a given distance from your location.” Upon selection of “Food” in the Grab’s dropdown menu, the app will let you know if the service is available in your area or not.  GrabFood follows the introduction of GrabAssistant, their service for miscellaneous errands. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/205653-grab-driver-cancellations-decline-brian-cu/","title":"Brian Cu: Grab driver cancellations down by 50%","date":"Jun 24, 2018 6:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu says they have addressed the 'root causes' of unwanted driver behavior","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Driver cancellations in ride-hailing app Grab declined by 50% after the company addressed “root causes” of the behavior, country head Brian Cu said on Friday, June 22, during the sidelines of the 2018 Techtonic Summit. Cu said they “targeted aspects” of their service where they had to improve, through their 100-day campaign. “We have changed some policies, upgraded our tech, as well as spending. As you may have noticed, the complaints in social media already declined,” he added. According to Cu, lesser income drove the unwanted behavior. Grab assured drivers that they will continue to receive subsidies “as long as they need money.” On June 19, the company announced that it has started to provide subsidy for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the P2 per-minute travel charge.  Grab said the subsidy scheme would cost around P100 million a month. Meanwhile, the company has branched out to food and grocery delivery services.  Cu said there is “great potential in the Philippine market” to launch Grab Assistant and Grab Food. Grab Assistant, which can be accessed through the same ride-hailing app, allows customers to request for drivers to buy anything they want up to P1,000 and have it delivered to their doorstep. The feature is available in Metro Manila, but is more reliable in certain areas such as Ortigas, Bonifacio Global City, and Makati City. As for Grab Food, it allows customers to order from select restaurants nearby.

Grab said it began a fare subsidy scheme last Monday, June 18, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab said its drivers should ideally be earning at least P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. “Based on our computations, a TNVS (transport network vehicle service) driver needs to make at least P330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. “Since [the] P2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in.” The subsidy will be provided to drivers for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. Grab gave this example to illustrate how the subsidy would work: “If a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance, and fare is computed at P120 only, Grab will return to the driver the P210 difference to make sure he made P330 for that one-hour trip.” The ride-hailing company reiterated on Tuesday that there continues to be a vehicle shortage on its platform, with only 33,000 cars available for 600,000 to 800,000 passenger bookings a day. “With guaranteed earnings, we hope that this subsidy will also urge our partners to be more confident that they will make money for any trip they get and continue providing quality service to the riding public,” Cu said. He added that the subsidy is different from incentives which are “only a bonus for drivers who hit a certain number of rides.” The subsidy will be in place, according to Cu, “as long as it’s needed” and the company still has funds for it. Grab has been criticized for alleged overcharging and “deteriorating” service, after it acquired Uber last March. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), which is reviewing the Grab-Uber deal, said that Grab has taken control of 93% of the local ride-hailing market, leaving commuters on the losing end. The LTFRB has since accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies, but the PCC does not expect these firms to challenge Grab’s dominance anytime soon “because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base.” Grab maintains that it does not charge illegal fares, but launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience” in response to complaints of poor service. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/204800-toyota-investment-ride-hailing-company-grab-asia/","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in Grab","date":"Jun 13, 2018 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The Japanese automaker plans to expand beyond its core business into the 'mobility' sector","body":" TOKYO, Japan (UPDATED) – Toyota said Wednesday, June 13, it was investing $1 billion in Asia ride-share company Grab, as the Japanese automaker looks to expand beyond its core business into the “mobility” sector. Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber’s regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal “is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data” stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab’s board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the “partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.” The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls “profound change” in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a “once-in-a-century challenge.” “I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,” he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing “various services involving movement of people around the world.” Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year. The deal has run into trouble though, with Singapore saying in April that it would impose restrictions on the acquisition until it concludes a probe into whether the sale may have infringed competition rules.

The unnumbered department order (DO) subjects transport network companies (TNCs) and operators of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to the “full regulation and supervision” of the LTFRB. Under the order, which took effect immediately, the LTFRB was given the authority to issue or suspend franchises, set fares, determine operating conditions, and impose fines. The previous DO 2017-11 and DO 2015-11 only gave the LTFRB oversight functions over fare setting. DO 2017-11 stated that there would be a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB,” while DO 2015-11 gave TNCs the right to “set fares, subject to LTFRB’s oversight.” These provisions of the DO were in question when ride-hailing company Grab Philippines changed its fare scheme on its own. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Now, under the newly-signed DO, the LTFRB will determine the fare scheme of ride-hailing companies through “public hearings or consultations.” “The fare for the TNVS shall be determined by the LTFRB, after public hearing or in consultation with the TNCs and TNVS,” the DO states. It also reminds ride-hailing companies and operators to comply with all laws, particularly the law governing common carriers. “Any violation or non-compliance by TNCs and TNVS are grounds for imposition of fines, suspension, and cancellation of accreditation, subject to notice and hearing,” states the DO. Grab to ‘comply’ In response, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said that they have yet to receive a copy of the order, but that they will comply “as always.” Cu added that the DO “strengthens” Grab’s position that the P2-per-minute travel charge it added on its own is “legal.” “Since DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr and the LTFRB,” he said. While Grab believes the DO “strengthens” the legality of its P2-per-minute travel charge, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles thinks otherwise. “It is very clear that TNCs cannot set their own fares like all other land transport systems…. I hope that this is clear to all TNCs that the law should be followed,” Nograles said. For Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, the new order “will benefit” both the companies and the customers. “Kaya mahalaga na may regulasyon, para nababantayan at nasisiguro natin na walang naaagrabyado…. Siyempre, gusto natin patas ang playing field at patas ang kompetisyon,” Tugade said. (That’s why regulation is important, so we can monitor and make sure that no one is taken advantage of…. Of course, we want a level playing field and fair competition.) LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the Board has been engaging with ride-hailing companies more often than other public utility vehicles. “It is because we see their value, and because we believe that if done right, they will make a big difference and our commuters will ultimately benefit,” Delgra said. The DO is the department’s latest attempt in a bid to regulate ride-hailing firms. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?)

In a statement on Thursday, June 7, Nograles said the ride-hailing company subjects its partner-drivers to unfair profit sharing mechanisms and “humanly impossible” quotas for incentives. “With no financial and health risk, Grab is making a lot money, while the drivers who are working in slave-like conditions are left without any protection. To me, this is immoral and this is utterly wrong. This has to stop now and put Grab to the place where it really belongs,” Nograles said. Grab drivers who attended a consultation meeting with Nograles revealed that their take-home pay is only about P655 per day after working a minimum of 18 hours, the lawmaker said. The average commission of Grab per day amounts to P600, he added. Nograles had accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker said he would support the petition to implement fare changes if Grab Philippines foregoes of the 20% commission they charge from drivers, and to only take the P40 base fare per ride. “I will definitely back up the driver’s petition to implement the fair charges, on the condition that Grab Philippines forego any commission from this charge,” Nograles said. Reimpose P2 per minute In a statement late Thursday, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said: “No one among Grab parters is being forced to drive long hours. If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less.” Cu then again raised Grab Philippines’ appeal with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to reimpose the suspended P2-per-minute travel charge. “[I]n the spirit of fairness, we also urge him to enjoin all TNCs (transport network companies), which all have LTFRB-approved per-minute fare component in their fare structures, to forego their commissions, as he suggests,” Cu said. Grab earlier said the suspension of the charge led to fewer drivers, with only 35,000 drivers available for over 600,000 bookings a day. Cu said Nograles’ earlier accusation of illegal charges caused the drivers’ income to “drop drastically.” “Nograles actually caused drivers’ income to drop drastically when he questioned the legality of the P2 per minute fare component…. Without the P2, many drivers stopped driving, making commuting more difficult for the riding public,” Cu said. “Throughout the past months, he certainly has not been a constructive force in helping both drivers and the riding public,” he added. This is the latest move by the lawmaker in a bid to regulate Grab Philippines. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April.

The House committee on Metro Manila development met with representatives from the DOTr, local government units, motorcycle groups, and other government agencies on Wednesday. Quezon City 2nd District Representative Winston Castelo, the chairman of the committee, urged the DOTr to amend the department order (DO) on transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to include motorcycles. “We need to help ease the burden of Filipino commuters as soon as possible. This is why we need to allow motorcycles for hire to operate because they help in ferrying people,” Castelo said. Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code mandates that motorcycles can only be registered as private vehicles or as government vehicles, not vehicles for hire. But Castelo argued that the DO allowed private vehicles under the new TNVS category to provide ride-hailing services to commuters. “The same can be done for motorcycles,” he said. In response, Transportation Assistant Secretary Arnulfo Fabillar said the department would come up with guidelines before the end of June. ‘Beating traffic’ For advocacy groups, allowing motorcycles to be part of the ride-hailing market would help alleviate the dire traffic situation in the country. “[M]akakatulong itong maibsan ang hirap na nararanasan ng ating mga mananakay at mabibigyan rin ng pagkakataong magkaroon ng disenteng hanapbuhay ang ating mga kababayan,” said George Royeca, co-convenor of Transport Watch. (This would help ease the suffering of the riding public and would give our fellow Filipinos a decent livelihood.) Royeca also noted that legalizing motorcycles for hire would help regulate the illegal operations of habal-habals. A recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey commissioned by Transport Watch showed that one in every 3 Filipino households owns a motorcycle. Half use it for livelihood. Road safety The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and advocates had earlier raised concerns over the safety of motorcycles. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride) According to government data, 24,000 crashes in Metro Manila involved motorcycles in 2017, killing 247 people and injuring 12,182. Of the dead, 178 were drivers of motorcycles, 37 were passengers, while 32 were pedestrians. (IN CHARTS: How deadly are Metro Manila roads?) But Jobert Bolaños, spokesperson for motorcycle riders’ group Riders of the Philippines, said ride-hailing platforms such as Angkas provide training for drivers. “Before you can even join the app-based motorcycle TNVS, you have to undergo a rigid screening process and then get strict training. This is meant to ensure that the riders are the safest possible motorcycle riders on the road,” he said. Bolaños added that grievance mechanisms also prevent motorcycle riders from committing abusive behavior. For Angkas head of operations David Medrana, it’s “about time” that the transportation department come up with policies addressing the needs of commuters. “Angkas is willing to lend our understanding of the transport situation to the committee and the DOTr so we may come up with fair and non-discriminatory laws that will help provide transport services that Filipinos need to address the demand of the times,” Medrana said. In November 2017, the LTFRB ordered Angkas to stop operations, saying that it’s up to Congress to legalize ride-hailing services offered by motorcycles. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) The LTFRB also suspended the motorcycle ride-hailing services of Grab in 2016. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/203765-daily-news-highlights-may-31-2018-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, May 31, 2018","date":"May 31, 2018 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

The SOC is part of the PCC’s ongoing review of the deal. Grab again argued that there are too many passengers and not enough vehicles. (READ: Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day) “We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,” Grab said. This demand and supply imbalance, added Grab, “is likely to be temporary” because the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has since accredited 5 other ride-hailing companies – MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Go Lag, and Hype.

With Uber’s exit, Grab now controls 93% of the ride-hailing market. “Such entry of competitors would not be timely, likely, and sufficient because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base sufficient to contest the incumbent,” said the PCC. ‘Deteriorating’ service As for complaints about poor service, Grab noted that it recently launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience.” One of the top complaints is driver cancellation, though Grab earlier claimed that riders are more likely to cancel than drivers. The PCC, however, had said that its data show “prices are increasing, while quality of service is deteriorating, to the detriment of the riding public.” Grab, according to the PCC, also increased the frequency of its surge pricing. The commission’s MAO based its findings on “total observations of 27,648 booking requests over 3 phases” as well as “mystery shopper surveys (a total quota of 1,104 rides),” conducted before and after Uber exited the market on April 16. “Passenger surveys and interviews… indicate more driver cancellations, forced cancellation of rides, and longer waiting times,” said the PCC. In response to these findings, Grab said it would share its own market analysis with the PCC, to show that its deal with Uber “has no anti-competitive effect.” The company will file a formal reply to address the points in the SOC. “We hope that the PCC will fairly assess our arguments and sit down with us to discuss how to address any issues that the PCC may identify moving forward,” the company said. Illegal fares? In a separate statement, Grab also maintained that its fares are “legal and upfront,” denying the allegations of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it charges illegal rates. Nograles earlier claimed Grab had an unauthorized charge of P2 per minute of travel and a supposedly illegal P80 minimum fare. The LTFRB suspended the P2 per minute charge – a decision that’s under appeal – and also said it was not informed about the minimum fare. Grab said a 2015 order from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allowed transport network companies (TNCs) to set their own fares without LTFRB approval. “Congressman Jericho Nograles may be rocking the boat for his political ends, not really to protect the riding public. Proof is his own bill in Congress wants the TNCs to set their own fares, exactly what he is opposing now,” said Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales. In response, Nograles told Rappler that “Grab cannot change the facts through press releases.” The lawmaker added: “Grab advertised that they don’t charge per-minute fees, when in fact they did. Grab admitted under oath that they did not inform the riding public, the LTFRB, or the drivers and operators when they implemented the illegal fees on June 5, 2017. Let’s wait for the decision of the [LTFRB] in a few days.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/203634-thewrap-may-29-2018-evening-edition/","title":"Duterte certifies BBL as urgent, LTFRB on Grab, COA on OGCC | Evening wRap","date":"May 29, 2018 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler's evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte certifies as urgent the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law. President Rodrigo Duterte voices an interest in the vote recount for the 2016 vice presidential race. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it was ‘not informed’ that ride-hailing company Grab is charging passengers minimum fares. The Commission on Audit says 5 government corporate lawyers in the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel directly received allowances from their state clients, which were all untaxed and exceeded the allowable amount. United States President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agree  that it is ‘imperative’ to completely dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/203601-ltfrb-not-informed-grab-philippines-minimum-fare/","title":"LTFRB not informed of Grab’s minimum fares","date":"May 29, 2018 2:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab has been charging a minimum fare of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, and P125 for premium cars","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials on Tuesday, May 29, said they “were not informed” that ride-hailing company Grab would be charging passengers minimum fares. Visibly surprised by the information, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III asked Grab representatives during a hearing when the minimum fares were imposed. Grab lawyer Miguel Aguila said they started on June 5, 2017. “Ayusin ’nyo nga ’yung papel ’nyo. Ang gulo,” Delgra told Grab. (Fix your papers. It’s a mess.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles informed the LTFRB in a hearing on Tuesday that Grab Philippines charges “illegal” minimum fares, which “were not declared” by the ride-hailing company,  Nograles said Grab charges a minimum of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, while the premium cars start at P125. In response to a question, Delgra said during a media interview that the board was not informed of charges separate from the flagdown rate of P40. “Obviously, [we were] not [informed] insofar as the computation of minimum fare is concerned – compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,” Delgra said. Delgra said the LTFRB is not yet considering suspending Grab’s minimum fares, but the board needs a clarification on the matter. “We won’t necessarily remove this, but we are asking for clarification. We are only following the 4 elements in determining fares,” he said in Filipino.  Delgra said that the fares depend on the computation of the flagdown rate, the distance traveled, time charges, and the surge pricing. Under the government-approved fares, Grab charges an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer and has a surge cap of twice the distance traveled on top of the flagdown fare. Grab said that it was never the company’s intention to “hide” the fare from its patrons. “What you see on the app, that is an upfront fare. If it is a minimum distance, it’s a minimum fare, we never tried to hide it from the general public,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said. Illegal charges? Nograles earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker’s allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges. “If they truly subject themselves to the board, then why didn’t they apply to the board? Their only formal application for it was January of this year, way after they unilaterally imposed it,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said Grab’s move puts into question the authority of LTFRB as a regulatory agency. LTFRB earlier said they were not consulted either when the P2-per-minute fare was initially charged.  The ride-hailing company’ legal counsel argued that the P2-per-minute charge was added to cover the costs of the drivers when picking up the passenger at their pinned location in the Grab app. During the hearing, Delgra asked Grab to submit to the board the company’s earnings since the P2-per-minute charge was imposed. For the drivers Winson Esteras, leader of the coalition of transport network vehicle services, said on Tuesday that the P2-per-minute charge helps drivers cope with the costs incurred by longer travel time due to traffic congestion. “Kung mapapansin ‘nyo naman na hindi na talaga kami kumikita…. Pa’no ‘yung traffic? ‘Yung fare ngayon hindi na aligned sa sinisingil na gas sa amin,” Esteras said. (If you notice, we’re not earning a lot…. How about the traffic? The fare now is not aligned with the cost of gas.) Grab Philippines had admitted that its riders were not informed when the additional charges were rolled out starting June 5, 2017.  They argued that this is legal and asked for it to be reimposed, saying that it is for the drivers’ benefit. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila.

In a statement, Nograles said this minimum fare was not authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Without any public hearing, Grab Philippines again unilaterally imposed a new illegal fare condition. [D]uring the April 17 LTFRB hearing, Grab Philippines denied to the board that they impose an P80 minimum fare,” Nograles said. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Now, no less than the Grab app publicly declares that the company charges the same minimum fare. This brazen act shows not only disrespect to the regulators, but proof that Grab Philippines has no intention to follow Philippine laws,” Nograles said. “This is a usurpation of the powers of the LTFRB and this is a violation of our existing laws. Just because they now have a virtual monopoly of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) sector, they can now violate our laws by setting their own fare rates?” he added. Under the information card on the Grab app, its sedan and 6-seater vehicles for hire charge a minimum of P80 per ride, while the premium cars start at P125. Nograles said that under the approved fare structure, a rider should only be charged a maximum of P68 for a 500-meter ride at a surge rate of times two. It should not be at P80, he said. The lawmaker earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

(READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Grab Philippines also said that a motion for reconsideration on the suspension was filed, meaning the suspension should have been delayed and should not have been rendered “immediately executory.” “Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,” Grab said.

(READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) In a text message to Rappler, Nograles said Grab’s petition is “unfounded.” “Their petition is unfounded since reimposition means it was legal in the first place. It was never approved therefore there is nothing to reimpose,” Nograles said on Friday. “They dont have the moral authority to talk about equal protection of the laws when they have admitted that they have never conducted a public hearing for the P2-per-minute [charge],” Nograles added. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said. Grab earlier admitted that riders were not informed of the travel charges when first added to their fares mid-2017.

With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/202049-grab-philippines-passengers-cancellation-fee/","title":"Grab plans to impose fee on riders who cancel trips","date":"May 8, 2018 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing company plans to begin charging passengers for trip cancellations within the next 100 days.

In a media briefing on Tuesday, May 8, Grab Philippines marketing head Cindy Toh said there are ongoing discussions to roll out the feature in a few months. “Grab is eyeing to impose a cancellation fee – our target [is] that this will be done within the [next] 100 days,” Toh said. According to Toh, riders are more likely to cancel their bookings than drivers. Data showed that passengers cancel 12% of their rides, while drivers cancel 8% of their bookings. Imposing a cancellation fee is seen as a solution – a feature that Uber used to have. But Grab has yet to determine how much the fee will be, and how to roll out the feature for trips paid with cash. “For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Toh said. She added that Grab will soon issue new receipts which will indicate the fare breakdown of every trip. “On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers ang travel mo (your travel was). That is already a work in progress,” Toh said. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab of charging an additional P2 per minute on top of its government-approved scheme. He pointed out that Grab’s receipts do not show the trip’s fare breakdown.

Better service Grab is at the center of controversy over its drivers’ behavior, with Filipinos complaining of “poor service” after it bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. Toh said they are committed to improving customer experience by updating their drivers’ code of conduct, as well as implementing a new set of guidelines for passenger behavior. “We impose a maximum cancellation of one per day for our drivers. From our current driver cancellation of 8%, we should be able to reduce that by half or 4%,” Toh said. Grab will also expand its driver academy, which will include modules on road courtesy, customer service, and data privacy. Performance incentives will also be enhanced and a driver rewards program will be in place. Toh said all these will be done within their 100-day campaign.

An auto-accept driver-app feature will also be fully rolled out on Friday, which will automatically assign bookings to drivers.

This decision comes after the Singapore-based ride-hailing firm sought the advice of Transportation Undersecretary Thomas Orbos and Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon. (READ: Indonesia’s Go-Jek eyes Philippine ride-hailing market) “We want to vastly improve our services hence our consecutive decisions to sanction 500 errant drivers over the week, and now the non-showing of the passenger destination and the auto-accept feature,” Cu said. Last week, nearly 500 Grab drivers were sanctioned after an internal probe into mounting complaints of canceled ride bookings. According to Grab, some drivers were suspended for 3 to 5 days. No further details or breakdown of the sanctions were given. Cu admitted that Grab’s service is currently “not optimal” with fewer drivers on the road. “Grab is trying its best to keep more drivers on the road to keep up with rider demand and prevent long waits and price surges,” he said. ‘At last’ In a message sent to reporters, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Grab’s move to mask passengers’ destinations. “At least now the riders, hopefully, will have less cancellations. We appreciate the move unilaterally done by Grab, that they didn’t wait for an order from the LTFRB,” said LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada in a mix of English and Filipino. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who earlier questioned Grab’s P2-per-minute travel charge, pointed out that the destination masking was long overdue.

However, we will move forward. We have rolled out additional and stricter measures to address issues on cancellations and this is just the start,” Cu said.

Blaming it on LTFRB order Cu, however, also blamed the ride cancellations on the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order to suspend his company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. “[D]river cancellation rate doubled at 11% last Friday and Saturday (April 20 and 21), and were predominantly driven by low fares. As a result, drivers drove less and Grab was only able to service half of the passenger demand,” he added. The LTFRB’s order came after a complaint lodged by PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. Grab then admitted that its riders were not informed about the P2-per-minute travel charge when it was first implemented in June 2017. After the LTFRB ordered Grab to stop the P2-per-minute travel charge, the ride-hailing firm filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the alleged illegal charge goes to the drivers and not to the company. “[T]he P2-per-minute travel time fare component was legal [based on a 2015 Department of Transportation order], and necessary to protect the livelihood of driver partners while sustaining transport demands of the riding public. [T]he P2 is not a Grab income because 80% goes to the driver directly while the 20% is spent on driver incentives and rider promos,” Cu said.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu explained on Wednesday, April 18, that fares are “not higher” because they “did not increase fare pricing” after they acquired Uber. Cu said it appears that fares are higher because Grab absorbed “100% of the demand” when Uber left the market but they have yet to absorb all Uber drivers to meet the demand. “The demand base is fully absorbed. It’s easier for the demand to flow than it is for the supply to flow,” he said. (READ: Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us) According to Cu, about 40% of the Uber drivers from their masterlist had onboarded with Grab since they started the process early April. The country head also said that they will be employing stricter measures to avoid driver cancellations such as changing their incentive scheme for drivers. Cathy Toh, Grab Philippines marketing head, also invited passengers to continue reporting impertinent drivers. She said they had doubled their internal customer service team to address their woes. Grab is the only transport network company currently offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber closed down on April 16.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu made the statement in response to questions in a press briefing on Wednesday. “Riders were not informed [of the additional P2-per-minute charge]. There were no comms (communication) to the riders,” Cu said, when asked if Grab riders were informed of the charge through the Grab app or via social media. Cu said that there is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the “upfront price” or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip. This includes the computation for the travel duration charge. “The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors [are charged] and it’s fixed,” he added. The company head maintained that Grab is “transparent” in its charges, and reiterated that there was nothing illegal in charging the P2-per-minute charge, contrary to the allegation of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. “Hindi namin tinatago ‘yung fact na nagcharge kami ng P2 per minute since July (We are not hiding the fact that we charged P2 per minute since July). We are well within our rights to charge the P2,” Cu said. Cu said that their rates are now shown on their website. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Grab charges a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The travel duration charge is added on top of the base fare and distance charges. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is investigating the alleged “illegal” charges. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. ‘Fares are legal’ Miguel Aguila, Grab’s lawyer, maintained that the ride-hailing company’s travel duration charge is legal. Aquila cited the Department Order (DO) 2015-11 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), which he said allows Grab to set fares on its own. “Grab would like to set the record straight. Our fares are legal: ‘Fares are set by the TNCs (Transport Network Company) and is subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions in the market,'” he said. On Tuesday, April 17, Cu, Aguila, and Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua appeared before the LTFRB to explain why Grab’s accreditation should not be suspended or revoked amid allegations of  unauthorized charges. Aguila also said that the LTFRB was informed about Grab’s pricing scheme through the technical working group (TWG) in July, or a month after Grab started to impose the travel duration charge.  (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Why change fares on your own?) He added that the email correspondences with the LTFRB on Grab’s fare pricing scheme also transpired last year. Back to drivers, passengers Cu also said that the P2-per-minute charge did not go to the company, but benefitted both riders and passengers. “Fares are more fair for both sides and this P2-per-minute did not go to Grab. But it went to the drivers, it was reinvested by way of incentives or promos for passengers,” he said. Some Grab operators and drivers earlier expressed fears that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Nograles had said that drivers should be spared if a refund is ordered by the regulatory agency. Cu also said that Grab always complies with government regulations. When the LTFRB ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare, it immediately implemented it, he said.

On Tuesday, the LTFRB conducted a hearing on the alleged illegal charges by Grab Philippines on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) During the hearing, the regulatory board questioned representatives from Grab on how they “unilaterally” changed their fare scheme mid-2017, adding P2 per minute for every ride. “We are very specific how this mechanism was supposed to be implemented when a December 27, 2016 order remains as of today,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said. The December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The order does not include travel duration charges. “It is the position of the Board that the December 27, 2016 order mandates the fare structure – therefore there should be no other change in the fare structure, considering the fact that the Board exercised our adjudicatory powers,” Delgra said. The LTFRB instructed Grab to disclose in another hearing – set for May 29 – when exactly the travel duration charge was implemented, and how many rides were affected. It also asked Grab to further explain its algorithm for fare pricing in May. Illegal charges? Grab maintained, however, that it informed the LTFRB of its fare structure in a technical working group (TWG) meeting in July 2017. John Paul Nabua, Grab’s lawyer, said the ride-hailing company started charging the travel duration rate in “early June 2017” and informed the LTFRB about it the following month. As to why Grab implemented the new fare structure without the LTFRB’s approval, Nabua said Department Order (DO) 2015-11 issued by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allows pricing changes, only “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of disruptions in the market.” Nabua also said the LTFRB’s December 2016 order mentions the “time travel charge,” and Grab deemed this applicable to ride-hailing firms. But Delgra said the provision does not apply to Grab, as the company did not charge by travel duration prior to the December 2016 order. “Was there a time rate when the order was decided in December 2016?” Delgra asked Grab, and was told, “No.” In response, the LTFRB chairman said, “Then this [provision] does not apply to you.” Refund? PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who was also present during the hearing as complainant, said Grab only confirmed it did not go through the right process. “First of all, informing [the LTFRB] through a PowerPoint presentation is not a cause for approval. What we are pushing for here is due process for the rights of our consumers. The P2-per-minute charge did not undergo due process,” Nograles told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino. The lawmaker said that based on his calculations, Grab owes its riders some P3.2 billion. Some Grab drivers and operators who were also present during the hearing argued that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should the LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Some senators had also slammed the ride-hailing company’s “predatory pricing and overcharging.” The LTFRB previously ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare.

The commission’s order contradicted that of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB), which ordered Uber to end operations before April 16. When the PCC previously ordered Uber to continue running beyond April 8, Grab had said it would shoulder the cost of the extension but only until April 15. Little room for newcomers The PCC now plans to fast-track the completion of its review, “given how it is imbued with public interest.” “When a big player buys out its competitor, there will be many economic and legal factors that need to be scrutinized,” the commission added. (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Explain ‘illegal’ P2-per-minute travel charge) The PCC went on to reiterate that Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s assets creates a potentially distorted market for ride-hailing. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” said the commission. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to network effects. This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base,” it added. The PCC said it would take that into consideration during the review to level the playing field. “In the end, the PCC stands with the passengers to protect them from the perils of monopoly,” it concluded.

Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said Grab, as the “surviving” company after buying Uber, has no right to charge consumers higher fares. “There should be no room for predatory pricing by a firm allowed to engage in public service. Being the surviving entity does not authorize Grab to grab more profits,” Poe said in a statement. She added that the government should find a middle ground, saying regulatory agencies should both protect the riding public from exorbitant fees and Grab drivers from low income despite hard work. “I am hopeful that through dialogue and open channels of communication, all the stakeholders can strike a balance that will not hurt the pocket of Grab’s riders but will not leave Grab’s drivers empty-handed either…. ‘Yung tamang presyo at serbisyo na masaya ang lahat (The right price and service so everyone is happy),” she said. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, for his part, said government regulators, such as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), should probe the cost structure of ride-hailing services. “Dito papasok ang close monitoring ng LTFRB and PCC sa anti-competitive practices (This is where the LTFRB and the PCC’s close monitoring of anti-competitive practices comes in)…. They should also establish benchmarks that are internationally accepted to detect potential abuses of a monopoly,” Gatchalian said. He called on the LTFRB to require Grab to provide a breakdown of charges in its receipts for transparency. “Dapat i-review ng LTFRB ang lahat ng fees at charges na pinapatong sa commuters. At huwag payagan mag-charge ng mas mataas pa kaysa sa ibang bansa. I-mandato din ng LTFRB ang Grab na i-breakdown ang resibo at maging mas transparent pa sa mga singil sa commuters,” Gatchalian said. (The LTFRB should review all fees and charges passed on to commuters. They should not allow the charging of fees that are higher than in other countries. The LTFRB should also mandate Grab to provide a breakdown in its receipts and be more transparent in charging commuters.)

The LTFRB then issued a show-cause order telling the company to explain. Grab, for its part, maintained that it has always been “transparent” with its fare scheme.

Surge pricing was capped at twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare. This amends LTFRB’s December 2016 order setting the fare structure of Grab.  The order is effective immediately. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the board deemed it reasonable to lower Grab’s surge pricing cap since consumers are left with only Grab as their option for ride-hailing services, given the latter’s acquisition of Uber. “The board directs Grab to lower its surge from 2 to 1.5. Why? [The] LTFRB is processing the new TNC players. This is to ensure that the fares will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said during a hearing on Wednesday. The cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab. Lizada said that the cap would be reviewed after new players have come in. Grab spokersperson Leo Gonzales said they understand the need for the cap to be lowered. “We understand their justification for this. This is a critical time. As soon as new players come in, the board will have to study again. But , of course, we will comply with further downgrading the cap from 2.0 to 1.5x,” Gonzales said.

Nograles told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday that he arrived at the figure based on the conservative estimate of P1.5 million Grab rides per week, multiplied by the average travel duration of 30 minutes, at a P2-per-minute charge, over 5 months. He said he set his calculation for that period because he only had personal knowledge about the alleged illegal charge 5 months ago.  When Grab Philippines launched its ride-hailing services in 2015, it charged a base fare of P30 and additional P12 per kilometer. There was supposed to be no additional charges per minute. In December 2016, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered a cap on ride-hailing services fares, with Grab maintaining its base fare of P30 and lowering its per kilometer charging to a P10 to P14 range depending on surge pricing. Nograles said that as of 2017, the P2-per-minute charge was “not approved” by the LTFRB. The lawmaker said that when he asked the LTFRB about the pricing, he was told: “Really? Maybe you should talk to Grab.” “Alam ba ‘yan ng LTFRB o hindi? Kung hindi nila alam, complacency ‘yan. If alam nila, graft ‘yan (Does the LTFRB know about this? If they don’t, then that’s complacency. If they do, it’s graft),” Nograles added. Rappler sought a comment from LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada on Nograles’ allegation, but she has not yet replied as of posting. Grab repeatedly said in the past that fares will remain as is as it “cannot unilaterally” increase the fares.  Although fares right now may not increase given its acquisition of Uber, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition before the LTFRB to increase fares due to the tax reform law. What does LTFRB know? Does LTFRB know about the P2-per-minute charge? LTFRB and Grab have different answers. As far as LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra knows, “Grab doesn’t charge per travel time.” Delgra said this in an interview on radio dzRh on Sunday, April 8, when asked about the difference in the fares charged by Grab and Uber.  “Medyo mataas ‘yung Grab kasi nag-o-offer yung Uber ng, aside from the base fare na parehas sila P40 each, ‘yung per [kilometer] nila mas mababa ‘yung Uber eh, P5.70 per [kilometer] . Pero ‘yung Grab P11 to P14 per [kilometer], pero wala sila ‘yung travel time. ‘Yung Uber naman meron sila travel time, P2 per minute,” he said on Sunday.  (Grab fares are more expensive than Uber because aside from having the same base fare of P40 each, Uber’s per kilometer charge is cheaper than Grab at P5.70 per kilometer. Grab charges P11 to P14 per kilometer but they don’t have travel time [charges]. Meanwhile, Uber charges travel time at P2 per minute.) Asked about its P2-per-minute charge, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu told Rappler in an interview on Monday, April 9, “LTFRB is aware.” Grab spokesman Leo Gonzales, who was with Cu during the brief Rappler interview, said, “There was a time that we informed LTFRB about this.” Asked whether the LTFRB held a hearing on the additional charge, Cu said, “No hearing because at that time, it (fare) wasn’t regulated yet at the start.” “The first TNC accreditation doesn’t say that pricing will be regulated. It’s already in the new ones,” he added. Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.

Cu explained that after the acquisition, Grab was funding the current operations of Uber, thus, operations cannot be totally independent. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on March 25 and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure,” Cu said. Grab has been shouldering the cost of the Uber app extension from March 25 to its earlier scheduled shutdown on April 8, the original period of transition.  Cu added that the Uber app shutdown will be moved to midnight of April 15, which means extra costs for Grab.  The country head of Grab reiterated that the Uber app can still be accessed but “it has limited functionality and little or no support.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it was concerned that there would be a deluge of customer complaints. “The current solution does not benefit the riding public. It’s a risk for the riding public. If a road crash happens, who has the accountability?” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Cu called on the PCC to discuss the matter with them further, as keeping the Uber app functioning indefinitely will cost them “expensively.” Uber and Grab face a P50,000- to P2-million penalty per violation for failure or refusal to comply with the PCC’s order. However, both companies will be given a chance to explain their sides before this order will be implemented.  Many Uber patrons slammed the deal between the two companies, arguing that Grab has “monopolized” the ride-hailing service until the LTFRB approves 4 new ride-hailing apps.

The PCC’s mandate is to protect competition in the market and prohibit anti-competitive conduct, including mergers and acquisitions of businesses and companies that may substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition. The PCC said it will evaluate and analyze if after the acquisition, prices will likely increase; ride-sharing services will deteriorate; passengers will effectively have less options; and how likely new transport network companies (TNCs) will be able to fairly compete against the merged firm. Uber drivers in the Philippines were told to move to the Grab platform by Sunday, April 8. (READ: As Uber gives up Philippine operations to Grab, what now for commuters?) “A merger or acquisition review using competition lens will determine whether the merger of two players in the ride-sharing market will substantially lessen competition,” the PCC said. Meeting with Grab, Uber The PCC said it is set to meet with representatives of Uber and Grab on Monday to determine if the companies are required to formally notify the commission about their deal and have it reviewed. Back in March, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC raised the threshold to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations. Like in other global transactions that the PCC has handled, the commission said it will look into the operations of Grab and Uber in the Philippines as basis for the thresholds. “If the transaction is notifiable, Grab and Uber are not allowed to consummate the deal without PCC approval,” the commission said. “If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anticompetition concerns.” Should anti-competitive concerns arise, the PCC said Grab and Uber may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or prevent negative effects on market competition. The PCC may launch a motu proprio review or open a case that may disentangle or block the deal, should Uber and Grab decline to submit transaction details. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/199194-grab-monopoly-effects-filipinos/","title":"[OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters","date":"Mar 29, 2018 1:34 PM PHT","snippet":"With Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

Uber users and drivers will be required to register anew with Grab to allow them to use the Grab TNV platform,” Nabua said. No impact on data breach probe The NPC on Tuesday said Uber’s merger with Grab would not affect the agency’s ongoing probe into a data breach in 2017, which exposed information on drivers and users of Uber. “This sale does not affect our ongoing investigation into past Uber breaches that involved Filipino users,” Liboro said. “This investigation is continuing and a report would be out soon,” he added. Back in November 2017, the chief executive officer of California-based Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, announced the firm failed to disclose a massive breach that exposed information on over 57 million users of the application.

The communications team bubbled over with witticism by the cupful: “join us for a brew-tiful coffee experience,” “espresso yourself,” and “deja brew” embellished the electronic invite like latte art.

The event was held last March 16, a Friday, at the Seattle’s Best Coffee branch of SM Mall Of Asia. Our takeaway? Great-quality local coffee already offers enough impetus to haul ass out of bed every morning, but the added appeal of pairing it with well-loved panaderia treats like yema cake, ensaymada, and pandesal should make anyone who loves merienda or almusal even more giddy for coffee time.    Hello, where have you bean?  Seattle’s Best Coffee aims to make 2018 all about locally (and responsibly) sourced coffee beans from the highlands of Sagada, Benguet, and Matutum. These handpicked beans have their own special provenance which include soil quality, moisture, cloud cover, and even the activity of volcanoes in the locations they’re grown. The Sagada premium Arabica bean is best known for giving a bold coffee flavor with a pleasant floral aroma. Benguet coffee beans have the distinction of growing from rich soil located 1,600 meters above sea level, hence their full-bodied and rich flavor. Matutum beans are perhaps the most geographically unique (in volcano-rich South Cotabato), with their aromatic dark-chocolate flavor and nutty profile as a result. Together, these beans create a variance of exciting beverages, taken hot or over ice, and always with that recognizable Seattle’s Best flair.   Responsibly sourced? Cool beans!

From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,' warns an economist","body":" MANILA, Philippines – An economist warned that Filipino commuters could face higher fares and fewer incentives, after California-based Uber decided to sell its entire Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. Ending stiff competition between the ride-hailing behemoths, Uber on Monday, March 26, sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. “Obviously, it is not good. From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,” Fernando Aldaba, dean and professor of economics at the Ateneo de Manila University and a senior fellow of Eagle Watch, told Rappler. “Without competition, prices may go up and quality of service might deteriorate,” Aldaba added. Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8 – or two weeks from now. (READ: Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks) Pola del Monte, a 28-year-old editor in Quezon City, said this gives her no choice but to rely on Grab for ride-hailing services. “I’m an Uber loyalist – largely by force of habit, but also because I prefer its sleeker interface, have had too many pleasant riding experiences, plus I find their customer service impeccable. I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,” she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. “Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won’t be able to compare prices now. We won’t know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,” she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. “If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,” Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  “If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan’s statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. “As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,” the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a “dynamic surcharge” would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. “With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,” the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/198968-grab-buys-uber-southeast-asia-operations/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab buys Uber’s Southeast Asia operations","date":"Mar 26, 2018 10:21 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return","body":" SINGAPORE (3rd UPDATE) – Uber sold its Southeast Asian business to rival Grab on Monday, March 26, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marking the US firm’s latest retreat from international markets. Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber’s latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. “Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.” Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab’s board as part of the deal, said: “This deal is a testament to Uber’s exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.” Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber’s losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/198839-toyo-eatery-restaurant-feature/","title":"Taking root: Why Toyo Eatery is the most important Filipino restaurant right now","date":"Mar 24, 2018 1:39 PM PHT","snippet":"With their new Miele One to Watch award in tow, Toyo Eatery looks about ready to take the world by storm, but their target seem to be a bit closer to home","body":" It is not news to anyone that the food at Toyo Eatery is extraordinary. Anyone who has ever dined at the unapologetically cool 50-seat space tucked in a corner of Chino Roces Avenue knows exactly the sort of wide-eyed wonder that fills you as soon as Chef Jordy Navarra’s tomato meringue amuse bouche collapses between your tongue and the roof of your mouth, giving way to tender shreds of langka slicked in thick, savory coconut cream. You do not need to be told just how good their octopus starter is, about how the tentacles, tender as can be, are scorched just so around the edges and coiled over a broth that tastes so much of the sea that you’d swear you were standing by the shore at dawn, watching as the fishermen brought in their catch for the day.   Neither does anyone need to be reminded of the marvels of Richie Manapat’s bread, with its open crumb and dark, well-baked exterior, the slight tang of fermentation acting as a through line between the crusty country loaves and the moreish tocino buns.  It was then no surprise to Filipino diners when it was announced that Toyo Eatery had been awarded the Miele One to Watch Award for Asia. It was something that was bound to happen, and it was only a matter of time before the global culinary elite finally took notice of what is arguably one of the best restaurants in the Philippines. It is interesting to note, though, that the award does come at a seemingly fortuitous time in the food world. Filipino food is now at the crest of a wave, having just found purchase in the collective consciousness of diners the world over. The food of our childhood is suddenly making headlines outside of the Philippines, with publications like the New York Times and Bon Appetit giving ample space to stories about the familial language that is Filipino cooking, of how the Filipino diaspora had inadvertently brought with it a tradition of sharing good food rooted in a homeland oceans away. Suddenly, the vernacular of our cooking started making its way to media outside of our own and Filipinos yearning for culinary representation beyond our shores finally had it in their grasp.   What makes Toyo so interesting at this very moment is that it is just as focused on reacquainting Filipinos with the true indigenous roots of our cooking as it is with bringing it to the world stage, if not more so. The work and research that Chef Jordy and his dedicated team put into bringing their innovative take on Filipino food to life is as much a conservation effort as it is a culinary one. If you look closely at the menu at Toyo you’d discover that it is an ingenious mix of the quintessential quirks of contemporary fine dining and unashamedly local techniques and ingredients deeply rooted in our history. Every single bite at Toyo Eatery has been precision engineered with tweezers, dehydrators ,and a Cryovac machine, but at its beating core, the food here is a distillation of centuries of Filipino flavor and technique.    The plates here may not look too familiar – think perfect fillets of fish adorned with edible flowers and powdered cured fish roe – but it is in the vivid acidity, in the almost brazen charring of meat, in the briny echoes of the sea, and in the deep, earthen bass notes of vegetables we are all too familiar with, that you will be able to find the food’s striking Filipino spirit. A meal at Toyo Eatery, it seems, is as much about reinvigorating our need to connect with our identity as Filipino cooks and eaters, as it is about giving diners from anywhere in the world one hell of a good time. The flavors here are truly evocative, just as much harkening to days spent on the seashore eating grilled fish on the sand, as it does to ancient techniques unfamiliar to many of us, and it is exactly this specificity that makes Toyo Eatery so special to Filipinos, more than anyone else. – Rappler.com Chino is a freelance culture writer and food stylist.

After all, there are still so many places to visit and cultures to be discovered in our own backyard.      Last January, selected members of the media, travel bloggers and writers got the chance to go to Isabela for the Bambanti Festival 2018. In between our coverage of the festival, we were able to explore some places in Ilagan, where the festival was held.  Named after King Philip’s wife, Queen Isabela, this northern province is known for supplying rice and corn to various parts of the country. Through the years, Isabela has gained exposure through the tourism efforts of the Bambanti festival, the Sierra Madres, the Rio Grande of Cagayan, and the beaches promoted by the local government, headed by its governor, Faustino “Bodjie” Dy III. Ilagan Sanctuary At the Ilagan Sanctuary, which has gained popularity as a tourist spot, you can let out the daredevil in you by going down the zipline, exploring the caves and the zoo, or having a picnic with your family.  While some of our colleagues decided to do the zip line, photographer Rob Reyes and I decided to take the more sedate the tour of the Sta. Victoria caves. We started our journey by crossing a hanging bridge that was 10 feet above ground. For someone who has a fear of heights, I crossed as swiftly as I could to get to the other side. It was quite a start to further adventures.   Once we crossed the bridge, our tour guide led us to the first cave, called the Sun and Moon cave. According to our guide, the reason why it was called the Sun and Moon cave was because of how the rays of the sun and light of the moon would shine inside the cave.  We then headed to the main cave which took us to the zoo area.   {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BeieFsbBni_/” data-instgrm-version=”8″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BeieFsbBni_/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Caving adventure from last week.</a></p> <p style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;”>A post shared by <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/alexavvillano/” style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;” target=”_blank”> Alexa Villano</a> (@alexavvillano) on <time style=” font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;” datetime=”2018-01-29T15:35:10+00:00″>Jan 29, 2018 at 7:35am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=”//www.instagram.com/embed.js”></script>{/source}   Animal Kingdom After a 10 to 15 minute trek, we finally reached the zoo inside the Ilagan Sanctuary. Animals housed in the zoo include tigers and a gigantic python. Some of us touched the python, some did not. I was initially reluctant to touch it but eventually did – albeit for only a few seconds.     Families and tourists visiting the Ilagan Sanctuary can also do other activities such as paintball (P250 per 50 bullets), the obstacle course (P100), cable car ride (P100), zip line (P200), horseback riding (P150 around the sanctuary), picnicking and more.   Ilagan Japanese Tunnel Another site we visited was the Ilagan Japanese Tunnel. According to the brochure given, the Japanese built many tunnels for defensive purposes during World War II. The tunnels are believed to have served as headquarters of the Japanese soldiers.   The Ilagan Japanese tunnel is found in Barangay Sto. Tomas, and is just one of many tunnels in Isabela. It measures about 40 meters in length and a bit over 3 meters in width and height. The real size of the cave, however, has yet to be determined as we were told by the guide that it has yet to be fully checked and explored. At one point, they even showed us a part of the cave that was a little more than a tunnel, which leads locals to believe that there are still unexpolored areas yet to reach.      We descended inside the tunnel where replicas of the chambers are on display. We saw a replica of a golden Buddha as well as memorabilia discovered in the caves such as guns, bombs, and swords from World War II that were used by the Japanese. {source} <blockquote class=”instagram-media” data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BeXZ9JtAVA_/” data-instgrm-version=”8″ style=” background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% – 2px); width:calc(100% – 2px);”><div style=”padding:8px;”> <div style=” background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;”> <div style=” background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;”></div></div> <p style=” margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;”> <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/p/BeXZ9JtAVA_/” style=” color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;” target=”_blank”>Today&#39;s exploring moment before another Bambanti event.</a></p> <p style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;”>A post shared by <a href=”https://www.instagram.com/alexavvillano/” style=” color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;” target=”_blank”> Alexa Villano</a> (@alexavvillano) on <time style=” font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;” datetime=”2018-01-25T08:27:24+00:00″>Jan 25, 2018 at 12:27am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=”//www.instagram.com/embed.js”></script>{/source} For the cave tour, entrance fee starts at P50 for adults.

Price for a bus ride starts at P550 for a one way fare.

LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III made the clarification during the Senate committee on public services. “The issue on the hatchback is that it is allegedly considered in Metro Manila only, but we are allowing it to those areas we allowed the application of TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Service). That is in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Pampanga,” said Delgra. He pointed out, however, that hatchback units under TNVS cannot bring passengers outside Metro Manila and in areas that will have to ply expressways. Delgra said that the LTFRB puts a premium on public’s safety and convenience, hence the regulation of hatchback vehicles providing ride-hailing services. “We have consistently set a higher standard for public utility vehicles for safety and convenience of passengers such as enough legroom or a baggage compartment,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Under LTFRB’s latest memorandum circular, hatchback units will also have to charge lower rates compared to sedans. 3-year period In January, LTFRB planned to ban hatchback and compact vehicles from being accredited for ride-hailing services. Drivers and operators from the TNVS hatchback community appealed to the regulatory board, saying some operators are still paying for the vehicle’s loan amortization.  In February, LTFRB allowed the hatchback units to continue operating but only within a 3-year period to give way to car loan payments. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of Senate committee on public services, asked the LTFRB to reconsider the allowed period for hatchbacks to operate. “I hope there will be an extension, especially if the LTFRB finds that hatchback units do not bring inconvenience to its riders and other road mishaps. Maybe TNVS groups can discuss that again. Hopefully, the allowed hatchback units will be given the opportunity to expand their service,” Poe said in Filipino. On Monday, February 12, the LTFRB raised the allowed number of TNVS franchises to 66,750 from 45,700 units nationwide.

When asked whether current and active drivers would not be prioritized, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said “that seems to be what is happening.” Cu said they are hoping the LTFRB will consider using the transport network companies’ master list of active drivers and prioritize them during the application period. “What we’re proposing, and hopefully that gets settled, is that they (the LTFRB) use the submitted master list as basis of who’s active… I don’t want to log jam the applications that are not complete or are not active and I think a lot of people will agree to that,” Cu said. He also urged the LTFRB to review the cap, suggesting ways on how to arrive at better numbers. Given the total registered number, Cu said there are probably around 90,000 unique units or some 40% less the total registered vehicles. “You subtract those who are not active. I think that’s about 75,000 active unique drivers in total,” he added in a mix of English and Filipino. “Provided with all the numbers, ilan ang active daily? Medyo nagulat kami sa’n nanggaling ‘yung number na ‘yun (How many are active daily? We were surprised where that number came from),” Cu said, referring to the 45,700-unit cap. Review the cap On Monday, January 29, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said he has already ordered the LTFRB to review Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-003 which limits the common supply base of TNVS. Tugade said policies “should be anchored in the spirit of good governance and compassion, in order to better serve the interest of all the stakeholders.” In a statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said it will monitor the number of booking requests received by ride-hailing apps, including the served and unserved requests. The DOTr will also take into acount number coding, maintenance schedules, and drivers’ working hours. “We assure you that should there be adjustments in the common supply base as a result of the review, the decision would be based on actual data from the different transport network companies, thorough DOTr study, and consultations with the public at large,” the department said. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, earlier asked the LTFRB to “explain the math” behind the common supply base crafted by the regulatory board. The memorandum is the latest move by the LTFRB in its attempt to regulate ride-hailing apps Grab, Uber, and U-Hop. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/194238-poe-ltfrb-math-tnvs-vehicles-cap/","title":"Poe to LTFRB: ‘Explain the math’ behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles","date":"Jan 22, 2018 2:35 PM PHT","snippet":"Units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber are around 125,000, exceeding the cap two times over","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Senator Grace Poe urged the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to “explain the math” behind the 45,700-cap on cars under ride-hailing companies.

Ilabas nila ang minutes ng meetings and consultations para alam ng publiko. (They should put out the minutes of the meetings and consultations so the public knows),” said Poe. “Such disclosure of a public document is what the FOI rules, issued by the President, require. Tulad namin dito sa Senado (Like here in the Senate), ang transcripts are made public. Walang (None are) censored or hidden,” she added. Poe said that she’s not questioning the decision, rather just asking the LTFRB to explain the scientific basis of cap. “Malaki na ang inunlad ng data science, kaya maraming interesadong malaman kung ano ang justifications. Isang importanteng tanong: Ano ang baseline data na ginamit? Ano ang forecast model for future demand ang ginamit?” she said. (Data science has greatly improved that’s why many people are interested to know what are the justifications. One important question is: What was the baseline data used? What forecast model for future demand was used?) On Thursday, January 18, the LTFRB released a memorandum circular setting a “common supply base”, limiting the number of cars operating under Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) to 45,700. Impact Poe highlighted the possible impact on both drivers and patrons of the service. The senator asked if consultations with patrons were done by the regulatory agency. “If the most important components in the ride-sharing business, the customers, were consulted, was there a survey? Was the pulse of those who’ll be affected were taken into account?” Poe said in a mix of Engish and Filipino. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada explained that the numbers were computed based on the data submitted by ride-hailing application companies and the “churning rate” of drivers which takes into account those who decided to quit driving. (EXPLAINER: LTFRB requirements for Grab, Uber permits) Poe noted that the review should not be based on the churning rate but through an algorithm that determines demand and supply.  “Given that there are currently about 100,000 TNVS combined, and this number is not enough to satisfy the demand of the public, then we should start with that as the base and adjust accordingly,” she said.

But urban planners looking for solutions to gridlock may find the draconian measures hard to replicate in other less-compliant cities. Singapore has gone further than any other major city to avoid the monster jams that have blighted Asian metropolises such as Jakarta or Manila. The tough approach has been possible as Singaporeans are used to strict control – with media closely monitored and harsh punishments for minor crimes – and are fearful the city-state will be flooded with vehicles without the curbs. However the model faces mounting criticism thanks to rush-hour jams that have frustrated commuters, surging vehicle prices after a freeze on car numbers, and public transport breakdowns. “I think the system can be made better and fairer,” Joel Lee, a 28-year-old technician, told Agence France-Presse. He said authorities should make “a distinction between those who need cars, be it for work or family commitments, and those who just want more cars as a status symbol”. Six times the price Authorities’ main tool is the certificate of entitlement, or COE. Every potential car buyer must bid for a certificate and the cost is added to the vehicle price. The current cost of a COE for an average family car is almost Sg$50,000, pushing the price of a Toyota Corolla to Sg$114,000 (US$83,000). But COEs fluctuate depending on demand and at their high point 4 years ago the same car was Sg$159,000 (US$127,000 at the exchange rate at the time) – six times the price in the US. The certificates are valid for 10 years, after which the car must be scrapped or the certificate renewed. Despite the high price, many in the financial center, home to hordes of wealthy expats and millionaires, have bought cars, with some 600,000 on the streets – a considerable number for a limited road network. Other key measures include controlling the number of vehicles on the road and charging tolls on main roads at busy times. Authorities last month decided to freeze the number of private cars on the road from February for at least two years, citing land scarcity. But the decision sparked anger and was followed by a jump in the price of COEs by several thousand dollars, in what the Straits Times newspaper described as “panic buying”. To mitigate its tough policies, Singapore has built a modern public transport network with a subway, overland trains and buses, and the government recently announced a plan to spend Sg$28 billion to upgrade the system. Ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber have helped those unable or unwilling to spend on a car, and the government plans to build 700 kilometers (430 miles) of cycle paths. But the subway has recently been hit by repeated delays and breakdowns during rush hour. In the most serious incident for years a tunnel on the network flooded last month, crippling a main line for 20 hours, and sparking widespread anger. ‘Car-lite’ woes Some are now questioning the government’s plan to make Singapore a country where most people walk, cycle or take public transport. “The government has been trying to make the city ‘car-lite’ but you have a train system that’s not very reliable,” Jason Lin, a 66-year-old retiree, told Agence France-Presse. “If you take a bus, because there are so many cars, it’ll take a long time. It can be very frustrating.” Speaking in parliament this month, Lam Pin Min, a senior minister of state for transport, insisted there significant growth in the transport network was planned and there would be “less need to own a car”. Singapore has not heavily promoted electric cars as it pushes public transport – unlike rival financial hub Hong Kong – but an electric-car sharing scheme starting next month is a first step to changing that. Other places echo Singapore’s approach – London has a congestion charge while Paris sometimes orders some private cars off the road due to air pollution – but they are unlikely to copy the city-state’s tougher measures as it would be too risky. “COE is not a very popular measure, and any government that tries to implement this kind of a measure in any other country may lose elections,” Vivek Vaidya, a transport expert at business consultancy Frost and Sullivan, told Agence France-Presse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/188388-hyundai-philippines-agudo-asean-business-investment-summit-2017/","title":"‘You’re a woman, what do you know about cars?’","date":"Nov 15, 2017 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Maria Fe Perez-Agudo, head of the Philippine arm of Korean carmaker Hyundai, shares her experience of male bosses intimidating her","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The first time Maria Fe Perez-Agudo met the male bosses of Korean carmaker Hyundai, they gave her cold treatment meant to intimidate. “In a meeting with 10 or 12 male executives in Korea, they looked at me and they only had one question. ‘You are a woman. What do you know about cars?'” The sexist remark made her want to walk out, but she didn’t. She has already left a lucrative real estate job in favor of a career in the male-dominated automotive industry, so she gathered some inner strength and replied: “Can you treat me as a coequal even just for 30 seconds?” Without blinking an eye, she said next: “You are a Korean. What do you know about the Philippine market?” That clinched the deal. She shared this experience during a panel on “Unleashing Women Economic Power” at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Business and Investment Summit in Manila. (WATCH: ASEAN Business and Investment Summit 2017, November 13) Getting into these “game-changing” situations that level the playing field for women require “competence, attitude, and packaging,” she told an audience of business owners, government officials, and other executives from Southeast Asia. She urged the audience to “continue challenging and to reframe the social expectations and attitudes toward women and women leaders.” She highlighted another tool, saying, “Education is the number one leveler and penetrating strategy for women in a perceived male-dominated industry.” Agudo and her partners established Hyundai Asia Resources Incorporated (HARI) to market the Korean brand in the Philippines, and how she handled that 2001 meeting eventually changed the industry landscape in the Philippines. Not long after, Hyundai was grabbing significant market share from Japanese and American brands that already had a firm footing in the domestic car industry. HARI, where Agudo is president and chief executive officer, joined the ranks of Toyota and Honda in the industry’s top 3 in only a decade or so. It earned her various accolades, including being recognized by Ernst & Young as Woman Entrepreneur of the Year-Philippines in 2011. Fast forward to 2017, gender disparity is less of an issue to Agudo and her peers.  HARI and the entire industry are facing disruptive technologies that will likely erode the double-digit growth in vehicle sales in the Philippines that players have been enjoying in the past years.  The continued demand for the services of ride-sharing firms, like Grab and Uber, and other potential innovative alternatives to consumer mobility, such as driverless cars and flying taxis, will shift market positions of current players, Agudo shared.  By 2030, the evolution of the industry – not whether one is male or female – will decide who will be the losers and winners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/188350-asean-revolution-precrafted-filipino-unicorn/","title":"Filipino unicorn sets eyes outside ASEAN","date":"Nov 14, 2017 11:35 AM PHT","snippet":"Revolution Precrafted, the first Filipino startup valued at more than $1 billion, wants to establish a presence in 18 countries","body":" MANILA, Philippines — A homegrown startup finally managed to get unicorn status with a valuation of over $1 billion but unlike most of its peers, it has set its sights far beyond its regional turf. Revolution Precrafted Properties Limited now joins the very exclusive unicorn club in Southeast Asia that includes ride-sharing firms Grab and Go-Jek, travel firm Traveloka, and tech platform Sea Ltd. Unlike these service-based platforms aiming to expand into and dominate market share in Southeast Asia, Revolution Precrafted’s export-oriented model means it is not geographically dependent. The firm develops pre-built parts of designer homes and offices. Robbie Antonio, son of Century Properties founder and chair Jose EB Antonio, founded it in 2015.  “Unlike many of the unicorns in Southeast Asia, we’re really focused on the world, not just Southeast Asia,” Antonio said on the sidelines of the 2017 ASEAN Business and Investment Summit (ABIS) on Monday, November 13. “We’re really hoping to have a footprint in major parts of the world including America, Europe. The goal is to be the biggest home supplier in the world,” he emphasized. At the moment, however, the firm’s expansion has been confined to the neighboring countries, which Antonio explained was only because of close proximity. “In the end, we’re shipping homes. It is not exactly as easy as shipping other goods like clothing or appliances. It’s a much more complicated job.” The firm recently entered Indonesia after closing a deal early this year with Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie Group. Revolution Precrafted will supply 5 mega studios and 5 hectares of office spaces and storage facilities for a studio project in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Antonio pointed out, however, that there are other deals in the works in the the US and Central America. He plans to expand in phases. “We’ve identified 18 countries we want to open offices in. I just came from the Middle East and we’re going to penetrate that market as well,” he said. Branded housing The new insight Antonio has brought to the prefabricated industry is to combine it with the sheen of exclusivity in a style reminiscent of Century Properties’ use of the Trump and Paris Hilton brands for some of their high-end residential buildings in Manila.  Revolution Precrafted’s roster of high-profile designers for its pre-crafted structures include New York-based architecture firm Philip Johnson Alan Ritchie Architects, Jean Nouvel Design, and music star and designer Lenny Kravitz.  “I didn’t start the pre-fabricated space, but clearly we’re the only ones who are doing this from a branded perspective so we have intellectual property. But I wanted to keep operating and capital expenses down,”  Antonio said. Antonio pointed out that the firm consciously tries to minimize operating and capital expenses, emphasizing that “unlike some of the other ASEAN unicorns, Revolution Precrafted is already highly profitable.” The firm owns no land and carries no inventory while it outsources its construction to factories that use robotics to execute the firm’s designs. “Unlike Grab or Go-Jek which would need to raise $2 billion [to expand], we don’t. We’re never in that position,” Antonio said. ASEAN financing troubles  While Revolution Precrafted’s strategy may differ from its other high-profile peers, one common problem for all of them is “access to funding” in the region.  Speaking at an ABIS panel discussing financial inclusion in the region, Antonio said early stage financing for startups in the region was quite poor and hinders competitiveness compared to developed markets. “There are about a 1,000 unicorns in the world, most of which are situated in America for one reason: access to funding,” he said. “It’s not like we have fewer brilliant people here in Southeast Asia. We’re close to double the population of the America, yet t there are only 9 unicorns in the [region].”  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/188106-commuters-traffic-edsa-asean-summit/","title":"EDSA ‘parking lot’: Commuters endure traffic ahead of ASEAN Summit","date":"Nov 11, 2017 5:58 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) MMDA opens the ASEAN lane along EDSA Northbound to the public as of 6 pm on Saturday, November 11","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Angry commuters and motorists complained of being “trapped” in traffic congestion along EDSA on Saturday, November 11, two days before the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit.

The ASEAN’s combined GDP makes it one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world and it continues to be an attractive market and investment destination for leading economies, such as Japan. Japan’s foreign direct investment (FDI) remains significant within the ASEAN. From 2013 to 2015, Japanese FDI within the region amounted to $19.2 billion, or 15.4% of total inbound investment in the market. This also represents 16.7% of Japan’s total overseas investment. “Over the last two decades, just as Japan has increased its trade ties with ASEAN member countries, investment into Japan from Southeast Asian based companies has increased.

Growth plan: “Albion products are highly-valued by the medical and academic communities, however with the shrinking Japanese population, it is important for us as a company to reach out to Southeast Asian markets. In order to engage with new customers, we plan to significantly expand our network across Asia and ensure our products are available in high-end stores across the region,” says Shoichi Kobayashi, CEO of Albion Co. Ltd.  IRISO ELECTRONICS Who they are: The company specializes in manufacturing connectors. Last year, on their 50th anniversary, Iriso moved up from the JASDAQ Securities Exchange to the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This year the company is focused on growing their business, global network, and consumer base. Why they matter in the ASEAN: Iriso currently has manufacturing and research and development facilities in 12 countries. “Singapore remains our key center for sales to ASEAN member countries and we continue to provide high-quality connectors that play important functions within electronic devices,” says Sadao Sato, Iriso Electronic’s Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Growth plan: The company plans to invest in more innovative technologies, such as car electrification and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. They also want to be a key player in the Internet of Things evolution.  INOAC Corporation Who they are: From manufacturing bicycle tires and inner tubes, INOAC Corp. has evolved into a global leader in rubber goods – they supply polyurethane, rubber, plastic, and new material products and technologies to a wide range of clients. Why they matter in the ASEAN: INOAC Corp. has 27 production facilities in Southeast Asia. The company’s  overseas sales accounts for two-thirds of its total revenue, with the Southeast Asian region responsible for 30% of this business. Growth plan: The company eyes more localization to improve delivery to its ASEAN clients. “We have developed strong technical know-how with many of our products and we work closely with local partners to assist them as they grow their business,” says Soichi Inoue, Chairman and CEO of INOAC Corp.  JAPAN EXCHANGE GROUP (JPX) Who they are: JPX is the financial instruments exchange group under which Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and Osaka Exchange (OSE) operate. Why they matter in the ASEAN: The JPX has had a physical presence in Singapore for over 20 years. During this time, numerous governments, exchanges, and others in related industries throughout Southeast Asia have offered JPX their unfettered support. Growth plan: In 2015, JPX gained clearance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to convert their TSE and OSE representative offices into official branches – in anticipation of Singapore’s continued economic growth and the then-impending establishment of the AEC. – Rappler.com For the full length articles to the report and corporations featured, please click on this link.

This was underscored in a panel discussion at the 2017 Social Good Summit held on Saturday, September 16. The discussion focused on the challenges to innovation in the Philippines, and what various groups have been doing to promote entrepreneurship in the country. Ongoing conversation The recent deadlock between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber reflects the challenges encountered by innovators clashing with government regulators. Uber is no stranger to controversy, encountering backlash in the places where it launched because its business model did not fit current transportation laws. The Philippines is unique in that respect, since it created new transport categories back in May 2015 to accommodate Grab and Uber’s business models. In July this year, the LTFRB cracked down on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms, eventually leading to Uber’s suspension and the imposition of a hefty fine. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)  The issue sparked controversy, with some criticizing the LTFRB while others pointed out the need for accountability and regulation for these transport network companies. Lawyer JJ Disini cited this issue as he discussed the challenge of balancing innovation with the need for government regulators to do their job and protect the public interest. In other countries, some firms can try out new ideas by participating in a regulatory sandbox, where businesses are allowed to test out their innovative products or business models without following some legal requirements. The results and information generated from participating in a regulatory sandbox can be used by the government to craft regulations that better fit the public need, Disini said. This way, both innovators and regulators can work together to learn and refine the new business models. “We need regulators to be there. Their job is to protect the general public, but we should also understand that they’re constrained by that. At the same time, they want innovation as well. We do understand the complexities of the issues,” Disini said.  Supporting PH startups On the part of the government, there have been efforts among different government agencies to enable an environment where local startups can thrive. Rosemarie Edillon, planning and policy undersecretary of the National Economic and Development Authority, said entrepreneurship is key to helping the Philippine economy prosper. “One of the big problems we’re trying to address is the economy, and the way to have more employment is to have more employers. So we see entrepreneurship as one strategy,” Edillon said. “We actually need to grow much faster, and we need growth to be more inclusive. Key to that is entrepreneurship and innovation,” she added. To help entrepreneurs and startups thrive, agencies like the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) have their own programs geared toward budding entrepreneurs. The BSP, for instance, has a credit surety fund program to help micro, small, and medium enterprises obtain loans from banks. The DICT, meanwhile, has launched a roadmap for digital startups, that aims to provide a framework for developing the Philippine startup ecosystem. “It’s so exciting today, we’re glad that [Philippine startups] have become sexy,” said Mon Ibrahim, undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology. For Diane Eustaquio, executive director of non-profit incubator IdeaSpace, encouraging millennials to take risks and overcome a fear of failure is crucial for boosting the local startup scene. “We’re conditioned to follow and not to challenge, so it’s difficult for people to become entrepreneurs,” she said.  “I think that’s the challenge, it’s not in our culture to be allowed to fail… But it’s that failure that allows you to try to be better than what you were before,” she added. –Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/180171-whats-the-big-idea-asian-institute-management-data-science/","title":"AIM’s big data bid to regain business school leadership","date":"Aug 27, 2017 3:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The Asian Institute of Management bets on data science as one way to reclaim its place among the top business schools in Asia","body":" MANILA, Philippines – One of the many things we can blame on the Marcos years is how the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) lost its lead among business schools in the region. The future was bright when AIM was organized in the late 1960s by the likes of Washington SyCip, Eugenio Lopez, and Joseph McMicking, the visionary behind today’s Ayala group. Using their clout, they harnessed resources and grants from Ateneo, La Salle, Harvard, and the Ford Foundation to open the school in 1969. AIM was organized around the same time as the National University of Singapore Business School, but about 20 years before institutions like HKUST Business School and Singapore Management University. All 3 – and many others – are now bigger and/or more pricey than AIM. Schools benefit from being close to practitioners, whether because some practitioners teach, or because of joint projects or even just internships. Business schools benefit from being amidst strong, innovative businesses and growing economies. After a few years of Martial Law boom went bust, the Philippines entered almost 3 decades of lagging growth. AIM didn’t stand a chance. In an interview with Rappler’s “What’s The Big Idea?” series, AIM president and dean Jikyeong Kang says there’s a chance to catch up now, after the Philippines started becoming one of the fastest growing economies around a few years ago. And some businesses are striving to be innovative or at least dynamic: AIM needs to strengthen its ties to these. Prospective students – and prospective teachers – want to interact or even work with companies that are doing exciting things. AIM needs to be innovative and dynamic itself, by creating new courses and programs. Kang’s latest shot is a double-barreled one: a masters in data science program and a data science lab that can help companies organize and analyze their data.  “Big data” has been a business buzzword for several years now. But to the uninitiated, it’s referring to the explosion in information companies collect from your activities and transactions. There’s an explosion because companies’ systems are increasingly digital, so that every purchase by every customer is a digital piece of information that is easily stored and, more importantly, easily sorted in ways that might yield some insight into consumer behavior. Not very long ago, if companies were collecting data, it was text – text that took forever to shake into patterns. There’s also an explosion, of course, because your systems are increasingly digital. More and more credit card purchases instead of cash, more and more Amazon or Lazada purchases, more and more Uber and Grab rides rather than anonymous rides in cabs, jeepneys, and buses. More and more Beep card swipes than paper tickets. And more and more phones are online longer, feeding Smart and Globe and Waze, not to mention Facebook, information about where you are, what you’re doing, and what you like. Knowledge has always been power. The business that knows how to get and use this explosion of information will have a big edge over competitors who don’t. Kang says it was Filipino Silicon Valley icon Dado Banatao who nudged her into thinking data science could be AIM’s innovation. No stranger to recruiting foreigners, she looked abroad and found… two Filipinos in Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research, or A*STAR: Erika Legara and Christopher Monterola. In the interview, Kang and Legara talk about how more and more executive decisions rely on data science and how one day, there will be CEOs who didn’t rise up through sales, marketing, finance, or operations but data science. Legara admonished me several times against using the term “big data” because “big” is a relative term – what’s big to you may just be gigabytes or terabytes to her. She said that, big or small, the job is the same, a lot of it being a janitor cleaning up and organizing the data so that it is useful.  The jury is out on whether data science programs – there are similar programs in other business schools – will take their place alongside the traditional MBA and other business-oriented master’s programs. Some say executives can do data science without months or years of specialized study, or that it takes a scientific mind and temperament – Legara and Monterola are both physics PhDs, for example – to do the real work. But if innovation is the gauge, with next year’s master’s in data science coming on the heels of last year’s master’s in innovation and business, AIM finally appears to be making a serious bid to go back to the future. – Rappler.com Coco Alcuaz is a former Bloomberg News bureau chief and ANC business news head and anchor.

Supply and demand is taught on Day One of any basic economics class for two good reasons. First, it explains why prices go up during times of relative scarcity and down during times of relative plenty. Second – and perhaps more importantly – supply and demand arms students with a simple yet powerful framework by which to understand government intervention in markets, and how such policies can improve or worsen society’s welfare. In this article we use supply and demand to explain the fascinating economics of Uber and Grab, and predict the likely impact of LTFRB’s regulations on both their riders and drivers. Regulating the number of Uber and Grab vehicles Each Uber or Grab ride is mutually beneficial to the rider who hails it and the driver who supplies it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t bother transacting with each other on the apps. So when the government prohibits such rides – partially or totally – it eliminates such gains from trade. Riders and drivers can’t benefit from the rides they can’t take, and this reduces social welfare.  This is what happens when the LTFRB limits the number of Uber and Grab vehicles, whether by imposing quotas or prohibitions. Consider Uber’s one-month suspension that started on August 15. Beyond the many angry comments, hashtags, and memes that it inspired on Facebook and Twitter, the welfare losses from such suspension could prove huge in monetary terms. In the US, one study found that UberX generated about $6.8-billion worth of consumer welfare in 2015 alone. No such study yet exists for the Philippines. But given the hundreds of thousands of rides that don’t happen anymore because of the suspension, the losses for riders and drivers could easily amount to several millions of pesos daily. Regulating ‘surge pricing’ Market prices orchestrate the decisions of consumers and producers. In the case of Uber and Grab, riders want to hail vehicles when prices are low, while drivers want to ply the streets when prices are high (or “surge”). Governments worldwide are particularly keen to regulate “surge pricing.” It is often taken as a form of price gouging, akin to what happens when prices of basic commodities rise during times of short supply (think Yolanda or Marawi). In the previous Christmas season, the LTFRB warned Uber and Grab against these “unreasonable” price surges that “take advantage” of people. But far from abusing people, this “dynamic pricing” mechanism – afforded by algorithms – lies at the heart of the dependability of Uber and Grab. By allowing prices to rise and fall with changes in supply and demand, riders can reliably hail vehicles whenever, wherever. Figure 1 below shows surge pricing in action. Notice the rise of driver supply (green) in response to a rise in demand (red). Surge pricing makes sure that demand always meets supply, and a similar phenomenon occurs whenever it suddenly rains or it’s rush hour in Metro Manila.   Figure 1. UberX supply rises to meet higher demand. Source: Hall, Kendrick, and Nosko (2015). Tinkering with dynamic pricing – by imposing a price ceiling beyond which prices can’t surge – will not just diminish the reliability of Uber and Grab, but also prolong wait times. Entrants that lack dynamic pricing altogether (such as taxis using the new Micab) are also therefore unlikely to match the availability of Uber and Grab vehicles. To see the effect of price controls, one need only look at the first day of Uber’s recent suspension. Bookings for Grab rides jumped by 10% to 15%, and Grab managers responded by capping their surge rates at 1.4 (meaning their rates can’t go beyond 1.4 times the regular rates). But the effects of such a binding “price ceiling” are well-known in Econ 101: It creates excess demand, where demand exceeds supply. In Grab’s case, more riders were willing to hail rides than there were Grab vehicles on the road, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and longer wait times. Grab wanted to help riders with this surge cap, but ended up making them wait longer for their rides. Regulating work hours LTFRB also came up with a proposal to impose “minimum work hours” on Uber and Grab drivers. They reasoned that the franchises they issue will be put to waste if many drivers don’t ply the streets at least a certain number of hours per week. But again, this proposal ignores the centrality of supply and demand in Uber and Grab’s operations: With dynamic pricing, both prices and the number of cars on the road have to adjust freely to reflect supply and demand. During peak hours – when demand is high – prices rise to incentivize drivers to go out and drive. By contrast, during off-peak hours – when demand is low – prices go down, which turns off most drivers, many of whom choose not to drive. The net effect is that ride-hailing vehicles typically have higher “capacity utilization rates” than taxis. Simply put, Uber and Grab drivers are far likelier than taxi drivers to ply the streets with passengers in their cars. In a 2016 paper, two economists confirmed this when they looked at UberX in 5 American cities in 2015. Figure 2 shows that, in Los Angeles, UberX was 58% more efficient than taxis; in Seattle, 41%.

Capacity utilization rate = percent of miles driven with a passenger.   Again, no similar study yet exists for the Philippines. But if the LTFRB requires Uber and Grab drivers to work minimum hours, supply and demand tells us their vehicles will likely become idler on the road. Heed the law of supply and demand One might argue that, in all this, the LTFRB – with all its “draconian” and “antiquated” policies – is just doing its job. On the first day of Uber’s recent suspension, motoring journalist James Deakin said on Facebook, “rules are rules.” However, what is illegal is not necessarily bad economics, and what is legal is not necessarily good economics. The letter of the law is no excuse for LTFRB to spawn a flurry of discretionary policies that completely ignore (and even negate) the most basic lessons of economics. To make sure that there are enough rides when people need them, don’t impose caps on surge rates. To make Uber and Grab operations more efficient, don’t impose minimum work hours. To improve the welfare of the riding public, don’t kill a new industry that many people have come to love and depend on. The LTFRB can impose all the orders and decrees it wants, but it cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Try as it might, it will be as successful as the proverbial king who commanded the waves to retreat. – Rappler.com   The author is a PhD candidate at the UP School of Economics.

Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177848-weekly-video-highlights-july-30-august-5-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Videos you need to watch this week, July 30-August 5, 2017","date":"Aug 6, 2017 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Must-watch videos from this week","body":"Dear Rappler readers, It is the first week of August, and in the Philippines, the month began with the continuing woes in the Bureau of Customs.

DOTr Assistant Secretary for commuter affairs Elvira Medina raised the issue on Thursday, August 3, in a Senate public services committee hearing. “For the past weeks, the LTFRB had been bashed, they had been maligned. But my question is did any of the two, or any of these TNCs hire agencies using minions and all the other to bash the LTFRB?” Medina asked. However, she was not given the chance to continue her questioning, as Senate committee chair Grace Poe called her out. Poe said it is not wrong for either parties to hire public relations companies in a free market. “Ma’am I think we’re going off topic. I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There’s a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it’s propaganda, it won’t last). They can spend millions and it will not take off. For sure meron silang (they have) PR, lets just agree on that,” Poe said. Poe, also the public information committee chair, said she would not even try to regulate it. “No, I’m not going to regulate that. Pero yung fake news, pwede kayo maging liable diyan (but fake news, you can be held liable for that),” she said. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before Congress to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. Uber has called on the LTFRB to stop imposing ancient policies on today’s technological innovations.

This comes after Uber allegedly defied the agency’s July 26 order which states: “No further acceptance of additional accreditation of TNVS [Transport Network Vehicle Service providers] and/or activation of their accounts into the respondents’ respective systems shall be allowed effective immediately.” In their defense, Uber representative Joseph Castillo said they interpreted the order as still allowing them to accept new drivers without accrediting them. (READ: LTFRB orders Grab, Uber to deactivate drivers registered after June 30) Pointing to their order, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said that accepting new drivers was also forbidden by the order. “The language of the order is very clear. We need to put a stop to the false expectations [of] the public that they can still get themselves accredited, and worse, get their account activated so they can run on the road as [TNVS],” Delgra said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada added that even accreditation can be done as they used the Uber website themselves to troubleshoot accreditation. Lizada said they were able to activate 3 accounts from July 31 to August 1. Uber asked if the LTFRB was able to book a ride through the dummy accounts, to which Lizada said they did not try. Lizada added it was enough evidence that it was indicated in the application that their accounts were “activated”. “What I find difficult to comprehend is that they can add vehicles into their accounts inside the confines of their room…I wonder how many operators are now putting vehicles in their respective accounts because this can be another way of vehicles circumventing [the LTFRB orders],” Lizada said. When asked by the LTFRB for their side, Castillo declined to comment, requesting to be briefed further about the dummy accounts first. Castillo said they have yet to check their system to determine how many applicants they have accepted since July 26. The hearing comes while the LTFRB is engaged in talks with Uber and other transport network giant Grab in regulating ride-hailing services. Delgra urged Uber to be “patient” until a resolution is reached. “On good faith, we created the technical working group to get equilibrium for supply and demand…we hope that Uber will be patient enough to wait, [to] be compliant.

During the House committee hearing on the registration and franchising or lack thereof of the two companies, Uber said it has more than 66,000 “partners who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Out of that number, only over 2,500 have either a provisional authority (PA) permit or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise, which allows them to ply the streets of Metro Manila. Grab, meanwhile, has more than 52,000 vehicles accredited with only 3,000 to 4,000 of those vehicles possessing either PAs or CPCs from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “We are shocked, to say the least,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said, after the two companies stated the figures. Delgra said up until today, the number of vehicles registered under Grab and Uber had been unclear even to them.

Several lawmakers have filed bills before the House of Representatives to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. “Come to Congress, get your franchise, and don’t fight with LTFRB,” said AKO Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe, author of a bill that would regulate TNCs. Batocabe lost his nephew to a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore last month. Lawmakers also quipped that it was no wonder traffic in Metro Manila has gotten worse, given the sheer number of TNC vehicles on the road.    Both Uber and Grab, however, clarified that not all of the vehicles registered in their networks ply Metro Manila at the same time. Some “partners” are registered with both companies. Not all drivers are full-time either, meaning they only drive their vehicles for a few hours a day at most. Bong Suntay of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) said they are fine with operating alongside Uber and Grab so long as these ride-hailing services “are regulated just like [taxis].” “The requirements are almost the same. But the difference is in the compliance. So it’s an unequal application [of the rules],” said Suntay. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/176933-you-need-to-know-fuss-grab-uber-ltfrb-regulation-explainer/","title":"What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?","date":"Jul 28, 2017 9:26 AM PHT","snippet":"What's happening between the LTFRB and ride-hailing services? Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body’s crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What’s the issue about? Here’s a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year.  What’s the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB’s earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don’t have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it’s not their fault they are considered “colorum.” They point to the LTFRB’s earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB’s preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What’s the LTFRB’s position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it’s standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a “minority” in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB’s admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August.    How did the public react? With the LTFRB’s crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government’s move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What’s next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it’s considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176714-grieving-lawmaker-demands-grab-uber-legal-accountability-ltfrb/","title":"Grieving lawmaker demands Grab, Uber legal accountability","date":"Jul 25, 2017 9:09 PM PHT","snippet":"AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe lost his nephew two weeks ago in a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore","body":" MANILA, Philippines – If a crash happens involving a Grab or Uber driver, can the transport network companies (TNCs) be sued? This was the question that grieving lawmaker AKO BICOL Representative Rodel Batocabe posed to TNCs and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Tuesday, July 25, during the hearing of the House committee on Metro Manila. The committee hearing comes after the LTFRB encountered a regulation deadlock with the TNCs, as the LTFRB attempted to put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) cars in the metro. “Two weeks ago, namatay ang pamangkin ko sa Singapore, Uber. Yung driver hindi namatay, pero pamangkin ko namatay in Singapore…Let’s say dito sa Pilipinas nangyari ‘yun, sinong idedemanda ko?” Batocabe asked. (Two weeks ago, my nephew died in Singapore [while riding] Uber. The driver didn’t die, but my nephew did. Let’s say it happened in the Philippines. Who do I sue?) LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III pointed Batocabe to Memorandum Circular (MC) 2015-015, which says that the driver, not the TNC, will be liable. “The TNC shall be liable for failure to exercise due diligence and reasonable care, except if such non-compliance is due to acts or omissions outside of the TNC’s control. However, such liability shall not extend to actions of drivers, who are independent contractors who provide the transportation services directly to passengers,” the MC read. But for Batocabe, the TNCs should also take a part of the blame since they also accredit their drivers as their “partners.” “They can’t just operate with apps and everything without any regulation especially when it involves public utilities and public service [and when] it involves our people,” Batocabe said.  Batocabe recommended that the LTFRB issue a “remedial order” to reinforce their last MC increasing the accountability of the TNCs. Passenger insurance In their defense, representatives from Grab and Uber said that all rides booked through their applications are insured by the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency, setting insurance as high as P200,000 per passenger in case something untoward happens. They also said that they actively reach out to passengers when they get into trouble in their trips. Uber government relations chief Yves Gonzalez added that passengers can file a case against Uber if they find fault committed by the company itself. Meanwhile, the LTFRB chairman said he will raise Batocabe’s concern in the board’s technical working group meetings with Grab and Uber in the coming weeks. Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. In its July 11 order, the LTFRB directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. But Grab and Uber have filed separate motions for reconsideration. LTFRB is set to release their verdict on Wednesday. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/176536-grab-new-financing-didi-chuxing-softbank/","title":"Grab to raise $2.5B in new financing","date":"Jul 24, 2017 1:10 PM PHT","snippet":"The Singapore-based firm says it will use the fresh funds to bolster its leading position in the ride-hailing industry and invest in a mobile payment platform called GrabPay","body":" SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said Monday, July 24, it expects to raise $2.5 billion in financing, mostly from China’s Didi Chuxing and Japan’s Softbank, as it strengthens its lead over rival Uber.

Grab said it amounts to the largest single financing in Southeast Asia. Both Didi and SoftBank are already investors in Grab.

Grab offers private car, taxi, motorbike and carpooling services in seven countries and 65 cities across Southeast Asia, a region of 650 million people. “Starting with transport, Grab is establishing a clear leadership in Southeast Asia’s internet economy based on its market position, superior technology, and truly local insight,” said Didi founder and chief executive Cheng Wei in a statement. “Both companies look forward to working together with communities and policymakers across Asia to fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities in the upcoming transportation revolution.” Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of SoftBank, described Grab as “a tremendously exciting company in a dynamic and promising region.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/176337-documenting-daily-commute/","title":"Dear politicians, we’ve documented our commute so you don’t have to","date":"Jul 23, 2017 3:07 PM PHT","snippet":"We need solutions for our transportation woes and we need them fast","body":" Much has been said about commuting in Metro Manila, especially with the ongoing Uber-Grab-LTFRB hullabaloo. From bad drivers to overcrowded trains, the list of transportation woes doesn’t seem to end. Many say it’s a problem with policy: the government simply does not manage our transportation system well enough. But how can they, when our policy makers live in a bubble, travel in their posh cars, and are oblivious about the experiences of daily commuters? There have been calls to require our politicians to take public transportation, and some even did it as publicity stints. Now we know that would be hard request to make and many of you don’t have the time to take the jeep or ride the MRT. So we’ve decided to document our commute, in 360° photos, hoping that it would give you an idea on what it’s like to commute in Metro Manila. Manila traffic We are lucky enough to be able to take the afternoon to evening shift at work. This means that we are spared from the dreaded rush hour traffic. But roads are also congested in other times of the day; it simply is much heavier from 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/64EiCF/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“64EiCF”></iframe> {/source} Traffic in Manila is unpredictable. Commuting is a game of chance. You can try to leave during non-rush hour windows, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get stuck in heavy traffic jams. Even at noon, we still experience heavy traffic going to the office. The estimated distance from our place in Manila to our office in Kapitolyo, Pasig is just 8 kilometers. During late nights to past midnight, we can go home from work in just around 20 minutes, but earlier in the day, travel time can take up to 2 1/2 hours due to traffic jams and bottlenecks. There are some days when we have to take the morning shift and travel to work during the busiest times of the day. The longest time that we’ve been on the road for work was around 3 hours on a UV Express – from 6:30 to 9:30 in the morning. That’s 3 long hours that we could have spent doing something productive. But instead, we were right there sitting inside a cramped FX, praying to any higher being to give us patience. Now imagine the working majority who have to get through this every single day, reliving this over and over again – as if metro traffic is a part of our own personal hell. Our daily commute to work We have 3 options when we take public transportation going to work. We can either 1) ride a jeepney, then a UV Express; 2) ride a tricycle, then a jeepney; or 3) ride a tricycle, take the LRT 2, take the MRT, then a jeepney. We know that some have to endure a more grueling daily commute than any of these but just to give an example, let us show you a quick comparison of our different commuting scenarios. OPTION 1: Jeepney + UV Express = P48 pesos We usually take the first option because it seems more convenient and more affordable compared to our other travel choices.  The jeepney ride from our home to Quiapo costs only P8 pesos, then the UV Express from Quiapo to Kapitolyo costs P40 pesos.  When we ride the UV Express from the terminal, we have to pay for a fixed fare – which means we have to pay for the van’s whole trip to Pasig’s center even if we’re already disembarking halfway there. But we still take it nonetheless, instead of hailing a ride mid-route, because it’s the only way we can be guaranteed a seat.   When you ride from the terminal, you will have to wait for the FX to be filled before it leaves. Take note: Most of the time, it won’t leave until every seat is filled. It doesn’t matter to the drivers if people come in different sizes. When they say the FX can take 10 people, 10 people have to find a way to fit inside, no matter how uncomfortable and cramped it is already. Heck, there have also been reports of drivers being rude against plus-size passengers for taking up more space. At the terminal, we almost always have to wait up to 40 minutes before we can leave. That’s when we either have to wait for the FX to be filled or endure long lines waiting for a vehicle during rush hour. But then, taking this route is still the more convenient option because after leaving the terminal, the FX can already go straight to our destination without having to take in passengers midway (this is also why hailing FXs outside terminals is hard). OPTION 2: Tricycle + Jeepney = P68 pesos On some days, when there are less UV Express vehicles available, we take the second option. A tricycle ride from home costs P50 pesos because for reasons we don’t know, they do not have a fare matrix and every ride is considered a special ride with a special fare. It’s even more expensive than our jeepney ride from Mendiola to Kapitolyo which is just Php18.  The jeepney’s cheaper fare is a tempting bargain but we still prefer taking the UV Express when possible because of the comfort. Both rides can be crowded and cramped, but at least you get closed windows and air conditioning in the latter (Metro Manila smog isn’t exactly something you’d want to breathe in).  Personal space? There’s no such thing when you commute, squeezed inside public utility vehicles (PUVs) like sardines in tin cans.

But when jeepney drivers say the jeepney can take 14, 16 will ride, with 2 of those (sometimes even 4) standing at the PUJ’s stirrup. OPTION 3: Tricycle + LRT 2 + MRT + Jeepney = P94 pesos Our third option when going to work involves more ride transfers as compared with the other two. We seldomly use this option mainly because we dread MRT rides especially during rush hour.  Gone were the days when train rides mean convenience, efficiency, and better alternative to other existing modes of public transportation. Every day, commuters complain about overcrowded trains and stations.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/Gzvnz3/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“Gzvnz3”></iframe> {/source} The trains are faster, yes, but the long lines during rush hour will delay your travel also. Every now and then, you’d also see commuters venting their anger against other commuters. When you’re tired from work and forced to squeeze yourself in an overcrowded train, it’s easy to lose your temper. (READ: ‘The MRT Survival Guide‘ ) There are also the occasional delays brought about by the train breaking down. Whenever the trains malfunction, you can already be assured that there’d be traffic everywhere, with commuters having to take alternative modes of transportation. Safety Safety is an issue when commuting too. Commuters like us already know better than to bring out our phones and gadgets inside PUVs or put valuables and wallets inside our pockets. Many Manila commuters have experienced crimes, like ‘holdups’ and pickpocketing. In fact, we were careful ourselves about bringing out our camera to take photos for this story. Bad driving is also a safety problem. Many PUV drivers overspeed and swerve all over the road like daredevils, never mind that it’s making their passengers scared and uncomfortable.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/TAoZn2/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“TAoZn2”></iframe> {/source} Comparing costs All 3 commuting scenarios are still significantly cheaper than taking a cab or any of the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services available. Taking the public transportation going to work will cost us less than P100 pesos, a faily reasonable price since we are living in one city and working in another. Without any surge in pricing (which is rare), a GrabCar ride to work costs around P200 pesos. For Uber, it can go as high as P250 pesos. Taking the more affordable alternative, a GrabShare or UberPool ride can cost us around P140 to P150 pesos. During peak hours, travel costs can skyrocket to around P350 to P500 pesos.  Seeing these huge differences in prices, one would think that taking the public transportation is automatically the better option. But then aside from safety and convenience, time is definitely of huge value. People who are conscious about the value of their time may veer toward spending more on Uber or Grab rides if it means shorter travel time. But then again, convenient as they are, ride-hailing services are not really an option for many commuters who can only hope and wait for the government to solve their transportation woes. It’s already 2017 and the Philippines need a better transportation system, and we need it fast. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176157-daily-news-highlights-july-20-2017-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, July 20, 2017","date":"Jul 20, 2017 11:05 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

But impending government regulations are about to make it downright painful. Starting July 26, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend and fine Uber and Grab drivers, and impound their cars, if found lacking the necessary permits. Before this, LTFRB fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for allowing such illegal or “colorum” vehicles to ply the streets. The LTFRB maintains that this crackdown is meant to protect commuters. One official said, “Paramount to LTFRB is the demand and the need [of the] riding public.” But will this crackdown really help commuters? In this article we argue that, given the significant value of ride-hailing services to Filipino commuters, this crackdown will invariably hurt the riding public, not protect them. Consumer value  Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters? In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmario.limos%2Fposts%2F10155541327053147&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”626″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

The order demanded that Grab and Uber: Grab and Uber were recently fined P5 million each for allowing their drivers to work in Metro Manila despite their lack of permits. During their show-cause hearing held on Tuesday, July 11, both companies disclosed that about 80% of their drivers are driving without either a provisional authority (PA) permits or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise. Of Uber’s 10,054 active drivers, 5,850 were rejected to get PAs while 3,505 are still in the process of acquiring them.  Grab has yet to submit its tally to the board, but it had admitted to also having the same ratio of drivers who drive without permits. The LTFRB stopped releasing PAs since July 21, 2016 to limit the inflow of new TNVS drivers even as government tries to craft better guidelines for TNCs. If the LTFRB were to follow its initial guidelines in their Memorandum Circular 2015-016, Uber and Grab should have been closed down, but because of “public demand” they were only slapped with the fine.

Starting Thursday, May 18, it will be illegal for them to do so. On Thursday, the Anti-Distracted Driving Act will take effect. Under this new law, drivers are banned from using a “mobile communications device to write, send, or read a text-based communication or to make or receive calls.” They also cannot use “an electronic entertainment or computing device to play games, watch movies, surf the internet, compose messages, read e-books, perform calculations” while the vehicle is in motion or even when stopped at a red traffic light. Using gadgets, however, is not considered distracted driving if done using a hands-free function or similar devices. Concerns about implementation In a press conference of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) on Wednesday, May 17, concerns were raised about the implementation of the new law. For one, will it cover the placement of navigation systems on ride-hailing services like Grab and Uber? What motorists can do, said the authorities, is to set their destination on navigation apps before trips begin. Gadgets with these apps may be installed in a part of the vehicle that will not obstruct the driver’s view. If motorists need to find alternative routes while in traffic, they should pull over first. “Kung kinakailangan mong tumingin sa gadget mo na maalis ang tingin mo sa lansangan, kailangan itabi mo muna,” LTO Assistant Secretary Edgardo Galvante said. (If you need to look at your gadget and your eyes won’t be on the road, you should bring your vehicle to the side of the road first.) Another concern – how will traffic enforcers check compliance if vehicles are heavily tinted? The DOTr and the LTO reminded the public that there are standards to be followed for window tints. “[We] will be coming up with a public information campaign for the next 3 months but law [enforcement] agencies will not stop [in implementing] this,” said DOTr Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon. He added that every type of vehicle is covered by the new law, including motorcycles, bicycles, and even horse-drawn carriages. Exemptions will be granted only during emergency situations, fire, or crime. Violators, both public and private vehicles, will face fines ranging from P5,000 to P20,000. Aside from the DOTr and the LTO, the Philippine National Police (PNP), Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and local government units (LGUs) are authorized to enforce the Anti-Distracted Driving Act. Road safety According to Ronnie Corpus of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), they can also issue additional sanctions for public utility vehicle (PUV) operators who fail to educate their drivers about the law. Ultimately, the law is for the promotion of road safety. “Ayaw na natin madagdagan pa [ang mga aksidente]. One life lost from this is one too many. Pati ‘yung pagtawid sa kalsada, nagte-text or nagbabasa… ie-emphasize natin ‘to para ma-remind ang mga tao natin,” Galvante said. (We don’t want more accidents. Even those crossing the street are texting or reading. We will emphasize this to remind the public.) De Leon added: “Kung alam ‘nyo na ganito ang batas, ‘wag na kayo gumamit ng cellphone. Ang objective ng batas na ito is not on the enforcement, o sa dami ng huli, kung hindi sa naa-avoid na aksidente.” (If you already know about this law, don’t use your cellphone while driving. The objective of this law is not to catch as many violators as possible, but to prevent accidents.) Children on motorcycles Aside from the Anti-Distracted Driving Act, the Children’s Safety on Motorcycles Act will also be fully implemented. It will take effect on Friday, May 19. Under that law, a child riding a motorcycle must be able to comfortably reach the standard foot peg of the motorcycle and grasp the waist of the driver. The child also has to wear a helmet. Violators will face fines ranging from P3,000 to P10,000. (READ: What laws help keep road users safe in the Philippines?) – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/169161-globe-suspends-mobile-services-quiapo-after-blasts/","title":"Telcos suspend mobile services in Quiapo after blasts","date":"May 7, 2017 9:15 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Police requested that cellular signals be jammed for 48 hours in Quiapo, the site of twin explosions","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Telecommunications companies temporarily suspended mobile services in Quiapo and other nearby areas in Manila starting Sunday, May 7, a day after twin explosions rocked the capital.  Globe made the announcement in a Facebook post at 7:57 pm on Sunday. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fglobeph%2Fposts%2F10154896518309748&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”325″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} “In compliance with a directive from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) upon the request of the Philippine National Police, Globe Telecom will temporarily suspend mobile services for 48 hours in Quiapo, Manila and neighboring vicinities effective immediately,” said Globe.   Users in the affected areas will not be able to access phone calls, text messages, and mobile data services during the suspension. “Mobile services, including internet connection, would be restored as soon as the NTC has given clearance for the company to do so.

Saturday’s twin blasts happened a week after another bombing incident – along Quezon Boulevard, also in Quiapo – where 14 people were hurt.   – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/167086-asean-brands-that-have-gone-global/","title":"12 ASEAN brands that have gone global","date":"Apr 24, 2017 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Some familiar brands in the Southeast Asian region are making their mark around the world","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Jollibee, San Miguel Beer, Potato Corner – these are some familiar homegrown brands for Filipinos. But these proudly Pinoy brands are fast becoming known in Southeast Asia, with some even venturing beyond the region and bringing their products to the global market. Several brands from neighboring countries like Singapore and Malaysia are also making waves – from Grab, Malaysia’s ride-hailing service that rivals the US-based Uber, to Singapore bakery BreadTalk, with its signature open-plan kitchen that has established an international presence. Rappler lists down some regional brands in Asia that are making their mark around the world.  1. Grab (Malaysia) Grab – then known as GrabTaxi – was a gamechanger in the ride-hailing service industry when it first launched in 2012. Following in the success of the San Francisco-based Uber, the app makes it easy for passengers to hail taxis with just a few taps on their smartphones. The idea for Grab came about following a conversation between co-founder Anthony Tan and an Indonesian friend about the difficulty of hailing taxis in Malaysia. Tan, then a student at Harvard, worked with fellow Malaysian classmate Tan Hooi Ling to create a business plan for what would soon be launched in Malaysia as MyTeksi. The mobile app aimed to connect taxi drivers to passengers efficiently, making it easy for riders to get a ride and for drivers to be assured of their next passenger without aimlessly roaming around the city. (READ: GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes) Since its launch in Malaysia in June 2012, the app has launched in 6 more countries around the region: the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Manila saw the app’s launch in August 2013; it has since expanded to include other Philippine cities such as Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. Aside from booking taxis, the Grab app also offers booking of private cars, a ridesharing carpool service, and a motorcycle delivery service.  2. British India (Malaysia) Established in 1994, British India is a fashion label calling Malaysia – not Britain or India – as its home. It was founded by Pat Liew, who has more than 30 years of experience in the retail industry under her belt. Upon launching, the colonial era-inspired fashion brand had a cheeky tagline: “Presenting British India. An era of racism, oppression, injustice and nice outfits.” Within months since its launch, the brand came out with 4 outlets in Malaysia and 4 in Singapore by the mid-1990s. The Singapore launch, Liew said, was a testbed for the brand’s readiness for a global presence. Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the Malaysian brand has expanded into other countries in Asia, with more than 40 outlets in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.  3. BreadTalk (Singapore) BreadTalk entered the Philippine market in 2004, opening its first branch at Glorietta 4 mall in Makati City and enticing customers with its unique open-plan kitchen that offered a glimpse of how the bread was made. The Singapore-based brand was founded in April 2000, entering Singapore’s bakery industry with products that catered to traditional tastes as well as promoting and creating new varieties of bread. The bakery often has customized product offerings to fit the local flavors or preferences in their outlets in the region. They also launch new products to fit in with seasonal festivals and trends. The company opened its first overseas outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003. Since then, it has expanded to more than 900 outlets in 17 countries. Its brand portfolio also includes Toast Box, Food Republic, and Ramen Play. It manages the Singapore franchise of the Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung as well.  4. TWG Tea Company (Singapore) Luxury brand TWG Tea (which stands for The Wellbeing Group) was founded by Taha Bouqdib, Maranda Barnes, and Rith Aum-Stievenard in 2008, with Singapore as the launch base of the brand. The famous teashop, which brands itself as an upscale tea salon, offers more than 1,000 fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, as well as a variety of tea patisseries and delicacies. The “1837” in the company’s branding doesn’t refer to the date it was established, but refers to the year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore, when the island became a trading post for teas. The luxury brand quickly became well-known worldwide, with its teas being served in some of Singapore’s best hotels and in the front cabins of Singapore Airlines. Food chain Dean & Deluca also brought the brand to US markets, while Harrods brought the brand to London.   5. Potato Corner (Philippines) Known for its flavored french fries, this homegrown brand has been in the industry for 24 years, with more than 500 branches in the Philippines and several more in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Panama. Potato Corner opened its first kiosk outlet back in 1992. Two years since it started business, the brand opened 70 outlets across the country. It opened its first overseas outlet in 2006 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and entered the US market in 2012. By 2016, the brand had 800 stores and had begun operating in Thailand.   6. Jollibee (Philippines) Filipinos love Jollibee. And so does the rest of the world.  The fast food giant behind well-loved food products such as Chicken Joy and Yumburger traces its beginnings to 1975, when Filipino-Chinese founder Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice cream shop in Cubao, Quezon City. The ice cream shop would later become Jollibee’s first outlet, and would become the bedrock of the company’s rapid expansion for years to come. Jollibee boasts a presence of nearly 978 stores in the Philippines and 80 stores internationally to date. The company also operates other fast food chains including Chowking, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, and Red Ribbon. Jollibee has established an international presence in Canada, the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Brunei, Oman, and Qatar. The group caters not only to Filipinos working overseas but also to locals, who form part of the snaking lines that greet Jollibee’s store openings outside the Philippines. The company withstood the entrance of McDonald’s to the Philippine market in 1981 as it catered to distinct Filipino tastes, setting it apart from the international fast food giant.    7. URC (Philippines) Tracing its beginnings to as early as 1954, Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was started by Filipino businessman John Gokongwei, who learned to do business as a trade importer during World War II and the postwar years. The company started out as a corn mill under the name Universal Corn Products. This business would become the foundation for URC as it is known today – a household name in the snacks industry, agro-industrial operations, and commodities distribution. URC products are distributed under the company’s brands including Jack ‘n Jill, Robina Farms, Robichem, and Universal Corn Products. The company offerings include snacks, beverages, meat and poultry products, and commodities like sugar and flour. URC has expanded beyond the Philippines, distributing its products to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  8. San Miguel (Philippines) Established in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, San Miguel is Southeast Asia’s first brewery and the Philippines’ largest brewery to date. The Philippine brand is also part of one of the country’s largest conglomerates: San Miguel Corporation, which has businesses ranging from food, power, oil, and infrastructure to airlines, beverages, and packaging.   San Miguel has been under the control of prominent Filipino families such as the Zobel de Ayalas, Roxases, and Sorianos. It is currently largely owned and operated by Ramon Ang and Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. The company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Hong Kong, China, and Australia.  San Miguel exports its beer to major markets around the world and is consistently part of the top 10 bestselling beer brands worldwide. Its brands include Red Horse, Golden Eagle, and the company’s namesake beer products such as household brands San Miguel Pale Pilsen and San Miguel Light.  9. Integrated Micro-Electronics (Philippines) One of the Philippines’ oldest and largest conglomerates, the Ayala group has expanded its presence beyond the country, not only in the region but also globally. The group’s largest international operations is under the company Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated (IMI), a leading provider in electronics manufacturing services and power semiconductor assembly and tests services. Established in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins Incorporated, its services cater to a number of industries including telecommunications infrastructure, consumer electronics, solar energy, automotives, medical machines, and storage devices. IMI’s global presence includes manufacturing operations in China, Singapore, the United States, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Czech Republic. The company also has sales operations in Japan and Germany. The company recently marked its entrance into the aerospace industry and defense sector this year with its acquisition of STI Enterprises, a UK-based electronics manufacturing services company.  10. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) Another Filipino conglomerate, the Aboitiz group, has established an international presence with Pilmico Foods Corporation. Pilmico operates animal farms and also produces and distributes flour and animal feeds. The company was incorporated in 1958 as Central Philippine Milling Corporation by brothers Ramon and Vidal Aboitiz. In 1962, the company partnered with The Pillsbury Company of Minnesota, USA to establish operations in Mindanao. The company changed its name to Pilmico Food Corporation in 1990, upon the sale of all its shares to Aboitiz & Company. The company’s brand profile includes Wooden Spoon flours, Home Style, and Pilmico.  In 2013, Pilmico started exporting its products to the ASEAN market, prompting it to establish operations in Indonesia and Vietnam. At present, Pilmico flour is exported to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Hong Kong. Its feeds business also currently exports to Cambodia.  11. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (Malaysia) Founded by Chinese-Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts opened its first location in April 1971 in Singapore. Inspired by the legendary land found in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton, the Shangri-La group draws from the description of the land being an earthly paradise.  The group, now based in Hong Kong, operates 5-star luxury hotels and resorts in several locations and is famous for its world-renowned hospitality and services. According to its company website, the group’s brand portfolio includes Shangri-La, Kerry, and Hotel Jen and Traders branded properties.  Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts has a presence in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean islands, with over 40,000 rooms.    12. J.Co Donuts (Indonesia) The popular donut brand finds its roots in Indonesia, where it was established in 2005 by businessman Johnny Andrean. Known for its unique flavor offerings, the company opened its first outlet the same year.  In a little over 10 years, the company now operates over 214 stores in Indonesia and has expanded its presence to other countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  J.Co’s donuts are known for their high quality toppings like matcha green tea, premium dark chocolate, and roasted almonds. The brand is also popular for its playful product names and has expanded into other offerings such as frozen yogurt, beverages, and sandwiches. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/165386-grabtricycle-rides-mandaluyong/","title":"Grab offers free tricycle rides in Mandaluyong","date":"Mar 27, 2017 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Passengers can use the ride-hailing app to book a free tricycle ride in selected areas in Mandaluyong City from March 27 to April 5","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing service Grab is beta-testing a new service using a very Filipino mode of transportation: the tricycle.  From March 27 to April 5, Grab users in Mandaluyong City can avail of free tricycle rides to get around selected areas, using the app to hail and book a ride with just a few taps.  The service is available from 8 am to 5 pm, along the following streets:  To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabTricycle icon on their app, select pick-up and drop-off locations within the specific areas mentioned, and add the promo code GRABTRIKE before booking.

Grab's newest service, GrabShare, aims to do something about that","body":" MANILA, Philippines — Long, winding lines at the MRT station; suffocatingly packed buses and vans; the numbingly slow crawl of EDSA traffic — this is just a glimpse into a day in the life of a Metro Manila commuter. To say the traffic situation in the Philippines is bad would be an understatement. According to a Ford survey published in several major news sites, 30% of Filipinos consider commuting the worst part of their day. And it’s largely because of the current state of available public transportation options: crowded, uncomfortable, and inconvenient.   But as much as Filipinos hate it, there’s no avoiding it. Everyone still needs to go to work, visit their families, have dinner and drinks with friends. So what’s a commuter to do?  Companies are now coming up with new ride-sharing options that aim to change the way Filipinos look at getting from point A to point B.  A new way to commute In a media launch help last February 16 at The Brewery in BGC, Grab introduced GrabShare, the company’s first on-demand commercial ride-sharing service in the Philippines. With GrabShare, commuters can expect to share their ride with only 1 other passenger for up to 30% cheaper fares than GrabCar (Sedan). GrabShare allows a maximum of only one additional detour per ride, to make sure that the passengers’ time and money are not wasted. The new service will introduce cheaper fares for passengers and more income for drivers by allowing them to complete two bookings in one trip.   GrabShare works by using a “matching algorithm” to help passengers get to their destinations in the shortest time possible. The algorithm factors in the closest available drivers, travel time, overlap of trip routes, detour distance, and current traffic conditions before sequencing pick-ups and drop-offs so commuters can experience the most efficient and practical rides.  Grab claims that Filipinos who are used to sharing seats in cramped vehicles now have a more comfortable and convenient option for getting around.  Perks for both passengers and drivers GrabShare was first launched in Singapore in December 2016, and was considered a huge success. In 2 months, 2 million GrabShare rides were completed, covering a total distance of about 20 million kilometers. Since more passengers have been choosing GrabShare, Grab has improved their passenger matching rate by 15%, and with it, increases Grab drivers’ monthly incomes by 10%.  So in addition to providing Filipinos with a better option for ride-sharing, GrabShare also helps their drivers increase their potential earnings. While the traffic situation in Metro Manila still leaves much to be desired, at least now Filipinos are not limited to their usual commuting options. And ride-sharing doesn’t necessarily have to be associated with sweaty lines and cramped seating arrangements anymore. As people and technology evolve, so can the future of our commute. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/157499-ltfrb-rejects-uber-grab-franchise-applications/","title":"LTFRB rejects 15,000 Uber, Grab applications","date":"Jan 5, 2017 11:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Applicants submitted incomplete requirements or did not appear at hearings","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday, January 5, said it dismissed nearly half of franchise applications – over 15,000 out of some 32,000 – for ride-hailing services Grab and Uber.

The storm has left around a million Bicolanos in evacuation areas and left thousands of passengers hoping to spend their holidays in the Visayas stranded at the Matnog port. Camarines Sur has been placed under a state of calamity on Monday morning. The Philippines is not the only country that went on crisis mode on Christmas day, Chile was hit by a powerful earthquake on December 25. Thankfully, no casualties were reported. The year 2016 has been difficult for many. This is reflected in messages delivered by Church leaders on Christmas day. At the Saint Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis called for guns to fall silent in Syria. He also urged Israelis and Palestinians to “have the courage and the determination to write a new page of history.” In the Philippines, Lingayen Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, urged Filipinos to remain vigilant over extrajudicial killings even as they celebrated the holidays.  In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump considers dissolving his charitable foundation in the face of brewing conflict of interest issues. He is, however, prevented from doing so by ongoing investigations.  Closer to home, China sends its sole aircraft carrier into the Pacific for the first time – a move likely to raise regional tensions. A little good news to Filipino commuters: transport apps Grab and Uber heed the call of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to impose caps on holiday rates.

Uber cited the suspension of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications since July as a reason for the price surge. “Since the suspension of TNVS applications in July, we have been in frequent dialogues with the LTFRB to find workable solutions to meet the increasing demand for ridesharing options and avoid price increases brought about by disproportionate supply and demand, longer wait times for riders, or having no available cars on the road,” Uber said.

He calls it “a little bit of smart technology that could make a big impact on how the Catholic Church brings the mercy of God and the joy of the Gospel to our contemporary world.” The Archbishop posted about the event on his Twitter account:  {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Thanks to all who took part in today&#39;s very successful launch of our new Mass &amp; Confession finder app in Rome especially <a href=”https://twitter.com/viganoctv”>@viganoctv</a>. <a href=”https://t.co/nAeq3hCgLd”>pic.twitter.com/nAeq3hCgLd</a></p>&mdash; Archbishop Cushley (@leocushley) <a href=”https://twitter.com/leocushley/status/801178749639258114″>November 22, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src=”//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source} Time also says that the app reportedly uses technology by software firm Musemantik. The app also appears to be for sale to dioceses around the world. In the Vatican Radio article, Dr Maciej Zurawski, the founder and CEO of Musemantik, reportedly said that he hopes that Catholic dioceses across the globe will purchase the new app. The article also said the Musemantik hopes that the high-profile launch in Rome “will persuade other dioceses throughout the Catholic Church to purchase the app in the weeks to come.”  On the app’s official site, its proposed benefits for dioceses around the world were listed down: Given these benefits, do you think this is an app that local dioceses should get a hold of? – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/146763-grab-raises-750m-investors/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab raises $750M from investors","date":"Sep 20, 2016 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raises the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing startup Grab said Tuesday, September 20, it has raised $750 million from investors to expand in burgeoning Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, as it aims to build its lead over US-based rival Uber in the region. The new investments led by Japan’s SoftBank Group raised the Singapore-based firm’s total capital to more than $1.0 billion, it said in a statement. Competition between Uber and local startups has grown fierce in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and a rising middle class. Grab is considered the leading ride-hailing platform in the region, operating in nearly twice as many cities as Uber, with the startup claiming up to 1.5 million bookings a day. Singapore state investment agency Temasek Holdings was an early investor in the firm.  Grab said participants in the recent round of fundraising included both new and existing investors which it did not name, but reports last month said China’s Didi Chuxing was among those planning to back the firm. The two companies are already partners in an alliance that also includes India’s Ola and US-based Lyft Inc, allowing users to book rides while traveling to a country covered by any of the 4 apps. Grab chief executive and co-founder Anthony Tan said the latest investment was “the largest in the history of Southeast Asia consumer technology”. “We are particularly excited about the growth opportunity in Indonesia, where we see an almost US$15 billion market for ride-hailing services alone,” he said. The move follows Uber’s decision to sell its business in China to Didi Chuxing last month, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. Grab operates in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Its core product platform includes private cars, motorbikes and taxi-hailing services which are rapidly gaining popularity in the region.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/143070-intramuros-grabkalesa-promotion/","title":"Going around Intramuros?

Once a common mode of transportation back in the Spanish colonial period, they are now popular rides for tourists looking to do some sightseeing around the Walled City. Ride-hailing app Grab puts the spotlight on the kalesa this weekend, offering an on-demand booking service that takes passengers around Intramuros for free. From 2 pm to 5 pm on August 20 and 21, passengers can take a free ride using the app’s special GrabKalesa option. The trip begins and ends at Plaza Roma in Intramuros.   To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabKalesa icon on the Grab app during the booking date and period. The pick-up and drop-off points should both specify Plaza Roma.  The ride will pass through the streets of the historic Walled City, taking visitors around to see popular tourist sites in Intramuros, such as the Manila Cathedral, Palacio del Gobernador, Baluarte de San Andres, Casa Manila, San Agustin Church, and Fort Santiago, among others. Each kalesa can seat up to 3 passengers only, and the trip will last 30 minutes. In its promotional page, Grab said the promotion aims to promote and recognize the kutseros – the drivers of the horse-drawn carriages – and the vast knowledge of history and culture that they impart to their passengers on every trip.

Transportation Undersecretary for Air Roberto Lim confirmed via text message that the transportation department on Monday, July 18, started allowing regular metered taxis to enter NAIA terminals – a move seen to address the high demand during peak hours. This means passengers will have more choices of transportation – from coupon taxis to regular metered taxis. Last March, private vehicles operating under the app-based ride-hailing service Grab were allowed to pick up and drop off passengers at the NAIA terminals.

The app allows payment with cash or credit card, which the company says makes it more accessible for drivers and riders.  “Whether you are behind the wheel or on the back of a motorbike, we want to make Uber a service that is truly for everyone. UberMOTOR is a great way to help hundreds of thousands of people get access to cheap, reliable transportation, and get around Jakarta, with a little help from technology,” said Dian Safiti Wibowo, Uber’s Head of Communications in Indonesia. In a statement, uberMOTOR said its new motorbike service is the most affordable ride in town. Rides are calculated using a base fare of 1.000Rp, while every additional kilometer is charged at 1.000Rp and every minute is worth 100Rp.  Other leading motorbike service charge 15,000Rp for up to 5 km.

The partnership produced the OpenTraffic Initiative, launched on Tuesday, April 5. It is designed to provide real-time data to traffic management agencies and city planners. The open source platform uses GPS data taken from smartphones in Grab’s vehicles and translates it into traffic statistics which include speeds, flows, and delays at intersections. This is done real-time with data transmitted every 6 seconds. The data is then compiled in the OpenTraffic platform where information can be used by government agencies to study critical areas in traffic management. These areas include peak hour analysis along key streets, travel time reliability, and street vulnerability to bad weather and traffic accidents.  “If governments can see precisely what traffic congestion looks like in the Philippines, it can alleviate its impact by optimizing traffic signals, revising the planning of public transportation routes and schedules, and making effective decisions for implementation of key infrastructure such as overpasses,” said Deevya Desai, Grab’s regional head of public affairs, at the platform’s launch. In addition, Grab and the World Bank plan to integrate another open source tool called DRIVER, by late May, which will provide real-time notifications of traffic incidents to government agencies. The application is designed to help governments identify and prioritize cash-prone areas and allow for faster response times. While the Philippines was chosen as the initial country to pilot the project, Grab and the World Bank plan to eventually make it available to all governments throughout Southeast Asia. “Through this initiative, the Philippines will leapfrog traditional approaches to road safety, traffic management, and planning,” said Holly Krambeck, senior transportation specialist at the World Bank.  From calculators to Excel sheets The newly launched platform will be made available to the government at zero cost. The World Bank and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) have trained 200 government staff from different agencies to use it. The initial agencies with personnel trained include the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Philippine National Police (PNP), Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and the Cebu City Transportation Office “As they say whoever controls information controls decision-making. Once you have timely and reliable info, then decision-making and implementations become easy,” said DOTC Undersecretary for Planning Rene Limcaoco. Limcaoco said the agencies will initially use the data to focus on travel patterns and durations so that they can get an accurate picture of where the demand for transportation is and to which specific destinations. With that information, he added, “the government can then plan and implement through the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), more responsive public transportation policies and/or new rules.” The upgrade was needed because, until recently, the government’s major source of traffic data came from manual surveys. Limcaoco pointed out that these surveys ran the risk of being obsolete once completed due to the length of time needed to conduct them. “It’s like moving from manual calculators to Excel,” he said. Real-time data, however, is not a panacea to all of the country’s data collection woes, according to Ricardo Sigua, director of the UP Institute of Civil Engineering. It is a good indication of the level of usage of roads but to fully understand traffic, other variables involved such as traffic law and density should also be considered, he explained. “Most of the data for this platform will be gathering from Grab drivers which is a subset of road users. To have an overall assessment of what’s going on, on the road, we need to complement this project with other activities,” Sigua said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126810-photos-protest-jakarta-taxi-drivers/","title":"IN PHOTOS: Angry Jakarta taxi drivers violently protest ride-hailing apps","date":"Mar 23, 2016 10:31 AM PHT","snippet":"Scenes of the protest show the demonstration turned violent as drivers stopped driver of ride-hailing apps to attack them","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – On Tuesday, March 22, a protest organized by the Association of Public Transport Drivers (PPAD) against ride-hailing apps – Uber, Grab and the motorbike service Go-Jek – turned violent.

Drivers yelled and waved rally signs, and blasted their horns throughout the protest.   An ojek rider was also attacked by taxi drivers during the protest, and was forced to get off his motorbike and run away. Drivers smashed the rider’s helmet and overturned his motorbike then chased him.  Another rider wearing a Grab Bike jacket was stopped by taxi drivers. The drivers tried to take off his jacket.   “It is okay to protest peacefully but attacking is absolutely illegal,” Mohammad Iqbal, spokesman for the Jakarta Police, said. He added that police will surely move against those who engaged in illegal acts.  Several armed police with guns and riot shields guarded the parliament building.

With the current congested and crippled state of mass transportation in the city, there are only so many options for the busy Manila commuter.  Late last year, ride-booking service Grab launched the latest iteration of their service: GrabBike. Aside from booking a taxi, car, or even a helicopter, the app’s users can now also book a motorcycle to get around Metro Manila. (READ: Road-testing the GrabBike)  Since its launch in the Philippines in 2013, the Grab app has had 12 million downloads, making GrabBike accessible to virtually anyone with a smartphone. Last Feb 4, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) issued a Cease and Desist Order for the service.  The LTFRB decision was founded on concern for passenger safety. But until the LTFRB releases revised regulations for motorcycles, only 4-wheeled vehicles will be allowed to offer public transport. Meanwhile, other 2-wheeled unofficial public transportation systems like habal-habals remain unapprehended. While the Cease and Desist Order is in place, around 800 registered GrabBike riders will be jobless and without income. Meanwhile, options for public transportation within Metro Manila remain few and far between. What’s your take on this issue? Are you or aren’t you happy with the transport options currently available? Do you think the Government should bring back GrabBike? Tell us. On Tuesday, March 8, we will be holding a Twitter conversation with the hashtag #CommuterWatch based on the issue of alternative public transport options for the daily commuter.

In a regional launch in Singapore on Thursday, January 28, GrabTaxi rebranded itself as Grab to reflect its new range of services. Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012. (READ: GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli) The new Grab encompasses all its services: taxis (GrabTaxi), private car services (GrabCar), motorcycles (GrabBike), social carpooling (GrabHitch), and last mile delivery (GrabExpress), under one umbrella brand.  “We’ve grown over the years – and we’re now much more than a taxi app. This new brand is an important evolution that represents our goal to outserve our customers,” Grab Group CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said during the regional launch. Dominance in Southeast Asia Since its establishment in 2012, Grab has evolved from a taxi-booking application to Southeast Asia’s largest land transport company.  Grab now has over 200,000 drivers and more than 11 million mobile downloads. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) The company’s data show that in mid-2015, it experienced 35% average monthly growth in GrabCar rides and a 75% average monthly growth in GrabBike rides across the region. These figures are encouraging as Grab aims to move far ahead of other ride-hailing companies like Uber. (READ: Uber plans APEC region expansion despite rough ride) “We have set the benchmark in the industry, with the most number of transport services that cater to all price points, all available in one app,” Tan said. Grab’s CEO said his company will “grow from the current 28 cities across 6 Southeast Asian countries,” but did not specify where.  “What I can say is we are focusing all our energy in providing better transport services in the region,” Tan said. Grab’s regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, “Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.” Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.   On a ‘friendlier’ road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. “We’re not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It’s not all about profit,” Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to “provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,” Goh added. According to Goh, Grab’s end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"}]}
