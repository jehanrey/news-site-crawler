Regional Director Jerry G. Tizon, in an interview Thursday, said they are looking forward to an increase in their almost PHP1 billion scholarship budget last year so they can have more scholars. “Hopefully this year our scholarship allocation will increase further so we can help more. I believe with the special commitment of our central office to legislative partners, it’s going to be the same figure or even more than that will be downloaded to us,” he said. TESDA Western Visayas has 13 training technology institutes and 201 private technical-vocational institutions (TVI) as partners. With its partners handling the training, TESDA will focus on the conduct of assessment to make sure that scholars are trained according to the standards and competencies set by the government. TESDA offers over 280 training qualifications but if there are programs not included in their menu, Tizon said that they will try to come up with a registration program so it will be made available in the region. “Training and assessment in TESDA is free. I am urging them to grab this opportunity and coordinate with our provincial offices for their desired training,” he added. Those who are interested are advised to get in touch with TESDA’s provincial offices or at the regional office, training institutions or TVI partners. Once a training qualification meets the required number of scholars, then there will be an orientation or training induction program. With the pandemic, he said that they might adopt the same strategy last year where they will go on blended learning consisting of face-to-face classes for practical exams and online for theory.

Edwin Pasahol, chief of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) - Bureau of SME Development Program Development Division, said the agency is promoting an intensive shift to digitalization as physical stores have lost clients since the global health crisis began in March 2020. “We highly advocate digitalization and promoting digital operations in partnering with service providers that are into platforms, so they can continuously operate their businesses and not eventually shut down,” he said in mixed English and Filipino during a recent webinar. Pasahol said the “DTI Ctrl+Biz Reboot Now!” program offers a series of free webinars that targets MSMEs which need to transform their operations digitally. “Enablers across the entire e-commerce ecosystem will provide their expertise and experiences on how to take advantage of the digital space. We are also coordinating and partnering with service providers like Grab, Shopee, and Lazada, the most popular platforms now, so that they will guide our MSMEs on how to partner with them, how to avail of their services, and of course, how to be part of their operations,” he added. Pasahol said the agency also provides information to MSMEs on the different technology tools, applications, platforms, and resources available to reinvent businesses amid the crisis. The tools or solutions specified in https://sites.google.com/view/tech-resources-for-msmes/home are categorized based on functionality across multiple categories such as e-commerce, e-payment, digital marketing, logistics, work-from-home collaboration tools, productivity tools, webinars, finding an expert, and government resources. “(We) combine or consolidate different technology tools, application platforms, and resources so that they can cope with the challenges of community quarantine,” he said. Apart from programs assisting the MSMEs, Pasahol said the government has come up with the Youth Entrepreneurship Program to support the business ideas of the younger set and help them become productive. “It will help young Filipinos develop their entrepreneurial skills by offering them a comprehensive package of interventions and efficient initiatives intended to harness public and private resources and direct these resources to the development of youth entrepreneurship,” Pasahol said. Director Noel Catibog of the Technology Transfer and Promotion Division of the Philippine Council of Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD), an agency under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), also bared support mechanisms for startups and MSMEs. Catibog said these include the National Agri-Aqua Technology Business Incubation (ATBI) program, the agri-aqua business hub under the DOST-PCAARRD Innovation and Technology Center, DOST startup grant fund program, Regional Agri-Aqua Innovation System Enhancement program, and the agri-aqua innovation challenge comprising startup pitching competition and startup mentorship. The ATBI program is one of the strategies identified by DOST-PCAARRD to commercialize the technologies and outputs of local agri-aqua research and development inputs. It encourages, supports, and nurtures the development of mature agriculture, aquatic, and natural resources-based technologies into viable commercial agribusiness ventures for economic development.

Among such efforts were setting new policies, establishing partnerships, enforcing relevant laws and regulations, as well as enhancing DENR's information and education campaign (IEC) since climate change and other threats are increasingly hounding ENR anywhere in the world.  \"In this season of joy and beyond, let us do our best to give our people cleaner air to breathe, cleaner surroundings with reduced waste, ample refreshing water to drink, a healthy environment to enjoy and more productive natural resources for a provident and sustainable future,\" Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu urged DENR officials and employees nationwide through his 2021 message for the agency's traditional Christmas lights switch-on event.  Cimatu hopes the switching of the Christmas lights will inspire them to further perform their duties \"with renewed vigor.\"  This year, Hamburg-based World Future Council conferred its Future Policy Award (FPA) on DENR for coming up with and successfully implementing DENR Administrative Order (DAO) 2013-24, the chemical control order (CCO), which prohibits the use of lead and lead compounds in paint and other products nationwide.  However, Cimatu assured that DENR would not rest on its laurels after emerging as among the five international 2021 recipients of FPA which recognizes international policies aimed at benefiting present and future generations.  Being chosen for the award \"will inspire us to further strengthen implementation of our chemical control policy and to develop other policies to protect human health and the environment,\" he said.  According to WHO, sources of environmental lead contamination include mining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling.  The WHO said continued use of leaded paint, gasoline, and aviation fuel in some countries is also a source of contamination.  Lead adversely affects multiple systems in a person's body, the WHO warned.  To further guard against toxic chemical elements, the DENR issued this year DAO 2021-008 (CCO for Cadmium and Cadmium Compounds) and DAO 2021-009 (CCO for Chromium VI Compounds).  Cadmium and chromium VI compounds have various industrial applications but can adversely affect the environment and human health so there is a need to increase awareness about the availability of technically superior and safe alternatives to these elements, DENR's Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) said.  Making history  The DENR and EMB made history this year by being able to close all remaining illegal open dumpsites in the country to comply with the two decades old Republic Act 9003, otherwise known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act.  \"This accomplishment mirrors the successful implementation of our Solid Waste Management Program, one of DENR’s 10 priority programs for intensified environmental protection,\" Cimatu said.  He reminded local government units (LGUs) concerned to rehabilitate the closed dumpsites without harming the environment.  The National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC), which Cimatu chairs, boosted the implementation of RA 9003 by finally coming up this year with the country's list of non-environmentally acceptable products (NEAPs).  Plastic straws and plastic coffee stirrers are the initial NEAPs in such a list.  The DENR is advocating the use of environment-friendly alternatives to both products and other NEAPs, which NSWMC will include in the list to help reduce the volumeof waste for disposal.  Recognizing increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment around the country due to Covid-19, the DENR distributed to LGUs yellow trash bins where people can dispose of these items after use.  Disposing personal protective equipment (PPE) gears in the bins will help prevent spread of Covid-19 and contamination of land and water, the DENR said.  The EMB also announced requiring operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to process and disinfect infectious waste materials they are handling.  Processing and disinfecting such materials are necessary so these may qualify as raw materials for co-processing in cement kilns, it said.  Global warming  The Philippines further strengthened its bid to comply with Montreal Protocol, the international agreement promoting protection of Earth's ozone layer through phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS) like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCFs) that have high global warming potential.  In September, DENR and the UN Industrial Development Organization spearheaded the virtual kickoff of HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP) Stage II's second tranche which aims to help the Philippines further reduce its HCFC consumption.  Both partners cited HCFCs and several other ODS with high global warming potential aggravating Earth's warming.  Phasing out such ODS will not only save the ozone layer from further damage but is also a way of helping mitigate climate change, the partners said.  Ozone layer is the atmosphere's ozone molecule-dense portion that protects Earth from overexposure to ultraviolet radiation of the sun.  Impaired health, reduced plant, and fishing yields as well as damaged ocean ecosystems are among such overexposure's ill effects, experts said.  Scientists’ discovery of a hole in the ozone layer fueled international action on the matter  -- including UN member-countries' adoption of Montreal Protocol in 1987.  HPMP's implementing agency is United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the specialized UN agency promoting industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization and environmental sustainability, while DENR is the undertaking's lead government agency.  This month, the Philippines  -- through DENR -- joined other member-countries of intergovernmental organization Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA) in signing the Preah Sihanouk Ministerial Declaration.  Such a declaration aims to strengthen green recovery and ocean governance in East Asia, the DENR said.  \"Through the declaration, the PEMSEA member-countries endorsed PEMSEA Roadmap to 2030 as the region’s decadal strategic guide anchored on  the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia vision and commitment to blue economy,\" it added.  Continued rehabilitation  The government continued rehabilitation of Boracay Island, Manila Bay as well as Cagayan, Bicol, and Marikina rivers to improve environmental conditions.  The DENR-led Boracay Inter-Agency Task Force reported being on track to complete Boracay's rehabilitation by 2022.  Work to expand Manila Bay's dolomite beach is in progress so the government can open this area to the public next year, the DENR said. Creating the beach is among activities for Manila Bay's rehabilitation which aims to make this water body fit again for contact recreation. Authorities also aim to increase water-carrying capacity and facilitate water flow of Cagayan, Bicol and Marikina rivers so there will be a lower risk for these major channels to overflow during inclement weather and spill water that will flood surroundings. Rehabilitation activities the government identified for such rivers include removing sediment and debris through dredging to improve water-carrying capacity and flow, as well as planting bamboo, particularly along the river banks to help prevent erosion. Downpour from successive tropical cyclones in late 2020 caused water in Cagayan, Bicol, and Marikina rivers to overflow, spill into and flood surrounding areas, prompting creation of DENR-led multi-agency Build Back Better Task Force for the whole-of-government approach to post-disaster rehabilitation and recovery in the country's typhoon-affected areas. Metal price The country’s metallic mineral production value grew 22.34 percent to PHP121.16 billion in January to September this year from PHP99.03 billion in 2020, DENR's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) said. \"Strong metal price coupled with better mine production of nickel ore during the review period was the vital factor for this development,\" it said. The MGB added that prices of gold, silver, copper, and nickel remained bullish year-on-year. The country's mining prospects remain upbeat as MGB said passage of critical policies this year \"created an optimistic buzz in the minerals sector.\" \"Such policies include DAO 2021-12 (Guidelines for the Automatic Renewal of the Exploration Period and the Timely Filing of Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility Under the Exploration Permit, Mineral Production Sharing Agreement, Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement and similar mining tenements), EO 130 (Amending Section 4 of EO 79 series of 2012 Institutionalizing and Implementing Reforms in the Philippine Mining Sector, Providing Policies and Guidelines to Ensure Environmental Protection and Responsible Mining in the Utilization of Mineral Resources), DAO 2021-25 (Implementing Rules and Regulations of EO 130, Amending Section 4 of EO 79 series of 2012) and DAO 2021-29 (Extended Application Period for the Disposition of Residual Stockpiles),\" it said. As of Oct. 31 this year, the MGB said only about 2.48 percent of the Philippines' total land area of 30 million hectares were covered by mining tenements. However, with EO 130 issuance, the government can again approve mineral agreements, it said. The EO 130 lifted the moratorium on mineral agreements under Section 4 of EO 79. Updating, amending  The updating of MGB's geohazard maps continues so the public can access the latest information about flooding and rain-induced landslide risks around the country. \"As natural disasters bring great structural changes to Earth and impact lives of Filipinos, updating geohazard warnings is important in order to have widespread information on hazard susceptibility of areas,\" the MGB said. The DENR Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) this year maintained its call for the government to amend RA 9147, otherwise known as the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. \"RA 9147 must be urgently amended and strengthened as illegal wildlife trade (IWT) has become increasingly sophisticated and organized two decades after the law’s passage,\" the BMB said. It said IWT in the country has already evolved into an industry valued at some PHP50 billion annually as crime syndicates involved in this illegal activity are exploiting loopholes in RA 9147. Such loopholes include RA 9147's vague language as well as low fines and penalties that fail to deter IWT, it said. \"A  strong legal framework will improve enforcement mechanisms, strengthen inter-agency cooperation against IWT, and result in a more forceful and dynamic response to this transnational crime,\" it added. The BMB is not discounting the possibility of IWT facilitating the transmission of disease-causing viruses and other pathogens from wildlife species to humans. The 4th National Environment Law Enforcement (NELE) Summit this July produced a resolution supporting the enactment of a law that will create DENR’s Environmental Protection and Enforcement Bureau (EPEB). NELE participants came up with the resolution, noting the Philippines is both a biodiversity gem and hotspot. The Philippines hosts about two-thirds of biodiversity on Earth, they said. IWT, pollution, habitat destruction, illegal logging, and illegal mining are among factors degrading and depleting biodiversity nationwide, they added. EPEB's creation will help DENR mount an increasingly science-based nationwide crackdown on environmental crimes. The DENR said such a crackdown is necessary as environmental crimes are becoming more organized, sophisticated, and even transboundary. The EPEB, which DENR aims to have, will facilitate capacity-building for enforcers concerned so they can better crackdown on environmental crimes. Despite EPEB's absence, the DENR and its partner-agencies reported still being able to apprehend environmental violators and confiscate trafficked wildlife species, hot logs, and even equipment used in illegal quarrying. Protecting wetlands Cimatu sees a need for legislation aimed at protecting the country's wetlands. \"There has been no single Philippine legislation that advances wetland conservation and its wise use,\" he said. Wetlands provide various ecological services so these ecosystems must be protected, conserved, and wisely utilized, he added. Experts said among wetlands' services are natural water quality improvement, flood protection, and shoreline erosion control. Wetlands also provide opportunities for recreation and aesthetic appreciation. Sasmuan Pampanga Coastal Wetlands this year gained the distinction of being the Philippines' eighth Ramsar site or wetland of international importance, the DENR said. Cimatu considers such distinction a \"landmark accomplishment that will become DENR’s motivation to further preserve and conserve protected areas and wetlands across the country.” The Philippines' other Ramsar sites are Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary, Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area, Naujan Lake National Park, Negros Occidental Coastal Wetlands Conservation Area, Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park and Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. The DENR is partnering with telecommunications giant PLDT Inc. and its subsidiary Smart Communications Inc. to protect Caimpugan and other peatlands of Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary. Protected areas The BMB and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center this year formally agreed to work on developing PPPs that are appropriate for protected areas (PAs) nationwide. Both agencies decided to establish policy guidelines that aim to ensure PPPs in PAs are aligned with sustainable development and biodiversity principles. Some possible PA-based PPPs are eco-tourism and biodiversity-friendly enterprises, the PPP Center said. PPPs are contractual arrangements between the government and the private sector so the latter can build, operate, and maintain infrastructure facilities and provide services that the former traditionally delivers. PA refers to identified portions of land and water set aside because of their unique physical and biological significance, managed to enhance biological diversity and protected against destructive human exploitation, said RA 7586, otherwise known as the National Integrated Protected Areas System or NIPAS Act of 1992. Forest interventions This year, DENR and its Forest Management Bureau (FMB) spearheaded the launch of the Save Our Watershed (SOW) campaign. Such a campaign aims to help further generate public support for protecting and conserving the country's watersheds as these provide various ecological services but are threatened by deforestation, pollution, inappropriate agricultural practices, and other factors. SOW also aims to raise public awareness about and promote action for sustaining and even building on milestones of FMB's Forestland Management Project (FMP). FMP covers forest and watershed interventions in Upper Magat and Cagayan river basin where Ifugao, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino provinces are Upper Pampanga river basin where Nueva Ecija province is, and Jalaur river basin where Iloilo province is. Such a project is focusing on those river basins due to the extent of degradation there, the FMB said. FMB and other agencies are encouraging the private sector to invest in Philippine forestry. Guidebooks on the matter are available for potential investors in plantation development, cattle grazing, ecotourism, and other forestry-related development activities, the FMB said. The Department of Trade and Industry believes private investments in industrial tree plantation development will complement efforts to improve products, industry, and value chain, the FMB said. The National Economic and Development Authority sees the need to sustain knowledge-sharing as well as adapt innovations that will help optimize goods and services from forests, it said. Reforestation through the nationwide DENR-led National Greening Program (NGP) continued despite Covid-19. The latest available official FMB data show that since NGP launched in 2011, this program has already greened almost 2.10 million hectares of denuded land nationwide using around 1.8 billion tree seedlings. The DENR launched NGP to help promote environmental stability and poverty alleviation, provide needed resources like timber and food, as well as enhance ecological services which include trees sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions that are raising the global temperature so climate is changing. For its 2021 observance of Arbor Day and 158th year of Philippine forestry service, the FMB and various companies partnered on holding the virtual Bike, Hike, Plant+ tree-planting activity. The companies were takbo.ph, Grab Philippines, Energy Development Corporation, Forest Foundation Philippines, M&S Company, Inc. and TreeDefi, the FMB said. \"A total of 777 bikers and hikers were able to complete approximately 90,515 kilometers of biking and hiking (plus walking and running), as verified by takbo.ph -- these are equivalent to 3,750 seedlings that will be planted in our partners’ conservation sites in Quirino, Albay, Quezon City, and Sultan Kudarat,\" it added. ENR-related disputes The DENR further expanded its pool of alternative dispute resolution officers (ADROs) to facilitate the settlement of ENR-related disputes. Conduct of online comprehensive alternative dispute resolution (ADR) accreditation training program and mediation properly made such expansion possible despite Covid-19, DENR's Lands and Management Bureau (LMB) said. \"An additional 106 ADROs, divided into four batches, earned their accreditations in 2020 and 2021, bringing to 330 the number of DENR employees that were accredited as ADROs,\" LMB said. DAO 2005-18 mandated the adoption of ADR principles and procedures in resolving appropriate ENR conflicts. According to the DENR, resolving such conflicts through ADR has been successful. \"Since its rollout in the lands sector in 2018, a total of 1,020 cases have been referred for ADR as of Dec. 8, 2021 with some 281 cases still under ADR  proceedings,\" the LMB said. LMB also said a total of 739 ADR cases \"have been mediated during the period of which 321 disputes, or 43 percent of 739 cases, were settled while 418 others failed to reach a settlement.\" Such percentage accomplishment is far better than the near-zero percent conflict resolution rate LMB had before adopting ADR, the bureau said. The Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau (ERDB) of DENR launched its pilot mentorship program.    This program aims to boost ERDB's capacity to produce, based on this bureau's studies, articles that can be published in 'Sylvatrop.' 'Sylvatrop' is DENR's official technical journal covering research findings on ecosystems and natural resources. \"Ten ERDB studies were selected for the pilot program,\" ERDB said. Such studies are on germination, bioremediation, urbanization, solid and hazardous wastes, climate change, governance, and market chain analysis, it added. ERDB also partnered with Batangas province's Lobo LGU on strengthening the protection and conservation of this municipality's natural resources. Lobo watershed is the study site for pilot-testing valuation manuals on water, carbon, and tourism due to the intact ridge-to-reef ecosystem there, it said. \"In a study conducted by USAID along with NGOs and LGUs, the municipality was revealed to have the best-protected areas in the entire region of Batangas in 2013, 2015, and 2018,\" it added. The Department of Tourism in 2015 declared Lobo municipality as an agro-ecotourism destination. To enhance its IEC campaign, the DENR decided to begin including Filipino sign language interpreters in online lectures of this agency, so more people can learn about ENR. The DENR said some of its IEC materials have braille versions already to help the blind understand the information they contain. The BMB launched its family-friendly 'Samot-Sari' web series to teach children about Philippine biodiversity and its conservation, Cimatu said. He said DENR also supports other IEC-related initiatives like the 'Our Fragile Earth' docu-series which features Philippine protected areas to educate the public about the importance of the country's biological heritage. Covid-19 must not prevent learning so DENR continues to explore ways of using digital technology in disseminating ENR information, he said. \"We should not let Covid-19 hinder education of the next generation -- our teaching methods need to evolve to adapt to the constantly changing situation brought about by this pandemic,\" he added.

Maj. Gen. Juvymax Uy, the Army’s 6th Infantry Division commander and head of Joint Task Force Central (JTFC), made the appeal Tuesday to the extremist groups following a brief clash that left a sub-leader of Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) killed in Maguindanao earlier this week. \"As part of the marching order of President Rodrigo Duterte, we are dedicated to putting an end to these terror groups,\" said Uy, appealing to the remnants of terror groups to return to the fold of the law and live a peaceful life with their families. Zukarno Guilil, alias “Commander Motorola,” a sub-leader of the BIFF Kagi Karialan faction, was killed after he and his men clashed with government forces belonging to the 6th Infantry Battalion (IB) in Barangay Ganta, Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Maguindanao on December 26. Lt. Col. Charlie Banaag, the 6IB commander, said the armed clash erupted when his men were sent to verify reports from civilians about the presence of gunmen in Barangay Ganta. As the soldiers were approaching, they were fired upon, triggering a brief firefight until the rebels fled deep into the marshland, leaving behind the body of Guilil. Soldiers found two grenades beside Guilil, a bomb-making expert, while his rifle was believed to be taken by his fleeing comrades. Uy said Guilil was responsible for various attacks and bombings in Maguindanao and has several warrants of arrests for murder, multiple attempted murder, destructive arson, and violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020. \"The neutralization of alias Motorola gives justice to all victims of BIFF atrocities.

Acting Presidential Spokesperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said the Covid-19 situation and the high vaccination turnout in the country allow Duterte to catch up with his allies. “With active Covid-19 cases now on a steady decline and now that we are feeling the positive impact of the government's vaccination, we expect the President to join similar gatherings with friends and allies in the future,” Nograles said in a press statement. Nograles issued the statement, as he confirmed that Duterte had an “informal and relaxed” gathering with his allied lawmakers at Malacañan Palace in Manila on Tuesday night. Nograles, however, did not elaborate on Duterte’s meeting with several lawmakers. “It was an informal and relaxed gathering with lawmakers, many of whom are friends of the President dating back to his days as mayor of Davao City,” he said. Nograles said Duterte merely wants to grab the chance to meet with his allies and make up for lost time because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It was, for the President, an opportunity to see friends he had not personally seen since the onset of the pandemic due to the restrictions that had been put in place,\" he said. In a separate statement, House Deputy Speaker Michael Romero said Duterte hosted a \"casual dinner\" for over 100 congressmen and congresswomen. Romero said Duterte, in his \"unscripted speech,\" also thanked the 18th Congress \"for all the legislative support\" it has given to his administration. \"In return, leaders of the House led by Speaker LAV (Lord Allan Velasco) thanked the President for all the programs he has coursed through the various representatives of the House,\" he said.

With a proposed budget of not more than PHP500,000, organizers announced Tuesday that participants may choose to design for the Paoay sand dunes, Solsona-Apayao road, Saud Beach, Kapurpurawan Rock Formation, and the Capitol East Garden. According to Xavier Ruiz, senior tourism operations officer of Ilocos Norte, one design for each of the five display areas will be chosen and the provincial government will subsidize the winning design’s construction. “Participants should consider the availability and durability of materials to be used, as well as installation methods, fabricators and foundation work,” he said noting these art installations shall be accessible to the public and all designs shall be both aesthetically pleasing and functional. All entries shall be submitted to tourismilocosnorte@gmail.com on or before November 17, 2021. Since Nov. 8, all public parks and other commercial establishments in the province of Ilocos Norte are now open for children regardless of vaccination status. In anticipation of the Yuletide season, the Ilocos Norte Tourism Office is expecting to welcome more visitors following a steady decline of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases in the province. In the past weekend alone, nearly 1,000 tourists arrived in the province, the highest recorded tourist arrivals so far this month. Although this year’s numbers are still a far cry from pre-pandemic records, Ruiz said the latest data on tourist arrivals is a good indicator that Ilocos Norte remains a top choice for leisure travel in the country.

In an interview on Wednesday, Elections Assistant Jonathan Sayno said the ERB has already deliberated on applications of 19,638 registrants for the Sept. 6 to 30 registration. The ERB is composed of the local civil registrar, schools division superintendent, and the elections officer. “All applications were approved,” he said. From Nov. 11 to 16, the ERB will again deliberate on the applications of 12,822 registrants during the extended registration period. The results of the two ERB hearings will be added to the running total of 304,450 as of July 2021, he said. “We still have an ongoing cleansing process to remove the names of deceased voters based on the list from the Local Civil Registrar of Iloilo City,” he added. They are expected to come up with the list first week of December. Sayno said they have to fast-track because their central office needs the data on the number of registered voters as the basis for the printing of ballots and functional clustered precincts for the allocation of vote-counting machines (VCMs). By January next year, a list of voters for posting in voting centers will already be available. He added that voters are advised to already grab the opportunity to look for their precinct and sequence number so on the day of the elections they will just proceed to their identified voting precinct and no longer have to queue and look for their names on the list. It is also their chance to check if their names are on the voters' list so they need not go to the voting center during election time. “We are mandated to post the list of voters months prior the Election Day but it seemed like this is not given importance by our voters. They will just realize its importance during the day of the election,” he said. In the last 2019 midterm elections, the city’s total registered voters were 294,766.

Noel Legaspi alias “Ka Efren,” who had served as deputy secretary of the CPP Far South Mindanao Regional Committee and long-time spokesperson of the National Democratic Front (NDF) Far South Mindanao, said on Tuesday they should grab the chance to yield and lead peaceful lives before their “uncertain struggle” catches up with them. He issued the statement in response to the killing last Saturday of ranking NPA leader Jorge Madlos alias “Ka Oris” and another companion in a reported encounter in Barangay Dumalaguing, Impasugong town in Bukidnon. “I am again appealing to my former comrades to surrender before it’s too late,” Legaspi said in an interview. The former rebel leader, along with his wife Jeanalyn Defensor Bendalian, surrendered to government troops in January 2018 in South Cotabato province after nearly 26 years in the communist terrorist organization. He availed of the government’s reintegration program and has since become a peace worker and advocate. Legaspi said he had known the 72-year-old Madlos, who was considered as one of the highest-ranking NPA leaders in Mindanao, and whom he described as his “mentor.” He said the latter’s story, specifically his death in the recent clash, is mainly the same path that awaits the NPA combatants who still refuse to give up fighting and remain in the mountains. “They’re wasting their time for a war that they will not win and would only lead them to their graves,” he said. Legaspi said he did not regret his decision to surrender more than three years ago and the chance to pursue a normal life. He said his current situation, especially living with his family, has been better and far different from his previous experience while trying to survive and evading government forces in the mountains. Legaspi reiterated that there is no more reason for them to fight the government, with the changes that came these past years. He cited the convergence efforts of government agencies under the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict that have reached many far-flung areas in the country to bring various services. NPA combatants who would decide to surrender are now assured of a better and brighter future through the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program, he said. “You can also eventually become instruments of peace in our communities if you take that path,” he said. The CPP-NPA, which has been waging a five-decade armed struggle against the government, is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines. The NDF has been formally designated as a terrorist organization by the Anti-Terrorism Council on June 23, 2021, citing it as “an integral and separate part” of the CPP-NPA created in April 1973. (PNA)  "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1157212","title":"DOJ releases matrix on drug war ops deaths","date":" October 20, 2021, 1:37 pm","snippet":"MANILA – The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Wednesday released information on the initial batch of 52 cases it is reviewing as part of the government’s policy of transparency on the anti-illegal drugs campaign.","body":"MANILA – The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Wednesday released information on the initial batch of 52 cases it is reviewing as part of the government’s policy of transparency on the anti-illegal drugs campaign. The matrix included docket numbers, names of deceased suspects, places and dates of the incidents and the review panel’s summary of observations on the cases. Among the 52 cases, the most number of deaths in a single incident involved the operation in Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte on July 29, 2016 which resulted in the deaths of three persons. According to the police version, the suspects on board a vehicle refused to stop at a checkpoint and opened fire on the officers. The DOJ review panel noted that according to the medico-legal report, the victims appeared to have been shot at close range. The Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service (PNP-IAS) ordered the dismissal from the service of those involved. The earliest case among the 52 involved a man who was killed in a shootout with police in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City in December 2016. Based on the DOJ review, records of the case did not contain any detailed narration, no indication of death in the death certificate and no pre-operation report, coordination for, custody form, ballistics or paraffin test result nor autopsy result. It resulted in a reprimand of the officers involved who were found guilty of grave irregularity in the performance of duty. The most number of cases, at least 15, involved incidents in different areas in Laguna. Earliest of the cases involved the death of a man in Mamasapano, Maguindanao on July 20, 2016. According to the official police account, the suspect was accosted at a checkpoint for operating a motorcycle with license plates and on the way to the police station, the suspect tried to grab the firearm of one of the arresting officers prompting in the use of deadly force. There is, however, no autopsy or death certificate on record and resulted in the exoneration for one of the police operatives and dismissal from the service of another. Earlier, the DOJ said the disclosure was meant to assure the families and loved ones of the deceased that the suspects and the circumstances of each death are undergoing a determination of possible criminal liabilities on the part of police officers being undertaken by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In the interest of truth PNP chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar welcomed the DOJ decision to release the matrix of the cases, saying it is \"in the interest of truth, transparency and justice.\" Eleazar noted that since 2016, the campaign resulted in the confiscation of multi-billion peso worth of illegal drugs, the \"neutralization\" of key players in the illegal drugs trade and the dismantling of shabu laboratories in the country. He added that the campaign also resulted in the \"unprecedented\" 64 percent decrease in index crime. “Marami rin sa aming hanay ang nagbuwis ng buhay sa mga operasyong ito kaya nararapat lamang na mabigyan din sila ng hustisya sa mga maling paratang tungkol dito. At huwag din nating kakalimutan ang mga sakripisyo ng inyong kapulisan na nagresulta sa pagkakakumpiska ng bilyong-bilyong halaga ng mga iligal na droga (Many of our fellow police have died in the line of duty during operations. It is but proper to give them justice on the wrong notions about this. Let's not forget the sacrifices of our police officers that resulted in the confiscation of billions worth of illegal drugs),” Eleazar said. Eleazar also urged the victims to cooperate in holding policemen who committed abuses accountable for their action. \"Ito rin ang pagkakataon para sa mga pamilya ng nasawi sa police anti-illegal drug operation para sila’y makapagsumite ng complaint-affidavit o kaya’y magharap ng testigo upang maisampa ang kaukulang kasong kriminal sa korte.

Meralco hoped to forge a decider after a 102-98 win in Wednesday’s Game 5. \"They gave us a very good series. Their effort was outstanding,\" Magnolia coach Chito Victolero said. The Hotshots, who trailed by as much as 11 points early, lost the Philippine Cup to the San Miguel Beermen in the 2017-2018 and 2019 seasons. Earlier, San Miguel kept its title hopes alive after whipping TNT, 103-90, to force a Game 7. Two days after the Tropang Giga put up what coach Chot Reyes described as an \"excellent effort\" to bludgeon the Beermen, it was the latter's turn to make one. Marcio Lassiter tried to lead San Miguel's early breakaway by scoring three straight triples that helped open a 14-4 lead at the start of the game. But TNT took control of the latter part of the first quarter to cut the lead down to four, 25-21, before Arwind Santos scored the buzzer-beater to extend SMB's advantage to six. The Beermen tried to pull away again after stretching their lead to 16 early in the fourth, 46-30. Mikey Williams capped an 8-2 Tropang Giga run with back-to-back three-pointers to trim the gap to 10, but the Beermen had the last laugh in the first half with a 5-0 run to up their lead back to 15 points, 53-38, at halftime. SMB appeared to have pulled away from TNT after opening an 86-62 lead at the end of the third quarter, but TNT got its offensive game going in the fourth and drew to within 10 again, 88-98, with 2:44 to play. Lassiter eventually sealed the Beermen's win with a wide-open three that hiked the lead 13 as both teams settled for an exchange of baskets in the end. Mo Tautuaa finished with 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting, five rebounds, and one assist off the bench to lead the Beermen. Lassiter added 19 points on 7-of-14 field goals including 5-of-8 on three-pointers, five rebounds, three assists, and four steals.

In his taped Talk to the People delivered Monday night, Duterte viewed as “good news” the apparent decline in Covid-19 cases because of high vaccination turnout. “Dahil sa bakuna, bumaba talaga ang hawaan. So kakaunti ang hawaan kasi kakaunti naman ‘yung tao na hindi nabakunahan. So, ‘yun ang magandang balita (There is a drop in infections because of the vaccine. So, the number of infection rate drops because only a few are unvaccinated. So, that’s the good news),” Duterte said. For the past days, the Philippines recorded lower Covid-19 cases despite the presence of the more transmissible Delta coronavirus variant. On Monday, the new Covid-19 infections cases recorded in the country were only 8,292, the lowest posted since August this year. Duterte maintained that the only solution to defeating Covid-19 is to inoculate the majority of Filipinos. He expressed confidence that with the intensified vaccination campaign, the country will have a “better and truly merry Christmas.” “If we continue to ramp up the vaccination of our people, along with our consistent practice of mask -- huwag pa rin ninyong tanggalin (do not remove that) -- hugas at iwas (wearing of mask, handwashing, and social distancing), and may (with) the gradual resumption of our economic activities, then we can hope for a better and truly merry Christmas,” Duterte said. He then renewed his call for those eligible to get vaccinated to protect themselves against the coronavirus amid the prevailing pandemic. He made the appeal anew, as he acknowledged that there are still some Filipinos who are hesitant to receive the vaccine. “Kaya iyan na lang ang ipagbilin ko sa’yo na sana sundin ninyo kasi iyan lang talaga ang pampawala ng sakit ng ulo sa bayan natin. Magpabakuna. Alam ko marami pang ayaw eh (Just follow my advice because that will ease our burden. Get vaccinated. I know many still do not want to get inoculated),” Duterte said. Duterte told his fellow Filipinos to grab the opportunity to get vaccinated against Covid-19, especially now that the country has an adequate vaccine supply. “Meron tayong bakuna. Marami nang dumating (We have enough vaccines. Many vaccines are being delivered to the country),” he said. “We will make use of that so that we can help the country and our fellow human being.” As of Monday, a total of 50,066,590 coronavirus vaccine doses have already been administered nationwide, based on the National Covid-19 Vaccination Dashboard uploaded on the official website of the Department of Health. Around 23,360,489 individuals have been fully vaccinated, while 26,706,101 others have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. According to the June 23 to 26 survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations, around 45 percent of Filipinos are now willing to get inoculated against Covid-19. Only 24 percent are still uncertain about receiving the vaccine, while 21 percent do not want to get vaccinated. The survey also found that 10 percent of the respondents have already been vaccinated, with 7 percent receiving the first dose and 3 percent already completing the two doses.

The commotion came to the attention of the police around 2 a.m. Monday after Garcia managed to send a text message to Philip John Espiritusanto, the secretary of Barangay Zone 3, who in turn reported the matter to the ZCPO’s Station 11. “It’s good that Mrs. Garcia remained calm and managed to convince Hajiri to return her cellphone as the suspect grabbed it,” Natividad said. Hajiri claimed he barged into the residence of the victim because he was trying to get away from people supposedly pursuing him. Hajiri also claimed that he has no intention to hurt Garcia although he armed himself with three machetes that he got from the victim's house. Natividad said they were able to establish face-to-face encounter with Hajiri and the hostage following negotiations with the help of Wahid Ibba, the suspect’s uncle. “We tried to sneak into the house to rescue Mrs. Garcia, but it was too risky, since the suspect covered the windows with sacks and the door at the back was blocked with a cabinet,” he said. The police convinced Hajiri to come out of the house with his victim after he demanded the official vehicle of Barangay Zone 3 to take him and the hostage to another place. As negotiations continued, one of the ZCPO’s Station 11 personnel, S/Sgt. Jhun Maddas, took the opportunity to grab and subdue the machete-wielding suspect, ending the nine-hour hostage-taking incident shortly before 7 a.m. Natividad said that they will file a serious illegal detention case and other charges against the suspect who is now under the custody of ZCPO’s Station 11.

In a statement, PNP chief, Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, said all resolutions of the IAS regarding administrative cases of cops need to be reviewed by the Discipline, Law and Order Division (DLOD), an office under the Directorate for Personnel and Records Management (DPRM). “But just like other results of IAS investigations, this case will still be subjected to two more reviews— under the Discipline, Law and Order Division of the DPRM and under the Office of the Chief PNP— to determine if there are solid legal grounds to justify the recommendations made. This is how due process works in your PNP,” he said. This came as the family of victim Edwin Arnigo expressed its dissatisfaction after learning that suspect, Senior M/Sgt. Christopher Salcedo, will only face a 40-day suspension. Arnigo’s mother even sought Eleazar's help regarding the matter, saying that stiffer penalties must be enforced against the cop. Eleazar appealed to the family to let the entire review process takes its course as there is no final decision yet on the matter, noting that the 40-day suspension is only a recommendation. Police had claimed that Arnigo attempted to grab the gun of the cop and was shot during an anti-illegal cockfighting operation in the city's Lingunan village last May 23. The Arnigo family belied the police's claim, saying the victim was afraid of police officers. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) was tapped to conduct a probe into the incident. Probe on Calbayog City mayor's killing Meanwhile, Eleazar said he is awaiting documents from the DPRM in connection with the IAS' recommendation for the dismissal of five police officers accused of killing Calbayog City Mayor Ronaldo Aquino last March in Samar province. This came after IAS inspector general Alfegar Triambulo said he has submitted a copy of their resolution on the administrative cases filed against Lt. Col. Harry Sucayre, Maj. Shyrille Tan, Lt. Julio Armeza Jr., Senior S/Sgt. Niel Cebu, and Cpl. Edsel Omega to the DPRM. In a separate interview with the reporters, Triambulo said the witnesses' testimonies and the results of a Senate probe on the matter indicated that the policemen were bent on killing the mayor as they found out 267 bullet holes on Aquino's vehicle. “Their claims that they were fired upon by the other group was the reason for their act of returning fire do not add up because there is a trajectory in the windshield, so there is an intention to kill whoever is inside the vehicle. Now, why are they also wearing bonnets? They cannot explain that. There were two of their companions inside their vehicle who were wearing bonnets,” Triambulo said in a mix of English and Filipino. Earlier, the NBI filed murder and frustrated murder complaints before the Department of Justice against police officers involved in the March 8 incident that killed Aquino and five others. The NBI based its conclusion on 53 statements of witnesses, a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage of the incident, and information from the cellphones they had obtained. In June this year, whistleblower Master Sgt. Jose Jay Scenario claimed in a Senate inquiry that a political rival of the slain mayor allegedly colluded with some PNP personnel to obtain a search warrant against him and tag him as the protector of a policeman involved in the illegal drug trade. He added that the ambush on the mayor had long been planned.

This, after Duterte bared his plan to recalibrate his administration’s Covid-19 response efforts, amid the presence of variants of concern, including the more transmissible Delta variant. “Whether the rise in the number of cases is due to the Delta variant or not, we need to recalibrate our response,” Duterte said in his prerecorded Talk to the People delivered Monday night but aired Tuesday morning. “We are also evaluating whether granular or localized lockdown would work best in our current situation.” Duterte also directed the National Task Force Against Covid-19 to study the potential benefits of implementing localized lockdowns all throughout the country. He gave the fresh directive as he lamented that the Philippines logged Monday the highest Covid-19 daily case count. On Monday, the country recorded 22,366 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of coronavirus infections to 1,976,202. Around 1,794,278 individuals have already recovered, while 33,330 people have died because of Covid-19. There are still 148,594 active Covid-19 cases in the country. Despite the surge in Covid-19 infections, Duterte remained thankful over the low Covid-19 fatality rate in the country. “There’s a rise of Covid cases all over [the world]. Hirap ang Amerika ngayon, ang Europe is suffering from a… Maraming namatay. Turkey, maraming patay. Saudi Arabia, mas maraming patay. Itong atin, hawa lang. Ang patay natin, hindi masyadong ganoon karami. (America, Europe, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are struggling because of Covid-19-related deaths. In our case, many are catching the virus but there are only a few deaths),” Duterte said. For now, Metro Manila and other areas in the country will remain under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), the second strictest community quarantine status, until Sept. 7 to address the increasing bed occupancy and enable the local government units to ramp up their vaccination rollout, Duterte said. Duterte also reminded Filipinos to continue heeding the government’s advice to wear face mask, observe regular handwashing, and follow strict social distancing to protect themselves against Covid-19. “Let us continue to be safe from Covid and its variants by continuing to observe our minimum public health standards -- mask, hugas, iwas (wear a mask, wash hands, and observe a distance). And please [get] vaccinated as soon as your turn comes and avoid being complacent about protocols,” he said. Duterte likewise renewed his call on his fellow Filipinos to grab the opportunity to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “Alam mo, sabi ko sa inyo, walang iba, ang panlaban natin sa Covid ay ang bakuna. Meron tayong problema ngayon, nag-mutate, may variants, nag-kaniyang sarili, nag-ibang anyo ang mga animal (You know, I am telling you, our only weapon against Covid is the vaccine. We also have a problem now because the virus is mutating, there are other variants already),” he said. As of Aug. 29, around 33,099,392 doses of Covid-19 vaccine have already been administered nationwide, based on the presentation made by NTF Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. Around 13,784,681 individuals have already been fully vaccinated, while some 19,317,711 individuals have already received the first dose. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), in its Resolution 135-A approved on Aug. 26, has directed LGUs whose jurisdictions have a community transmission of Covid-19 to implement localized lockdowns.

The statement also noted that since the end of July, the US has relocated nearly 53,000 people.

In the days after seizing power, Taliban leadership assured the \"peaceful transition of power\" and has publicly disavowed any attempts at revenge on Afghans who worked with the government or foreign organizations. But with the unexpected power grab and President Ashraf Ghani and top officials leaving the country, concerns became louder from several countries as well as rights organizations. In the meantime, some offered refuge to Afghans. Sixty-four countries signed a statement on Aug. 16, demanding a safe and orderly departure for anyone who wants to leave Afghanistan. Among them were Canada, France, Germany and the UK. \"Those in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan bear responsibility -- and accountability -- for the protection of human life and property, and for the immediate restoration of security and civil order,” they said in a statement. Later, New Zealand and Australia announced they would help evacuate Afghan nationals who aided their troops who were deployed in Afghanistan, according to media reports. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her country would help its nationals and their families evacuate Afghanistan. The Cabinet agreed to assist 37 Afghan nationals and their immediate family members who worked with the New Zealand Defense Forces in Afghanistan, added Ardern. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that since April, 430 Afghans who worked with Australian forces and their families had been resettled in Australia. \"We still are working to transfer people. I can't go into the operational details of that,\" Morrison told Sky News. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau announced that his country will resettle 20,000 Afghans threatened by the Taliban and forced to flee Afghanistan. \"Afghans have put their lives at great risk to support Canada in helping Afghans achieve significant democratic, human rights, education, health and security gains over the past twenty years. We owe them a debt of gratitude and we will continue our efforts to bring them to safety,\" he said. Separately, the UK announced a new Afghanistan citizens’ resettlement scheme to welcome up to 20,000 Afghan nationals who are at risk because of the crisis. About 5,000 people are expected to arrive in the UK in 2021. \"Priority will be given to women and girls, and religious and other minorities, who are most at risk of human rights abuses and dehumanizing treatment by the Taliban,\" the government said in a statement on Aug. 18. Spain has not given the precise number of Afghans it wants to bring to Spain, though media reports suggest that it has worked with around 50 Afghan interpreters. Unlike Canada, which has promised to resettle 20,000 refugees, Spain has only committed to repatriating its local staff. Though the US did not pledge to take in Afghan refugees, Uganda’s foreign minister said on Aug. 19 that his country has yet to decide on a US request to host 2,000 refugees from Afghanistan. \"We were asked to host them. The country was approached due to its humanitarian record but a decision is yet to be made,” he told parliament’s committee on foreign affairs. Similarly, Albania accepted a request from Washington to temporarily take in about 300 refugees seeking visas to enter the US, the Albanian prime minister said on Aug. 15. \"No doubt we shall not say no. Albania, a NATO member, is ready to take its share of the burden,” said Edi Rama. On the other hand, Greece’s migration minister said his country will not allow refugees to cross its borders into the EU. \"Our country will not be a gateway to Europe for illegal Afghan migrants,\" Notis Mitarakis said in a statement.

They really have no conscience and they don't care if these cause damage to anyone -- whether a soldier, police officer or civilian -- as long as they continue to sow terror and manage to grab power from the government,” said DILG Secretary Eduardo Año in a news release. Año said the CPP-NPA seems to have a short memory and have conveniently forgotten the murder of Far Eastern University player Keith Absalon and his cousin Nolven who died while biking after the communist terrorists in Masbate detonated an APM in June of this year. “Tila nakalimutan na agad ng CPP-NPA kung paano nagalit ang publiko sa pagkamatay ng mga Absalon dahil sa kahayupan nila. Kunwari ay humingi pa sila ng tawad sa mga namatayan pero ang totoo ay wala silang budhi dahil tuloy pa rin ang paggawa at paggamit nila ng APM (It seems the CPP-NPA have forgotten about the public outrage caused by the death of the Absalons, which is an effect of their cruelty. They even asked forgiveness from the bereaved family but the truth is they are heartless because they continue to make and use APM),” he said. The use of landmines is a violation of the Ottawa Convention or the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty signed by 133 states and adapted by 164 state parties, including the Philippines. It prohibits the production, stockpiling, transfer, and use of anti-personnel mines (APMs) which cause serious destruction and indiscriminately harm civilians, including children. The use of landmines is also a violation of Republic Act 9851 which penalizes crimes against the International Humanitarian Law. Based on reports from the Philippine National Police Regional Office 8 and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Año said the Joint Task Force Storm of the Philippine Army’s 8th Infantry Division (8ID) based in Catbalogan City launched ground, air, and sea raids in Barangay Osmeña after getting a tip from locals on an explosives manufacturing site and NPA camp in the area. He said 19 NPA members died in the day-long encounter while there were no casualties from government forces. Twenty-nine high-powered firearms were also seized from the CTGs during the raid. “The DILG congratulates the 8th Infantry Division for its successful operation against Communist Terrorists. This operation is a big blow to the terrorism-capacity of the CPP-NPA-NDF in Samar,” he said. According to the AFP, at least 29 villages in Eastern Samar are still communist NPA terrorist (CNT) affected while at least 45 new villages in the province have already been cleared of communist terrorists. “The CPP-NPA is fighting a losing battle. Habang may panahon pa ay sumuko na kayo at magbagong-buhay dahil kailan man ay hindi nagwawagi ang karahasan at kasamaan (Surrender now while it is early and start a new life because violence and evil will never win),” Año said. The DILG chief urged the NPA to grab the chance to reform and lead new lives through the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP), a complete package of assistance to former rebels (FRs). So far, a total of 6,418 former rebels (FRs) and rebel sympathizers have laid down their arms and availed of E-CLIP.

In a text message, DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said Myanmar assumed the coordinatorship during the virtual Asean-China Post Ministerial Conference on Aug. 3. Throughout its co-chairmanship with China from 2018 to 2021, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. reported that the Philippines has tried to make as much progress on the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea (COC) negotiations even while the pandemic is ongoing. \"As outgoing Country Coordinator for negotiations on the Code of Conduct, the Philippines tried to make as much progress on the COC negotiations as circumstances allowed,\" he said in his statement at the Asean-China meet on Aug. 3. \"Soon we turn over the work to Myanmar. Speaking of whom, we recognize that given its proximity to China, we hope for China’s initiative in restoring peace and freedom to that said land,\" he added. The Asean and Beijing adopted the COC framework in 2017 in hopes of a document that will serve as a guideline for parties in the disputed South China Sea, where China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam have overlapping territorial claims. Last September 2020, Locsin said he would \"push through to the 2nd Draft and get started on the 3rd before handing the China coordinatorship\" to Myanmar. At the Asean Post Ministerial Conference with China, Locsin reiterated that disputes in the area \"should be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS and in the recent light of the 2016 Arbitral Award which singles out no one, was carefully crafted as to be unusable as a weapon for disputation; and most helpful in clarifying maritime issues.\" 'Comprehensive' strategic partner Meanwhile, Locsin said Beijing deserved a status upgrade as the bloc's comprehensive strategic partner as he cited the broad partnership between Asean and China. \"Let me begin with the self-evident: the quality and increasing extent of Asean-China relations merit elevation to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. As I said at Chongqing, geography alone argues for the elevation; reality demands it. China is or soon will be the world’s biggest economy. Its role is imperative for a global post-pandemic recovery,\" he said. He noted China's success in containing the virus and its role as one of the first pandemic responders who shared their strategies as well as vaccines to several countries. \"When critics of China said its vaccines are not as good, I asked: As compared to what? The Chinese vaccines were the first on the scene. Had many countries not made a grab for it, the death toll would be far greater. The extent might be the same; but the intensity of the infections far worse,\" he said. But aside from the pandemic, Locsin said the two parties could also work on addressing the climate crisis and protecting the environment, including the seas. \"The climate crisis is here. We see it in the increased number and intensity of fires across forests and plains; heatwaves withering crops; droughts parching farmlands; alternatively: flash floods of uncommon scale; swallowing cities, wiping out decades of progress. Our planet is dying. If climate action does not measure up to what is needed, we all face the same fate of diminished existence or extinction altogether,\" he said. \"We therefore welcome China’s great leaps to scale up initiatives on renewable energy. An environmentally conscious and conscientious economic powerhouse benefits not just its neighbors but the world,\" he added. Manila assumed co-chairmanship of the Asean-China Dialogue from Singapore in 2018. Myanmar will shepherd the relations for the period of 2021 to 2024.

In an interview on Thursday, Noemi Bron, DOH-Bicol Health and Promotion chief, said the vaccine made by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company arrived in 22 boxes aboard a Cebu Pacific commercial flight from Manila. \"With these newly arrived vaccines, we are expecting that local government units will encourage and follow the priority list particularly the senior citizens in their localities,\" she said. Bron said a vial of J&J vaccine contains five doses so the 33,280 vials could be administered to 166,400 senior citizens in the provinces of Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, and Sorsogon. The allocation of 9,000 doses for Catanduanes arrived in the island province on Monday while the 28,400 doses for Masbate would be directly delivered from Manila this week. The National Vaccination Operations Center allocated 51,000 doses of the J&J jabs for Camarines Sur; Naga City – 6,000; Iriga City – 5,600; Albay – 31,000; Legazpi – 6,000; Tabaco – 5,500; Ligao City – 5,500, Camarines Norte – 19,500; Sorsogon – 24,000; and Sorsogon City – 6,700.

The Janssen vaccine brought to 203,800 the total number of vaccine doses received so far by the Bicol Region. Meanwhile, Mayor Noel Rosal encouraged all senior citizens here to avail of the single-dose vaccine. \"We are calling all senior citizens to grab the opportunity to be inoculated with this vaccine. As per instruction by the health authorities, we need to increase the vaccine turnout for our elderlies,\" he said. Rosal noted that the city government has now administered almost 40,000 doses of vaccines. \"We want that before December, we would be able to reach at least 90,000 inoculations in the city. We also need to prepare and safeguard our people from the Delta variant that is very dangerous. We need vaccines for our preventive and safety measures,\" he said.

Investigation showed that the two suspects, identified as \"Rey\" and \"Anne,\" approached two undercover ARTA-CIDG agents posing as applicants for student permits on July 14. The fixers ensured the immediate release of the agents' student permits, including the medical exam and Theoretical Driving Certificate—which normally takes three days to process. Rey charged the undercover agent a fee of PHP3,500 for the illegal service while Anne asked for a payment of PHP4,500. The permit is normally priced at PHP317.63. The undercover agents agreed to pay the fixers outside the LTO Tabang on Monday. After receiving the entrapment money, Rey and Anne, who was carrying her one-year-old child, were arrested. The suspects were placed under the custody of the CIDG while the child was turned over to Anne's mother. Secretary Jeremiah Belgica, who was on the ground during the entrapment operation, lamented how even children are not spared by fixers conducting illegal activities. \"Nalulungkot ako kasi nakita ko 'yung bata. Bakit mo isasama 'yung anak mo sa ganong klaseng operation na alam mo namang bawal? (I’m sad because I saw the child. Why would you bring your child in that kind of operation that you know is prohibited?),” he said. \"I'm disappointed kasi pati mga bata nagagamit sa ganitong klaseng mga operasyon (because even children are being used to this kind of operation).” After the entrapment operation, the ARTA chief immediately went inside the LTO Tabang to conduct an inspection on their processes. When Belgica asked the head of security of LTO Tabang why they were not making the fixers leave the premises, he said the fixers are just staying outside the office. \"Alam mo palang may fixer sa labas, ba't di mo paalisin? You have to make sure na 'yung perimeter mo ay malinis (You know there are fixers outside, why don't you get rid of them? You have to make sure that your perimeter is clean),” Belgica told the head of security. Belgica reiterated his call on government officials to investigate possible cohorts of fixers or other sources of red tape in their offices. He said ARTA is implementing the snake-grab approach in catching fixers, both inside and outside of government offices. \"Hangga't may mga fixer na ganyan, hindi ako maco-convince na walang red tape na nangyari (As long as there are fixers like that, I can’t be convinced that no red tape happened),\" he said. Janelle Louise Estrella, LTO Tabang assistant chief, said they have reported fixers to the municipal government which has led to their arrest. However, after ARTA's inspection, she promised to double their efforts in eradicating fixers and red tape. Belgica encouraged government officials to be more proactive in the fight against red tape by immediately responding to reports from the public. \"Pinapaalalahanan natin sila na hindi porket wala sa opisina, so, wala sa loob ng compound mo, nandoon lang sa vicinity, sa perimeter, eh wala na kayong pakialam. Kung nandoon lang sa vicinity, sa perimeter mo, paalisin mo 'yon (We remind them though the fixers are not inside your compound, and they are just in the vicinity, you don't care anymore. If they are in the vicinity, on your perimeter, get rid of them,\" he said. He urged the public servants not to relax as Filipino people deserve more from them. Belgica said ARTA will issue a show-cause order to the LTO Tabang Division Chief, as well as the barangay officials in the area, for their apparent lack of action on the proliferation of fixers at the LTO branch. The ARTA, he said, will also be investigating if fixers have infiltrated Theoretical Driving schools. He said he is also looking into the possibility of setting up ARTAmbayans or outposts near government offices that will not only serve as a deterrent for fixers, but will also be equipped to receive and handle concerns from the public.

The Davao City Vaccination Cluster data showed 61,137 of A4 recipients were vaccinated with the first dose while 299 have received the second dose. Schlosser also bared that since the city government started the vaccination rollout, only very mild adverse effects were reported. \"We have not logged any adverse events that were rare or fatal. For those who are scared, there was no such a report or if ever there is an adverse event following vaccination, don't fear because we have a standby doctor and hospitals,\" she said.

Especially with the pandemic, the demand and usage of motorcycles have grown drastically, so we want CitySavings to be top of mind when customers want to get their own,” Angue said in a statement Tuesday.  Citing Motorcyclesdata.com, CitySavings said the demand for motorcycles has steadily increased and expected to address the logistical limitations of movement and transportation and to help the people’s day-to-day needs.  With easy access to credit, the bank capitalized its motorcycle loans program with fast approvals, exclusive offers, and low-down payments under its “Motor Mo’To program.”  Angue said the bank tapped several institutional partners whose companies rely heavily on motorcycles for their business operations.  Since 2019, the bank has been a partner of four major Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) and other logistics companies such as Lalamove, Grab, Quad X, and Foodpanda that help enable riders to get great motorcycle deals and flexible payment options and consequently expanding their income potential, he added.

The bank’s partnership with Lalamove has potentially benefitted 35,000 riders in Luzon and Cebu, the statement said.

The Philippine government’s goal is to inoculate up to 70 million this year to achieve population protection. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Monday said around 10 percent of the target population for the country to achieve population protection have already been vaccinated against Covid-19. On June 2, National Task Force Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. expressed confidence that the government’s population protection target is still achievable by the end of the year.

But how do you handle one when the crisis is the pandemic itself?","body":"MANILA – There's a type of crisis where once resolved, eventually goes away and the business returns to normal. But how do you handle one when the crisis is the pandemic itself? For Amor Maclang, an internationally recognized crisis management and disaster risk reduction expert, the way forward is to innovate. In the recent Leadership Excellence Series 2021 (“LES”): A 360° Virtual Learning Experience hosted by the Department of Tourism-Metro Manila, Maclang said the coronavirus crisis has already become a \"paradigm changer\". Compared to a crisis where one can recover easily, she likened the pandemic's impact to having a leg amputated where one \"totally have to adjust to your new lifestyle and circumstances\". In the context of the tourism industry, she said established business models are already dying out as new ones spring right back up. \"I know what we all want for the tourism industry and that is for the economy to reopen, but what if the economy was actually already opened and it just so happen that it is not the same economy that we were used to,\" she said. \"Maybe when people talk about the economy, when they talk about circumstances changing, what they're hoping is for the old economy to come back and I'm not saying it won't. But there's a really good chance that that's not going to happen,\" she added. Maclang said businesses must toss out the playbook and grab the opportunity to be experimental. \"It's better to apologize for mistakes by trying new things rather than closing your company just because your established ways of getting customers don't work anymore,\" she said. She added that merging crisis management, marketing, and good governance is what businesses need to keep in mind to thrive in any type of storm. For the tourism sector, she advised stakeholders to find ways to \"exceed best practices\" in sustainability because this is the time for the country to stand out as a place that values not only the visitors but also the health of the planet. \"Low-carbon tourism for example is all about minimizing the impact of our actions on the planet... Social distancing should have also been done a long time ago because the carrying capacity of most of our islands cannot really tolerate mass tourism,\" she said. \"I'll tell you, address this next crisis before it hits so we can prosper in hard times and not forever play the victim,\" she added. Cathy Yap-Yang, a multi-awarded business journalist and First Vice President and Group Head of PLDT and Smart Corporate Communications, meanwhile, zeroed in on customer satisfaction. At PLDT, she shared that they thrive to become \"more digital\" to keep up with their customers' needs during the pandemic. During the crisis, she highlighted the importance of providing reliable services while considering the health and safety of both your employees and clients. For DOT-Metro Manila Regional Director Woodrow Maquiling, the trailblazing hybrid online learning event could not be more timely as the country face a period that needs rebuilding of consumer confidence. \"Our country’s tourism chief said it best, 'the tourism industry can rise again,' given the massive rollout of the national vaccination drive by the government and the continuing strict implementation of health and safety protocols,\" he said. The LES was held last June 11 at the Joy Nostalg Hotel & Suites Manila.

National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon visited the AFP General Headquarters (GHQ) at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City to witness the vaccination of military troops. The country's testing czar cited the need to vaccinate the country's uniformed personnel as they play critical roles amid the public health crisis. He said they not only maintain the country's security but also assist in the government's Covid-19 pandemic response. \"Napaka-importante talaga na mabakunahan ang mga tropa natin, lahat ng uniformed personnel. Kailangan na talagang mabakunahan na natin kasi sila 'yung exposed na exposed (It is important for our troops, all our uniformed personnel, to get vaccinated as they are ones who are mostly exposed to the virus),\" Dizon said in an interview. Soldiers also man quarantine checkpoints and quarantine facilities and assist in vaccine arrival and deployment. In the National Capital Region (NCR), 9,000 in the AFP are not yet vaccinated but Dizon is confident they can be inoculated within two weeks. The inoculation of all personnel at the AFP GCQ is expected to be done by Tuesday, he added. \"I think we will be done by tomorrow and later on we will go to other camps and make sure within 10 to 14 days all our troops are already vaccinated,\" he said. Vaccination at the Philippine National Police (PNP) will begin Tuesday in nearby Camp Crame.

The government is boosting its vaccination program in areas that are experiencing a surge in cases. \"We will maximize our resources and we will not stop until this problem ends,\" Dizon said. Maj. Edna Claire Capacillo, 42, said she decided to get vaccinated not only to protect herself but also her family, her co-workers, and those she socializes with. \"Ini-encourage ko 'yung iba na hindi pa nakapagpa-vaccine na i-grab na natin 'yung opportunity para sa proteksyon ng lahat (I encourage those who are not yet vaccinated to grab this opportunity for the protection of all),\" Capacillo said. Lt. Commander Chris Brian Ascaño, 40, said people need to protect themselves against the virus and help the spread of the infection. Ascaño said they are vulnerable to virus exposure since they are required to be physically present at work. \"We have to travel from our place to work. Then there's a possibility for us to get the virus during our travel so I got the vaccine to protect myself,\" he said. He urged his fellow soldiers to get vaccinated. \"Sana kayo ay magpabakuna na para sa kaligtasan ng ating mga kasama at ng ating mga kababayan (I hope you get vaccinated to protect our comrades and our countrymen),\" he said. Lt. Colonel Don Ravago said he did not feel anything after his first shot of the Sinovac vaccine. He lauded the government's vaccination program and for making sure that those who are working in the frontlines are protected. \"Malaking bagay 'yung vaccine na binibigay sa ating kasundaluhan 'pagkat bilang front-liner, ito 'yung first-hand protection para makapagsilbi ng mas maganda sa ating taong bayan (The vaccine given to the military is a huge help because as front-liners, this is the first-hand protection to better serve our people),\" Ravago said.

(ANTECO) on June 7, 2021. In case of fire, each have their respective roles to carry out, he said. “Whenever there would be fire incident, the police will be immediately responding to manage the traffic of commuters away from the incident area and protect the firefighters,” he said. Based on their experiences during fire incidents, he said there are spectators who usually mob the area distracting the firefighters. “There are also fire victims who tend to grab the hose nozzle from the firefighters because they want their own houses to be given priority in the firefighting,” he said. ANTECO will first shut down electric lines so that the firefighters would not be exposed to live wires. “I had experienced when I was still assigned in Negros Occidental when there were two firemen who were killed because of the livewires when they responded,” he said. Meanwhile, Pudadera said that from January 1 up to June 11, 2021 the BFP Antique already responded to 35 fire incidents in different towns in the province. “Most of the fire incidents, however, were caused by grassfire,” he said.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made the appeal in a virtual press conference, amid the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) investigation into the supposed sale of either Covid-19 vaccine shots or vaccine slot for financial gain. “Ang panawagan nga po namin sa mga lokal na pamahalaan ay kung pupuwede po magpasa rin sila ng ordinansa na nagpapataw ng parusa doon sa magbebenta ng slots, para malinaw po na mayroon tayong legal na basehan para parusahan ang mga taong gumagawa nito (Our appeal to local governments is to pass an ordinance that will impose penalty on those selling slots so we have legal basis to punish them),” Roque said. Roque told the public that Covid-19 vaccines cannot be sold because these are not cleared for commercial use. Hence, the sale of Covid-19 vaccines is illegal and violates the country’s law, Roque said. “Wala pang bakuna na covered ng commercial use authorization. Ibig sabihin, dahil wala pa pong commercial use, hindi pupuwedeng ibenta dahil lahat po ng mga bakuna ay nasa experimental use authorization pa lamang (No vaccine has been covered by commercial use authorization. Meaning, all vaccines cannot be sold because they are still covered by the experimental use authorization),” he said. The Philippines has approved for emergency use at least seven brands of Covid-19 vaccines, including the United States’ Pfizer and China’s Sinovac. The PNP has received reports that some individuals are offering vaccines and vaccination slots for as much as PHP15,000, depending on the vaccine brand. ‘Best’ vax is ‘the one available’ The Social Weather Stations (SWS), in its April 28 to May 2 survey, found 63 percent of adult Filipinos prefer Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by the US. Following the US are China (19 percent), Japan and Australia (13 percent each), the United Kingdom (13 percent), and Canada and Russia (12 percent each). Obtaining single-digit scores are Germany (8 percent), South Korea (6 percent), and India (3 percent). When it comes to specific vaccine brand, Filipinos’ top pick is Sinovac (39 percent), followed by Pfizer (32 percent), AstraZeneca (22 percent), and Johnson & Johnson (10 percent). Covid-19 vaccine brands that obtained single-digit scores include Moderna (7 percent); CureVac, Sinopharm, Novavax, and Sanofi (3 percent each); and Gamaleya (2 percent). Roque said Filipinos choosing Covid-19 vaccines developed by the US is understandable because ‘they admire more the stateside.” He, however, maintained that the “best” vaccine is “the one available.” “Kung bibigyan ng pagkakataon na mabakunahan, piliin na ang mabakunahan para maprotektahan natin ang ating sarili, ang ating pamilya at ang ating komunidad (Grab the chance to be vaccinated to protect yourself, your family, and the community),” he said. “Ang iniiwasan natin ay ang maospital o ang mamatay. Ito ang goal ng ating mass vaccination, ang population protection (What we are avoiding is for you to be hospitalized or die. Our goal is mass vaccination and population protection).” Avoid ‘super spreader events’ Roque also reiterated his appeal to the public to avoid “super spreader” events. He made the call to achieve the government’s herd immunity goal by year-end. “Kaunting tulog na lang po, magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine protection eh bakit naman ngayon pa kayo pupunta sa mga super spreader event (We will soon have vaccine protection so why would you have to go to super spreader events)?” Roque said.

Among those who lined up for the vaccination was Emergancia Diaz, 85, who was in a wheelchair. She survived Covid-19 when last year after she tested positive for the disease. Her husband Quintin, 86, had shown symptoms of the disease and also survived. “We are so happy that we have now the protection against Covid-19,” she said. The couple was among the recipients included in the A2 priority list of the population group in the city. Meanwhile, 70-year-old Danilo Roldan, said he wants to get vaccinated to have peace of mind. “I’m not getting any younger, I have comorbidities so I grab this offer from the government,” he said. “I feel good now.” As for the Mecca-bound pilgrims, Patadon said the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos has required all pilgrims from the Philippines to undergo vaccination before joining the annual Hajj. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said only “immunized people” will be granted permits to perform Umrah as well as prayers in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

Michael Angelo Quijada, founder and executive director of One Guadalupe, said his organization has partnered with the Sangguniang Kabataan of Barangay Guadalupe here in setting up two community pantries. “What inspires us to organize a community pantry is what actually transpired in Manila. Actually, it’s a good program to replicate. It can help the people. We are aware there’s financial difficulties of our people because of the pandemic,” Quijada told the Philippine News Agency in an interview. Quijada, who is a student leader, said he used his connections to some 20 school and student organizations in coming up with food supplies for their community pantries. Apart from the SK council in Guadalupe, he said the SK Federation in Cebu City has also supported the program. He urged businessmen in Cebu to help in the initiative that helps the indigent amid the prevailing pandemic, which has caused many people to lose their jobs. “Specially to our big businesses, it’s good if we cannot get their support to make this community pantry expand and be able to help the people. Through the pantry project, you can also help their workers,” Quijada said in Cebuano. As of Tuesday, the two community pantries, one of which is located at the entrance of the National Shrine of the Our Lady of the Guadalupe and the other across Angel’s Pharmacy along V. Rama Avenue, have served over 400 people, he noted. Photos of the pantry project was first posted by a travel consultant, Rachel Navaja Olmogues, on her Facebook page. “The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19) has brought financial difficulties, especially to the poor and marginalized sectors in our barangay. This month of April, the first flagship program of One Guadalupe is to install community pantries in five (5) strategic areas in the Barangay Guadalupe. These community pantries shall be accessible to those willing to donate unperishable goods like sardines, instant noodles, rice, and water bottles. Fruits and vegetables are also allowed. Anyone can place their donations on the same table where those who are in need can quickly grab enough amount of goods for him or his family,” Olmogues’ post read. Quijada said members of the Visayan Youth Matters also distributed reading materials to those who lined up for the free food about the importance of following health and safety standards to prevent Covid-19 infection. One Guadalupe, he said, is a youth-led initiative that aims to unify and mobilize the young residents to address common issues faced by the people in their neighborhood.

Just recently, the district hospitals in Bangui and Dingras towns, including the quarantine facilities of the Department of Public Works and Highways have also their own Covid-19 testing centers that offer a cheaper fee of PHP500 per test for local residents and PHP800 for non-residents. A separate antigen testing for tourists is also available at the Tourist Triage South located at the Pinili Visitor Center along the national highway or just about an eight-minute drive from the Badoc gateway for tourists to process their entry into the province. As a general protocol of the province, a negative RT PCR with swab collected within 60 hours of arrival is required before one can enter the province.

Such observance is an opportunity that people worldwide must grab to speak up for nature and demand world leaders' action on such decline, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) which is the international conservation organization behind Earth Hour. Nature is vital to life on Earth but rate of this resource's loss in the last 50 years is already \"unprecedented in human history,\" WWF warned. WWF said surge in global trade, consumption and human population growth as well as continuing urbanization are fueling such decline. \"We are losing nature faster than it can restore itself and without urgent action, significant harm to people and planet is inevitable: inadequate food and water for our growing global population, significant harm to our economies and the mass extinction of an estimated one million species,\" it said. Citing earlier data, WWF said healthy nature can provide humanity various services collectively worth some USD125 trillion annually. The Philippines will observe Earth Hour this Saturday (March 27) at 8:30 p.m. WWF noted this year's Earth Hour will occur less than a year before UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity holds its 15th meeting. That meeting will focus on the state of nature, noted WWF \"By speaking up for nature this Earth Hour, we can put the spotlight on our planet and spark global conversation on the need for change, building momentum and a 'domino effect' that directly influences the direction of this crucial UN biodivesity conference in a few months,\" WWF said. Such global conversation can turn that conference into the event where world leaders formally commit to end nature loss and put Earth on the path to recovery by 2030, it noted. \"No matter where you are in the world, you can make an impact and join us for the Hour as we speak up for nature!\" said WWF. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is still raging so WWF is recommending that people participate in Earth Hour online or digitally instead. Among online activities for this year's Earth Hour is airing of the first 'Virtual Spotlight' video which people can watch and share, it said. \"If you are planning to be in a public space or are thinking of spending the Hour with friends and family outside your home, please follow local guidelines, remember to wear a mask and maintain social distancing,\" WWF continued, citing the basic precautions against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Earth Hour is WWF's flagship global movement that promotes concerted action for the environment and Earth. Beginning as a 2007 lights out event in Australia, Earth Hour evolved into an annual observance in over 100 countries worldwide.

Starting Tuesday up to the end of the week, the CLMMRH aims to vaccinate about 150 personnel a day, which would mean utilizing an estimated 800 doses for the initial jabs, which will be followed by the second shots after 28 days, Dr. Julius Drilon, medical center chief of CLMMRH, said. Dr. Carina Frayco, an infectious diseases specialist (IDS), said it is vital for her work as a medical front-liner to get protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). “As an IDS, I am grateful that I’m able to participate and especially I’m one of the first who received the Sinovac. This is important in my line of work, in my line of duty as a front-liner, and also for my own protection, for my family, and for the whole community,” Frayco said in an interview after taking the first shot. “Although it will be a long time that we can achieve herd immunity, but I’m happy that step by step, or what we call baby steps, we can achieve our goal to end this pandemic,” she added. At the CLMMRH, only about 50 percent of the 1,743 hospital staff has consented to avail of Sinovac shots for varying reasons – some are already above 60 years old, some have existing medical conditions, and some are hesitant because of the brand, Frayco said. “I hope that in the next few days after they will see that I’m okay, that I didn’t experience major side effects, it will encourage healthcare workers to take part in the vaccination program.

Section 3(g) of Republic Act (RA) 9944, or the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010, provides that “for delivery orders, the 20 percent discount shall likewise apply subject to certain conditions, i.e. senior citizen ID card number must be given while making the order over the telephone.”  It also provides that the senior citizen ID card must be presented upon delivery to verify the identity of the senior citizen entitled to the discount.

However, she said senior citizens are presently unable to avail of the benefit when ordering through food delivery apps.  Herrera proposed that food delivery service providers incorporate the appropriate discounts into the account holder’s profile to allow senior citizens to avail of their discount.  She underscored the need to extend assistance to senior citizens by providing discounts to this sector given their limited income due to restrictions in movement.  “The money equivalent to the 20 percent discount of the senior citizens may be utilized for the medicine and other maintenance expenses as well as other necessities,” she said in her resolution.

Gayares said he took Sinovac as protection against Covid-19 because “it is the safest for me”. “It’s unattenuated. It’s a dead virus. It has maintained its spike protein. It does not interfere with any other mechanism in my body except to stimulate the immune system to produce anti-bodies. That’s the normal, traditional way of making vaccines and letting the vaccines work in you, and Sinovac used that kind of technology,” he added. Tiples-Ruiz pointed out that if a person has a choice, the brand of vaccine would matter in deciding to be vaccinated. “But remember, we have an increase in demand and supply is not enough for everybody. The more people that are inoculated as soon as possible the better. We need to see this as a collective effort to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The safety of the vaccines is assured and the efficacy helps us,” she said. Ramos-Cortes said that in a way, the brand matters in choosing what vaccine to take, but in times of a pandemic, the choice would be to be vaccinated as early as possible, and anyone should grab the chance to be vaccinated. “I have no hypertension and I don’t have diabetes so I’m really okay with Sinovac. I would go for it because it’s the first vaccine that’s available for me so I chose to take it,” she said.

In a virtual briefing with the press, Roque said the healthcare workers (HCWs) have been facing the risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). \"The best vaccine is the available vaccines. We have the vaccines offered to you considering the risk you face as medical front-liners, you better grab it,\" Roque said in mixed English and Filipino. His comment came after many HCWs from the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center preferred to get vaccinated with other brands despite the arrival on Tuesday of the 7,200 doses of CoronaVac by Sinovac Biotech. The vaccines, which are part of the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines, are now placed in a cold storage facility at the regional hospital. To encourage HCWs to take their first shots of CoronaVac, VSMMC chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. volunteered to lead five other officials in the ceremonial inoculation at the hospital's Center for Behavioral Science Building here. \"Let me reiterate Sec. Roque's words: the available vaccines are those that are already available. I urge my colleagues to be vaccinated (with the CoronaVac),\" Aquino added. Roque said medical workers can still get other brands if they choose not to take the available vaccines now. He said Cebu will still get allocations from pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. The doses of this brand of vaccine from the United Kingdom will still be administered to the priority sector, which means that VSMMC medical officials and staff who would not get CoronaVac will be inoculated with it. \"Kaya lang, maghihintay sila kailan ang deployment ng AstraZeneca. Kaya nga kung anong vaccine na available ngayon, kunin nyo na po (However, they have to wait for the deployment of the AstraZeneca in Cebu. That's what's the available vaccines now, you better grab it),\" Roque pointed out. He also said other medical front-liners in the Rural Health Units in Cebu are being listed as priority sector for the vaccination rollout. However, they have to wait for the next allocations as the first group considered for the available vaccines now is the VSMMC medical staff.

In a phone interview, Dr. Mary Jane Roches Juanico, head of the DOH WV Center for Health Development (DOH WV CHD) infectious disease cluster, said six Covid-19 referral hospitals have been identified as recipients of the China-donated vaccines. Western Visayas was allocated 8,438 doses out of the 600,000 donated vaccines that arrived in the Philippines on Feb. 28. The allocation will be divided among recipient hospitals based on their actual number of employees who already have given their consent to be vaccinated. To be covered are the medical staff, health workers, and other employees. The recipient hospitals are Western Visayas Medical Center, West Visayas State University Medical Center, Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital, Riverside Medical Center, St. Paul Hospital, and Iloilo Doctor’s Hospital. Juanico said they are also preparing a quick substitution list to make sure that no vaccine will be wasted in case some would refuse to be vaccinated. “This is not mandatory but rather a voluntary vaccination,” she clarified. A resurvey is currently being conducted because they have previously prepared for AstraZeneca and not for Sinovac. Initially, it looked like the target recipients are also amenable to the Sinovac vaccine, she added. Juanico said they will immediately start the immunization once the vaccines are here. Meantime, in a virtual forum “Isyung Bakuna” hosted by DOH-6 and the Philippine Information Agency, Juanico said in general, people who are eligible to get vaccinated, should always grab the opportunity whenever there are free vaccines for their protection and their families as well. “Vaccination is really important. Every opportunity that the government gives for a free vaccination is really a chance of having an extended life because we are really protected from infectious diseases,” she said. Meanwhile, the Office of the Civil Defense will be holding a simulation exercise around 4 p.m. on Thursday in preparation for the vaccine arrival starting from the Iloilo International Airport in Cabatuan, Iloilo to the cold room warehouse of the DOH regional office in this city’s Mandurriao District.

This, after Roque drew flak from the public after he defended President Rodrigo Duterte’s earlier decision to reclassify this year’s Nov. 2 (All Souls’ Day), December 24 (Christmas Eve), and December 31 (Last Day of the Year) as special working days. Roque, in a virtual presser on Tuesday, said Duterte had revised the classification of the three public holidays to enable the country to recover “lost time” since it has been on “vacation” mode for almost a year. “Halos isang taon na tayong nagbakasyon dahil sa Covid-19. Siguro naman po ngayong nandito na ang bakuna, hayaan naman nating maka-recover tayo for lost time ‘no (We have been on vacation for nearly a year because of Covid-19. Perhaps, we need to recover for lost time now that the vaccine is here),” he said. After the backlash, Roque clarified that his “vacation” comment was only meant to give emphasis to Filipinos’ unemployment since the pandemic broke out. “Ang konteksto lang nito, talagang maraming tao ang hindi nakapaghanapbuhay dahil dito sa pandemiyang ito. Kaya nga ninanais ng economic team na makahabol naman tayo (The context of this is many people were unable to work because of the pandemic. The economic team wants us to catch up),” he said.

November 2 (Tuesday), December 24 (Friday) and December 31 (Friday) were initially declared as special non-working days. However, Duterte on Feb. 26 signed Proclamation 1107, declaring the three traditional holidays as special working days to boost economic productivity in the country amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Galvez emphasized the importance of legislating the Senate Bill 2057, the substitute bill for vaccine-related measures that proposed a much-needed indemnification clause required for Covid-19 vaccines. \"They really intend to protect not only the manufacturers but also the vaccinee considering that mayroong allocated tayo na ano sir na indemnification fund kung just in case na ma-ospital or mayroong tinatawag tayong adverse effect (that we have allocated indemnification fund just in case vaccine recipients may hospitalize due to adverse effects).

This commitment was made as the government, through the Task Force Zero Hunger and alongside its partners in the private sector and other non-profit organizations, launched the \"Pilipinas Kontra Gutom\" (PKG), a multi-sectoral anti-hunger initiative, which aimed at addressing involuntary hunger and food security in the Philippines on Monday. Margot Torres, private sector lead for the PKG movement, said the private sector has responded to the government's call for joint initiatives to end malnutrition and hunger being experienced by some Filipinos in different parts of the country. Torres said the private sector has translated the \"key responsibility areas\" of the National Food Policy into frameworks that can serve as a \"springboard\" for synergized initiatives and communication to end hunger issues among Filipinos. She said the PKG movement will be functional into four \"A\" frameworks: --Availability relates to food production by improving the productivity and income of the farmers and fisherfolk. It will also ensure a resilient food system. --Accessibility relates to distribution as well as ensuring 100 percent access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round. --Adequacy addresses hidden hunger with the vision of ending malnutrition experienced by children under five years old as well as pregnant women and lactating mothers. --Assistance that addresses hunger and ensures a resilient food system during crisis periods such as the current pandemic or natural disasters. \"While the long-term goal is to end hunger by 2030, we have set an immediate realistic goal of uplifting one million Filipinos from hunger and malnutrition by 2022,\" Torres said. She said the PKG programs will be pushed through in the priority areas with the highest poverty and malnutrition incidence. The Task Force Zero Hunger has identified 32 priority areas while the private sector has identified 17 more areas in 49 provinces nationwide. \"As the multisectoral collaboration continues, we have mapped out where in the Philippines there are existing programs to guide us in synergizing our efforts for both the present as well as the future,\" she said. Torres said they are targeting to include the public and partake in the PKG movement as she invited them to join the \"Lahat kasali, lahat kasalo\" initiative. \"We are preparing a consumer campaign and this will really invite the public to also participate even as low as 20 or 25 pesos to feed a hungry child so we're in the works,” she said. Torres noted that the campaign is set to be launched by April this year. Zero hunger movement Meanwhile, Task Force Zero Hunger chairperson and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said resolving issues on involuntary hunger in the country is a \"collective responsibility\" among the general public, the government, and the private sector. \"[It is] an imperative for all of us—the government needs the help of the private sector and other stakeholders to achieve our shared goals for zero hunger in the country,\" he said. Under the national food policy, Nograles said various programs and projects are lined-up to assist the food producers to sustain their livelihoods.

This as the government and private sector partners formally launched on Monday the Pilipinas Kontra Gutom (PKG), a national and multi-sectoral anti-hunger movement, to work together on various programs with a common goal: 1 million fewer hunger Filipinos by 2022. “With the strong synergy and collaboration between government and the private sector, this daunting task will be much more bearable. With the support of the PKG, we will be able to augment our resources and craft better plans and strategies so we can reach more and do more,” Nograles said during the PKG virtual launch program. With the support of the private sector, non-government organizations, and civil society groups, and spearheaded by the government’s Task Force Zero Hunger (TFZH) chaired by Nograles, PKG is adopting a whole-of-nation approach to achieve its immediate and long-term goals of addressing involuntary hunger and malnutrition in the Philippines -- an urgent concern given the millions of families that grapple with hunger in the country. “Through this whole-of-nation approach, we are optimistic that we can end hunger by 2030,” Nograles said. Nograles thanked all the groups and organizations “that recognize the importance of battling hunger and have committed to work for a hunger-free Philippines.\" \"Hunger is a silent enemy that can no longer be ignored; maraming apektado, at maraming kailangan tulungan (Many are affected and in need of assistance). In our campaign against hunger, we should be all in, all out -- anyone who can pitch in should help, and those who can help should go all out,” he said.

Battling hunger, one project at a time With a rallying slogan “lahat kasali, lahat kasalo” (everyone is involved), PKG plans to focus on key result areas of concern to organize sustainable initiatives for targeted beneficiaries that will address challenges concerning food availability and accessibility, adequate nutrition, and crises assistance. These are consistent with the Zero Hunger roadmap outlined in the National Food Policy unveiled by TFZH last month. PKG's initial projects include the following: -- Farmer assistance: With the end in view of elevating farming as a dignified and sustainable profession, these projects aim to increase farmer income by as much as 20 percent within the year, and to double farmer productivity by 2025 via the expansion of value chain projects and logistics improvements. -- Sustainable nutrition programs: Projects that will collectively work to achieve zero undernourished Filipino children across all households by 2030 via a strategy that involves campaigns to promote proper breastfeeding, address malnutrition, and roll out nutritious meals for Filipino households. -- Disaster response: Private sector companies will work to revolutionize their disaster response in close partnership and coordination with the attached national agencies and local government units to streamline the private sector’s efforts to facilitate a prepared, synchronized, and targeted action flow for food security when crises strike. -- Food banking: This effort involves the initiation of food surplus assessments among food manufacturers, restaurants, supermarkets, and public markets in Metro Manila, with the food surplus from donors eventually allocated for distribution to those in need. To promote these projects, to raise awareness regarding hunger, and to invite companies and organizations to join PKG programs, PKG is set to launch a public information campaign, the details of which will be accessible at pilipinaskontragutom.com.

Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said that she was informed by the QC Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (CESU) on Friday after they received the latest Covid-19 swab test on the 35-year old-man. “Ok na siya, he’s negative, he tested negative already pero nandyan pa rin siya sa quarantine facility (He is ok, he tested negative already but he needs to stay in the quarantine facility). He developed some mild symptoms a few days ago so we just want to make sure before he is given a certification to leave the facility,” Belmonte told reporters. In the meantime, the QC government has already contact traced about 350 individuals from the community within the 50-meter radius where the man stayed. Belmonte said that eight of these individuals have manifested some symptoms and that they are now under home quarantine pending their swab test results. Moreover, out of the 350 people, 106 have already undergone the Covid-19 swab test. Belmonte said their results are expected to be out within the day while the CESU is targeting to finish the swab test of all the remaining individuals that have been contact-traced. Meanwhile, CESU has already identified the Grab driver and contact tracing will also be done on all the persons with which he had encountered. As of this writing, Belmonte said they have not recommended placing the community where the man stayed under a special concern lockdown but that members of the community are advised to stay home. “Yung results ng 106 persons na yan yung magiging batayan kung tayo ay magla-lockdown or hindi (The results of the 106 individuals will be our basis if we will impose a lockdown or not).

In a statement, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. reiterated Manila's support of democracy in the Southeast Asian nation, recognizing both the military and its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi's roles in shaping the nation. \"The Philippines has been supportive of Myanmar’s progress towards a fuller democracy, cognizant of the Army’s role in preserving its territorial integrity and national security, as well as the unifying role of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in the history of the country and Army her father founded,\" he said. \"The realization of this democratic process can only be achieved through the complete restoration of the status quo ante.” Myanmar's military seized power and detained senior political officials, including Suu Kyi last week, alleging fraud in the November 2020 general elections overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's party the National League for Democracy. The power grab prompted a series of demonstrations against the junta takeover and to demand the release of Suu Kyi. Several cities in Myanmar, including Yangon, have reportedly been placed under martial law as of this posting. In a recent ANC interview, Locsin said he wants to see the army, Suu Kyi, and freedom to \"work hand-in-hand again\". Previously, he criticized Western nations for destroying the reputation of Suu Kyi and \"making her a victim of the military\". Suu Kyi, Myanmar's paragon of democracy and a 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, met criticism over her alleged inaction in the atrocities toward the Rohingya minority. \"I pour scorn on the Western world for destroying Aung San Suu Kyi and making her a victim of the military,\" he said in a February 4 Senate hearing, noting that the Rohingya issue was the problem of Britain, which he said, \"created a sub-class of sub-human Rohingya\" and left them to Burma without giving them residence or citizenship. “Aung San Suu Kyi had to balance the continuing tolerance of the army for her democratic moves against the racial hatred against the Rohingya. And what did the Western and those fairies in Oxford do? They tear her down, they removed her reputation,\" he said. \"She had only the adoration of the world to stand up with against the army. They stripped her of all of that... Now the army saw, this woman has nothing, she has no name, no reputation, 'it's time to get her out of the way' and that's what happened,\" he added.

Malls, markets, and even sidewalk vendors have an abundance of hair ties in all styles and designs. There are plain ones, and there are colorful ones. Some are tight, and some are loose.","body":"MANILA – In a tropical country like the Philippines, it’s common to see people, mostly girls and women, keeping their hair up in ponytails. Malls, markets, and even sidewalk vendors have an abundance of hair ties in all styles and designs. There are plain ones, and there are colorful ones. Some are tight, and some are loose. Ponytail holders are not only used to hold someone's hair in place while they washed their faces, but they are also a fashion statement, especially in the ‘80s and ‘90s. In the past year, they’re starting to be trendy again. Enterprising Filipinas like Rolanda “Dhang” Morales De Jesus, 32, are taking advantage of this trend to earn extra income for her family amid the Covid-19 pandemic. As an administrative staff in Malabon National High School, De Jesus earned enough money to provide a good life for her family. But there were always additional expenses to pay, and she needed another way to make more money. She started by selling hygiene items such as alcohol, face masks, and face shields, selling food such as bagoong, and atsara (or atchara), and other catering services. However, sales eventually slowed down. “Kailangan ko ng iba pang pagkakitaan kasi dito sa family, dalawa yung nawalan ng trabaho. Ako, suwerte, luckily, hindi naman ako natanggal kaya tuloy pa rin yung suweldo ko (I needed another way to earn money because in my family, two lost their jobs. Me, I was lucky I didn’t lose my job that’s why I continue to receive salary),” she told the Philippine News Agency in an interview. One day, she went browsing for ideas online until she found a business idea that eventually made her known as the go-to scrunchie store in Malabon City. Her business idea blossomed and became “Neyhann’s Sari-Sari Collections.” “Sabi ko, ponytail [holder] kaya? Kasi yung sa online, walang masyado nun e. Nag-isip ako yung wala masyado. So nag-search ako sa YouTube, na-search ko na ang tawag pala scrunchie (I thought, what about ponytail holders? Because there were only a few selling them online. So I went on YouTube and found out what they called scrunchies),” she said. Determined to start as soon as possible, she started teaching herself how to sew, purchasing cotton and silk cloth which she used as materials until she had enough to make at least 50 pieces by hand. It wasn’t easy, so she decided to buy herself a small sewing machine and was able to make about 300 more. Soon enough, she started having resellers, mostly high school and college students who also needed extra cash to pay for tuition and gadgets for distance learning. “May mga reseller ako -- mga college students, grade 11, 12. Natutuwa naman ako kasi nakakatulong ako sa kanila (I have resellers - college students and grades 11 and 12. It makes me happy because I can help them earn),” she said. But her sewing machine was not designed for heavy work, so it eventually broke down. De Jesus had to rethink her business idea. Friendly push According to De Jesus, she would have given up on her scrunchie business if it weren’t for her friend, Rhuby, who gifted her with a heavy-duty sewing machine that cost around PHP5,000. “Nung October, birthday ko. Inisip ko, ‘Sana may magregalo ng sewing machine’. Tapos may nagbigay, office mate ko (Last October, it was my birthday. I thought ‘I hope someone gifts me with a sewing machine.’ And then someone actually gave me one, my office mate),” she said. She said it was her friend who pushed her to pursue her business venture when she was on the verge of giving up because she knew it was something that she was passionate about. “Ang balak ko talaga ihinto na kasi wala naman din akong pambili ng machine. Although may trabaho ako, may kailangan kasi akong iba. Sabi niya, ‘Hindi, ituloy mo ‘yan. Ayan, bumili ka ngayon ng sewing machine (I intended to stop because I couldn’t afford to buy a sewing machine. Although I have work, I need to prioritize other things. But she said, ‘No, continue. Buy a sewing machine,’)” she added. De Jesus stressed the importance of having friends who not only support her dreams, but also build her confidence when she feels unsure. “Sila yung mga pushers ko, ganun. Kailangan may mga kaibigan kang naka suporta sa’yo kasi kung ikaw lang at walang sumusuporta, parang hindi mo kakayanin (They’re the ones who push me. We should have friends who support us because if it’s just you, you won’t be able to handle it),” she said. Who’s Neyhann? The word “Neyhann” is actually a portmanteau of “hon” from “honey”, her term of endearment for her husband Jonar, and the names of their two sons, Yohann, 10, and Giovann, 7. From time to time, her family members, including her 62-year-old mother and cousin, help her throughout the process of making and selling scrunchies. De Jesus said she’s the only person in the family who uses scrunchies, but should she have a daughter in the future, she’ll definitely make sure she has all the styles and colors. Currently, there are about 35 different scrunchie colors and designs available in her shop, which usually cost PHP15 (in retail) or PHP12 per piece (in wholesale or 100 to 500 pieces). But she also sells them in cardboard and wooden boxes as well as pouches. A cardboard box with six scrunchies of any design or color cost PHP85 while a cardboard box with 15 scrunchies of any design or color cost PHP215. A wooden box with six scrunchies of any design or color cost PHP115. When placed in a pouch, three scrunchies of any design or color costs only PHP55. The latest additions to her collection are scrunchie clips and headbands also made of cotton or silk. “Halos lahat ng colors mabenta e. Kasi hindi ako nagi-stick sa isang kulay lang. Kunwari may na-discover akong ibang kulay na silk or printed na colors, gina-grab ko ‘yun para maiba yung tingin ng tao. Nauubos naman siya (All colors are saleable. I don’t think of one color. For example, when I discover a new color or print, I grab them so people will see these as unique. These always sell out),” she said. Her favorite place to shop for cotton and silk is in Tondo, Manila because they are cheaper there. It’s also where she purchases items to decorate her boxes and pouches. Cotton and silk, she said, are ideal fabric that are used to make her scrunchies because they have less tension than regular hair ties and don't leave a dent in people's hair. The joy in sewing De Jesus didn't get to enjoy scrunchies when she was younger, instead she tied her hair using regular hair ties, sometimes even rubber bands. But now, she’s making up for all the years she didn’t get to accessorize that much. “Parang gustong ibalik yung style ng ‘90s. Ngayon, medyo nag-evolve lang siya dahil mga silk na, makikintab, maraming kulay tsaka mas maraming designs ngayon (It seems people want to bring back the ‘90s style. Now, scrunchies have evolved because they use silk, which are shinier, and more colorful cloth, and there are more designs now),” she said. She also makes it a point to ensure that her scrunchies are top quality -- which means there’s no place for incorrect stiches. “Kahit mura yung product, dapat may quality din para laban (Even if it’s cheap, it should be of good quality)!” she said. For her, sewing scrunchies doesn’t feel like a job at all. She said that she finds joy making them and making younger customers happy when they use scrunchies. “Tuwang-tuwa ako sa ginagawa. Gustung-gusto ko siya kasi nung bata, hindi ko siya naranasan e. Parang naliligayahan ka habang nagtatahi ka kasi ang kulay-kulay ng nakikita mo (I’m really happy with what I do. I really like doing it because when I was younger, I didn’t get to experience them. It makes me happy while I sew because what I am sewing is colorful),” she said. While she initially had doubts, de Jesus said she trusted her gut feeling and took a risk because it was something she felt that she would genuinely enjoy. “Isipin mo muna kung sure ka doon sa business na gagawin mo, kung magiging masaya ka ba, kung yun yung passion mo. Kasi kung hindi mo passion ang gusto mo, hindi magki-click (You must be sure first if you really want to pursue your business, if you will be happy, if it is your passion. Because if it is not your passion, it won’t click),” she said.

Anhouvic Atilano, speaking for the Army’s 6th Infantry Division, said Monday the BIFF was behind the harassment of civilian communities in Barangay Itaw, South Upi, and the ambush of town Mayor Reynalbert Insular, who emerged unscathed. During the ambush, a hitchhiker identified as Thelmo Divinagracia Sasi, was killed while three others -- King Sasi, John Andro Tumbaga, and Pao Dalimbang -- were injured in the 2 p.m. ambush in Barangay Pandan, South Upi, Maguindanao. “The BIFF wanted to grab the ancestral lands of the Teduray people in Barangay Itaw,” Atilano said in a phone interview. He said five BIFF combatants were killed when two attack helicopters fired rockets and machine gun at the fleeing BIFF after the ambush. “Elements of 57th Infantry Battalion extracted the ambush victims at the site while artillery fires were launched against the attackers,” Atilano said. A resident said the slain gunmen were taken by their fleeing comrades as they rushed toward the upland communities of Datu Saudi Ampatuan and Talayan, also in Maguindanao. Insular said he and the town’s disaster risk reduction and management council went to Barangay Itaw Sunday morning to extend relief aid to some 599 families affected by the BIFF harassment on Jan. 1. “We are already returning to the town center when the ambush took place, I thank the military for responding quickly that save our lives,” Insular said. He requested the deployment of peacekeeping troops in Barangay Itaw to prevent similar harassment in the future. The displaced families have started to return home Monday morning, Insular said.

I think 75 percent, at least in Mindanao, mga Lumad. Kayong mga Lumad, umuwi kayo sabihin ninyo sa mga tao ninyo na niloloko lang sila ng NPA talaga. Parang namatay ang Lumad. (You lumads, go home and tell your people you’re being fooled by NPA. Lumads are being killed). So if this thing goes on, the lumads, yung native na Pilipino talaga (native Filipinos) will become an extinct tribe kung hindi kayo huminto diyan (if you don’t stop),” he said. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Nov. 3 said it would be hypocrisy for the CPP-NPA to say that they do not have legal fronts. “Kaplastikan po ng CPP-NPA kung sasabihin nilang wala silang mga legal fronts na tinatawag (It is hypocrisy for the CPP-NPA to say that they don’t have what they call legal fronts),” he said. In a Senate hearing last week, Zarate denied being a member of CPP-NPA and denounced the AFP's red-tagging of the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives. He said Bayan Muna and members of the Makabayan bloc are legitimate groups pushing for meaningful social reforms. The CPP-NPA-NDF is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

James Kodrowski, managing director of Foodie.ph, told reporters here on Thursday that the company is “aggressively looking for more partner restaurants in Metro Cebu”. The company has over a hundred vendors in Metro Manila, he said. The delivery firm recently expanded to the Cebu market, where demand for food delivery has seen an unprecedented growth driven by consumers buying food online during the quarantine period. “The pandemic has brought challenges in sourcing event requirements. Foodie.ph can fix any corporate food requirements and effectively fill this gap between the corporate customers and the restaurants,” Kodrowski said. Cebu’s corporate customers who need bulk food, whether for meetings, conferences, or catering, now have more delivery options. Existing food delivery companies such as Grab Food and Foodpanda have also been seeing this strong demand since the start of the lockdowns early this year. Foodie.ph in particular is seeing a growing demand for food group delivery. “We are an enterprise-level platform that allows corporate clients to efficiently order online. Customers do not need to worry about quarantine restrictions when ordering for group food,” he said. Cebu's expanding delivery industry has been boosted by growing consumer demand amid the Covid-19-induced social distancing and stay-at-home protocols. The firm has a dedicated in-house call center and logistics team that gather quotations, contact restaurants, track and deliver the orders with a guaranteed on-time delivery service.

Taguiam said amid the “economic struggles faced by businesses, this is an important piece of legislation that will bring relief to business owners facing tax challenges”.  CCCI’s call came a day after Mayor Edgardo Labella called on companies here to take advantage of the tax concessions offered by the city government.  Special Officer of the Mayor for Finance and Treasury Jerone Castillo said the CCCI was instrumental in the creation of the tax amnesty ordinance and crossing parties to push for its passage.  “This is not a proposal of the city. This is an initiative of the CCCI in relation to the ease of doing business,” Castillo said.  The tax amnesty ordinance of 2019 was approved in late 2019, and took effect in September.  The tax amnesty measure grants reprieve and foregoes or waives the collection of unpaid interest, penalties, and surcharges of all outstanding or unpaid local taxes including real property, business and community taxes in 2019 and previous years without penalty by Dec. 15, 2020.  It also imposes a fixed rate of 10 percent on all unpaid due and demandable real property, business, and community taxes, as well as other fees and charges after this date but within one year from the effectivity of the ordinance.  The city government has moved the deadline for payment of real property taxes (RPTs) and business taxes for fiscal year 2020 to Dec. 21, 2020.  Castillo also urged that the CCCI, which is the largest business group in Cebu, may lobby for further extension of the deadline to provide relief for taxpayers.  He said taxpayers may visit the city hall for accurate assessment and computation of their tax obligations.  Online application is also available, he added.

Glen Fernando, DTI Antique provincial office Trade and Industry Specialist, said that since most of the government employees have received their bonuses, then they could already do their Christmas shopping and no longer wait for a few days before December 25. “Consumers are advised no longer to wait for the last minute shopping,” he said. Starting November 17 they intensified their monitoring of Noche Buena products to make sure that prices of commodities like the 500 grams Swift Noche Buena Ham will not exceed the Suggested Retail Price (SRP), which is PHP135.00, and the Del Monte Spaghetti 400 grams at PHP52.25. “So far in our monitoring of the Noche Buena products the major stores in the province had not exceeded the SRP,” Fernando said. “We have no specific day for the monitoring but we will do it weekly,” he added. Aside from doing early shopping, consumers are also told to be wise buyers. \"As wise buyers, they should not be brand conscious but grab the opportunity to buy products that are sold as premium in pack,” he said. An example of premium in pack items is the spaghetti noodles that are sold in bundle with sauce and cheese or the salad macaroni with mayonnaise and creamer, which could be cheaper as compared when they are bought as single items. Fernando said that shopping malls and stores will get a letter of inquiry if ever they will be found to have exceeded the SRP.

Once or twice a week, Grade 12 student Jaira Crystal Paza, 17, and three of her friends have to walk 4 km. to Lanawan village in nearby Macarthur town through a newly paved undulate road with steep climbs. Lanawan is the nearest community with a mobile phone network coverage. The other village with phone signal is Cansiboy village of Burauen town, which is about 5 km. from Mahagnao. \"For two to three hours, we have to stay under a small shade outside a school in Lanawan to be able to send and receive text messages and view instructions from our teachers in our class group chat,\" Paza said in an interview Tuesday. She is the top student of her class and an aspiring flight attendant. Paza is currently enrolled at the Hibunawan National High School, situated 8 km. away from their village. While studying their self-learning modules, students residing in Mahagnao list down all their questions so they would not forget them once they reach a place with phone signal. \"We are lucky if we get a reply from our teachers and classmates in a few minutes. Sometimes, we have to wait for two hours for their response,\" said Friza Joy Agrava, 15, a Grade 10 student of Burauen National High School (BNHS). These learners start their hike to Lanawan village after lunch and rush back home before dark. It takes an hour of brisk walking to get there and back. While in Lanawan, they also grab the opportunity to read online or download learning materials to supplement their home-based learning. \"Our classmates are lucky they live in places with mobile phone network coverage. But for us, obtaining a phone signal is a big sacrifice,\" said 15-year-old Pearly Ann Agrava, a Grade 11 student of BNHS, whose dream is to become a worker in the tourism industry. About 100 high school students enrolled in Burauen and La Paz towns have been participating in remote learning inside their homes in Mahagnao. Most of their parents are farmers with no capacity to facilitate their children’s distance learning experience. The government has prohibited face-to-face classes this academic year for fear of the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in schools. Mahagnao, one of the farthest villages in Burauen town, is located 18 km. from the town center and is one of the communities in Leyte province without cell reception. Each week, teachers deliver printed modules to the village with the help of village officials and parent-leaders. The village, situated within the Mahagnao Volcano and Natural Park, is 1,200 meters above sea level and surrounded by Leyte’s natural wonders. Listed as a protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the park has a dormant volcano with a huge crater that turned into a lake. The village also hosts multiple hot springs, a sulfur mountain, and waterfalls.

Further, NCRPO is conducting a separate and distinct fact-finding investigation regarding this matter to determine the fault of the cop, if any. We are also encouraging the lady driver to coordinate with us and file a case against the subject police officer if his actions warrant such,” NCRPO chief, Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas said in a statement. Citing the report from the local police, Sinas said the incident happened around 10 p.m. on Tuesday at the pickup/drop off area of a coffee shop along Cayetano Boulevard in Barangay Ususan. Capt. Ronald Saquilayan was waiting for his daughter while inside his car when a woman identified as Mary Florence Norial, who was onboard a Hyundai Accent honked at his car for him to move so she can pass through. Saquilayan came out of his vehicle to report the matter to the security guard. However, when he was about to go back to his car, Norial suddenly pushed the door of the car which prevented the cop from boarding on it. She then allegedly hit the cop on the head. Saquilayan then arrested Norial while informing her of her rights and the nature of the crime she committed. Norial allegedly became unruly, resisted, and tried to flee. Complaints for alarm and scandal and direct assault and Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code were already filed against Norial on Wednesday as supported by statements of two witnesses of the incident. However, Norial, in a Facebook post, claimed she was about to pick up a passenger in the area but the driveway was blocked by the vehicle driven by Saquilayan. She flashed the headlight and honked several times but the driver of the car would not move the vehicle. She also knocked on the windshield of the vehicle but still, the driver would not reportedly budge. She then sought the assistance of a security guard who helped her knock on the windshield of the car to ask the driver to move. But Saquilayan allegedly opened the car door ‘suddenly and forcefully’ which resulted in Norial being hit and thrown to the bushes along the driveway. Angered by the driver's action, Norial allegedly got up and slapped him. PNP spokesman Col. Ysmael Yu said the chief of police of Pateros was instructed to do an impartial investigation on the incident since the policeman involved is one of his men. “The chief of police of Pateros has the discretion to conduct an investigation. I believe that this is already being looked into at the Pateros police station level,” Yu said.

Gordon stressed the need to expedite the international airport proposed to be built in Bulacan to make the country more attractive to investors. Gordon made the statement in his Wednesday’s co-sponsorship speech for Senate Bill No. 1823 under Committee Report No. 128, which proposes to grant Miguel Aerocity Inc. a franchise to construct, develop, establish, operate and maintain a domestic and international airport in Bulakan, Bulacan and to construct, develop, establish, operate and maintain an adjacent airport city “I strongly support this new airport that is solely going to be built by San Miguel Corporation without any money being put in by the government. This idea is something that has to be undertaken real, real fast because after Covid there would be a mad rush for investments and we have to make our country look very, very good,” Gordon said. He said the proposed construction of an international airport in Central Luzon is really “a game-changer” “We can now make a tremendous leap-frog into the world of competitiveness,” he added. Gordon said with China dislodged as the manufacturing hub with giant firms like LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, among others going to Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, the prospect of a very major international airport, with all the other airports and seaports, would certainly make the Philippines attractive to the people who are now changing the paradigm. “With the promise of this major airport, it is going to be a big selling point. Apart from the strategic location of our country vis-à-vis Asia, away from the mainland like England is to Europe, away from the battles and wars going in the mainland, I think this would be very, very good for our country. If we get that airport here, I’m sure not only FedEx will come here but all the airplanes. When this airport opens, it will attract other industries,” he said. Gordon also expressed confidence that the resulting multiplier effect of the proposed Bulacan International Airport, together with the Regional Infrastructure and Investment Coordinating Hub of Central Luzon, a bill that he authored, would not only decongest Metro Manila and disperse industries, but it would also boost the economy in Central Luzon all the way to Northern Luzon and Southern Luzon. “It would also serve as a model for the other regions in the country,” he said. He said all the great countries in the world are really putting up a lot of airports because aviation has really grown by leaps and bounds. \"Airpots attract a lot of industries. They will be attracting a lot of cargo operations, warehousing, certainly there would be a lot of businesses like restaurants, duty-free shops. If we subdivide the vast, idle land in the region into possible industrial or investment parks, the new airport and the three other existing airports in Subic, Clark and Manila, together with the seaports and the network of highways and the proposed railways, would facilitate the movement of raw materials, goods, trade and people. It would be a very good come-on for investors,” he added.

In a statement, the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA)-Cebu Chapter said it conceptualized the virtual sale of Cebu’s top brands in the hospitality, wellness, travel, automotive, fashion, hardware, electronics and food industries.  Inspired by the great Singapore sale, the event will highlight exceptional deals, promos and packages of participating brands throughout the sale period from Sept. 15 to Oct. 31.  Chester Lim, PRA-Cebu Chapter president, said the long period of quarantine since the middle of March and the lockdowns amid the resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in June have crippled businesses and jobs lost.  “We need to start building up business and consumer confidence through a movement of consumption. The Great Cebu Sale will hopefully create favorable conditions for businesses to go online during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Lim said. “It’s a great opportunity for Cebu businesses to promote their product and services via e-commerce.”  He said this first virtual shopping event will be conducted collectively by retailers in Cebu, along with the different businesses, organizations, and chambers here.  As Cebu is reopening the economy with the downtrend of Covid-19 cases, Lim said now is “a good time to purchase anything from discounted room accommodations to the best deal in work and study from home gadgets or simply enjoy a visit in your favorite family destination\".  He said Cebuanos will surely get the best deal for their peso, as all businesses have to submit their applications to DTI.  “Cebuanos can be assured of legitimate and fair business dealings,” he added.  Nine hotels – Seda Ayala Center and Seda Central Bloc, Golden Prince Hotel and Suites, Bai Hotel, Marco Polo Plaza Cebu, Movenpick Hotel, Cebu Grand Hotel, Citadines Cebu City, and Mezzo Hotel – participating the virtual trading will treat Cebuanos with 50 percent discounts on their products and services.  Wellness facilities like Maayo, LH Prime Medical Clinic will also present their services while restaurants like Cafe Laguna, House of Lechon, Lantaw, Top of Cebu, 10 Dove Street will give Cebuanos best choices of cuisines.  Tourism and amusement brands like Island Souvenirs and Anjo World Theme Park, hardware establishments like Belmont Hardware Depot and Cebu Bionic Builders, automotive companies such as JMC Vehicles and Deco Sales, Loalde and ATE Clothier for fashion will pitch in their different products and services.  Gaisano Main, Fresco, D+B Wines, Prosel Pharma, Aerophone, Remplex Productions, Twinbee, and Third Team Media are other businesses that signed up for the activity.  The PRA, however, said other businesses in Cebu can still join the event by signing up until Monday (Aug. 31).  The event will also highlight how Cebu businesses have gone digital and embraced the online platform to sell their products and services. The event organizers thus tapped Foodpanda, Maxim, Mober, Lalamove and Grab Delivery as partners for the event.  The Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu, Inc. (HRRACI), Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), and Cebu Filipino Chinese Chamber of Commerce (CFCCC) are collaborating with PRA for the event.  Also helping them are the Hardware Consolidated, Inc. (HCI), Cebu Alliance of Tour Operation Specialists, Inc. (CATOS), Cebu Business Club (CBC) and the Mactan Export Processing Zone Chamber of Exporters and Manufacturers (MEPZCEM).

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said nurses with experience dealing with Covid-19 patients will give them the advantage which foreign employers are looking for. “Sa tingin ko po kung kayo ay mag-apply dito sa emergency recruitment ng ating gobyerno at nagtrabaho po habang may Covid, naku, pag-aagawan po kayo lalo pag natapos po itong pandemic na ito (I think that if you apply for a job in the emergency recruitment of our government and work while we continue to grapple with Covid, you’ll even be more sought-after when this pandemic is over),” he said in a virtual Palace briefing. Roque emphasized that nurses have to gain years’ worth of experience working as a nurse in the country before working overseas. “With your clinical experience at the time of Covid, you will become the subject of headhunters. So konting tiyaga lang po (have a little more perseverance) but take advantage of the opportunity na rin po (also) to prove your worth in the Philippines as clinical nurses,” he said. He also appealed to nurses to understand that the government is also looking for their safety by preventing them to work abroad. “Ang unang konsiderasyon po ng ating Presidente ay pangalagaan po ang kalusugan ng ating mga health workers dahil ang pupuntahan po nila ay mas malala pong kaso ng Covid-19 (The first consideration of our President is to ensure the health of our health workers because the countries they want to work for are facing a worse Covid-19 situation),” he said. According to Roque, healthcare workers should also take into consideration their duty to serve fellow Filipinos first. “Charity begins at home. Meron naman po tayong mga bakanteng posisyon. Dito po muna sana tayo magtrabaho (There are vacant positions here. I hope you consider working here first),” he said. Last week, Roque appealed to nurses’ sense of nationalism to convince them to stay while the country is facing a state of public health emergency. “Sa tingin ko po, sa panahon ng pandemiya, mananaig naman po ang nasyonalismo sa puso at damdamin ng ating mga nurses (I think at the time of the pandemic, nationalism will prevail in the hearts and feelings of our nurses),” Roque said. He said the government is already providing healthcare workers additional benefits such as risk allowance, PHP15,000 for those who get infected with Covid-19, life insurance, free accommodation and transportation, and free and regular testing. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) earlier issued Resolution 09, temporarily suspending the deployment of all healthcare workers \"until the national state of emergency is lifted”. However, healthcare workers with perfected and signed overseas employment contracts as of March 8 to work abroad. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases also released resolution No. 64 temporarily suspending the deployment of medical professionals. Earlier this month, Malacañang announced plans to hire 10,000 healthcare workers to boost the workforce. ‘It’s okay not to be okay’ Amid concerns that mental stress caused by the persisting Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on Filipinos, Roque urged the public to look after their mental health by seeking help from medical experts and spiritual leaders. “Whether it be a medical professional or a spiritual leader, kinakailangan lang po humanap tayo ng kausap (We just need to find someone to talk to),” Roque said. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire urged the public to contact the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) crisis hotline at 0917 899 8727 (USAP) and 989 8727 (USAP). “Hindi lang po dapat physical health ang tinitignan natin kundi dapat healthy rin po tayo mentally. So ito pong ating mga kababayan na nakakaranas ng fears, anxieties, depression, feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, maari po kayo tumawag dito po sa aming mga hotlines (We should not only take care of our physical health, but we should also ensure that we are healthy mentally. So, our citizens who feel fears, anxieties, depression, feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, you may call our hotlines),” she said. She said the public can also contact partner institutions of the Department of Health namely the Philippine Mental Health Association, the University of the Philippines Diliman Psychosocial Services, and the Ateneo Bulatao Center for Psychological Services. “It’s okay not to be okay. Lahat po tayo ay nakakaranas ng mga ganyang pakiramdam sa ngayon dahil sa sitwasyon na ito. Pero kailangan lang po ang suporta ng pamilya, suporta ng komunidad (All of us experience these feelings because of the current situation.

Business owner Catz Alejo, one of the two owners of Hello KitTea Garden, is using every means available to ensure that her business will survive the present crisis. As dine-in services were either banned or limited due to quarantine restrictions, Alejo said her milk tea business has been surviving thanks to online delivery services. \"We are surviving due to Grab and LalaFood if not for them, we would have closed shop a long time ago,\" Catz said in a mix of English and Filipino in an interview Monday. She is also very thankful that the health crisis failed to dampen the \"milk tea craze\" as customers continue to patronize their products. Compared to now, Catz admitted that sales were very good before Covid-19, adding that HelloKitTea Garden formally took wing on June 8, 2019. \"Sales before the Covid-19 pandemic ranged from PHP8,000 to PHP12, 000 daily. Now, we're lucky to get PHP2,000 to PHP4,000,\" she said. While this is just enough to recover all of their operating expenses, Catz said what is important is that they are able to survive while still providing employment. \"Matira matibay.

Prior to the pandemic, she added that they have four people manning their milk tea shop in Urduja Village, Caloocan City. In compliance with the government's health and safety protocols, Alejo said they only have three people left and not all of them are required to report daily. In fact, only one is present at the store daily while the other two are rotating on shifts. She also believes the pandemic will not be here forever and that business will rebound once a cure or vaccine is developed and made available to the public. Alejo added that she cannot afford to let down their customers who have grown fond of their milk teas and other foods they are serving.

Belmonte branded this as \"good news\" despite being the most densely populated with more than three million residents. She said data from May 26 until this week showed there are more recovered cases than active cases in the city. Belmonte attributed this to immediately setting up quarantine facilities for health workers who help in the recovery of Covid-19 positive patients, and the implementation of special concern lockdowns in specific barangays in the city where there is community transmission. Currently, the city has three quarantine facilities with a 500-bed capacity. By the end of August, Belmonte said they are looking forward to increasing this figure to 1,500 bed-capacity. On special concern lockdowns, Belmonte said they implement 14-day lockdowns which may be extended to one month, or until the residents who caught the infection have recovered, before lifting it. Belmonte said that during lockdowns, nobody is allowed to enter or leave the area. “Ginagawa natin lahat ng nasa lockdown area talagang lockdown sila, sumusulat po kami ng letter sa kanilang mga employer telling them their situation at kung maaari lang wag naman silang tanggalin sa trabaho habang sila ay nasa lockdown area.

Randy Apostol, deputy chief of Polomolok municipal police station, identified the slain suspects as Jomari Doma, 18, and Dimas Talib, 58, who were listed as members of the Nilong sub-group of the Dawlah Islamiyah-Hassan Group. He said Doma, a resident Sitio Batotitik in Barangay Basag, Tboli town, was arrested around noon Tuesday due to a warrant of arrest over the ambush last month of former Barangay Rubber chairperson Moner Kinjiyo. As the suspect was being brought to the police station aboard a patrol vehicle around 1:15 p.m., he reportedly attempted to grab the service firearm of one of his escorts. As they grappled for control of the firearm, it went off and hit the suspect, who was eventually declared dead upon arrival at the municipal hospital. Apostol, in a report released on Thursday, added that Talib was killed in a shootout with operatives during a buy-bust operation past 9 a.m. on Wednesday in Purok San Miguel, Barangay Klinan 6. He said the suspect resisted arrest after selling a sachet of suspected shabu worth PHP500 to a police officer who posed as a buyer. Talib reportedly drew a handgun and opened fire, prompting them to retaliate. The suspect was fatally wounded in the ensuing firefight and declared dead upon arrival at the municipal hospital. Recovered from the suspect was a homemade handgun, PHP500 marked bill, a sling bag containing an M26 fragmentation grenade, two sachets of suspected shabu worth PHP6,800, and a motorcycle.

Police Master Sgt. Veronica Villareal, information officer of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group-Cordillera, identified the suspects as Richard Allen Badua del Rio, 26; John Lawrence Fernandez Cercado, 22; and Vilmor Garcia Wakit, 25. Del Rio and Cercado were arrested at Barangay San Vicente around noon Wednesday. Wakit was arrested in a separate entrapment operation near his residence on the same day. Villareal said on Thursday that several drivers sought their help after realizing that the licenses issued to them were fake. The complainants said they thought they were dealing with a fixer at the Land Transportation Office (LTO) who can get them a license for PHP4,000, after they failed the LTO-facilitated examination for professional drivers. Villareal said the drivers carry non-professional licenses but need to upgrade to a professional one as required of drivers who wanted to join ride-hailing firm Grab. In an interview, del Rio and Cercado said that they transacted with Wakit, who knows someone who manufactures fake licenses somewhere in Avenida, Manila. \"The victims came to us after seeing some of their drivers license which they suspected to be fake. We immediately coordinated with the Land Transportation Office-Cordillera to verify if they have records on the released driver's license. LTO-CAR said they don't have records so we conducted the entrapment operation,\" Villareal said. Villareal said the suspects are facing charges for falsification of public document, estafa, and violation of the Land Transportation law. LTO-CAR regional director Francis Rae Almora encouraged other victims to file complaints against the suspects. He appealed to the public to transact only at the LTO office and follow the legal way of acquiring a driver's license.

The memorandum of agreement is currently being reviewed and (it) will soon be ready for turn-over,” Lacson said in a report he delivered as part of his State of the Province Address on Tuesday afternoon. He said the province opted to let an NGO operate the \"Negrense: Kadiwa\" because the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA) wants to sustain the initiative. On April 1, the provincial government and the Department of Agriculture (DA) opened the \"Negrense-Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita\" store at the Negros Food Terminal Market here while the province was under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. “This project was rolled-out also in collaboration with other local government units to make agriculture commodities available at affordable prices,” Lacson said. Records showed that from April 1 to June 22, the \"Negrense: Kadiwa\" generated total sales of PHP2.751 million after catering to more than 3,000 consumers. Also, 467 farmers and fisherfolk suppliers as well as 15 consolidators were linked and 20 personnel generated employment from the initiative. Jose Albert Barrogo, chief of the DA-Western Visayas Regional Agricultural Engineering Division, lauded the partnership of the provincial government with the MUAD. He said the concept of \"Negrense: Kadiwa\" opens huge opportunities to both the public and private sectors, and is harmonized with the DA’s “new thinking”. “To further move and sustain the initiative, the decision of the provincial government in tapping and making partnership with NGOs is a right move.

Lt. Melanie Martins, who hails from Angeles City, Pampanga, made the challenging transition from the enlisted aviation community to the wardroom of a guided missile submarine in 2013, becoming the first female Filipino officer to earn the Submarine Warfare Specialist pin in September last year, the US Navy Office of Community Outreach said in a news release issued Friday. The submarine warfare insignia, worn by all qualified submariners worldwide, is a universally recognizable symbol of a submariner’s experience, competency, and in the case of officers, the ability to assume command in an emergency. Over many decades, earning one’s “dolphins” has evolved into a rite of passage in submarine culture. The US Navy submarine warfare pin features the starboard angle of an O-class submarine emerging from the center of the insignia, slicing through the waves of an oceanic horizon. Two dolphins, the attendants of the Greek god of the sea Poseidon and patron deity to sailors, bring shape to the submariners’ badge and are seen surfacing from the sea, facing the submarine. The insignia is an unspoken indication that the wearer has challenged the depths of the seas and has been deemed worthy of donning it by their peers. Those who wear “dolphins” are widely acknowledged as part of an elite community, and as Martins related, accepted as part of a close-knit team. “I felt like I knew my wardroom for a very long time when I first got there! There was no awkward moment with anyone, even in the enlisted ranks,” said Martins. “My first experience was scary, especially when I found out how to get in and out of the boat. I was so scared to climb up and down the escape trunk. The passageways are so tight and the compartments are confusing, but everyone is willing to show and teach you where everything is, so I got familiar with the boat quickly.” She said the challenges of being a submariner exceeded her expectations. “I thought it was hard. I was wrong. It is really, really hard,” Martins said. “There are times when I am too busy, and I ask myself, ‘Why did I do this at all?’ But then I realize that not all people are offered this opportunity. I have to grab it and be the best that I can be.” She recounted some of the challenges of submarine life and the path to earning her “dolphins”. No one gets cut any slack, she learned. Qualifications take time, perseverance, and at times, a thick skin. “I was qualifying for Diving Officer of the Watch. I was going to take the boat to Periscope Depth, and I was so nervous and stressed because, for me, it is probably the most difficult evolution of the watch,” Martins said. “You have to be able to do it in minutes. It took me forever to take it up. The commanding officer was really frustrated. But I practiced more and got better at doing it.” She acknowledged that the path to earning one’s “dolphins”, as difficult as it is, would never be a solo endeavor. Everyone, from the most junior submariner to senior officers, is deeply invested in a new crew member’s success. “In the submarine fleet, we are closer to each other, not only physically, but it is a brotherhood. No matter the rank, if you are doing something wrong that can potentially kill everyone on the ship, you will be corrected,” Martins said. “We rely heavily on each other, especially under the sea, because the possibility of losing all hands in one mistake is highly likely. Trust is huge and very important.” She returns the favor by bringing a bit of her own culture below the depths of the sea aboard the guided-missile submarine and to her fellow submariners. “I cook Filipino dishes underway sometimes,” Martins said. “I am the only Pinoy aboard my submarine, so I show everyone our dishes. We never run out of rice of course! But I miss (the Filipino dish) sinigang. It is my all-time favorite!” At the end of the day, however, she reminds herself of the things, or the people, that motivate her to do her best and push forward. “My family motivates me to be the best I can be, especially my daughter. I want her to be proud of me one day and say to everyone that her mommy is a submariner!” Martins said.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB-7) regional director, said on Thursday that 61 special permits were issued to buses that will ply different routes in Cebu City and 29 for buses in Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, Talisay, and Consolacion. “Based on Section 4 of the Omnibus Guidelines on the Implementation of Community Quarantine, ‘the movement of all persons in areas placed under GCQ shall be limited to accessing essential goods and service,'” he said in a statement. The movement of people for leisure purposes is not allowed and those aged 21 below and 60 above are still required to stay at home, he noted. Montealto said students who account for 40 percent of ridership are not yet going to school. “The increase in the number of vehicles allowed to ply the routes would be in phases, depending on the passenger demand, which will be monitored by LTFRB-7,” he stressed. He said Memorandum Circular 2020-017 provides for the hierarchy of transport service if there is a need for additional PUVs. Topmost in the hierarchy are buses followed by Omnibus Franchising Guidelines (OFG)-compliant public utility jeepneys (PUJs) or modern PUJs, then UV Express. The fourth is traditional PUJs, which have already been consolidated as cooperatives or are fleet-managed and last are the tourist vans. The LTFRB-7 on Tuesday also issued 150 special permits for taxis and Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) such as Grab and Micab. However, the operators might still be conducting training for their drivers since the taxis and TNVS would be using the cashless payment system, Montealto said. According to him, the LTFRB continues to validate applications for special permits and is coordinating with the LGUs to determine if there is a need to add more PUVs to serve a certain route. LTFRB, in coordination with the local government units, has come up with rationalized routes, which were identified due to the presence of businesses offering essential services, he explained. He called on commuters in areas that have not been covered yet by the routes to be patient and understanding since there would still be limited number of PUVs that will be allowed to operate.

Yap pushed for the immediate adoption of the economic agenda he crafted as a way to help the local economy back on its feet now that Central Visayas has been downgraded from enhanced community quarantine to general community quarantine status, allowing businesses to resume operations. Among the agenda is allowing LGUs to borrow from the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) under a zero-interest concession for small businesses and water projects. These projects, Yap said, will assist farmers in increasing food production and enable micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to operate under the new normal. He also pushed for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to allow debtors to restructure their loans without penalties and surcharges. Normally, he said the BSP imposes a penalty on restructured loans because they are considered as \"failed loans\". Yap said he was also able to convince the RDC-7 Full Council to grab the opportunity to position Central Visayas as the next hub for multi-national companies that are leaving China, citing a published article mentioning four firms that decided to transfer its off-shore operations. He said that Assistant Secretary Asteria Caberte, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-Central Visayas regional director, agreed to take the lead in coordinating efforts in luring investors who are leaving China. “Unfortunately in the survey, we are losing to Vietnam. The No. 1 country that is harvesting all the companies that are leaving China right now is Vietnam. Second is the Philippines in terms of preference. No. 3 is Indonesia. No. 4 is Thailand,” Yap said. He said Caberte mentioned during the RDC-7 Full Council video conferencing Monday that his proposal was very timely since locators in the Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) in Lapu-Lapu City are facing problems. Yap said Bohol needs the stimulus plan that will tap resources from LBP and DBP loans to fund projects that will be flushed down and lent to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) “because we need to fund the MSMEs”. “In the meantime, the national agencies must use their funds now to retrain and retool people because if they don’t retrain, retool and readopt people, even if you give them funds, they will not know how to operate,” he said. Under an interest concession, the interest rate is reduced as compared to commercial rates where the government agency would provide the concessions or through a government grant to a lending bank. He said LGUs in the region need a stimulus plan that will churn the local economy in the meantime that Congress is still debating on the PHP1.3 trillion-worth of stimulus packages under the Philippine Economic Stimulus Bill. (PNA) "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1103437","title":"LTFRB: Bookme app unauthorized; TNVS only allowed in GCQ areas","date":" May 20, 2020, 4:24 pm","snippet":"MANILA – The Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday warned the public against using the Bookme Transport Lite mobile app and said that transport network vehicle services (TNVS) are only authorized to operate in areas under general community quarantine (GCQ).","body":"MANILA – The Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday warned the public against using the Bookme Transport Lite mobile app and said that transport network vehicle services (TNVS) are only authorized to operate in areas under general community quarantine (GCQ).

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda filed House Bill 6765, which seeks to establish a fiscal regime for the digital economy. “No new taxes here, we just want them to pay their fair share. Assuming you’re a company that sets up in the Philippines, and you do video-streaming or music-streaming services, you will definitely pay taxes. But companies like Netflix and Spotify don’t. That’s obviously not fair,\" he said. When you’re a network in the Philippines, advertising services paid to you will be subject to VAT [value added tax]. But Google and Facebook are not subject to VAT for advertising. Ang laki po ng kinikita nila sa mga Pilipino, pero ni isang kusing ng VAT, wala,” he added. Salceda said the bill responds to the increased urgency of finding new sources of revenue to fund the country’s efforts to recover from the adverse impacts of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and anticipates the increasing digitization of the country’s economy. He said that this tax administration proposal aims to fairly capture the value created into the tax system, which will lead to five key changes to the way the digital economy is currently taxed. The bill seeks to make “network orchestrators” like Grab, Angkas, and other similar services as withholding agents for income taxes, to ease their partners of the burden of having to pay their own taxes, while also encouraging tax compliance. It shall clarify that services rendered electronically in the course of trade or business are liable to VAT. It would also clarify that digital advertising by internet giants such as Google and Facebook and subscription-based services such as those of Netflix and Spotify are subject to VAT. Network orchestrators for lease services such as Airbnb and electronic commerce platforms such as Lazada and Shopee shall be made withholding agents for VAT. The bill requires those who render digital services to do so through a resident agent or a representative office in the Philippines. This seeks to address the issue of companies having a significant presence in the country without having a physical establishment in the Philippines not being liable for tax and regulatory purposes. Salceda noted that the bill ensures consumer protection, as most of these companies are considered “runaway services”. “Kapag may reklamo ka, paano mo sisingilin, wala namang opisina sa bansa, kaya wala naman kaming pwede panagutin (If you have a complaint, how would you hold them responsible, if there is no physical office in the country? There is no means of accountability),’ he said. Salceda also added that his tax proposal will not affect social media users who do not advertise on these platforms. “If anything, these social media platforms need you, the user, to keep using, so that they could earn from digital advertising, the same way TV networks need viewers so they could get advertising contracts. So, the usual social media channels will definitely remain free,” he said. “The whole idea that somehow, this bill will make social media networks charge users who don’t advertise, that’s a bad reading of the proposal,” he added.

He said Covid-19 has compelled the government and the private sector to strengthen and elevate partnership to adapt to the new norm. “With the challenges posed by this pandemic, it is imperative that we develop new innovations and scale up existing technologies, and we’re happy that many have been forging an alliance with us to help first and foremost our countryside heroes,” Dar said. Meanwhile, the new partners expressed support to the initiative, highlighting their willingness to help the producers and consumers alike. Aside from enabling farmers to be social entrepreneurs, the merchants ensure safe and nutritious food items are made available to the Filipino family. In addition to fresh vegetables and fruits, fish and meat products are now available on the e-Kadiwa market list, as well as organic produce and indigenous products such as adlai rice which is grown in Malaybalay, Bukidnon is a delicious grain that is high in fiber, low glycemic, gluten-free and a healthier alternative to rice and pasta. Dar said as food supply remains to be part of the essential, the DA, along with its partners, will continue to boost market linkage through e-Kadiwa as well as other Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita marketing strategies. Following the success of e-Kadiwa, Dar announced its possible expansion in other urban centers. “We will bring in more companies that hold high regard for social responsibility,” he said. To check out the wide range of products available, simply visit eKadiwa.da.gov.ph. Select a store and choose from the products available, then simply add to cart along with other items or proceed to checkout.

In its Memorandum Circular (MC) 2020-018 released on Friday, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to allow taxis and TNVS with a valid certificate of public convenience (CPC) or provisional authority (PA) to operate starting May 16 in adherence to certain guidelines. For TNVS operators under transport network companies (TNC), such as Grab Philippines, the memo circular stated that bookings and payments must be made “strictly through an online facility or electronic payment only.” The TNVS units must be currently registered with a valid personal passenger insurance policy. For taxi operators with a valid CPC or PA, units must be equipped with an “internet/web-based app provided by an accredited TNC, for purposes of booking and online payment transactions.” “Street-hailed” taxis must have their taxi meters calibrated and were directed to enroll or register with electronic payment providers for the purpose of cashless transactions. Taxis are also required to have a valid personal passenger insurance policy, aside from other requirements under LTFRB MC 2017-026, such as GNSS receivers, a dashboard camera, closed-circuit television, and an online digital platform or application. In a Facebook post, the LTFRB said the memo also includes other conditions for the operation of taxis and TNVS in GCQ areas, such as a daily record of passengers for contact tracing that would be made available at the request of LTFRB and other government agencies. Existing fare rates for taxis and TNVS will apply upon their resumption of operation, it added. Early in May, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases released public health safety protocols for public transportation in GCQ areas. These protocols include wearing face masks and gloves at all times by public utility drivers, “no mask, no ride” for commuters, regular disinfection, and reduction of capacity for taxis and TNVS to two persons per row (including the driver).

The DTI has also conducted the caravan in Maulong, Mercedes, and Poblacion villages on April 23, and in Canlapwas on April 29. It is scheduled to hold another caravan in Guinsorongan village on May 13. “Instead of consumers crowding the city to buy their needs while under strict quarantine measures, our agency together with the local government came up with the ‘diskwento’ caravan barangay (village) edition,” said Araceli Laraga, DTI-Samar director. The activity helps address the challenge in providing consumers easier access to goods in this difficult time, by bringing the manufacturers, distributors, and local producers closer to them, according to Laraga. On the other hand, the caravan also enables small entrepreneurs and food processors from nearby communities to sell their products, knowing their struggles in generating sales in this time of crisis, he added.

Major Jun Napat, Tulunan police chief, said the town’s social workers, escorted by police and soldiers, were to proceed to Barangay Tuburan, an upland community known to be infiltrated by communist rebels, to distribute SAP funds to indigent residents when tipped of the plan of the New People's Army (NPA). “The social workers and their escorts were on board separate police and military vehicles when they were told of an impending ambush by the NPA (rebels) and plot to grab the SAP funds,” Napat said in an interview. A team of 39th Infantry Battalion troopers, part of the reconnaissance patrol, figured in a clash with an undetermined number of rebels at 5:30 a.m. “They were positioned on both sides of the highway ready for an ambush when foot patrol soldiers saw them,” he said, adding that a 30-minute firefight ensued. There was no reported casualty on the government’s side. Citing information from village officials, Napat said one rebel was slain but his body was taken by his companions. He identified the NPA leader who was to lead the ambush and robbery as Eusebio Cranzo of the NPA Guerilla Front 72. Police and soldiers recovered bloodied spent shells for an AK-47 rifle, the rebels’ signature firearm, and also empty shells for an M-203 grenade launcher and an M16 rifle. Local social work officials decided to postpone the distribution of the SAP and were studying the possibility of conducting it in a nearby and safer village. The NPA, together with the Communist Party of the Philippines, is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

The provincial government has partnered with the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the RU Farmers Assistance Center for the establishment of the food facility in time for the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). DA 6 (Western Visayas) Executive Director Remelyn Recoter welcomed the good response of consumers here to the opening of the Negrense-Kadiwa. “We are happy to note that the consuming public in Bacolod City (is) patronizing the products,” Recoter said on Monday. She also commended Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson’s support when he said that the marketing scheme would go beyond the quarantine period. The store is located at the Negros Food Terminal Market along North Capitol Road. From April 1 to 8, except April 5, the store generated PHP612,199.78 from selling lowland and upland vegetables, spices, eggs, meat, and poultry products to both walk-in and home delivery clients. The highest sales of PHP131,835.84 was recorded on April 7. Initially, the Negrense: Kadiwa accommodated walk-in customers on limited hours but eventually implemented a text and pick-up, and delivery only services to limit public exposure.

The people’s movement is now being limited. Only one member of the household is allowed to go out,” he added. Jose Albert Barrogo, chief of the DA-6’s Regional Agricultural Engineering Division, said during this period of the ECQ, they came up with the idea of using food service delivery providers to bring agricultural goods to people’s homes.

He said the time is of the essence, especially with many Filipinos have been sidelined due to the enhanced community quarantine to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) As chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee that oversees the implementation of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, Go said there should be no politics involved in the distribution of aid and that the funds must be allocated fairly and distributed equitably, especially among the poorest of the poor. “Ang mga ahensya tulad ng DSWD dapat mamahala sa pagbibigay ng tulong. Ang mga pulitiko hindi dapat makialam. Huwag niyo po haluan ng pulitika dahil mas humahaba pa ang proseso. Huwag na natin pahirapan pa ang mga tao, pabilisin na natin ang pagbigay ng tulong sa kanila,” Go said. (Government agencies such as the DSWD, should supervise the distribution of relief assistance. Politicians must not interfere. Don't let politics get in the way because the processing becomes longer. Let us not burden our people, let us speed up the distribution of assistance to them.) Go said the priority now is to be able to provide immediate healthcare needs to solve the health problem and defeat the virus and, at the same time, to provide cash and food assistance to those who are affected the most by the crisis. “With the passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the bulk of government spending is now allocated to DOH (Department of Health) for immediate healthcare needs, DSWD for social assistance especially for affected vulnerable sectors, and DOLE for assistance to displaced workers,” Go said. The Senator noted that the law has already given the necessary authority and flexibility to the government to use the funds as deemed necessary to respond and address the growing threats of Covid-19, and the economic impact that comes with it. As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and as a member of the Joint Oversight Committee, Go said he assures that the funds are properly used, prodding those concerned government agencies to provide the needs of those affected by the pandemic. “Alalayan rin natin ang mga displaced at informal economy workers – mga vendors at Public Utility Vehicle drivers, tulad ng mga namamasada ng taxi, tricycle, bus, jeep at iba pa. Pati na rin po ang mga trisikad, pedikab, habal-habal at mga nagtatrabaho sa Transportation Network Vehicle Services o TNVS, katulad ng Grab, Angkas, Joyride. Lalong lalo na po ang mga kababayan natin na ‘isang kahig, isang tuka’ o ‘no work, no pay’ – mga daily wage earners na kinailangang tumigil sa pagtatrabaho para maging ligtas mula sa pagkalat ng sakit na ito,” he said.

Those who worked in the transportation network services or TNVS like Grab, Angkas, Joyride, especially those who are in 'no work, no pay' scheme, the daily wage earners who have to stop working to contain the spread of this disease.) Citing the burden placed on Filipinos as they go through the enhanced quarantine measures, Go said it is the responsibility of the government to secure and sustain their needs as their lives grind to a halt. “Responsibilidad natin na alagaan ang ating mga kababayan na pinilit nating hindi lumabas ng kanilang mga bahay. Nag-impose tayo ng strict measures para maprotektahan ang kalusugan nila pero hindi dapat doon nagtatapos ang responsibilidad natin sa pag-aalaga sa kanila,” he said. (It is our responsibility to take care of our countrymen that we force not to go out of their homes. We impose strict measures to protect their health but our responsibility to them does not stop there.) Meanwhile, the Department of Budget and Management has requested for the release of a budget amounting to PHP2.84 billion for the benefit of displaced workers through DOLE. The funds for DOLE are intended “to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 among affected the private sector employees who have no or insufficient leave credits and are required to undergo community quarantine, among others.” Go said as the country continues to fight to contain the Covid-19 transmission, the government must take care of poor Filipinos who are becoming hungry and restless. Over 85 percent of the requested fund of DBM that will be given to DOLE will be allotted for the Tulong Panghanapbuhay Para sa Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers and Government Internship Program (TUPAD-GIP). TUPAD is a community-based package of assistance in the municipality or barangay level that provides emergency employment for displaced workers, underemployed, and seasonal workers, for a minimum period of ten days but not to exceed 30 days, depending on the nature of the work to be performed. On the other hand, GIP provides opportunities for young workers to serve the general public in government agencies or entities’ projects and programs at the national and local levels. Go said the will also closely monitor the provision of the cash and food aid to low-income Filipino families as part of the Social Amelioration Program, based on the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. “As a member of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee, pursuant to the provisions of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, it is my duty to scrutinize how the Executive spends the funds we allowed to be used to combat Covid-19.

Earth Hour, an annual international movement of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), promotes awareness on energy consumption and its impact on the environment.  More than 180 countries join the WWF in this advocacy.  However, this year’s Earth Hour is different from the past years as the world faces the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic that has pushed some countries to implement a quarantine period and prohibited mass gatherings.  “This year, we are facing Earth Hour in exceptional circumstances with countries around the world experiencing a health crisis with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus,” the Earth Hour organizer stated on its website.  The Earth Hour global organizing team recommended individuals to join the event online for “on-the-night live streams”.  In a phone interview Friday, Energy Utilization Management Bureau Director Patrick Aquino told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) that the country saved 606 megawatts of energy during Earth Hour in 2010, the highest energy savings the Philippines has recorded in its more than a decade of participating in the global event.  However, energy savings during Earth Hour in the past two years declined to 110 MW in 2018 and 195 MW in 2019, Aquino said.  He encouraged local government units to promote the advocacy and urged households and establishments to at least switch off their lights for an hour.  “Our theme for this year is ‘Change the Ending’. The power is in our hands if we want to have a sustainable environment and growth,” Aquino said in Filipino.  He noted that Filipinos could expand their actions in taking care of the environment by “going beyond the Earth Hour” by making energy conservation as part of their lifestyle.  “We want the Filipinos to be efficient and smart in consuming electricity. The lower the consumption, the greater the impact (on) the environment,” Aquino said.  Do it in the dark, but stay at home  There are many activities to try during the Earth Hour despite the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and some parts of the Visayas and Mindanao.  On Earth Hour this Saturday, have a candlelit dinner at home with your loved ones while enjoying a good playlist on your phone.  While the electricity-consuming lights are out, dance the night away.  To try something new, hold a silent disco -- household members should grab their earphones, play their favorite songs, then dance in the dark. They could enable their phones’ flashlight for improvised disco lights.  Experience the “zen life” in candlelight. Practice yoga or meditation during Earth Hour.  Catch up with friends by holding a group video chat. You can also do a virtual prayer and together pray for the world amid the Covid-19 crisis.

Sison is again engaged in ranting nonsense that only highlights his perverted vision of reality as well as his insensitivity to the present grave peril that the Filipino people he professed to fight for face,” Panelo said. Duterte on Wednesday ordered the suspension of military operations from March 19 to April 15 to pave the way for the government’s response to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The government sought to stop the transmission of Covid-19, which has infected 217 people, as of Thursday. Amid the government’s fight against Covid-19, Duterte directed the military and the police to stop offensives against the CPP and its armed and political wings, the New People’s Army (NPA) and the National Democratic Front (NDF). Sison, however, said there is no clear basis yet to reciprocate the unilateral ceasefire declared by Duterte. Panelo said Sison should grab the “golden opportunity” to show his patriotism by extending his hands for peace, for the sake of the Filipino people. “At a time when all Filipinos, regardless of class, religion, or ideology, are united to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 in the country, Mr. Sison, in these times of national health emergency and calamity, would rather have a hostile environment where Filipinos argue with, if not kill, each other,” he said. True colors Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said the communist movement is showing its \"true colors\" over its outright rejection of the government's unilateral ceasefire. \"Their true colors are exposed here. They claim to be compassionate towards the people but even in the time of the coronavirus, where everyone is making sacrifices, they still want to continue the battle against our police officers and soldier.” DILG Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said in Filipino during a briefing on Covid-19 aired over state-run PTV. Malaya said the communist movement's response to the measure is saddening. \"Their actions reflect that they do not care or they do not love the country and our people especially in times of crisis and calamity,\" he added. Malaya said since the national and local governments including the police and military are swamped with challenges due to the Covid-19 crisis, the least that the communists should have done is to not hamper government efforts to serve the people by reciprocating the government’s declaration of the ceasefire. “How do we expect the police and military to do their jobs properly to man the checkpoints, deliver relief goods to indigent families, maintain peace and order, and so on and so forth if they are always looking over their shoulder for that NPA ambush or attack on construction sites to extort revolutionary taxes?” he said. He said the government’s declaration of ceasefire will give the Philippine National Police the opportunity to fully serve the people since Interior Secretary Eduardo Año has also declared a suspension of offensive police operations. “It was never about the people. It was always about them and how they will advance their so-called revolution to bring about a communist state in our country. We are fools for expecting the communists to put the interests of the country before their own narrow ideological ambitions. That’s why there’s no use negotiating with terrorists,” he added. In the event of a communist attack, Malaya said government forces are prepared and will have no resort but to protect themselves. The CPP-NPA-NDF has been branded as a terror organization by the Philippines, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

In a media bulletin, the DOTr said the bus service will comply with containment protocols of the Department of Health (DOH) such as social distancing, body temperature checks, and regular disinfection of vehicles. In response to DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade’s call for solidarity amid the nationwide crisis, Grab Philippines President Brian Cu also committed to providing free transportation for health workers to identified hospitals, with details on the arrangement to be announced soon. For officials and members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), the DOTr will set up an operations center and a motor pool for the mobility of its members during the Luzon-wide quarantine period. \"We are racing against time to contain this deadly virus. So, this initiative will truly help our front liners do their jobs as they are the ones who are strenuously and heroically holding the line to keep our country safe. Let us do this now,\" Tugade said. In a meeting on Tuesday, the IATF-EID ordered the DOTr to develop a point-to-point transport system specifically for health workers. On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte placed the entire Luzon on enhanced community quarantine which means imposing strict home quarantine in all households, suspension of mass transportation, strict regulations of food and health services, and enforcement of quarantine procedures by uniformed personnel.

Mayor Carmelo Lazatin Jr. cited on Saturday the need for everyone’s cooperation and support to contain the spread of the highly contagious disease. Lazatin said he asked the Grab officials to back-trace passengers who may have been exposed. “This is not the time to think of their business,” Lazatin added. He also appealed to passengers who rode the said vehicle to report to the city government for monitoring and assistance. Meanwhile, Grab Philippines, in a statement said, that they will be working closely with the health and local government officials to assist in the necessary contact tracing to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have a team on standby to immediately respond to and support DOH’s [Department of Health] contact tracing efforts and identify the close contacts of the infected individual,” it said.

However, given the urgency of the situation, the Grab said they “carefully decided to provide the needed information to Mayor Lazatin and the local government, so they can initiate the contact tracing.” Meanwhile, Grab said their driver-partner will receive medical and financial support from the company and will disinfect the vehicle.

In a statement on Thursday, a Grab spokesperson said the company’s Safety and Anti-fraud teams regularly monitor and suspend accounts with fake, incomplete and unverified names. As part of such measures, he said the company previously sent out a warning to such users and gave them until February 22 to correctly update their information. “Those who have failed to correctly update their profile have been suspended from the platform. Last 2019, we have already suspended more than 351,000 fake, incomplete, and invalid accounts from the platform,” the statement read. Most recently, he said Grab has suspended a total of 856 accounts as of February of this year due to the same violations. “The anti-fraud team has been continuously identifying multiple accounts that were created and being used by the same user. These initiatives have deterred users who use the platform with ill, fraudulent, and malicious intent,” the statement read. He said aside from violations in relation to fraudulent names, the company also flag users who frequently cancel rides and do not show up to claim food orders for possible account suspension. “This behavior is resulting in loss of opportunities and resources for our driver and delivery-partners,” the statement read. He said users who regularly provide low-ratings to drivers and delivery partners without a reason can also be flagged for possible account suspension. “Low-ratings provided to drivers- and delivery-partners can be disputed by especially if these low-ratings do not include specifics and actionable insights,” the statement said.

What they lack is the sure market. The hospitals, jails, and schools in the region are guaranteed markets where they can sell their products at better prices.\"Villareal added that the ARBOs involved have already undergone capability-building and productivity improvement training with the support of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Technical Education Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in the area.Credit support will also be provided to the ARBOs to increase capitalization through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), he said. In his message, Nograles pointed out that EPAHP’s ultimate goal is to help the farmers by linking their cooperatives and organizations to established markets.“For years, the cycle of poverty has been affecting our farmers. Their farm products usually fall into the hands of middlemen and traders. Eventually, these middlemen and traders enrich themselves from the farm products of our farmers,” Nograles said.\"Now is the time to eradicate these practices and bring their products directly to the market or to buyers such as the hospitals, jails and through the feeding programs of the DepEd and the DSWD,\" he added.For this year, seven ARBOs from Agusan del Sur will link their products to the partner agencies that signed the MOU, two ARBOs in Agusan del Norte, and two each in Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur.

Retired Col. Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of LTFRB-7, said that Maxim, a ride-sharing app that originated from Shadrinsk, Russia is actively operating in Cebu despite absence of accreditation from their office. “On Feb. 7, a joint operation with LTFRB-7 and Highway Patrol Group-7 apprehended a transport network vehicle service (TNVS) using the so-called Maxim ride-hailing app. The units that we apprehended are a Kia Picanto and a Mitsubishi Strada pickup type truck,” Montealto said. Maxim has not sought accreditation with the LTFRB to operate legally as a ride-hailing app for booking of trips by customers via mobile phones or tablets, he said. Montealto admitted there are so many unaccredited TNVS operating in Cebu and using apps that are not registered with the agency. Last month, LTFRB-7 operatives apprehended six cars for illegally operating as TNVS using inDriver, another unaccredited ride-hailing app. Both inDriver and Maxim are not among the list of LTFRB-recognized apps such as Grab Car, MiCab, Hype and Hirna. InDriver was founded in 2012 but Maxim started as a modern taxi-ride ordering service in Russia in 2003 and simultaneously opened branches in seven cities worldwide in 2009. It expanded to 17 more cities in 2010. Montealto lamented that Filipino counterparts of Maxim and inDriver operators abroad could clandestinely operate in Cebu without fear being detected by authorities. According to initial investigation by the LTFRB-7, Maxim has revealed in its Facebook account the address of its office along J. De Veyra Street in North Reclamation Area here. Montealto, however, said operations personnel will continue to monitor their movements and conduct apprehensions against TNVS operators using Maxim and inDriver based on intelligence reports that they can gather. TNVS operating via unaccredited ride-hailing app are not paying taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, he said. He said the two vehicles apprehended on Friday in a mall in Mandaue City were placed in the impounding area pending payment of penalty ranging from PHP120,000 to PHP200,000 for engaging in colorum operations, aside from being blacklisted for 90 days. LTFRB record showed Cebu has reached the cap of 1,500 TNVS while the request for additional units has not yet been approved by the board.

The passenger selfie verification, it said, was also being rolled out in other countries, especially in the Southeast Asian market, while audio and video recording were also being tested in select locations. Grab also said its new safety features, meant “solely for purposes of maintaining the safety and security of platform users, and to assist law enforcement on investigations,” follow existing rules on lawful processing of data. However, the NPC, in its recent statement, said Grab has failed to sufficiently identify and assess the risks posed by its new safety measures to the rights and freedoms of its passengers. “Only the risks faced by the company were taken into account,” the NPC said in its privacy impact assessment of Grab’s new measures. Among other issues mentioned by the NPC were Grab’s failure to inform its passengers that the photo, audio, and video files collected by the new systems would be released to police authorities upon request in the event of a dispute, conflict, or complaint, and failing to mention its legal basis in processing collected data. It added that while there was an option for Grab passengers to withdraw consent for in-vehicle audio and video recording, the details on how to do so were “not sufficiently communicated to passengers.” “It was also unclear if and how the data processing will be affected upon such withdrawal of consent,” the NPC said. In the first half of January, Grab began a pilot run of in-vehicle audio and video recording in 180 of its GrabCar vehicles as a safety measure for both its drivers and passengers.

Stella Quimbo on Wednesday said Grab would continue to monopolize the ride-hailing market if transport authorities do not allow the entry of motorcycle taxi operators. In a statement, Grab said Quimbo’s statement revealed that on-demand and platform-based motorcycle taxis were “effectively competing” with Grab, as withdrawing motorcycle taxis would limit consumer choices on transportation. “It is in the same spirit that we respectfully seek the PCC to review the basis for defining the competitive market in which ride-hailing services operate,” Grab said in a statement. It said the ride-hailing competitive market could also be broadened to include street-hailing transportation such as taxis. “Right now, what we hope for is to review the basis for defining the competitive market and that would include motorcycle taxis and taxis as well,” Grab said. It said the voluntary commitments (VC) made by Grab with the PCC to improve service quality, pricing and transparency following its acquisition of then competitor Uber, were “totally different” from their call to review the definition of the ride-hailing market. “We cannot right away apply for release from VCs because there are certain market share thresholds that will have to be met per player before we can apply for release. That’s why we need the PCC to clarify the definition of competitive market,” Grab said. Earlier, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said Grab could be released from its VCs if the company proves that its services were substitutable with motorcycle taxis and that the substitute or competitor has acquired a certain percentage or threshold in the market. He added that once motorcycle taxis were established as a public utility vehicle, Grab would then have to prove whether four-wheeled vehicles such as Grab’s would be substitutable with two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycle taxis.

Rosario here, bringing recycled plastic bottles and containers, which were refilled with condiments and household products. “Refill Revolution” is an advocacy campaign of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB) in Central Luzon that is aimed at beating plastic pollution by reducing its production and necessity. During the activity organized by the City Environment and Natural Resources (CENRO), the locals were able to refill kitchen condiments, laundry products, and other household items by bringing clean and reusable bottles, containers and “eco bags”. These items were sold at prices that were 50-70 percent lower than the actual retail prices in supermarkets. CENRO officer Regina Rodriguez said they want to teach residents to avoid single-use plastics and instead promote eco-friendly and sustainable ways of utilizing plastic products. \"We are encouraging every household to avoid regular purchase of products in plastic sachets or containers. If possible, re-use plastic containers and grab every opportunity of refilling activities,” she said, adding that another Refill Revolution is set on February 21 as part of the \"Kaganapan\" cityhood celebration. Manufacturers and retailers like Nutri Asia Inc., Classic Brand Distributorship, and Glochem Marketing & Recycling Corp. took part in the refilling activity. Nutri Asia, which is among the country’s top condiments maker, was one of the stakeholders that rallied behind the initiative. Pepsi Cola, Water District Prime Water, and Soliman E.C. were also present to give away freebies to the residents. City Mayor Edwin David Santiago reiterated his desire for San Fernando to remain a “Zero-Waste City” in the midst of progress and development. “We are the first-ever model of Zero Waste City in the whole country. Let us prove it by remaining educated and disciplined enough to protect and preserve our environment,” Santiago said.

Marikina City Rep. Stella Quimbo said the initial move of the TWG to terminate the motorcycle taxis’ pilot run would create barriers that prevent transport alternatives to enter in the market. “At this point, the reason why Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It can operate is precisely because they are the subjects of the pilot study. Hence, LTFRB’s (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) move to withdraw the study is tantamount to putting up what competition authorities call a “barrier to entry,” Quimbo said. “Specifically, LTFRB would put up a barrier to entry in the market for on-demand and platform-based private transport, which includes Grab. Because Angkas and other operators potentially compete against Grab, this barrier to entry would provide the latter an undue advantage,” she added. She said while consumer safety is “paramount”, such objectives must also be balanced with competition principles. “The purpose of the pilot study is to determine the appropriate regulatory intervention to ensure passenger safety. In the process, it should not kill jobs, narrow consumer choice, or eradicate market options that have the potential to effectively compete with transportation options such as Grab.” Quimbo said. “Kung ang tunay na kakampi ng LTFRB ay ang riding public, tatapusin nila ang pag-aaral na may layunin na maghanap ng agarang solusyon sa problema ng kakulangan at nagmamahal na public transportation (If LTFRB is indeed an ally of the riding public, it would complete the pilot study with the end goal of finding a prompt solution to the challenges faced by the Philippine public transportation system),” she added. DOTr Assistant Secretary Goddes Hope Libiran said although the TWG has earlier recommended terminating the pilot study due to legal impediments caused by one of the players in the motorcycle taxi space, Tugade said he would reconsider the extension if all players agree on the rider caps and location guidelines set by the DOTr. In December, the TWG extended the pilot study on motorcycle taxis and released a revised guideline which included a 30,000-rider cap for Metro Manila and 9,000 for Metro Cebu and the inclusion of two other approved service providers.

Eduardo Montealto Jr., regional director of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in Region 7 (Central Visayas), said on Wednesday that although inDriver maintains a \"virtual office\" with no physical office in Cebu, it has been actively operating through social media. This, Montealto said, was despite the warning he issued on Monday against private car owners and taxi operators not to use the app as it has not been accredited with the LTFRB as transport network vehicle service (TNVS). “We have conducted intelligence gathering for one month after we received the report that inDriver is engaging the public using Facebook. It’s impossible for them to operate legally as there is an existing moratorium from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) on the accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies),” Montealto said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency. He said only Grab Car, MiCab, Hype, and Hirna are the legitimate ride-hailing apps in Cebu. There are three more TNVS that have a pending application for accreditation with the LTFRB-7, but Montealto said that due to DOTr’s moratorium, their operations remain pending. He said inDriver, a Russia-based ride-hailing app, is not among the applicants to operate as TNVS. He said despite the moratorium, inDriver continues to entice Cebuanos to use their private cars to earn income. “It’s easy to use inDriver. All that a car owner can do is to register with the app and submit their documentary requirements through electronic transmission. It means that there is no human contact as what they have here is just a virtual office,” he added. Montealto said inDriver has not been collecting a commission from the car owners, unlike the legitimate ride-hailing apps which have an established sharing-scheme. He reiterated that private cars apprehended for colorum operation will be slapped with PHP120,000 penalty for sedan models and PHP200,000 for van and sports utility vehicles (SUV), aside from the mandatory 90-day impounding of the unit. Impounded cars, he said, can be released earlier than 90 days but not earlier than 30 days, through a motion addressed to his office. “We are quite sure that InDriver operators and drivers have not undergone the mandatory defensive driver training and the driver’s academy training of the LTFRB. They don’t also have passenger insurance,” Montealto added. He also said that inDriver is not a safe transport system as it does not have the gadget to detect a vehicle's location. “They can unscrupulously use it to kidnap anyone because you cannot trace them,” he said.

Retired Col. Edgardo Montealto Jr., regional director of LTFRB-7, said his office apprehended in three separate operations last week four private vehicles for ferrying passengers using the app “inDriver.” InDriver is not among the ride-hailing apps that include Grab Car, MiCab, Hype, and Hirna recognized by the LTFRB as legitimate and licensed to engage in transportation network vehicle service (TNVS) operation in the country, he said. The four vehicles apprehended in separate operations last week were impounded pending payment of penalty ranging from PHP120,000 to PHP200,000 for engaging in colorum operations, aside from being blacklisted for 90 days, he said. Although unaccredited with the LTFRB central office, inDriver emerged in Cebu two weeks ago and enticed taxi operators and private car owners to use the app for passenger booking. Montealto said inDriver has no accreditation to operate as TNVS in the country, not even in Cebu. Accordingly, inDriver was founded in Russia in 2012 and operates in 31 countries around the world but it has neither an office nor an operational base in Manila and in any part of the country. The regional director of LTFRB-7 said he could not ascertain who are behind the operations of inDriver in Cebu as they could not locate its office here. “One of the owners who came to the LTFRB-7 regional office confided that private car owners like him and the taxi operators were enticed to go into TNVS because a public official himself posted in his Facebook account patronizing inDriver ride-hailing app as a sideline income using his own car,” Montealto said in a message sent to the Philippine News Agency on Sunday. He said taxi operators and private car owners planning to engage in app-based passenger booking service should choose accredited TNVS. “They may inquire at our regional office to know which are the legitimate Transport Network Companies (TNCs) accredited by LTFRB and the list of the requirements,” he said. To avoid inconvenience, he urged passengers to use any of the apps accredited with the board in booking their trips, adding that colorum vehicles have no insurance and their operators are not paying the required taxes. LTFRB record showed Cebu has reached the cap of 1,500 TNVS while the request for additional units has not yet been approved by the board.

Jack Arroyo, welfare officer of OWWA 6, said on Thursday there were OFWs before who refused the repatriation amidst being situated in conflict areas. “Of the number of conflict that arose in Middle East, especially in Syria and Libya, we face the same problem that they (OFWs) refuse (to go home) because it will be a decision that will stop them from working and will earn nothing,” Arroyo said in an interview. OWWA record shows that there were 25 Ilonggos in Iran and five others in Iraq. Arroyo said all of them will be persuaded to put their safety first. The OWWA will also keep a close coordination with those who will refuse the repatriation. “We will still communicate with them so when the time comes that they want to go home, we will find a way to make it happen,” he said. OFWs to be repatriated need to have a visa (meaning they legally entered the country). In case the employer contests, a team sent by President Rodrigo Duterte will be the ones to negotiate. The Department of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, will be responsible for the repatriation process. “Whatever process they would take, as long as the OFW can go home, then it would be beneficial for us,” he said. On January 7, Arroyo bared three families with members working as truck drivers in Iraq approached OWWA for help.

This, after the company apologized on Wednesday for its alleged bullying tactics and defiance of government guidelines and after the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court issued a 72-hour temporary restraining order against the limit on the number of riders in Metro Manila to 30,000 (10,000 each for Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It) and 9,000 (3,000 each) in Metro Cebu. In a petition dated January 6 filed before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 223, Angkas asked for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the new rider cap, apprehension of “excess riders”, and to exclude its two competitors in the pilot program. In a statement, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Assistant Secretary for Communications Goddes Hope Libiran noted that Angkas was “telling a lie” when it said it was open to competition and would no longer object to guidelines imposed in the program by the TWG. “Dito natin makikita na doble-kara ang Angkas.

They promised to follow the guidelines and have a dialogue with the government. Now, they went to court to challenge the government),” Libiran said. She said the attempt to exclude its two competitors from the program showed Angkas was “not ready to release its monopolistic hold on the motorcycle ride-hailing service sector.” \"Gusto nila, sila lang. Hindi ba pagkontra din ito sa dati nilang statement na wala silang problema sa kompetisyon? Ano yon, kasinungalingan lang? (They want a monopoly.

The DOTr said Angkas previously assured that it would no longer object to Section 10 or the imposition of a cap on riders of the revised guidelines of the pilot run of the TWG and was open to competition from other transport groups. Royeca’s apology came after TWG officials issued a warning against Angkas after the company was found to have made violations that could result in it being \"blacklisted\" when the TWG submits its findings and recommendations to Congress for the legalization of motorcycles as taxis.

In a radio interview, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Party-list Rep.

Nograles noted that the LTFRB can impose a PHP6,000-fine per motorcycle per day against Angkas for operating without any franchise. He also cited documents showing that Angkas is 98 percent foreign-owned, which could be another basis to shut down its operation as it violates a constitutional provision requiring that all public utility companies should be 60 percent Filipino-owned. “Ang legal status ng motorcyle-for-hire ay wala pa talaga silang totoong prangkisa at sila ay naka-test mode.

Napakaliit! Hindi tayo naniniwala na sa isang ride, wala pang piso ang maire-refund sayo. Buti sana kung sa drivers ito lahat napupunta eh (This refund is unjust. It’s too small.

He said Grab must honor its commitment to meet the price cap, as he echoed the woes of Filipinos for its unreasonable pricing. “Sabi nila kung hindi mo kaya magbayad, huwag ka na lang mag-book ng Grab.

So he should take that opportunity. Take that opportunity,\" he added. On Monday, Duterte reiterated his desire to talk with Sison sans the presence of peace panel from both the national government and the CPP's political wing, the National Democratic Front (NDF). Duterte's latest stance came even after the CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), violated the holiday truce with the government following its series of attacks against the government troops. The holiday ceasefire, which took effect on Dec. 23, 2019, will end at 11:59 p.m. on Jan. 7, 2020. NPA rebels reportedly attacked soldiers and policemen in Labo, Camarines Norte; Tubungan, Iloilo; and Quezon province on the first day of the implementation of the temporary ceasefire. The communist-initiated attacks also came despite the plan to revive the peace talks. Before the proposed resumption of peace negotiations, Sison should heed the President's call for a one-on-one meeting, Panelo said. Panelo reassured Sison, who is facing arrest in the Philippines for his supposed involvement in the so-called \"Inopacan massacre\" in 1980, would not be apprehended upon his return to the country. \"Well, the President, as we have said before, wants Joma Sison to come and to have a one-on-one talk with him.

Sison earlier said he was amenable to the proposed meeting with Duterte, on condition that the dialogue will be held in a neutral country \"near the Philippines\". Panelo, however, maintained that Sison cannot make any demands. Duterte, who initially had warm relations with the communists, was forced to sign Proclamation 360 on Nov. 23, 2017, which formally shelved the talks between state peace negotiators and NDF consultants, following the NPA's continued attacks against the government forces and civilians. The President also signed on Dec. 5, 2017 Proclamation 374, which brands the CPP-NPA as a terror organization. Panelo could not say whether there is a possibility for Duterte to lift the two proclamations to pave the way for the possible resumption of talks, considering that the communist movement had shown insincerity. \"They want to sit on the table and talk peace and yet, they're assaulting our forces. From the very beginning, iyan ang ayaw ng Presidente (that's what the President doesn't like), they're showing insincerity,\" he said. The CPP-NPA has also been listed as a terror group by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

Royina Marzan-Garma, PCSO general manager, said that aside from finding ways for their existing games, primarily the lotto and the Small Town Lottery (STL) games to produce more revenues, the agency has to introduce new ones to raise more funds for charity. \"Our gaming (Gaming, Product Development and Marketing Sector department) has to introduce new games and find ways for our existing games to produce more revenues,\" Garma told reporters in a recent press briefing. She said the games would raise more revenues for charity as most of its funds go to finance the Duterte administration's flagship social services program, primarily the universal health care (UHC) and the establishment of Malasakit Centers all over the country. She added that their focus next year would be on sales and marketing in order to generate funds to support more government projects. Crucial to the plan is the opening of more provincial branches throughout the country next year. For this purpose, she said they have already started hiring employees for the planned expansion. Garma said they are currently reviewing the fees and the processes in franchise applications to streamline their system. Arnel Casas, PCSO assistant general manager for gaming, product development and marketing sector department, said that the PCSO was counting on the private sector to help them come up with new games. Casas said the PCSO welcomes new game proposals, and have even streamlined the process for private gaming firms to submit proposals. Casas said the primary consideration for the approval of new games was that these should not take away business or grab share from the existing games of the PCSO such as the Lotto games, the STL, the Peryahan ng Bayan, the Keno Lotto, and the Scratch-It sweepstakes games. Garma said the PCSO would continue its charity programs such as their Individual Medical Assistance Program (IMAP) where they issue financial assistance for medical care to needy individuals, their Institutional Partnership Program (IPP) where they provide financial support to charity organizations like orphanages such as the Hospicio de San Jose or homes for the elderly, and even their program where they provide medical transport vehicles or ambulances to geographically isolated or disadvantaged municipalities all over the country. Garma urged the public to patronize the products of PCSO as a large chunk of its revenues goes to charity programs.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the LTFRB said it has called the attention of TNCs, such as Grab Philippines and Angkas regarding the matter. “According to commuters, some ride-hailing applications have started to charge higher fares since the Christmas season began, particularly this month,” the post read. “The LTFRB, in cooperation with accredited TNCs, are looking to settle this matter within the week,” it added. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the issues will be dealt with by the LTFRB. “The agency is at the forefront of ensuring public transportation remains safe, convenient, and also affordable. We will look into this,” Delgra said. The LTFRB said these ride-hailing applications have a standard rate of PHP40 as base fare, in addition to a PHP10-15 per kilometer and PHP2 per-minute charges. During rush hour or heavy traffic, the LTFRB said TNCs are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per-minute charges through surge-pricing. Arvin Lopez, a public relations officer of Grab Philippines, said they have yet to receive an official invitation from the LTFRB but has guaranteed the company's presence should the meeting occur. “We have yet to receive the official invitation from the LTFRB on this subject, but we will definitely comply and attend to this discussion,” Lopez said in a message to reporters. In November, the LTFRB announced a review of the fare setting of Grab Philippines following a recent fine imposed on the company for overcharging. Imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the LTFRB said the fine was due to Grab’s failure to follow through with a voluntary commitment it made with the antitrust body and had nothing to do with the policies set by the agency.

Last month, Bacolod was among the 57 cities which received the DILG Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) Award for 2019. In this year’s EXCELL Awards, Bacolod, aside from being recognized as the “Best Performing City”, also received special awards in five areas of governance. These include champion for Excellence in Local Legislation, Administrative Governance, and Environmental Governance, and first runner-up for Excellence in Social Governance and Economic Governance. For Local Legislation, the city was cited for the ordinance authored by Councilor Dindo Ramos which grants the authority to all city traffic officers and enforcers to confiscate driver’s licenses of erring drivers upon the issuance of city citation tickets and providing penalty for the refusal to comply. The “Enhancement of Electronic Business Integrated System (eBis)” used by the Business Permits and Licensing Division and Management Information Technology Computer Services was Bacolod’s entry for Administrative Governance.

There will be a PHP15 additional charge per kilometer for sedans, PHP18 for SUVs, and PHP13 for hatchbacks—aside from PHP2 charge per minute of travel. TNVS companies are also allowed to double their per kilometer and per minute charge through surge pricing. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab contested claims of overcharging against the company and the call for additional fines from Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Party-list) Rep. Jericho Nograles. Grab clarified that its fares were within the fare matrix of the LTFRB and the acceptance of the fine imposed by the PCC was made “in the interest of showing good faith.” “We will comply with the PCC although clearly we could have filed a motion for reconsideration or appealed to a higher authority, which we did not since we want to focus on our business instead,\" said Brian Cu, Grab Philippines president.

Grab’s voluntary pricing commitments covered August 2018 to May 2019. PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said both fines for the first and second quarters of the first undertaking totaling to PHP18.4 million will be paid to the PCC, and remitted to the national treasury. However, the third-quarter fine of PHP5.05 million and ensuing quarterly fines will be refunded to Grab customers through GrabPay within 30 days of Grab’s receipt of a notice of breach from the PCC, he said. The refund order was made through an amendment to Grab’s first commitment with the PCC and will be effective throughout the rest of the company’s price-related commitments which are set to end on Nov. 1, 2020, he added. “In the third quarter, in the fourth quarter and the extended period, that will be subject to refund,” Bernabe said. The fines, he said, were imposed after Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from its prices before its buyout of rival Uber. The allowable deviation or increase in prices was set to 22 percent from levels before Grab’s virtual monopoly of the ride-sharing market, which meant Grab constantly exceeded its allowable price-hike since the buyout, and was fined based on how much it breached its agreement with the PCC. During the event, Balisacan also announced a new set of voluntary commitments by Grab which were broadly categorized into non-exclusivity, service quality, and price-related commitments. The non-exclusivity commitments, Balisacan said, have implications on new competitors to the ride-sharing market and will be effective for four years from Nov. 1, 2019. These include commitments to prevent exclusive membership or registration of drivers or operators to Grab, monitoring of incentives to drivers/operators, and provision of licensing and regulatory support. Grab’s service quality commitments, meanwhile, will be effective for one year from Nov. 1, 2019 and would help ensure that Grab drivers would not discriminate against passengers through the removal of the “see destination” feature for drivers with a completion rate below 65 percent for the first quarter and 70 percent for the remaining quarters. For price-related commitments, which would also be effective for one year, Balisacan further said these include a fare transparency commitment and a system-wide average fare cap to limit the average fare increase to 22.5 percent in most months. He added each violation will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach, not including a disgorgement mechanism wherein Grab will refund its commissions in excess of the system-wide average fare cap per month. “We hope that with the commitments set out in the extended undertaking, the riding public will be protected from the threat of monopolistic behavior,” Balisacan said.

Citing the results of the September 2019 Global Web Index Report, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Benjamin Diokno said more than 69 percent of Filipinos aged 16 to 64 years old are internet users, and 62 percent of them made online purchases through mobile phones. “The digital life is upon us, and we can harness this to make sure internet access and mobile phone ownership do not only lead to better social connections and convenient shopping but also and more importantly, to greater ability for all Filipinos to use welfare-enhancing financial services,” Diokno said in his speech during the financial inclusion forum for the labor sector held at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) office in Manila on Monday. The central bank chief thus cited the need to ensure that all Filipinos will have access to transaction accounts that will enable them not only to save but also to make digital payments. “Our vision is to have more market vendors, jeepney, and tricycle drivers accepting digital payments through QR (Quick Response) code linked to transaction accounts,” he said. Among the transactions that use digital mode of payment include those of Airbnb, Grab, Lalamove, as well as those that use PayMaya and GCAsh, among others. Diokno said the use of QR codes is safer than bringing cash since people are less vulnerable to theft and counterfeit money. Employers also benefit from the use of QR codes since they can use this to pay their employees through the use of the PESONet, which is one of the two real-time electronic payment systems under the National Retail Payment System (NRPS). Diokno said the increase in the number of digital payments will result in a “rich digital footprints that can be used by banks, fintechs, and other lenders in evaluating and granting credit”. “This means people can have better and wider financing options,” he said. Citing official data, Diokno said there are about 25.5 million workers in the country and this is “a massive client base that is hard to ignore for both financial service providers and policymakers in our pursuit of our financial inclusion agenda.” “We are living in a most remarkable time as we see our country enjoying continued strong economic growth with digitalization becoming a critical enabler of economic and financial inclusion. I hope that together, we can seize these opportunities and enable all Filipinos to reap the benefits of our economic growth and achieve prosperity for all,” he added. BSP Financial Technology Sub-sector Managing Director Vicente De Villa III, in an interview by journalists after the event, said they plan to standardize the QR code for all institutions so that this system can be used by all sectors and not just a certain entity. “Right now, each entity has its own QR. If it's not standardized, you can only communicate with a QR that's, like you, internal to one ecosystem. If it's standardized, all those with QR can communicate with one another,” he said. “With the QR, all you have to do is scan the QR. Potential errors in the input of the account will be removed,” he added. De Villa added they are undertaking a plan to increase more government agencies in the PESONet since only the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is currently included in the system. “The target is that all those government entities that have accounts with the same government bank will be included in the e-government,” he said, citing the Land Transportation Office (LTO), the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), and those with frontline licensing and frontline payments requirements as among the agencies that will be part of the system. To date, the only bank that caters to the BIR e-payment transactions under PESONet is RCBC. De Villa said financial institutions that want to be part of NRPS need to have an electronic banking license on top of their usual banking license because “there are other prudential aspects to being able to transact digitally”. “So those that have generally passed our scrutiny can apply for PESONet and InstaPay. It's a business decision on their end,” he said. De Villa said applying for an electronic banking license is a business strategy, adding “it will not make sense to apply for an electronic banking license if you do not expand and further ride on the innovation bandwagon”. He, however, said that if a bank does not apply for this license, it will be left behind. De Villa said they are currently reviewing the digital-only bank regulations but declined to elaborate adding it is “maybe too early at this point” to disclose anything. “But it is something we're definitely exploring because at this day and age, digital banking...innovations are moving forward,” he said. He added the BSP and the Philippine Payments Management, Inc. (PPMI) are considering suggestions to increase InstaPay transaction, which currently is up to PHP50,000 per transaction. Most banks had set the maximum aggregate amount for InstaPay at PhP 50,000 per day per account only.

In a statement, Grab highlighted the modernization efforts of Valenzuela City through its 3S Plus Online Services which include the Paspas Permit that would enable business permit applicants to receive their provisionary permits in seconds following confirmation of payment through an online portal. During the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the two parties on Tuesday, Mayor Rexlon “Rex” Gatchalian said the Paspas Permit project will officially launch on November 12, coinciding with the city's founding anniversary. Grab president Brian Cu said Valenzuela City’s embrace of technology and innovation makes it an “equitable and reliable partner to help build Metro Manila’s first smart city.” “Valenzuela is one of the LGUs (local government units) in the country that we deeply admire as they are embracing and adopting technology to provide their constituents efficient and meaningful public service,” Cu said. Once a provisionary permit is received by the applicant, Grab enters the transaction through their on-demand courier service Grab Express which would deliver the actual business plates right at the applicant’s doorsteps. “This is where Grab comes in. As we all know, Grab has made on-demand delivery of parcels faster, and this partnership is a great compliment to our 3S Plus Online Services,” Gatchalian said. The process effectively eliminates the need for a business permit applicant to visit and line up at the city hall, Grab said. Grab also announced the collaboration with the city government in building a “hyper-localized mapping system of Valenzuela City” which would enable accurate and efficient bookings of services offered by Grab in its mobile app. The ride-sharing company added that Grab and the city government will also share relevant data on the updated base map or satellite imagery of Valenzuela City in compliance with Philippine data privacy laws.

Duterte has put into writing his offer to Vice President Leni Robredo to help his administration’s aggressive crackdown against the illegal drug trade.","body":"MANILA -- President Rodrigo R. Duterte has put into writing his offer to Vice President Leni Robredo to help his administration’s aggressive crackdown against the illegal drug trade. In a memorandum dated October 31 and released on Tuesday, Duterte designated Robredo as co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) until the end of his term on June 30, 2022. The designation of Robredo was made following demands by critics and detractors that enforcement power should be given to Robredo “through an official correspondence, and not just through a verbal or electronic communication.” In an interview over CNN, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Robredo could start attending the scheduled Cabinet meeting this week if she accepts the position. Panelo said as ICAD co-chair, Robredo will have authority over all drug enforcement agencies and offices, such as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB). “The President has directed these instrumentalities to render full assistance and cooperation to her through this official document,” he said. Panelo, meanwhile, expressed hope that critics and detractors would finally see the President’s sincerity in making the offer to the Vice President. He denied their claims that the President’s offer was a ruse manufactured by the administration to discredit Robredo. Panelo noted that the President’s ultimate motivation is the hope that the government be successful in combating the drug menace. “Ang tagumpay niya, tanggumpay ng taong-bayan, tagumpay nating lahat (Her success is the success of the whole nation, the success of all of us). That’s why we wish her well,” he said. \"Gawin na niya ang gusto niyang gawin (She is free to do whatever she wants),\" he added. Too much However, Panelo said it was “too much” for the opposition to ask Robredo to select the next PNP chief. “Masyado silang maraming hinihingi (They have so many demands). You’re given an inch, you try to grab a mile. Kalokohan ‘yun (That’s nonsense),” he said in an interview with reporters. He said that if the Vice President declines the offer, it would mean that her claim of a failed drug war is untrue. In a text message to reporters, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said as ICAD co-chair, Robredo will have a “pro-active” role in the government’s war against illegal drugs. “She will have a hand in crafting the policies and programs of the government and at the same time, ensure the proper implementation of anti-illegal drug operations and advocacy initiatives,” Medialdea said. 100% supportive PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino welcomed Robredo’s designation as ICAD co-chair, pledging his 100-percent support. He also expressed confidence that she would contribute to the advocacy, particularly in rehabilitation. Aquino acknowledged that the rehabilitation cluster of the drug war has not been “properly managed” and that there could be “a better approach.” “That’s what the PDEA wants, a whole nation approach. Holistically, all government agencies collaborate and participate for the solution of the problem and that's why I was telling a while ago that the VP would well contribute (to) the advocacy program. She is a good leader on this matter, particularly in rehabilitation matter,” Aquino said in an interview over ANC. He said that instead of calling the drug war as a failure, Robredo can help the campaign, noting the importance of everyone “working together.” “There's a lot of criticisms that have been made. I just hope that we'll work together and in fact, it's nice for the VP to accept that kind of designation and hopefully, we can move on and help the government in the war on drugs,” Aquino said. PNP spokesperson, Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, meanwhile, said the PNP would comply with and abide by Duterte’s orders. “The PNP will extend its utmost courtesy, cooperation and full assistance to the Vice President,” Banac said. Last October 28, Duterte offered to give Robredo six months to take over the crackdown on illegal drugs after the latter described the drug war as a failure. Panelo said accepting the role as drug czar could give Robredo a chance to “show her mettle” and prove that she could do better in addressing the drug problem. However, Robredo questioned the seriousness of the President’s offer, saying that giving her law enforcement powers is an admission of a failed drug war. In 2017, Duterte signed Executive Order 15, creating the ICAD to suppress the drug problem in the country, and ensure the effective conduct of anti-illegal drug operations and arrest of high-value drug personalities down to the street-level peddlers and users. The ICAD is chaired by the PDEA chief and has representatives from the following agencies as members: DDB; PNP; departments of interior and local government, justice, health, education, social welfare, trade, agriculture, and national defense; Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, Philippine Information Agency, Public Attorney’s Office, Office of the Solicitor General, Philippine Coast Guard, National Bureau of Investigation, bureaus of customs and immigration, Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the Anti-Money Laundering Council.

That was in 2017, when his parents did not like his idea that it took him six months to convince them to invest. In January 2018, the Pandalivery app was born, which he outsourced. Buelva described Pandalivery as a \"minimized Lazada, but for the locals.\" \"It's a localized platform, not just for the (app) users. It really helps the province, online store owners,\" he said. One could purchase various items using the Pandalivery app -- from over-the-counter medicines, clothes from \"ukay-ukay\", to groceries and food. Pandalivery enables small businesses to have an app to expand their market and sell their products, he explained. At present, Pandalivery operates in the cities of Naga and Legazpi, but Buelva targets to roll this out soon in Daet, Camarines Sur. \"We would like to uplift the provinces using our services,\" he said. The third year IT student from Ateneo de Naga has 90 partners selling via the Pandalivery app. From being on his own and using his brother's motorcycle, he now has 15 driver-partners and 10 dispatchers. He gets an average of 120 orders per day, too. Buelva said partner-drivers earn from commissions. \"Some of them earn an average of PHP800, which is higher than our PHP300 local minimum wage,\" he said. One could order via the Pandalivery from 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., for a minimum delivery charge of PHP35, depending on the distance. The items displayed on the app are those that are available in the store owner's stock. The buyer could also choose the expected time of delivery. In case of a defect in the items purchased, Buelva said Pandalivery would pick these up and have these replaced by the store owners. As part of customer service, the items will be delivered back to the buyers, free of charge, he said. Buelva was at the IdeaSpace event in Makati City last Tuesday, where Pandalivery and other startups showcased their products. \"I joined the (IdeaSpace) community because I like to learn from them. I'm still a college student and I don't have so much of an entrepreneurial mindset,\" he said. The young entrepreneur said he would like to reach more provinces in the future, and give small businesses a chance to develop something without spending too much. He said those who would like to partner with Pandalivery may give him a call and see the details in Pandalivery's website. \"(At Pandalivery), we prioritize the locals. We aim to provide them with more affordable local retail products,\" Buelva said.

Col. Gemma Vinluan, chief of CCPO, said her office has laid down proactive activities even before the robbery in four pawnshops and a money changer inside the J Centre Mall in Mandaue City last Saturday to prepare security guards against criminal elements. She said security agencies, trucking companies, gasoline station operators and hotel owners were called to participate in a series of activities covering crisis management and drills on bomb explosions. “Kaninang umaga (Oct. 24), nagkaroon tayo ng simulation exercises ng bombing incident ng gasoline station just to make sure na ang mga pulis natin at ang mga owners at mga staff ay ready gawin ito halimbawa may incident katulad nun, alam ng mga tao kun paano sila mag-rereact, ano ang kanilang gawin at ano at sino ang dapat una nilang tawagan (Just this morning, we had simulation exercises on bombing incident in a gasoline station just to make sure that police, owners, and staff know how to react, what to do, and whom to call),” Vinluan said in a radio interview. The CCPO will also engage banking institutions next week to train their security details in the same crisis situations, she said. “Gusto lang natin na mas proactive tayo, pinaghahandaan natin ang mga possibility lalo na ang Cebu City ay isang maunlad na siyudad. Kaya dapat mas proactive tayo pagdating sa crime prevention and control (What I want is to be proactive, we are ready in the possibilities as Cebu City is a progressive city. That, we need to be proactive in crime prevention and control),” she added. Vinluan said establishments must trust their police in the light of the policy of mall owners preventing police officers from carrying their service firearms in visiting their establishments, which she described as counterproductive when a crime happens. “Tingnan nila kung hindi kayo nagtitiwala sa pulis na may baril, puede naman silang humingi ng listahan sa amin sino ang mga pulis na papasok ng mall para meron silang listaan ng mga pulis na magpapatrolya sa loob ng mall (If they don’t trust the police who carry their guns, they can ask from us the list of police officers who would go inside malls to conduct patrols),” the chief of the city police said. The malls, she said, can also ask the visiting police officers, even those wearing uniforms, to present their Philippine National Police identification cards (ID), instead of asking them to deposit their service firearms. She supported the view of local officials here that the presence of armed cops deters criminals from doing their nefarious acts inside the malls. A group of 14 to 15 armed robbers from Mindanao carted away PHP130-million worth of jewelry and PHP6 million cash from four jewelry stores and a money changer, respectively, inside the J Centre Mall. Five of the suspects, who are members of the Alferez robbery gang from Ozamiz City, were arrested while four of their cohorts were killed after allegedly trying to grab the cops’ service guns while en route from Polambato wharf to the Bogo Police Station.

Libo-libong Pilipino ang naperwisyo nito at karamihan sa kanila ay habal na ang sinasakyan para mas mabilis makarating sa destinasyon nila at mas mura din ito kumpara sa Grab (Just like the fire incident in LRT-2, thousands of Filipinos were inconvenienced and most of them resorted to the use of the habal-habal as a mode of transportation to reach their destination because it’s cheaper compared to Grab),” he added. Republic Act 4136, or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, only allows the registration of motorcycles for either private or government use and prohibit its listing as a vehicle for hire. “However, individuals and even unaccredited transport groups, continue to utilize motorcycles for public transport despite (the) explicit prohibition of such operation under the same law,” Angara said. Under the bill, a motorcycle must have a minimum engine displacement of 125 cubic cm. and a backbone-type built to be registered for transporting passengers. The Land Transportation Office (LTO) will be tasked to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycles-for-hire before they are registered. To further ensure their safety, no modifications on the motorcycles would be allowed, except for the installation, based on safe engineering design specifications, of motorcycle luggage carriers, saddlebags, step boards or footpegs, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring device.

Satur Ocampo for discrediting President Rodrigo Duterte’s Executive Order No. 70 which institutionalizes a “whole-of-nation approach” in combatting communist insurgency. Major General Antonio Parlade, Jr. was reacting to Ocampo’s column published in Philippine Star on Oct. 12 where he claimed that EO 70, which preferred localized peace talks (LPE), would ”erect big barriers to progress in the peace process”. “You don’t want livelihood and poverty reduction measures for our impoverished and marginalized sector? Strange, Mr. Ocampo but not really,” he said in a statement sent to the Philippine News Agency on Sunday. Duterte terminated peace talks with the Reds in November 2017 citing continued attacks against military and civilian targets while a ceasefire was in place, and their demand for a coalition. Much ground “At ground level that's what you have been saying. You have gained so much ground over years from peace talks and this administration terminated it,” he said in a statement sent to the Philippine News Agency on Sunday. “Great opinion, Mr. Satur Ocampo but who needs your ideas?” Parlade, who is also Armed Forces of the Philippines Deputy Chief of Staff for Civil-Military Operations, said with the government agreeing to earlier CPP-NPA demands of peace talks, many of the communist terrorists took advantage of the truce by presenting themselves as peace consultants, and using the mantle of respectability, it gave them an opportunity to recruit minors into their ranks. “Vic Ladlad is just one of them but look what this consultant has to show from laptops we recovered from him? 8,635 children, aged 13-16, were recruited by Anakbayan and Kabataan into their ranks until September 2015 alone,” he said. Many of children, he added, became full time NPAs (New People’s Army), but Kabataan Party-list Rep. Sarah Jane Elago and ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro were only able to present two in a press conference, to refute claims they are missing. “So what happened to the 8,633? What happened to the other children which the League of Parents of the Philippines have been clamoring to see? They are presumed dead until they are presented,” said Parlade, challenging the former National Democratic Front consultant to talk of the real achievements of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). “Do the people, especially the clergy and genuine peace lovers you duped, know what the CPP really accomplished?,” he added. Parlade enumerated them, as follows: * Thousands of \"political terrorists\" released by five administrations as a sign of good will; * Hundreds of soldiers and policemen killed from ambushes and land mines during the ceasefire, not to mention the numerous civilians caught in crossfires; * Thousands of children recruited while ceasefire was on going; * Hundreds of cleared barangays reclaimed by the NPAs; * CPP collectors able to freely negotiate and extort millions from businesses and politicians; * More money from foreign donors to fund CPP-NDF's negotiations to attempt at peace; and * Improved status of belligerency as CPP leaders were seen as peace lovers. No peace after 32 years He lamented that the implication of these communist gains is damagingly deep and complicated, and always disadvantageous to the people hence, the government and the people didn’t get the peace it wanted after 32 years. Parlade also slammed communist rebels forcing their minor recruits to shoot it out with government troops and yet have the children of their CPP cadres and legal front organizations go to expensive schools and go on trips abroad. “While you recruit minors, who usually end up dead after becoming NPA combatants, children of CPP cadres and Kamatayan bloc representatives are sent to expensive schools and go on trips abroad. Jose Maria Sison shows them how they can live a lavish lifestyle at the expense of Filipinos they duped into dying for their dead, rejected, and rotten cause,” he added. Peace negotiations, he said, embolden the Makabayan bloc, selling themselves as an alternative solution to the problems of the society. “They rake millions of government funds for programs that destroy the government and its image abroad,” he added. Parlade also rebutted Ocampo, saying how peace talks allowed CPP-NDF to gain more leverage by having presenting themselves as \"social activists\", \"human rights defenders\", \"academic freedom fighters.” Abuse of press freedom “You enjoyed abusing these freedom to bail terrorists out of jail, write in papers and blogs about your lies like you do in PhilStar, accuse government of red-tagging, harassment, tyranny, and fascism when cornered,” Parlade said. “You even file harassment cases against those in government who are vocal in exposing the truth about your duplicitous nature, especially as these are already affecting the millions of Euros you are getting from unwitting foreign funding agencies in the EU, US, and even religious congregations.” He scored Ocampo for having the gall to complain about curtailing press freedom and human rights when it is the CPP-NPA who have been killing your own kind, including indigenous peoples who turn against communist ideology. The CPP-NPA is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines. “Finally people know it’s not peace and progress you and the CPP want. At the end of all these hypocrisy, its more conflict, unparalleled instability, and abject poverty that you want,” he said. He added that given the opportunity, communists will execute a power grab and establish their own \"proletarian dictatorship\" based on the CPP Constitution Plans and Programs dated May 2017. “You are the greatest scam of the century. Write about that next time,” Parlade told Ocampo.

Then-Captain Eduardo Montealto Jr., who retired with the rank of Colonel before joining the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to spearhead the PUV modernization program in Central Visayas, recalled on Wednesday how he and his commanding officer were kidnapped by NPA rebels in February of 1999. Montealto and his superior, then-Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, commander of the 55th Engineer Brigade in Davao City, were conducting an ocular inspection for a road project in the village of Kalatong in Davao City when the NPA rebels flagged down their pick-up truck. Montealto was the Brigade’s logistics officer when the kidnapping occurred. Their driver who was a Corporal and a civilian traveling with them were released. But Obillo and Montealto were brought to the NPA hideout and word of their capture spread like wildfire. “We were inspecting aggregates to be used for the road projects. We collect samples of the aggregates for lab test in UP (University of the Philippines) in Mindanao. While we were driving down the hills, the NPA rebels caught us,” Montealto told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in Cebuano in an interview. When they were brought to Kumander Parago (Leoncio Pitao), leader of the Pulang Bagani (red fighters) command in Southern Mindanao, they were met with several children carrying rifles, he said. Montealto also recalled that he was guarded by children during his two months of captivity. “Ang nag-guwardiya nako giti-onan ko mga bata gyud. Ako gipangutana pila imo edad, naay 13. Mao ako sila gi-estorya asa sila gikan, ug nahibaw-an nako taga Surigao sila (Those who were assigned to guard me were children. I asked one how old he was and I found out there was a 13-year-old. And so I was able to talk to them and I learned that they were from Surigao),” he narrated. Montealto said he noticed that the children at the Pulang Bagani command underwent indoctrination, with rebel leaders brainwashing them by telling stories about government oppression. “The children fighters were also taught how to conduct sparrow operations and tactical movement. And if they had operations, they would deploy first the children,” he said. He also noticed how the children had adapted to life as rebel warriors in the mountain. He said he saw one child fighter cleaning the firearms one after another and consistently putting a “pasulong bullet” (fighter’s lingo on chamber-load) in the barrel when cleaning, so that they were always ready to fire in times of eventuality. The children, Montealto said, confided to him that they went to a school in Surigao del Sur (near Tandag) where they sang “Himno Internasyonal” every morning, instead of the Lupang Hinirang. Half of the class of 40 students in that Surigao del Sur school went up to the mountain of Davao City to join other young fighters under Kumander Parago. Many of the child warriors' parents went to the mountain to see them, he recalled. But none of them was allowed to climb to the Pulang Bagani station. Montealto learned later on that the parents were provided with provisions called “supamil” which means “suporta sa pamilya” (support to the family). He also recalled counting around 140 fighters, including regular rebels who also became his “friends” while in captivity. He remembered how one Pulang Bagani combatant with the nickname “Vic” secured him during long walks in the hinterlands. “Mahadlok ko magtan-aw kay iyang armalite naka-on ang safety pin, ako giingnan “sir naka-kuan ang safety sa armalite mo, makalabit mo pa’g ma-slide tayo. Ilagay sa safety. (I was scared seeing his Armalite with safety pin open. I would ask him 'sir, the safety pin of your armalite is open, you might pull the trigger if we slide off the ground. Put it on safety'),” he recalled. The abducted Army captain also recalled seeing 14 female students of a big university in Davao who went to the mountain as OJT (on-the-job training) under the rebel command of Parago. “Hostage pa ko nila, ako sila gi-estoryahan kanus-a sila naabot. Motubag sila nako mag-sir. Ako pud sila giingnan ayaw lang mo pag-sir kay pantay-pantay ra ta dire (I was their hostage then when I had the chance to talk to them when they arrived. They call me 'sir' when they answer my question. I had to tell them not to address me sir as we were treated as equals there),” Montealto said. While in captivity, Montealto said he had the chance to study the rebels' tactical doctrine some of which were incomprehensible and bore “deep Visayan” terms and explanations. He also recalled that rebel leaders Jose Maria Sison and Luis Jalandoni would call him from the Netherlands to check on their situation while in captivity. Former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, General Joselin Nazareno then flew to Davao to coordinate military efforts to free Obillo and Montealto. News records showed that Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado justified Obillo and Montealto’s presence in the area, saying they were \"non-combatants\" and that being Army engineers, they were there to build roads and bridges for poor residents in Mindanao. A series of negotiations ensued. Then presidential adviser for Mindanao Jesus Dureza and Senator Loren Legarda, along with two bishops (one of them was Bishop Jesus Varela), negotiated for their release. But before the release happened, he suffered the ordeal of being tried before the Kangaroo court, with “baseless” accusations. “Nasipyat sila. Gi-accuse ko nga one of Marcos’ secret marhals kuno ko and nag-land grab ko. In 1972, elementary pa man ko, unsaon man nako pagka-secret marshal? Sipyat sila ato (They mistook me. They accused me as one of Marcos’ secret marshals and I went on land-grabbing. In 1972, I was just an elementary pupil, how could I be a secret marshal? They made a mistake),” he narrated. He said that he was able to list down their accusations that they broadcast on radio, but he said they did not read his answers. Due to mounting pressure from the public for the release of Obillo and Montealto, amid then President Joseph Estrada's order to suspend peace talks, the Pulang Bagani children warriors bade farewell to the two Army engineers. After 58 days of captivity, Montealto and Obillo were freed in the mountain village of Suawan in Davao’s Marilog District. They were brought down a steep hill and allowed to meet their wives inside a van before joining a ceremony at which Parago himself formally announced Montealto and Obillo’s release to the representatives of the Philippine Red Cross. After his release, Montealto was transferred to another Army unit that led a successful operation in the NPA lair headed by Parago, where fighters numbering around 60 – including the child warriors – surrendered to the government forces. His captor, Pitao or Kumander Parago, was killed along with a suspected female rebel in an encounter with 6th Scout Ranger Company of the Philippine Army in Pañalum village, Paquibato District in Davao City in June 2015. Pitao’s Pulang Bagani command was considered as the main unit of the NPA in Davao region. At the time of his death, he had several warrants of arrest for various crimes including murder, multiple frustrated murder and robbery. Montealto said he received an offer to make his story as NPA captive the subject of a movie to be starred by Philip Salvador but due to some reasons, it never materialized.

In a statement, Grab belied crash victim Karen Graneta's claims that she did not receive any financial aid from the firm. Grab said the case involving Graneta was pending in court. It clarified that a check worth PHP160,000 was issued to Graneta's family, specifically to her uncle, a certain Roel Capuno. The company said its chief of drivers’ services personally went to the University of Santo Tomas Hospital a day after the accident to see Graneta’s family and asked them about their needs. “At the time, Ms. Graneta’s family acknowledged that it was not the fault of the GrabCar driver, who also sustained injuries due to the accident,” the statement read. During the second visit of a Grab representative, Capuno was designated by the family to transact with Grab and was later given the check named to and personally received by him. “The family’s biggest concern at that time was the hospital expenses,” Grab said. Aside from providing financial aid, Grab said they also assisted the victim’s family in the processing of insurance claims as part of the company’s protocol. However, the family failed to comply with the requirements of the insurance claim. “Ms. Graneta’s family expressed interest to claim insurance benefits but were not able to submit the documents required for the processing of insurance claims,” Grab said. To express their willingness to extend support “above and beyond” what is necessary, Grab said they have also engaged additional third-party insurance since the accident — on top of the government-required insurance. On Wednesday, Graneta narrated the events of the 2016 collision that killed her friend, during a hearing by the Senate Committee on Public Services on the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Graneta and a friend were aboard a Grab car in full-stop at the Nagtahan (Mabini) bridge on Sept. 27, 2016, when a truck crashed into them from behind, causing their car to surge forward and hit another truck in front. Graneta recalled that they were trapped inside the vehicle for almost an hour. She was hospitalized for six months and her hospital bills amounted to PHP3 million.

In a Twitter post, Gatchalian said aside from the bill, he has also filed a resolution to investigate the incident. The senator said Grab should provide the money for purchasing goods ordered by their customers instead of its delivery partners. Verifying the legitimacy of buyers was also needed, Gatchalian said, noting that even fast-food giant McDonald’s asks for legitimate landline numbers to validate orders. He added that cashless payments must be encouraged to help ease, if not eliminate, the risk in their GrabFood delivery service. On Saturday, GrabFood released a statement on the said incident and initial investigation showed that the delivery-partner did not incur personal losses or needed to pay with his cash as the order was paid in a cashless transaction. “The cashless payment capability is currently available in select merchants and is being tested as a solution to limit the need for our delivery-partners to carry cash or working capital,” Grab said. Language differences and miscommunication between the delivery-partner and the customer were found to be the source of the failed transaction. “After waiting for more than 20 minutes at the drop-off point, the delivery-partner proceeded to treat the transaction as a no-show,” Grab said. However, Grab said their no-show and reimbursement policy was not followed by their delivery-partner which prescribed the drinks to be surrendered immediately to Grab. Afterwards, the customer tried to claim the drinks but was too late. The company added that they have reimbursed the customer and compensated the driver for his time and effort. Grab also reminded its GrabFood drivers that unclaimed orders are fully-reimbursed by the company. “We also encourage our customers to review their orders and ensure accuracy of delivery details before placing an order,” Grab said.

The eight-kilometer elevated four-lane expressway connects the NLEX and SLEX through Segment 10 -- C3 Road in Caloocan City to Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Sta. Mesa, Manila -- and Skyway Stage 3. The project is expected to be traversed by those going through Metro Manila from the north to the south and vice versa, which would effectively relocate a significant portion of vehicular traffic on Edsa. Another big-impact project, she said, was increasing the number of trains running in the MRT-3, which is yet to be fully realized. “We’ve been promised many times that the trains that were imported from Dalian will be working soon, but out of the 16 trains, only two or three are working after five years,” Poe said. An PHP18-billion comprehensive rehabilitation of the MRT-3 is currently ongoing, which the Department of Transportation hopes would increase the ridership of the MRT-3 from the daily average of 320,000 to 650,000 by its expected completion on July 2021. Sumitomo-MHI TESP, the contractor and maintenance provider of the MRT-3 project, will also overhaul all light rail vehicles of the rail transit, replace mainline tracks to increase its operating speeds, rehabilitate power and overhead catenary systems, among other upgrades. Walkways, innovative transport systems Aside from motorized mass transportation, the senator also highlighted conventional walkways as an effective solution to congestion in the metro. “If the government would mandate that, if you build certain buildings in a financial center or a business center, you should already have elevated walkways to connect to other buildings,” Poe said. She emphasized that these mass transport systems would be more effective than regulations on innovative transport systems such as transport network companies (TNC) like Grab and Angkas. “Yet the initial reaction of some people, such as the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board), was to treat the TNCs like taxi operators and regulate their supply and price,” Poe said. The senator said passenger rights and innovations must be carefully balanced because “nothing chokes an enterprise more than excessive regulation.” She added that the Philippines’ mass transportation is not yet fully available, thus, “the state is obligated to explore new modes of transportation for the sake of our commuters.” During the summit, experts from both the government and private sectors tackled the fourth industrial revolution brought by such innovative technologies as learning robots through artificial intelligence, Internet of things, 3D-printing, among others.

Lawyer Clarence Guinto, LTO National Capital Region West (LTO NCR West) regional director, thanked Cortez for taking the time to file an affidavit against Grab driver Anselmo Benigno, which resulted in the revocation of his driver’s license by the LTO. He also asked Filipinos to emulate Cortez and file formal complaints against any wrongdoing. “Tularan po natin si Gillian, ‘wag natin payagan na abusuhin tayo ng ating mga drivers – even mga (Let’s follow Gillian’s example, let’s not allow abuse from our drivers – or even) LTO personnel,” Guinto said during the recognition ceremony for Cortez at the LTO NCR West office. The LTO regional chief emphasized that they receive many accusations and complaints against some of their enforcers, but when asked to formalize their complaint, they refuse. In her short acceptance speech, Cortez thanked the LTO “for doing their job and making sure (that) at least one guy is not going to do this again to other women.” She also encouraged other victims of harassment to come out in the open and report their abusers to the authorities. “Thank you so much LTO and I hope that other women who are watching this are not going to be afraid to report their stories to the LTO and to the authorities,” Cortez said. A certificate of recognition was awarded to Cortez during the ceremony “for upholding her rights and ensuring that justice be asserted to those who have violated the human rights of others, especially on gender-based violence.\" In her complaint last July, Cortez said she caught Benigno lifting her skirt when she awoke after falling asleep while inside his Toyota Innova which her father booked on Grab. While Cortez formalized her lasciviousness complaint against the Grab driver, the LTO immediately issued a Show Cause Order and several notices to Benigno and his operator to appear during hearings at the LTO Central Office in Quezon City to explain the incident, for which the accused was a no-show and resulted in the revocation of his license.

Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, said Grab, as the “leading super app,” aims to continue its innovation, use “technology for good” and improve quality of life through transportation, logistics, and lifestyle services. “Grab has introduced a bunch of new services, and existing services have in fact grown multiple folds since we did this earlier this year. So, we’d like to share those updates with you and really tell you the story of how Grab has grown into your everyday ‘Super App’ here in Southeast Asia,” Cu said during a media townhall in Makati City. Through a partnership with Toni & Guy, an international chain of hairdressing salons, and L’Oreal, a global leader in beauty products, Grab would bring hair salon services right at the doorsteps of its users. Customers would be able to choose featured haircuts and hair color services and need only book these services at least two hours in advance. To supplement its current GrabExpress service which currently gives same-day delivery to its users in limited areas such as within Metro Manila, Grab partnered with Ninja Van to extend its package delivery range nationwide. Martin Cu, head of Ninja Van in the Philippines said their company has a network of 9,000 riders which covers 95 percent of the country’s population and would give GrabExpress users, especially those with small and medium enterprises (SMEs), cheaper nationwide deliveries, bulk pick-up of up to 30 parcels at once, and next-day scheduled pickup. “Grab and Ninja Van’s shared vision is to be the game changers in the logistics segments. We are committed to creating solutions that will enable millions of SMEs to scale their businesses and afford Filipinos the ability to easily reach their loved ones across the Philippines,” Cu said. In October, Grab users can expect to see a new “Videos” tile in their app made possible through a partnership with video-on-demand company HOOQ, giving users access to over 8,000 Hollywood titles, local series, and free-to-air content. Through efforts initiated in 2018 and now fully realized, the Grab app currently lets its users book hotel rooms and other services online, made possible in partnership with Booking Holdings Inc. which operates both hotels booking websites Agoda and Booking.com. Last July, Grab launched its Bus Marketplace in-app feature which allows users to purchase bus tickets initially limited to point-to-point operations by Tas Trans and San Agustin which includes Glorietta 2 to Nuvali and Glorietta 2 to Southmall routes. In September, Bus Marketplace will be expanded to include bus routes servicing Olongapo to Clark, Clark to Dagupan and Makati to Noveleta, Cavite (and vice versa) routes. To compete with other online and mobile payment services vying for a place in the country’s growing digital market, Grab bolstered its GrabPay service through a partnership with PLDT Group and SM Investments Corp. SM malls would soon allow GrabPay users to skip regular lanes and use the malls’ ‘Express Lanes’ in SM Cinemas, and ‘Prestige Lanes’ in SM Markets and give these users double GrabReward points in every purchase. Through PLDT Global Corp. (PGC), overseas Filipino workers in Singapore and Malaysia will be able to purchase PGC Free Bee Voice Buckets which lets its users make international voice calls. Smart, TNT and, Sun subscribers may also soon purchase Giga Video packages in the Grab app with a five percent discount using GrabPay.

On Wednesday, Tourism chief Bernadette Romulo-Puyat and Grab Philippines President Brian Cu signed a memorandum of understanding with the ride-hailing company committing to deploy 30 units of scooters, free of charge for a period of three months, for tourists to experience the historic destination in Manila. Romulo-Puyat said this partnership is in keeping with the DOT's effort to inculcate a culture of sustainable tourism in the Philippines. \"We want visitors to have access to an eco-friendly but fun mode of transportation,\" she said.  According to Cu, Grab Philippines will be setting up booths inside Intramuros where visitors can readily use the scooters. After the pilot testing, the rentals would be made via a mobile application called GrabWheels. \"This is a pilot to see what the uptake will be, if we see that there is a good response from the visitors this area, we might extend the trial period or select other locations,\" he said in an interview. Romulo-Puyat said no new destination has been agreed upon yet but the DOT wants to put up similar service at the Rizal Park and Paco Park in Manila. \"It's now for Intramuros for the meantime and then we'll see how it goes then we'll expand,\" she told reporters. \"This is the good thing with having a partnership with the private sector, there's more involvement in promoting the country's tourism.\"  Intramuros Administration chief Guiller Asido, for his part, is optimistic these personal mobility devices would significantly reduce traffic congestion inside the walled city. \"After a month, we will review its reception and determine the necessary mechanisms and setting of fees to make it sustainable,\" he said.

Major General Antonio Parlade, Jr., of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF ELCAC) made this statement in response to Elago's claims that she is not an NPA member. \"Who said you are an NPA member? Of course, you are not. What we said is that you have been hiding in your comfortable cover as Kabataan Party-list representative. You all have mastered the art of deception, moving from aboveground to underground, and now walking in the Halls of Congress,\" he said in a statement sent to the Philippine News Agency Saturday. Parlade, who is also Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Deputy Chief-of-Staff for Civil-Military Operations, said Elago was able to do this by using the CPP-NPA's \"revolutionary dual tactics\" which has kept the country in the dark for 50 years. Arouse, Organize, Mobilize \"You start with your Social Investigation and Class Analysis (SICA) to get the profile of possible targets for recruitment to LFS (League of Filipino Students) for students or Anakbayan to accommodate out-of-school youth. You choose the smartest but most vulnerable because of poverty, family issues, the progressive outlook in life, and even sexual promiscuity (a perfect excuse to be free from the prying eyes and rules of strict parents). If kids are receptive to the social injustices they see around, then that's when you start the arousal stage of your AOM (Arouse, Organize, Mobilize) methodology. More agitation will make them join your open mass organs like LFS, Kabataan, Anakbayan, CEGP, etc, thus the systematic 'Organization' of like-minded radicals,\" he added. In due time, recruits are given more indoctrinations and advance teachings that will elevate the level of political education of these minors in the lines of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist tenets in preparation for their mobilization, he added. After these processes, Parlade said, these minors will be assessed whether they are qualified and willing to become party candidates, and eventually become full-time CPP cadre members. \"Once sworn in, you now become part of the underground mass organization (UGMO) called Kabataang Makabayan (KM).  For that matter, none of you can become an officer of these open mass organizations if you are not a party member yet. But surfacing back aboveground as officials of Makabayan bloc does not extinguish your line to the underground,\" he said. Support role While Elago is not an NPA member in the strictest sense of the term, Parlade said she is still playing a role to support the communist rebels as she opted to be part of the group's so-called \"legal front\" which is tasked to support the illegal activities of the underground movement and its armed component. \"She fits that role because she has the charisma, charm, and intellect, needed to lead in the legal and parliamentary struggle. They need an exemplar who looks meek, harmless and has the face to project the sheep amongst wolves,\" he added. Minors recruited by Anakbayan, KM, and other progressive groups have no place to go but on the different underground bureaus of the CPP with the more aggressive ones being NPA cadres. \"But where does the rest of these Anakbayan and KM go? The more aggressive kids become NPA cadres, political officers, or officers of the different underground bureaus of the CPP. Those who write well go to propaganda and education, some as combat medics which they call health workers or logisticians for the Red fighters. Once exposed and integrated into the armed group, there is no more turning back. They are told that the military knows about them already and if captured they will be skinned alive,\" he added. With Elago and the rest of the militant party-list group leaders being very adept to the CPP's aboveground and underground strategies, Parlade said these individuals exist with the \"Kamatayan (Makabayan) bloc\" to ensure that the NPA does not run out of fighters for its illegal activities. \"They plan and work as CPP cadres for CPP programs, both for the legal and armed struggle. They attend NPA anniversaries, celebrations, and meet NPA cadres when needed. The 'Kamatayan bloc' like Elago, exists to ensure that the NPAs does not run out of fresh fighters, to die for their cause hence, the term 'Kamatayan',\" he aid. He added that while Elago and other militant party-list groups’ leaders have blood on their hands for recruiting minors to the NPA, their expertise on aboveground and duplicity strategies of the CPP makes them appear to be clear of any wrongdoing. Duplicitous scheme Parlade also dismissed the desire of these groups for peace talks as this has never been their true agenda because they want absolute power for their ranks. \"It's another duplicitous scheme of theirs -- project an interest in peace, when all they want is grab power. But for those who are too naive of their peace agenda, consider the following which are found in the NDFP version of the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio Eco Reforms (CASER): (a) Repeal of Mining Act, Agri and Fishery Modernization Act, and IPRA Law, the only mechanism that protects the interest of the IPs (indigenous peoples) which they claim to protect; (b) No demobilization of NPA (Art 7 CASER, Bayan Muna USA); and (c) Demobilization of the GRP military (Art 8 CASER Bayan Muna USA),\" he added. With these objectives in the open, he said it is very unlikely that the Filipinos will allow the dissolution of the AFP and allow the NPA to implement the CPP's \"proletarian dictatorship\". The CPP-NPA is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

The ARTA on Tuesday (Aug. 13) released an order declaring all pending but complete, duly-paid and duly-heard TNVS applications as automatically approved, and ordered the LTFRB to release the Certificates of Public Convenience (CPC) or other appropriate licenses or certifications for these applicants. “The Authority hereby declares the completeness of all pending TNVS applications before the LTFRB with complete documentary requirements, duly paid, and have been duly heard from 07 July 2018, or 20 days after the effectivity of RA 11032, until 24 July 2019, or 20 days immediately prior to the issuance of this Order,” the order read.  ARTA released a summary of their findings and recommendations following complaints from the TNVS community of red tape in the processing of TNVS applications. In the summary, ARTA said they found “unreasonable and undue” delay in the processing of TNVS applications. “Contrary to LTFRB’s 2017 Revised Citizen’s Charter, it failed to process TNVS applications within the processing time of 45 days for the conduct and hearing and evaluation of such application,” the summary read. To address the delays, ARTA recommended the “automatic approval of all pending TNVS applications that have submitted all documentary requirements, paid the appropriate fees, and have been duly heard, but are still awaiting the issuance of PAs (Provisional Authorities).” The validity of the PAs are to be extended from the current 90 days to one year, “or better yet, shall have no expiration at all,” recommended ARTA. It was noted that a PA may be revoked in cases of serious traffic violations, including ethical and legal considerations. The anti-red tape body also recommended reinstating the old process of having Grab organize TNVS applications instead of individual applicants so that they would only need to appear during their hearing at the LTFRB. In the second part of the summary, ARTA found the LTFRB to be imposing requirements that were not stated in its Citizen’s Charter. “The Authority further found that the LTFRB suddenly imposed changes in the documentary requirements without properly revising its Citizen’s Charter. This created confusion among TNVS applicants,” the summary read. ARTA also recommended the removal of Bank Certificate of Conformity as a requirement, devising of an appropriate regulatory framework for TNVS, conduct of a regulatory impact assessment to improve regulatory frameworks, revision of some other requirements, and to provide basis that would justify the cap of 65,000 TNVS units in Metro Manila. ARTA also said they found fixers to be prevalent in the premises of the LTFRB, and also recommended action against officials or employees of the LTFRB found violating RA 11032 or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007. On July 7, 2019, the ARTA began a dialogue with TNVS groups following “problematic” pronouncements from the LTFRB, which included the prohibition on hatchbacks as TNVS. Three days later, the LTFRB, DOTr, and ARTA held a dialogue, where TNVS groups raised their concerns to the government bodies. Tugade eventually signed an order amending past DOTr provisions to permanently allow hatchbacks as TNVS.

DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez cited other neighboring countries which are already doing all payments and even small transactions in the mobile phones. “They are just our neighboring countries. In other words, jumping into the system is just around the corner. All it takes is everyone to download an app or switch to digital transactions,” he said in a press briefing Tuesday on the sidelines of dialogue on E-Commerce Philippine Roadmap 2022. Lopez also sees 100,000 MSMEs engaging in e-commerce in the next three years, noting that over 30,000 sari-sari stores (community stores) in the barangay level have capabilities for e-wallet loading and transferring of funds. “We can be more optimistic on the target. The technology is already there, the penetration of mobile phones is there, internet penetration, Facebook,” he added. DTI Undersecretary Rafaelita Aldaba noted the services sector currently contributes half to the country’s total gross domestic product (GDP), and a bulk of which is shared by wholesale and retail. Aldaba said the figure does not include Grab transport, GrabFood, tickets booked online, and hospitality businesses listed in Airbnb, among others. Prof. Ronilo Balbieran, who is tapped to assist the E-Commerce Office of the DTI to produce the roadmap, said the e-commerce is expected to grow a minimum 25 to 30 percent per year. “We are very excited given that technology can always multiply output by a factor of between five to 10 times with the same resources,” he added.

The situation report also said retrieval operations continue for the remaining 12 passengers of the boats that sank amid inclement weather. “Our search, rescue and retrieval operation is ongoing,” CDRRMO head Donna Magno said, adding that dead bodies were seen floating in Dumangas on Sunday morning. Of the 19 retrieved bodies, 11 were passengers of MB Chi-Chi which capsized at 12:15 p.m. The boat has 47 passengers and 35 of them survived while one remains missing. MB Jenny Vince, on the other hand, was carrying 39 passengers. Twenty of them survived while eight died and 11 are still missing. No casualty has been reported on the third boat, MB Keziah. Magno said the search and retrieval operation is “crucial” because even if they are dead, it important for their families to see their bodies. “Given the number of hours since the incident happened and until this hour, we are still hoping that we can still see their bodies,” she said. She also hoped that their bodies drifted to nearby places and they just failed to send information or they are just waiting to be verified. Magno said 17 survivors already went home on Saturday night while the rest are still at the evacuation center. She shared a heart-wrenching story about a husband who attempted to rescue his wife only to find out he was holding a different woman. “And when he attempted the third time to grab his wife, she already slipped and he could not reach her anymore,” she added. Meantime, the transfer of retrieved bodies from Dumangas to Iloilo City is now being facilitated while coordination with the Department of Health is being made for the cadaver bags. An information desk was also set up to assist families who are still looking for their family members and for identification of dead bodies. Of the 19 retrieved bodies, six are yet to be identified. Meanwhile, Civil Defense Regional Director Jose Roberto Nuñez said as early as 5 a.m., teams conducting search and retrieval operations have been dispatched despite bad weather conditions. “We cannot give timeline because the weather is not good but we are trying our best to have an aerial survey if weather allows,” he said. He said investigation is now underway as to why the motor boats were allowed to sail despite the bad weather. “We have no basis for the final but at least we can have an initial investigation so that we can see if there are problems,” he added.

This was emphasized by Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana during the media briefing shortly after the launching of the two-day National Disaster Resilience Summit which was held at the Novotel Manila Center in Cubao, Quezon City on Tuesday. He added that the DND, along with the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), is busy talking to and training people living in Metro Manila lying in the path of the West Valley Fault. This fault line runs through Metro Manila to the cities of Marikina, Quezon City, Pasig, Makati, Taguig and Muntinlupa and also traverses Doña Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan to Calamba, Laguna. \"(The West Valley Fault is) huge (and once it) moves (it is capable of creating large scale earthquakes with magnitude 7 or higher and causing massive destruction) and that's why we have been emphasizing it to the heads of our local officials to prepare accordingly,\" Lorenzana said. Part of the preparation is that local government units tell their constituents to stockpile three days worth of food and water while barangays store a week's worth of essential supplies. Cities and towns should also have more of these items in depots and secure locations. Lorenzana said that he is hoping that households have their own survival kit or grab bag containing emergency items and a battery-operated transistor radio and power banks for cellphones. Meanwhile, OCD administrator Ricardo Jalad, who is also executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said the national government has a contingency plan for such eventualities. Aside from this, all government agencies are assigned a particular task within their capacity and capability. Jalad also said that they are also looking at the capacity of the local government units (LGUs) to do its own disaster risk reduction management (DRRM) capability. In line with this, the OCD chief is hoping that the LGUs will invest more in their calamity funds or the local DRRM fund. Aside from this, efforts or contingency measures are now being prepared by responsible agencies to ensure that food and water supplies in Metro Manila remain stable in the event of the \"Big One\". Lorenzana said part of the preparations include the Department of Public Works and Highways checking out buildings in Metro Manila to determine which are quake-resistant or not. Another ongoing effort is the identification of open areas that could serve as evacuation centers.

An existing ordinance provides that garbage should be taken out to the streets only when garbage collectors arrive.“Hakoot enables residents to know when to take out their garbage, unlike the present set up wherein residents and establishments have to watch out the whole day for the garbage truck that sometimes doesn’t come,” he said.Nevertheless, Efren stressed that the maximum effectiveness of Hakoot will still depend on solid waste management infrastructure -- enough garbage trucks and collectors, the establishment of Material Recovery Facilities and the main residual containment facility.Alvi Agolong, City General Service Office chief, acknowledged the challenge on the part of the city, noting that it still lacks some essential equipment and facilities.“We have the residual containment facility, but we still have to prod each barangay leadership to establish their own material recovery facilities. Worse, we don’t have garbage trucks, we just borrow two dump trucks from the Engineering Office,” Agolong said.The problem with borrowing trucks is that it can only be used for a single round on its route every day, “and it has to be sent back for engineering works,” Agolong said.Dapitan has only about five tons of garbage daily, which can be taken care of with three to four garbage trucks and about 32 collectors and drivers.At present, Agolong admitted that they can hardly collect the city’s garbage, “particularly if the schedule is disrupted when the aging dump trucks bogged down or if trucks are already full before its routes are completely covered.Efren said the mobile application was designed out of the frustration of residents, who \"have no one else to go but the social media. We were troubled, annoyed with the rants of our fellow Dapitanons on uncollected garbage, that’s why I called up my brother telling him we have to do something.”“Thus the birth of Hakoot, but we will continue on improving the software through the feedback of those in solid waste management and the residents and establishments. Hakoot has to be tailored fit for the needs of the city,” Efren said.The Jamolods and the city government have already agreed to use Hakoot in principle, and a memorandum of agreement will be signed this week with Mayor Rosalina Jalosjos, who just ordered the immediate purchase of two new garbage trucks and another two next year.Asked why the two-letter “o” in Hakoot, the developers smilingly answered: “that’s how we Bisaya pronounce it.” (PNA) "},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1075462","title":"Hatchbacks now allowed as TNVS units","date":" July 19, 2019, 2:25 pm","snippet":"MANILA — Hatchbacks and sub-compact cars are now permanently allowed as transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units.","body":"MANILA — Hatchbacks and sub-compact cars are now permanently allowed as transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units.

During a dialogue among the representatives of the LTFRB, Department of Transportation (DOTr), the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), and TNVS groups, LTFRB Technical Division Head Joel Bolano said all policies set by the Board for hatchbacks were based on existing department orders from the DOTr and LTFRB memorandum circulars (MC). He said MC 2018-005, a memorandum that allows for hatchbacks as TNVS until February 2021, only applies to accredited hatchback units. These accredited hatchbacks are part of 55,000 TNVS units in the master list made by Transport Network Companies (TNC) like Grab in cooperation with the LTFRB. Of the 55,000 units in the master list, a total of 24,805 filed their respective applications and out of these applications, 2,235 were hatchback units. Bolano said hatchbacks which applied for TNVS accreditation from March 5 to December 15, 2018 are also entitled to the benefits granted by the MC 2018-005. “Hindi po totoo na hindi natin pino-process yun, at hindi po totoo na hindi ini-implement yung [MC 2018-005]. Katunayan po diyan ay yung nag-apply na 2,235 units na hatchback (It’s not true we’re not processing them. It’s not true we’re not implementing MC 2018-005. The proofs are those 2,235 hatchbacks who applied for accreditation),” Bolano said. He said the accredited hatchbacks were actually in violation of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) orders 2015-11 and 2017-011 that only allow sedans, Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV), Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV), vans, or other similar vehicles for TNVS. The mistake happened due to a misunderstanding where TNCs misinterpreted the vehicle types allowed and wrongly accredited hatchback units. This paved the way for the LTFRB to act as the sole accreditor of TNVS operators instead of TNCs. MC 2018-005 was later released to help transition those already accredited until hatchbacks are phased out on 2021 from serving as TNVS. “Ibig sabihin noon, kung walang problema yung 2,235 (hatchbacks) na nag-apply doon sa master list, dapat po tumatakbo siya hanggang 2021 (That means if there are no problems with the 2,235 which applied in the master list, they can operate until 2021),” Bolano said. However, no new TNVS applications from hatchback operators are processed by the LTFRB following said orders from the DOTr, he added. TNVS counsel Ariel Inton challenged LTFRB's definition of TNVS vehicle types which are allowed in the department order. “Meron bang nakalagay na bawal ang hatchback sa (Did it say that hatchbacks are not allowed in the) department order? In fact, if you construe what the department order says, all other similar vehicles, malawak ‘yun (that’s broad). A similar vehicle would be a four-wheel vehicle,” Inton said. LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III, on the other hand, said legal opinions will vary on the matter but the DOTr has made it clear on their department orders what vehicle types are allowed for TNVS. “There is a listing. AUV, Sedan, SUV...The minimum is sedan and it goes all the way up to an SUV. And it says any similar vehicles,” Delgra said.

During a dialogue with TNVS groups and stakeholders in Quezon City, LTFRB Technical Division head Joel Bolano said some changes have been made to the current process of securing franchises known as provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) for TNVS drivers and operators. Beginning the third week of July, the LTFRB will add more hearing dates to address the huge volume of TNVS applications. “Yung isang araw, dalawang araw namin na hearing for TNVS, gagawin na po namin na three to four days. Siguraduhin lang po natin na complete requirements na po tayo (The usual one, two days hearing for TNVS will be extended to three to four days. Just make sure that the requirements are complete),” Bolano told operators during the dialogue. The move would lessen the processing time to secure papers and at the same time allow the regulator to process more applications, he added. It will also allot two Saturdays every month for follow-ups on applications for all types of transport services. Upon the acceptance of a valid and complete TNVS application, the LTFRB will automatically give a PA to operate for 90 days if the applicant has a previous application and if they provide passenger insurance and proof of garage. Bolano added that to get a PA, new applicants will also need to secure a bank certificate of conformity which is necessary for public transport as the usage of private vehicles for public service is in violation of bank rules. The streamlining came after drivers affected by the deactivation from the system of ride-hailing app Grab for failure to secure proper permits to operate in the ride-hailing industry sought for the LTFRB to reduce the process of franchise application. In the same dialogue, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the agency was doing its best to address the concerns of TNVS groups. “On behalf of the board, humihingi ako ng paumanhin (I ask for forgiveness). And that’s precisely why we are addressing it. We’re trying to find ways to address this,” Delgra said. On Saturday, the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) stepped in and arranged dialogues between leaders of the TNVS community, the LTFRB and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) after complaints of red-tape were filed against the LTFRB by TNVS drivers and operators. The LTFRB did not participate in the first two dialogues but arranged a third dialogue after a transport holiday by the TNVS community last Monday. Lawyer Ariel Inton, president of Lawyers for Commuters Safety and Protection, expressed satisfaction with some of the changes that the regulator presented to them. “Yung sa proseso, ito ay magiging mas madali. At yung mga requirements ay mabawasan. In fairness to the board, madami sila pinakita na pagbabago na gagawin nila sa proseso,” Inton said. Janina Pineda, president of the TNVS group Road Grabbers, said even though the dialogue took about six hours with no breaks, the opportunity given to members of their community to air their grievances was worth it but its results are yet to be seen. “Lahat ng operator nagkaroon ng chance na mag-speak up regarding their concern (All operators got a chance to speak up regarding their concern). Most concerns are ongoing for a board of directors meeting so we’ll wait within this week for updates,” Pineda said.

Poe made the statement after the TNVS drivers held a nationwide \"transport holiday\", wherein they went offline from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday to protest government policies affecting their operations. “We will continue to work hard in the Senate to tackle bills that would put in place a law governing TNVS operations,” Poe told reporters in a text message. Poe said this includes the re-filing of a bill, which proposes that only Transport Network Companies such as Grab will be directly regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). She emphasized the need to strike a balance on the need to regulate and to serve the riding public. Poe particularly noted that the LTFRB should make its policies more consistent and processes much easier for the TNVS sector. “While we respect the LTFRB’s mandate to regulate the industry and ensure the safety of the riding public, we also have to recognize that call to make the process easier according to the Ease of Doing Business Act is only for the good of everyone,” Poe said. \"Matagal na nating kinilala ang kakayanan ng industriyang ito na tugunan ang kakulangan ng maayos na transportasyon sa kalakhang Maynila.

Poe also questioned the LTFRB for not implementing its Memorandum Circular 2018-005, which allows existing hatchbacks in the system to continue for three more years in order to recoup their investment. “These are issues which have been raised in previous hearings of the Senate committee on public services. What we should look into is not just the necessity of the requirements issued, but the scope of what the LTFRB can regulate and the consistency of its regulations,” Poe said. “Hindi pwedeng paiba-iba ang ipinatutupad na regulasyon. Hindi ito patas sa mga mananakay at sa mga namumuhunan (We should not be unpredictable in the implementation of regulations. It is not fair to commuters and to investors),” Poe added. Poe said the transport holiday is an opportunity for the parties to come to the table, especially with the scheduled dialogue between the LTFRB and the TNVS drivers on Tuesday to address concerns relating to the “process of accreditation and the necessity of such regulations and requirements.” “We support the dialogue tomorrow and hope that both the LTFRB and TNVS drivers can come to terms for the good of the riding public.

Access and connectivity are really crucial for the tourism sector in the northwestern part of Leyte and Biliran province because the area is endowed with natural wonders, Department of Tourism Regional Director Karina Rosa Tiopes said. “A new airport that can service wider aircraft is a positive development for us because this means that we can now further develop new connectivity with a new gateway in the other side of Leyte,” she told the Philippine News Agency. Majority of tourists visiting Eastern Visayas use the Tacloban airport as their main gateway to get to different parts of the region. Travel time from the city to their destinations in northwestern Leyte is two to three hours. “This two to three hours or sometimes four hours travel time from Tacloban to a tourist destination is very inconvenient to our tourists,” Tiopes said. Most of the popular tourist destinations in Leyte Island are located in the Northwest Leyte Tourism Corridor, such as Lake Danao, Tongonan Hot Spring and Alto Peak in Ormoc City; Kalanggaman Island in Palompon, Leyte; Cuatro Islas in the towns of Inopacan and Hindang, Leyte; and Sambawan Island in Maripipi, Biliran. Kalanggaman, known for its white sandbar, is the most visited destination in the Eastern Visayas region. “This time, they have another option. So now, we are praying that soon an airline company will be serving this new route,” Tiopes said. The official added that tourism stakeholders should grab this opportunity and challenge of having a new airport by developing new market-ready tourism sites and for those who are in tour operations, to level up their services. President Rodrigo Duterte and Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade led the inauguration of the upgraded airport here on Friday. The facility was heavily damaged by Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 and by an earthquake in 2017. The Department of Transportation allocated PHP34 million for the rehabilitation of the terminal building, PHP82 million for asphalt overlay of the runway, and PHP55 million for the runway widening project. The terminal building has been completed while asphalt overlay works are still ongoing. The runway widening project is up for completion in 2020. The ongoing development will convert the facility into a night-rated airport, which is capable of launching and receiving flights at night. Leyte 4th District Rep. Lucy Torres-Gomez said she is very happy with the national government’s response to her request to rehabilitate the city’s airport. “Inviting commercial airline to operate in Ormoc is always part of the plan.

On July 18, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) will launch \"911 TESDA\" app in the National Capital Region (NCR). This would basically function like Grab and Uber, but instead of rides, one would ask services from TESDA graduates. \"This is still part of the government's employment objective, and to help those who would like to augment our income,\" TESDA-NCR director Conrado Bares told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) on Sunday. He emphasized that TESDA's mandate is not just to give education or training, but also help its graduates find employment or livelihood opportunities. \"This (app) also aims to make it more convenient for the public, those who need services, to find workers,\" Bares added. About seven digital online service providers (DOSPs) have signed partnership with TESDA-NCR for this app. According to TESDA, these DOSPs said 42,000 people in NCR are needing the services of certified TESDA graduates. Among the in-demand services are massage, carpentry, housekeeping, programming and call center.  TESDA graduates from 2017 may apply to be accredited by the DOSPs. The two will have an agreement on how things would work. DOSPs would screen the workers they would send to those who would be needing services. For instance, someone needs a masseur. The DOSP would look for the registered worker nearest the vicinity. Thus, this would give the TESDA graduates the option to work with the DOSP either full time or part time, depending on their availability.  During the launch in Manila, TESDA-NCR will orient the schools and ask them to encourage their graduates to register for this app. The DOSPs will also be there for an exhibit. TESDA explained that only those who graduated from year 2017 can take part in this program, because these are the graduates included in the agency's online database system. The system encoded details such as the date of enrollment and the expected date of graduation. Graduates should also be certified or national certificate (NC) holders. TESDA plans to eventually launch the app nationwide.

LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III urged the TNVS drivers to consider the interest of the riding public and conduct a dialogue with the board to air their concerns. “We ask TNVS operators to be more circumspect in their plan to hold a transport holiday that will affect the commuting public. Instead, we urge them to bring their legitimate concerns to LTFRB, in dialogue, so that the Board can address them and not hold the riding public hostage by their planned disruptive action,” Delgra said in a statement on Friday. “The LTFRB welcomes constructive criticisms and feedbacks from all stakeholders,” he added. On Monday, TNVS driver groups are expected to temporarily go offline from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to protest the delays in the processing of applications for certificates of public convenience by the LTFRB. Meanwhile, ridesharing firm Grab Philippines said it respects the right of its TNVS driver-partners to free speech and assembly as it calls for the exercise of restraint in holding their protest actions. “We urge our TNVS partners to show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides,” Grab Philippines Public Manager Nicka Hosaka said in a separate statement. “We recognize the TNVS partners’ right to free speech and peaceable assembly. In many ways, we also support the call for smoother processes and faster timelines,” she added. In a related development, a group of hatchback drivers said it is set to file a complaint against the LTFRB before the Office of the Ombudsman to oppose their deactivation. Metro Hatchback Community chairman Jun de Leon said hatchbacks are allowed to operate as TNVS until February 2021 under LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2018-005. However, the LTFRB refused to accept and process their franchise applications. The same group filed a mandamus case against the LTFRB before the Quezon City Regional Court for stopping the application of hatchback drivers last June 21. A total of 1,225 hatchback vehicles were deactivated in June, according to the Metro Hatchback Community.

This was highlighted by Philippine National Police Brigadier General Madid M. Paitao during a recent information, education, and communication (IEC) campaign here. “Let me reiterate that the coordination in the conduct of law enforcement operations in the MILF camps or communities is important even if we are no longer at war with them,” he said. With the passage of the Bangsamoro Organic Law on January 26, 2019, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was abolished and replaced by the BARMM. In April of this year, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed Executive Order 79 implementing the Annex on Normalization of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, the peace agreement signed between the Government of the Philippines and the MILF. The normalization track primarily involves the decommissioning of combatants and putting their weapons beyond use, and the transformation of six MILF camps into peaceful and resilient communities. For his part, OPAPP Assistant Secretary Dickson P. Hermoso stressed that despite the creation of the BARMM, the ceasefire agreement remains strong and will continue to be strengthened to ensure peace and order in the region. “Wala na tayong giyera with the Moro National Liberation Front and MILF so ano pa ang ating ceasefire? Nandiyan pa rin dahil sa adjustment period dahil hindi pa naiintindihan ng lahat sa ground. Kung may nag-commit ng crime, hindi niya p’wedeng sabihin na MILF siya. (We are not at war with the Moro National Liberation Front and MILF anymore, so what is our ceasefire for? It’s still there because we are still in the adjustment period since not everyone on the ground understands it. If someone commits a crime, he cannot claim that he is a member of the MILF),” he said. “The keywords here are trust and confidence. There is an opportunity for us to gain peace in our area. Let’s grab it -- not for us, but for the next generation,” he added. The IEC campaign is part of a series of activities conducted by OPAPP for members of the region's security sector to further enhance their understanding and appreciation in the Bangsamoro peace process.

For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III urged hatchback drivers to substitute their units with vehicles that are compliant with its rules and regulations. Delgra said the drivers were given a transition period by the Board to be able to comply with its directive. “Hatchback is not allowed under the rules kasi maliit yung engine (their engines are small). It’s not up to the standards for what a taxi service and TNVS is. So as not to disrupt the service and in consideration of those hatchbacks at the time we allowed a transition for hatchbacks but only until after their franchises would expire,” Delgra told reporters on the sidelines of its hearing on the deactivation of TNVS drivers. The LTFRB has issued a memorandum last year allowing hatchbacks to operate only in Metro Manila with lower rates within a three-year transition period.

In a statement on Wednesday, Eddie Lazaro of ND Motor Piston and NOFELATO pointed out the need for further study of the proposal even though they are open to the idea of the city government experimenting with 100 units of the so-called Grab Trike Premium and that an ordinance for its implementation has to undergo public hearing. Lazaro’s statement came after an Italian company, which has partnered with Grab, a company engaged in transportation booking service via a mobile phone application, presented its proposal to the city government early this week. According to Lazaro, they also have to consider the future of the existing tricycle units once the booking service is already operational. Lazaro said drivers were told the single motorcycles can be used for “Grab Express” or “Grab Food” while the sidecars can be converted to scrap iron. In what City Hall had initially dubbed as “PediGrab”, the proposal is now named “Grab Trike Premium”, with the grab-a-trike system being proposed by Autohub Group, City Information Officer Dems Rey Demecillo. Autohub Group is a supplier of modern tricycles made in Italy, Demecillo added. Auto Italia general manager Luis Jose, who did the presentation before tricycle operators and the drivers association of Dumaguete at the city session hall on Monday explained his group has entered into an exclusive tie-up with Grab App for the proposed project in Dumaguete. “This is not just to modernize the tricycle sector in the city but to provide for a lucrative source of livelihood for trike drivers and a reliable transport solution for passengers because the design is intended for comfort and convenience of commuters,” he said. Under the scheme, grab drivers are provided with smartphones where commuters can communicate with the drivers, while other services include Grab Taxi, Grab Express, and Grab Car. When booked, the driver and the commuter will agree on the pick-up and drop-off points, the fare matrix of which is subject to approval by the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council), including the amount of the booking fee and the fare per kilometer thereafter. In an interview, incumbent councilor and vice mayor-elect Alan Gel Cordova, who chairs the committee on transportation in the city council, disclosed that the proposal is worth a try to make use of the technology where passengers and commuters can simply call a tricycle or get semi-chartered service using the application in the cellphone. As chairman of the committee on peace and order, Cordova said it will enhance the city's security because all the activities are recorded and reflected in the Grab system, including the face of the driver. It will also do away with part-time drivers or “extradors” and the “colorum” or illegal units. A financing scheme is being addressed even as the city is toying with the idea of subsidizing 25 percent of the cost of the 100 units, which is about PHP 4.5 million, while the supplier is to subsidize 5 percent.

The proposal is a partnership between Piaggo Ape and Grab. The latter is a company that engages in the popular taxi booking service in urban areas, such as Metro Manila and Cebu. Also on hand to listen to the presentation were barangay officials, officers, and members of associations of tricycle drivers and operations in Dumaguete.

The company’s requirement is to have at least 100 units operating in the city.Remollo told reporters that he and other city officials will discuss the possibility of allowing the company 100 franchises after an inventory of all the “pedicab” or tricycles for hire in Dumaguete. The mayor said he believes that the total number of “pedicabs” plying the city streets is less than 2,500 as other franchises may have already been retired. Previously, the city government stopped giving franchises to motorcabs-for-hire or “pedicabs” due to the more than 2,000 units still in operation. Miguelito L.

The management has started banning all white taxis at NAIA Terminal 1 since Monday, May 6. \"They (white taxi drivers) can drop off and pick up passengers at the departure area. However, they are not allowed to go there without carrying a passenger,\" MIAA Media Affairs Division head, Jess Martinez, told the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The two-minute loading and unloading policy should also be applied. Martinez clarified that this ban is still on a trial period. \"We'd give it a trial for two weeks. We want to balance out things so the riding public would not have a problem. Eventually, we would apply this (ban) at all terminals of NAIA,\" MIAA General Manager Ed Monreal told reporters. \"MIAA would like to see if accredited transport and other operators which have permits from MIAA, such as Grab and UBE Express, would be capable of servicing the transportation needs of the passengers. If we find this okay, then all white taxi queuing lanes at the four terminals will be eliminated,\" explained Consuelo Bungag, MIAA Public Affairs officer-in-charge.  Monreal, meanwhile, said incidents involving erring taxi drivers are recurring. Some of these drivers, he said, are using fake tariff rates that they claim were from MIAA and the Department of Tourism. Erring taxi driver apprehended Authorities on Wednesday apprehended the erring taxi driver reported by the two vloggers. He was identified as Jhumil Bule. Airport authorities coordinated with the operator and with Taytay PNP, that led to Bule's arrest. Monreal also suggested that Bule's driver's license must be surrendered to the Land Transportation Office for revocation.

The move was in compliance with the directive of the LTFRB to suspend the fees following its meeting with Grab and other TNCs on Tuesday. The Board has created a technical working group (TWG) composed of representatives from different TNCs to discuss passenger and driver cancellation policies. Grab implemented last April 29 a PHP50 cancellation fee that will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after five minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within five minutes for GrabCar and three minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival. A passenger’s account could be suspended for 24 hours if they cancel rides twice in an hour, thrice in a day or a total of five cancellations per week. Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they force passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. The ridesharing firm said the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. The policy was implemented on a staggered basis for both riders and passengers and is expected to be completed within this month. “We wish to clarify that while Grab has announced the intended implementation of passenger cancellation fees this month, no fees have yet been charged or collected, since actual implementation of the policy was set to start next week,” Hosaka said. Grab assured that it will continue to provide further updates as discussions with the LTFRB progress.

Jimenez is optimistic that the voters’ participation will be encouraging specifically with their partnership with the private company. “There is room to believe to be cautiously optimistic that we will have higher turns out than expected and in addition to that, of course the activation of voters when they ride Grab vehicles through this voter education campaign will drive up that number even more,” Jimenez said. “Marami sa mga botante na nagdedesisyon lamang na bumoto sila on election day (There will be a lot of people who will decide to vote on election day),\" Jimenez added. Comelec data shows that the voter turnout in the 2010 polls was 74 percent while it was 77 percent in the 2013 election. On the other hand, the #OneDestination campaign, a tie-up between the Comelec and Grab, aims to encourage Filipinos particularly registered voters to participate in the May 13 polls. Under the partnership, Grab will provide PHP50 discount to Metro Manila and Metro Cebu passengers when they go to the polling centers using the Grabshare discount code “ONEDESTINATION.” Selected Grab car units will also have car stickers and flyers to be distributed to their passengers. “As Grab, our role goes behind providing safe, seamless, and reliable services to our customers, but to also cultivate a sense of community and unity among our users. Through this campaign, we aim to inspire voter’s confidence and trust in the voting system, and move the Philippines forward to one destination, together,” said Brian Cu, president of Grab Philippines.

The ridesharing firm explained that the new policy aims to reduce unreasonable cancellations by both drivers and passengers. “Grab is mindful that cancellations are frustrating for both the passengers and our drivers. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that sometimes, cancellations are necessary during special situations. Our intention in implementing this new policy is to create a better ride-hailing ecosystem, where both passengers and drivers practice the responsible use of the Grab platform,” Grab President Brian Cu said in a statement on Monday. Starting Monday, a PHP 50 cancellation fee will be charged to passengers who cancel the ride after 5 minutes of getting assigned a driver and a PHP 50 no show-up fee if a passenger did not show up at the pick-up point within 5 minutes for GrabCar and 3 minutes for GrabShare upon the driver’s arrival.

Drivers will also be locked out of the platform for a temporary period of time if they forced passengers to cancel ride bookings without any reason and for being selective of passenger destinations. Grab clarified that fees will not be imposed for the following situations: - Passenger cancels within 5 minutes of getting an assigned driver. - The driver is not moving towards the pick-up point or going to the wrong direction. - Driver takes 15 minutes longer than the first estimated time of arrival. - The driver indicates that he/she has arrived when he/she has not.

There are good candidates out there deserving and should be the chosen leaders in the provinces or their cities, but because they fall victim to fake news, they don’t get elected,” PCOO media adviser Pia Roces-Morato said in a recent interview with Net 25’s program “Pambansang Almusal.” \"At the end of the day your public servants should be the leaders that you deserve, and you will be voting for the good ones. You should be voting for the good ones in this coming election without falling victim to fake news,” she added. Morato expressed hope that with the newest PCOO campaign, they will be able to explain to the public how to avoid being victimized by fake news and to distinguish misinformation from disinformation. “In misinformation, it happens to all of us, because us who are in the media industry, we write, we are exposed to everything we see on TV, on Facebook, and sometimes we create mistakes, but these mistakes can still be corrected and within our power to change it,” Morato explained. “On the other hand, disinformation is not accidental but is created on purpose. Those who spread disinformation do this for their gain, and it is the public who are most affected by it,” she added. For his part, Philippine Information Agency (PIA) Senior Director for Strategic Communications Benjie Felipe said those responsible for spreading disinformation are spending a considerable amount of money. “You can see that they are creating good content. The written content is believable because they are spending money on it,\" he said. Felipe said click bait contents have the power to grab the attention of the public easily as well as to influence and sway the public into believing false information. He advised the public to check the ‘About Us’ of the news to see the creator’s identity. He also warned the public not to “like” or “share” any information in social media without reading it first to prevent being a victim and, at the same time, a purveyor of disinformation and fake news. \"With this, we can control the spread of fake news. Especially, if we know its consequences,\" he said. PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar earlier urged voters not to allow fake news to ruin the chances of the candidates who can serve the country well. Andanar said if people will allow disinformation to prevail \"we are actually allowing ourselves to be cheated\" by unfair elections which basically destroys the democratic election process.

Gilbert Marin, provincial tourism officer, said Wednesday he expects an influx of domestic and foreign tourists on April 17, a day before the observance of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. He said the tradition and culture of Ilonggos “is one of the reasons why people love going to Iloilo.” “Tourists, especially foreigners, are amazed how religious Ilonggos are because we always keep our tradition. We love the tradition and our history,” Marin said in an interview. He said tourists visit Iloilo during Holy Week for Visita Iglesia, street processions, and the Way of the Cross, among others. Aside from the religious activities, tourists also grab the opportunity to relax with family and friends. “Holy Week is a good opportunity for the city dwellers to have the time to go out of the city and explore different places. Our beaches here in the province come alongside with the Visita Iglesia because families also stay and enjoy them during their visit,” he said. Iloilo will go with faith tourism being one of the main thrusts of the Department of Tourism (DOT) by promoting spots where tourists can reflect and contemplate, Marin said. The top spots to consider for recollection are the Garin Farm Inland Resort in Purok 2, San Joaquin and the Bucari Pine Forest in Sitio Tabionan, Barangay Bucari, Leon. Marin added that the PTO also gears to survey visitors arriving in the airports and those from the seaports for the Holy Week. The survey will reveal which activities attract tourists to Iloilo, he said. These past years, surveys during the Holy Week revealed that aside from religious activities, tourists came to explore the beaches and natural spots. Marin noted that the Lenten season is “expected to be among the biggest contributors in terms of tourist arrivals” because it coincides with summer.

Aside from voting for national candidates, voters in the NCR head to the polls to elect candidates who will lead each of the region’s 16 cities and lone municipality. Among the positions up for grabs in the local polls of the country’s political, economic and educational center are for Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilors and Member of the House of Representatives. For the 2019 polls, the campaign for local candidates officially started on March 29 and will end on May 11. Why it matters? More than just getting free stuff or better quality of service, voters are more concerned about local polls as their choice may either result in the continuity of programs or the implementation of new projects and policies which may affect their way of life as well as the regional economy. It will depend on who will make it to their respective city/municipal halls after the votes have been counted. Local elections are also known to be rowdier because candidates are often familiar with the people in their respective areas. This concept of “immediate community” enables them to form camps and gather supporters for their campaign. “There is more conflict and tension in the air - both physical and emotional - because every single candidate has his/her own rabid camp and followers who are more involved intensely, during this period. There is a probability of clashes amongst the local candidates and his/her followers,” National Capital Region Police Office chief, Maj. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said in a statement. Old-timers vs. ‘young blood’ In the capital city of Manila, it is a battle between two old officials and a young blood. Incumbent Mayor and former President Joseph Estrada is running for a third and last term against former mayor Alfredo Lim and former vice mayor and Department Social Welfare and Development Undersecretary Francisco Domagoso, also known as “Isko Moreno” during his stint as an actor. Estrada’s running mate, former fifth district Rep. Amado Bagatsing will attempt to snatch the vice mayor post from incumbent Maria Sheilah Lacuna-Pangan, the daughter of long-time city vice mayor Danilo Lacuna. In Pasig, Councilor Victor \"Vico\" Sotto is running for the city’s top post against incumbent Robert Eusebio, whose clan has been dominating city's political scene for years. Sotto, 29, the youngest councilor in Pasig, is currently the chairman of Pasig City's Public Relations and Information Committee. Meanwhile, vice mayor Christian Caruncho Bernardo is running unopposed. Familiar, powerful names Powerful names in majority of the cities of Metro Manila are vying to continue their rule. In Taguig, former congressman and movie director Lino Cayetano is running to take over the mayoral post from his sister-in-law, incumbent Lani Cayetano. Lani, meanwhile, is running for congresswoman of the city’s second district while her husband, former senator and Foreign Affairs secretary Alan Peter Cayetano is running for congressman of the city’s first district. Alan Peter, the running mate of President Rodrigo Duterte in the May 2016 presidential elections, is reportedly seeking a leadership role in the House of Representatives if he wins in the 2019 polls. In Makati, former mayor Jejomar Erwin “Junjun” Binay is challenging his sister, incumbent Mar-Len Abigail \"Abby\" Binay-Campos. They are both children of former Vice President and long-time city mayor Jejomar Binay, who is running for the city’s first congressional district. In Pasay, incumbent Mayor Antonino Calixto and his sister, Rep. Imelda Calixto-Rubiano will attempt to switch posts. Rubiano will face retired Manila Chief Prosecutor Edward Togonon and Cesar “Chet” Cuneta in the battle for the city’s top post.

Vincent \"Bingbong\" Crisologo and former congressman Ismael Mathay III. Belmonte is the daughter of long-time city mayor and former fourth district congressman and House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. For the city’s vice mayoralty race, it will be a battle between Councilor Gian Sotto, lawyer Joseph Peter Sison and Councilor Roderick Paulate. In Malabon, incumbent Vice Mayor Jeannie Sandoval will go against incumbent Mayor Antolin Oreta III for the city’s top post. Meanwhile, Councilors Bernard dela Cruz and Maricar Torres are vying for the vice mayor post. No or few known challengers While local polls in many cities in the Metro are seen to be a battle of big names, some areas seem not to have prominent challengers to incumbent officials. In Las Piñas, incumbent Mayor Imelda Aguilar will try to keep her post against independent bets Luis Casimiro, Benjamin Gonzales and Conrado Miranda.

It will be the same case for Navotas as the battle for the city’s top posts is only between Rep. Tobias Tiangco and incumbent Vice Mayor Clint Nicolas Geronimo and their challengers Councilor Dan Israel Ang and Raymond Emil Cruz. Tiangco will seek to replace his brother John Rey, the city's incumbent Mayor.

Ka Louie, who claimed to be a member of the CPP in the National Capital Region for eight years before he decided to leave the group in 1990 to finish college, is now part of KADRE, a group of more than 300 former members of the CPP-NPA. Later on, he became a professor in a university where \"Ka Apol\" and \"Ka Czes\" became his students. “Parehong matalino sina Ka Apol at Ka Czes at pareho rin silang miyembro ng Collective Unit. Si Apol ay Student Council Vice President habang si Czes naman ay (Both Ka Apol and Ka Czes were smart and were members of the Collective Unit. Apol is a Student Council Vice President while Czes is a) Political Science Society President,” Ka Louie said. He, together with the other youth members of the communist terrorist group, advised Ka Apol to focus on his studies first and not to accept NPA’s invitation to become a political officer of the group in Rizal and enter rural integration. “Palubog na ang kilusan at papunta na sa pagiging gangsterismo. Naniwala si Czes at tinapos niya ang kanyang pag-aaral at nagtapos ng may dangal pero si Apol ay piniling mamundok (The group is sinking and already leaning to gangsterism. Czes believed and finished his studies with dignity while Apol chose to stay in the mountains),” he added. With his determination to improve the status of his family, Ka Czes finished college and is now the head executive assistant of a senator while studying law. Meanwhile, Ka Apol died in a bloody encounter between members of an NPA unit in Tanay, Rizal and a private army of a politician. Ka Louie said ka Apol was tasked to grab the lands of “hacienderos” and politicians in the area. According to reports, he said, Ka Apol’s corpse was dragged by the politician’s army to the plaza to show the farmers that the NPA is not capable of giving them protection. Ka Apol’s corpse was then buried at the foot of Sierra Madre in Rizal. “Kung hindi napatay sa engkuwentro, malamang ay isang kapaki-pakinabang na mamamayan si Apol sa kasalukuyan. Malamang ay isa itong top executive at malaki ang naiaambag sa Pilipinas (If he didn’t die due to the encounter, Apol could have been a productive citizen now. He may now be a top executive with a lot of contributions to the Philippines),” Ka Louie said. Ka Apol, he said, is just among the many young Filipinos whose lives were wasted after joining the \"failed rebellion.\" In March 2018, six alleged communist rebels — among them 21-year-old Myles Albasin, a Mass Communication graduate of UP Cebu — were captured following an encounter with government personnel in Negros Oriental province. In February this year, John Carlo Capistrano Alberto, a student of the University of the Philippines - Los Banos, reportedy an NPA member, died in a clash with government troops in Laguna province. The military, meanwhile, said it will heighten its security in preparation to the forthcoming 50th founding anniversary of the NPA. The CPP founded the NPA on March 29, 1969.

General Noel Clement, said his command fully supports localized peace talks. Clement said Centcom will now start to work with other government agencies in directly engaging with the CNTs in a localized dialogue to give them a chance at a new life. “The Central Command, along with other government agencies will strongly pursue the localized peace talks. This is to show that the government is sincere towards the attainment of a just and lasting peace,” Clement said in a statement sent to the Philippine News Agency (PNA). He added, that localized peace talks “will serve as an avenue for the CNT members to negotiate directly and receive assistance from the government.” Through direct negotiations with them, he said that the government will be able to directly address the problems, “thereby justly and objectively terminating the irrelevant NDF-schemed peace process.” The commander of Centcom said he believes that “finally putting an end to the longstanding armed conflict in the country” can only be attained through a focused dialogue that is limited to specific issues rather than a generalized approach. “We have the strong support of the local government units and agencies.

In a statement on Friday, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said Go Jek’s local subsidiary, Velox Philippines, violated the provision under the 1987 Constitution - which states that companies in the country should be 60 percent owned by Filipinos. “We need to follow the 60-40 requirement of the law for TNCs to operate in the country,” Delgra said. The Board affirmed the decision of its pre-accreditation committee, which denied the application of Velox Philippines. The committee noted that only 20.4 percent of the 1.2 billion common shares of Velox Philippines’ parent company, Velox South-East Asia Holdings Pte. Ltd. was actually sold to local shareholder Pace Crimson Ventures Corporation (PCVC) based on its Deed of Absolute Sale of Shares of Stock. The LTFRB said Velox Philippines has failed to show proof of payment of its capital gains tax on the shares allegedly sold, and proof of payment of shares allegedly subscribed by the PCVC under its subscription agreement. The Department of Transportation (DOTr), meanwhile, said it did not interfere in the accreditation process of Go-Jek. “The DOTr does not intervene with the decision of the LTFRB during that phase of deliberation. If Velox Philippines wishes to appeal, they can do so before the DOTr, through the Franchising Review Staff,” Undersecretary for Road Transport Mark de Leon said. Go-Jek is a technology start-up firm based in Jakarta, Indonesia that specializes in ride-hailing and logistics. It currently operates in Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand. The company, which counts Google and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings among its investors, has been expanding in Southeast Asia to compete with Grab, which took over the regional businesses of Uber Technologies last year.

Manila Water, which gets its supply from La Mesa Dam, on Monday said the water elevation of the dam has dropped to 68.93 as of 6 a.m. on Monday. This is lower than the recorded 69.02 meter level on Sunday. It added that the figure is at a critical level as most businesses and households in Metro Manila depend on the dam's water supply. Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) hydrologist Richard Orendain said the normal water level at La Mesa Dam is 79.30 to 79.60 meters while its normal high level is at 80.50 meters. \"If nothing's done to conserve La Mesa's reserve, water level there can dip to about 65 meters or 66 meters by April 2019's end,\" he said, adding that the projection is below La Mesa's lowest 2018 water level of 70.16 meters on June 6 last year. He also advised the public to conserve water to ensure that the dam's water would be available for a longer period of time. Jeric Sevilla, Manila Water head for corporate communications, said normal flow of water supply may be felt by residents beginning Tuesday as the agency's technical teams continue to work on the improvement of its water supply system. \"Ang mangyari po noon hindi lang sa Mandaluyong, kung hindi para po sa lahat ng lugar.

Panelo said Colmenares only challenged him to attract media attention and improve his chances of winning a seat in the Senate. “Challenging a publicly visible government official to a debate attracts media attention. Surely Mr. Neri Colmenares knows how to grab at a media op to improve on his fledgling candidacy,” Panelo said in a statement. Panelo, however, said that he had more important concerns to prioritize than respond to Colmenares’ challenge. “He should be commended for that but I have better things to do than to provide him the forum he desperately needs,” Panelo said. Colmenares, former Bayan Muna representative, earlier claimed the USD62-million deal on the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, an irrigation project in the Cordillera, favored China. Panelo emphasized that the Palace and government’s economic managers have already responded to Colmenares’ questions, but he could always go to courts if he felt the responses were lacking. “The issues he raised in the Chico River Pump Project have been squarely and adequately responded to by the economic managers as well as by this representation,” Panelo said. “If he is not satisfied with our responses, he is free to go to the courts, as his usual style for media mileage, and we will be happy to oblige him there,” he added. Previously, Panelo dismissed Colmenares’ allegations that the Philippines-China loan agreement for the Chico River pump project was “one-sided”. Panelo noted that the project is beneficial to Filipinos because it will provide a stable supply of water to around 8,700 hectares of agricultural land, benefit 4,350 farmers and their families, and serve 21 barangays in the provinces of Kalinga and Cagayan in Northern Luzon once completed. He also assured that the agreement had gone through proper procedures since it was reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the Interagency Committee composed of the Department of Justice, the Department of Finance and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

Also with the ever changing environment where technological innovations are fast emerging, the PNP must be able to keep in step with the changing times,” Albayalde said. It has been noted that drivers and passengers of transport network companies fall victims to robbery, assault, and carnapping. “Equipping PNP-HPG troopers with the right training and equipment will help curb these incidents from happening.

Carl Cruz put the Aces back up with a layup with 4:14 remaining, but Allein Maliksi buried a triple to put the Elite ahead, 93-92, with 3:41 left. Cruz scored another layup to bring Alaska back at the driver’s seat, 94-93, with 2:49 to go, but four straight free throws, two from Maliksi and the other two from James Sena, brought Blackwater back on top, 97-94, with 2:15 to play.

Roi Sumang found an opening inside the lane and went for a quick layup attempt, leading to a split from the free throw line off a foul from Thoss with 30 seconds left. The Elite got another chance to at least force overtime as Ping Exciminiano missed a three-point attempt that could have put away the game, but Maliksi failed to grab the defensive rebound and the ball sailed out of bounds.

In his sponsorship speech for Senate Bill 2198, Sotto said the proposal is not anti-poor, contrary to the claims of some critics, since children in poor families would be taken into state custody to protect their interests when parents are unable to do so. Sotto cited the principle of parens patriae (parent of the nation), wherein the state acts as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection. “This proposal is pro-poor since children in poor families do not have access to quality education and are being exposed to violence in their own family and communities. The government, through the principle of parens patriae, is stepping in to provide these children with education and training,” Sotto said. “Their parents failed to attend to the needs of their children and the government, with the proper implementation of the law, will be able to rehabilitate and provide better future for these children as responsible members of the society upon their reintegration,” he added. He said lowering the age threshold to 12 years old simply means that the government and the state can intervene in conflict situations involving its young citizens, with the end in view of providing them guidance and a chance at reformation. “We need to snatch our young with force from the snare of the criminal syndicates. We need to seize them from entrapment in the dens of felony and transgression. We need to grab them from the arms of lawlessness and delinquency,” Sotto said. “Only if we are able to reclaim, seize and grab them now from the paws of gangs and syndicates can we ever hope to rehabilitate our young offenders and prevent them from falling into the abyss of crime,” he added. Meanwhile, Senator Richard Gordon, chair of the Senate justice committee, said the objective of the proposal is to prepare children to be hardworking, honest, accountable, worthy and successful citizens of the country. “It is never too early to teach our children accountability, responsibility, respect for the common good, honesty, integrity, and service to the nation,” Gordon said. While arguing that children should be held accountable for offenses, Gordon stressed that no child will go to jail or a detention center. The bill proposes that “a child below 12 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense shall be exempt from liability. However, the child shall be subjected to an intervention program pursuant to this Act.” \"A child 12 years of age and above but below 18 years of age shall likewise be exempt from liability and be subjected to an intervention program, unless the child has acted with discernment, in which case such child shall be subjected to the appropriate proceedings in accordance with this Act,” the bill reads. Those who commit a serious crime would be sent to Juvenile Reformatory Centers, also called \"Bahay Pag-asa\", it added. These serious crimes involve parricide, murder, infanticide, kidnapping, serious illegal detention where the victim is killed or raped; robbery with homicide or rape, destructive arson, rape; or carnapping, where the driver or occupant is killed or raped, or offenses under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 that are punishable by more than 12 years in prison. The Department of Social Welfare and Development will be responsible for building, funding and operating “Bahay Pag-asa,” the allocations for which will be included in the budget of the DSWD in the annual General Appropriations Act. Children who do not pose a risk to the community may be allowed to attend schools outside the Bahay Pag-asa, the proposal stated. They could be released to their parents, foster parents or guardians only on order of the court and after a comprehensive study conducted by the local DSWD officer. The bill also stated that children below the age of criminal responsibility, in consultation with local DSWD officer, should be released to the custody of his/her parents, guardians or nearest relative.

Although not all solid wastes were removed during the three-hour cleanup, organizers said they are happy with the outcome. “At least we’re able to raise awareness on the value of cleaning our bays and waterways. This is in support to the program of President Rodrigo Duterte to rehabilitate the polluted bodies of water,” said An Waray founder Bem Noel, one of the event organizers. The group invited some residents living near the bay and creek, including children, who volunteered to collect debris and garbage. \"It's heart-warming to see the kids who approach you to ask for garbage bags because they too wanted to join in cleaning their surroundings. This is uplifting because we were able to raise consciousness to these young minds,\" Noel said. The activity collected at least five truckloads of garbage. Joining the drive were the Maritime Group of the Philippine National Police, Sangyaw Foundation Incorporated, Rotary Club of Ormoc Bay, San Juanico Eagles Club, Boy Scout of the Philippines, Tau Gamma Sigma members, students of Eastern Visayas State Universities, Carigara School of Fisheries Alumni Association members, villages officials and An Waray party-list volunteers. Mangon-bangon creek is a vital body of water in the city that traverses 13 villages. It drains to Panalaron Bay where the public market, fish port, and other big establishments discharge untreated wastewater into the bay. An Waray installed a biofence, made up containers to stop trash from Mangon-bangon creek to enter the bay. “Trashes will be easily collected with the use of biofence and will no longer end up at the bay,” Noel said. The group also distributed 20 plastic drums to villages along Mangon-bangon and Panalaron Bay that will be used as trash cans. “This may not totally solve the garbage problem, but I hope that when the citizenry sees these garbage bins, they will use it in disposing of their trash to avoid and prevent it from polluting the bodies of water,” Noel said. “We are also looking at the possibility of acquiring oil fence that we will distribute to local government units with rivers,” he added. Oil fence, also called a containment boom, is a temporary floating barrier used to contain an oil spill and also used to reduce the possibility of polluting shorelines and other resources and to help make recovery easier. Noel hopes that people in communities along waterways will be responsible enough to take care of their environment and stop throwing pieces of trash in waterways and sea. “It is not only protecting the environment, but it will also protect them and their children who love swimming. The only way to ensure they are safe is when we clean our environment. It is also convenient for them if their environment smells clean and good,” Noel added. Tacloban city information officer Maria Lumen Tabao said the city government supports the initiative of cleaning the bay and creek. Tabao added that the Fishery Law Enforcement Team (FLET) regularly cleans the Panalaron Bay but there are still irresponsible people who keep on throwing their trash anywhere that ends up at sea. “Villages along the waterways and coastline should also help in cleaning the bay by starting it within their communities, avoiding throwing their trash at Mangon-bangon creek so that it will not pollute the sea,” Tabao added. She added that offices at the city hall which includes FLET and the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office agreed to take turns in cleaning Panalaron Bay. Eastern Visayas Tourism Association public information officer Rhoel Ladera suggested that to sustain the cleanliness of waterways and bodies of water in Tacloban, the activity should be done regularly. “Why don’t we elevate this to a higher level? I mean like make this a regular activity for different groups whole-year round rather than just a one-time, big-time or yearly coastal cleanup from few groups,” Ladera said. He added that the big companies operating in the city may also grab the opportunity in joining the regular clean-up drive by making it part of their corporate social responsibility.

PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said the commission was able to monitor violations of Grab with its pricing commitments over the period from August 10 to November 10 last year. “The monitoring team of the PCC found that there were certain inconsistencies and inaccuracies with the data that was provided as it relates to the price monitoring commitment. Suffice it to say that this prevented the monitor and the PCC monitoring team from carrying out its review of the pricing commitments in an effective way, which results in an unbiased and credible outcome. In that sense, we’ve thought that reviewing the undertaking of Grab, this ran counter to specific procedures of that undertaking,” Bernabe said. The PCC has approved the acquisition of Uber by Grab on Aug. 10, 2018 following the submission of the voluntary commitments by the ride-hailing company. Its voluntary commitments include the improvement of the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates, which existed before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall likewise not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares that are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The PCC has appointed United Kingdom-based auditing firm Smith & Williamson to monitor the compliance of Grab with its voluntary commitments on a quarterly basis for a period of one year. The commission also slapped a PHP16-million penalty on Grab last October for violating the interim measures it has imposed during the review period of their deal with Uber. Meanwhile, Grab said it will file a motion for reconsideration against the fine imposed by the PCC. In its statement, the firm said it wants to determine the rationale for PCC to impose the maximum penalty. “We assure our passengers that we are charging fares within the range as allowed by the LTFRB,” Grab said in the statement. The PCC issued the fine against Grab last January 22 with the company receiving the notice on January 23. Grab has to submit the necessary data within five days of the receipt of order, which will be on January 28. The firm has until February 7 to file its motion for reconsideration on the imposed penalty.

DILG-8 Assistant Director Valente Bajet said the intention was to promote the use of the “Go bag” as part of disaster preparedness, among the office’s 300 personnel and does not refer to any person. “The procurement has started last year, but it was only delivered to us recently. It just happened that we are on election season and almost every activity is being linked to politics,” Bajet added. The “Go bag” or grab bag contains items one would need to survive for 72 hours, such as a first-aid kit, water bottle, whistle, blanket, radio, flashlight, resealable plastic envelope, and Swiss knife. According to the DILG, the term “Go bag” has been used for decades by different local and international organizations. The agency has been promoting the use of this kit since 2014 after Super Typhoon Yolanda ravaged the region and rendered thousands of families homeless and without food. DILG-8 Director Artemio Caneja asked his staff to delete the social media post on Tuesday night to stop speculations. The distribution of the bags began on January 14.

Richard Garin and Guimbal town mayor Oscar Garin are now in hot water after they allegedly mauled and threatened a police officer assigned at local police Station in Guimbal, Iloilo Wednesday early dawn. Police Officer 3 Federico Macaya, 41, of Brgy. Sambag, Jaro, Iloilo City, suffered injuries, including a bruise on his left eye after the incident which happened around 3:30 a.m. The incident reportedly happened after the congressman accused Macaya of convincing the minor victim of a commotion at the town plaza on December 22 not to file a case against the suspect, a son of the member of the Sangguniang Bayan on Guimbal. The victim, a son of an overseas Filipino worker (OFW), refused to file a case against the suspect to keep it from his parents who are working abroad, Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, Police Regional Office 6 (PRO6) director, said in a statement. “This made the Garins furious which led to the mauling of PO3 Macaya who was the investigator of the minor’s case,” he added. Macaya was called by Senior Insp. Antonio Monreal Jr., the town’s chief of police, to proceed to the town plaza and meet with the congressman and Guimbal Mayor Oscar Garin. When he arrived, the congressman ordered Monreal to disarm Macaya. Garin then grab Macaya’s handcuff and handcuffed the police. He then kicked the police officer several times, slapped him twice, and spat on his face. Not satisfied, Garin even fired a gun while Mayor Garin was watching and reportedly pointing a gun to Macaya, Bulalacao said. “I have talked to Congressman Garin over the phone regarding the matter and he already apologized for what he had done against my personnel. I accepted his apology but I could not bear how he degraded and humiliated our uniform and our profession as police officers. I could not imagine how a lowly PNP personnel in uniform was mauled helplessly,” Bulalacao said. He cited that what happened was an “affront to my leadership”. Upon receipt of the report, Bulalacao initially relieved Monreal “ for his non-action and his failure to arrest the Garins\" and cancelled the detail of two PNP security personnel of the congressman. Bulalacao said he will request the Department of the Interior and Local Government for the cancellation of the deputation of Mayor Garin so he will no longer have power or authority over the Guimbal police officers. He added that PRO6 will help Macaya file charges against the Garins. Bulalacao said the congressman will be slapped with cases of physical injuries, assault to persons in authority, alarm and scandal and grave coercion while a case of grave threats will be filed against Mayor Garin. “I have nothing personal against the Garins but I have grounds and responsibility to support my personnel and to protect and uplift the image of the police organization,” he said. The incident has been reported to Philippine National Police chief, Director General Oscar Albayalde, he added.

In a statement, Quezon City Rep. Winnie Castelo said the DOTr can issue a Department Order to allow Angkas’ ride-hailing operations in the same manner that transportation network companies (TNC) or transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab were allowed to do so. “A mere DO can suffice to lessen the suffering of the commuting public. DOTr should realize this. If they cannot provide efficient and reliable mass transportation system as they are mandated to do, they should at least be creative and use modern technology. We should not be technical and legalistic on this while millions of Filipinos are suffering from traffic and losing PHP2 billion in lost opportunities,” Castelo said. “DOTr can give its best Christmas gift to the suffering public by withdrawing its petition to the Supreme Court against Angkas,” Castelo added. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) earlier this month ordering Angkas to stop its operations. Castelo also noted that there are pending bills filed in Congress that would legalize motorcycles for hire. “This would take a lot of time because of the long legislative process. There are other ways to legalize it, to expedite its operations especially now that we are suffering from traffic congestion aggravated due to the holidays,” Castelo said. The DOTr has created a technical working group (TWG) that will review the issue of making motorcycles as a mode of public transport. In a statement on Friday, the DOTr said the TWG will consist of the DOTr, Land Transportation Office, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, Philippine National Police–Highway Patrol Group, Metro Manila Development Authority and representatives of the Senate, House of Representatives, commuter welfare groups, road safety advocates, motorcycle manufacturers, motorcycle organizations, and law schools. The TWG will conduct deliberations on various issues covering the capability of the motorcycles and drivers for public transport service which are: the types of motorcycles to be permitted; acceptable travel speed of motorcycles for hire; whether to allow the motorcycles on all roads or be limited only to secondary roads or areas not serviced by large vehicles such as buses or trucks; seat and helmet requirements and training for motorcycle bikers that will register as public utility vehicle drivers. The Supreme Court issued a TRO last December 5 against the decision of the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court to interfere with Angkas’ operations. It prevented the implementation of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carlos Valenzuela of Mandaluyong RTC Branch 213 last August in favor of Angkas, which prohibited the DOTr and LTFRB from apprehending Angkas bikers. Tugade has ordered the LTFRB to apprehend Angkas bikers, who deliberately defy the order of the high court. Angkas bikers and operators proven to have continued their service will be meted a PHP6,000 fine and to have their vehicles impounded for three months. They will also be blacklisted from securing a franchise from the LTFRB.

Albayalde said the police mobile strike forces were earlier deployed to 10 provinces in Eastern Visayas, Negros Island and Bicol region and have linked-up with their AFP counterparts in an active defense posture to strengthen community defenses against the New People's Army, the CPP's armed wing. He said the latest order of CPP founding chairman Joma Sison to the NPA exposed anew the culture of lies, deception and violence of the aging underground movement in its 50-year rebellion to grab power from government. \"The CPP/NPA has found a convenient excuse in the Congressional approval of the martial law extension in Mindanao as reason to stage further hostilities against government and civilian targets even as it earlier declared a farce five-day Yuletide ceasefire to trick government into reciprocating the CPP/NPA sham gesture of goodwill,\" the PNP chief said in a statement sent to reporters. \"We urge our people to maintain vigilance and not be intimidated by this vain attempt by the CPP/NPA to salvage its waning reputation and regain lost support of the masses that they continue to terrorize and oppress,\" he noted. Albayalde said that while the PNP maintains a stiff and decisive stance against the CPP/NPA, it is keeping the doors open to all rebels deceived by the false promise of a just society under communist rule, and now want to lead normal lives with their families. \"We gladly welcome them into the folds of the law to enjoy the blessings of democracy in a free state.

Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) chair and Administrator Wilma Eisma, meanwhile, said the taxi service will benefit the employees of more than 1,600 business locators in the free port. “Having Grab as a partner to drive Subic to become a smart city is truly a blessing. We share the same goal of providing convenience to Filipinos. GrabTaxi can make a difference in the lives of locals and tourists in Subic,” she said. Grab is now available in 12 cities across the country --Manila, Cebu, Davao, Pampanga, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Baguio, Bataan, Naga, Iloilo, Tacloban, and Subic.

Manuel Taytayon Jr., chief of Pasay City police’s Intelligence Section, in a shootout with a fugitive accused in the murder of a Grab driver in 2017. Albayalde and NCRPO head, Dir. Guillermo Eleazar, visited Taytayon's wake at the Veronica Memorial Chapel in Pasay City on Tuesday where his father, Manuel Sr., asked the PNP to conduct further investigation of the incident. \"We want to assure the family we will support, especially their doubts about the operation. We assured them there will be an investigation kung ano talaga ang nangyari doon sa (on what really happened during the) operation and the cause of the death of Senior Inspector Taytayon,” Albayalde told reporters. Taytayon’s father believed that there was a foul play in the incident, citing that his son had gunshot wounds at the back, which may indicate that he was possibly shot by another policeman involved in the operation. He added that all the firearms used by the cops during operation, as well the suspect’s guns, were already turned over for ballistic examinations. Based on initial examination conducted by the PNP Crime Laboratory, the two slugs recovered from Taytayon’s body matched with the firearms used by the suspect when he fired at arresting officers during the operation. He said there are two other bullet holes in Taytayon’s back but the slugs have yet to be recovered. Albayalde also noted the possibility that Taytayon pulled back and sought cover after the suspect fired at him. On Sunday, Taytayon led the operation against Marc Delemios, who was the main suspect in the killing of Gerardo Maquidato Jr., a “good samaritan” Grab driver in 2017. During his visit to the wake, Albayalde conferred the \"Medalya ng Kagalingan\" (Medal of Merit) to Taytayon. The \"Medalya ng Kagalingan\" is conferred to police officers \"for a single act of heroism or a series of heroic acts in a duty\". \"The PNP assures the orphaned family of PSI Taytayon of every possible assistance within our means if only to alleviate their suffering.

Cortez told Philippine News Agency (PNA) on Monday that the 20 growing entrepreneurs who completed the KMME program sessions in General Trias City, Cavite are now scaling up their businesses following the coaching and mentoring program sessions with experts and industry leaders. She said the batch was provided with a series of free mentoring sessions to assist small players scale up their businesses and contribute to economic growth and address issues of unemployment, job mismatches, and migration. DTI Calabarzon Regional Director Marilou Q. Toledo welcomed the empowered 20 MSEs mentees who undertook the modular training sessions with technical concepts, equipping them with the basic jargons and protocols in running a business. “I always emphasize that the world is our market because I want our micro, small, and medium enterprises to realize that opportunities for them are everywhere. Through KMME, we want to take our MSMEs to a whole new level of success and grab these opportunities as we envision them to be globally competitive,” said Toledo. According to Cortez, the lecture presentations and materials were simplified for effective comprehension as coaches and mentors provided actual examples and illustrations on the subject matter for the MSE mentees. She said that part of the program is the preparation and presentation of the Business Improvement Plan (BIP) to build the mentees’ confidence and provide them the avenue to showcase their planned improvement strategies entirely banked on their Business Model Canvas. “KMME taught me the value of knowing and loving my product. I learned that it is important to have continuous research and development to improve the product, to make sure to document everything that happens in your business, and to be open to critics and suggestions regarding your business,” said one of the KMME mentees Lea Resa Panganiban of David’s Faith Fruit Wine Manufacturing. Starting her business in 2014, Panganiban’s enterprise produces wine made from all-natural ingredients like the Insulin plant scientifically called “Costus igneus Nak” grown from the fertile soil of Tagaytay City. Another single mom entrepreneur, Delia “Dhel” Gambol of Dhelightful Creations ventured into bead jewelry-making by using up-cycled materials like tahong shells, river stones, mahogany fruit and fish scales. Despite her working single mom status, Dhel was challenged to explore various earning opportunities in sales, marketing, and tutoring while working full-time as an employee to earn sufficiently enough for their needs. Cortez also said the MSEs were challenged when the panel of evaluators tested the mentees' competencies and acquired entrepreneurial knowledge during the presentations of their business investment plans. The panel members were representatives from government, academe and private sectors such as DTI, Provincial Cooperative, Livelihood and Entrepreneurial Development Office (PCLEDO)-Cavite, VCargo Worldwide, Inter-Asia Bank, Windel Woodcraft, Delfa’s Food Product, Tokyo Tempura, Café Amadeo Development Cooperative, and the De La Salle-Dasmarinas. KMME mentees were graded based on the effectiveness of their presentations such as the organization, flow, time, and effectiveness to response to audience questions and comments, including their application of learning from the modules. During the evaluation program, Em Cruz of Take-away Sisig and Bea Belardo of Belardo Coffee Enterprise were chosen as Kalye Negosyo scholars by Tokyo Tempura President Jorge Wieneke III. Kalye Negosyo is the mentoring advocacy, which helps micro-entrepreneurs at the grassroots level become bigger and better entrepreneurs.

That’s why there is a need for coordination among the city officials. As far as this project is concerned, we support this,” the mayor said on Tuesday. Leonardia noted that it will be the first underpass in Western Visayas. The only other similar road project in the Visayas is in Cebu City. “This will also enhance our image, that we are a modern city. Infrastructure-wise, we are conducive for growth. It will attract investors once they see the city’s economy is vibrant. Still, in the end, it should benefit our people up to the grassroots,” he added. At present, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) is conducting a feasibility study on the proposed 625-meter underpass project following the request of Bacolod City Lone District Rep. Greg Gasataya. A team from the DPWH Bureau of Design, headed by Director Lea Delfinado, along with the group of consultant United Technologies Consolidated Partnership, presented the proposed project to Leonardia and Gasataya in Bacolod last November 8. The mayor said that in preparation for the construction of the underpass, the city government is planning to construct a road at the end of Narra Street to provide another outlet towards the Circumferential Road. The DPWH team will return to Bacolod to hold a consultation once the feasibility study is completed in February next year. Meanwhile, Leonardia said a “different type of flyover” is still being considered along the Burgos Street-Circumferential Road area to further address traffic on the east side.

An anti-epal ordinance was approved in Ilocos Norte last May and is now under strict implementation in the province. Under the ordinance, all concerned authorities are given six months to comply with it. Violators of the anti-epal ordinance will be slapped with six months to one-year imprisonment and a fine of PHP5,000. While members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan conducted their out-of-capitol session in Bacarra town on Monday, Mayor Nicomedes dela Cruz sought clarification on the specific coverage of the ordinance. “We are very much willing to implement the said ordinance, but I am afraid of being charged with abuse of authority once we demolished these signages,” dela Cruz said. Provincial Board member Vicentito Lazo, the main proponent of the ordinance, explained that epal posters using government funds are very visible in public roads, bridges, schools, and welcome arcs, including government-owned vehicles. “It’s hard to implement but if we don’t do it, who else will?\" Lazo said, stressing that it is \"immoral\" for a person to put his or her name or photo on a project that actually used taxpayers' money. “If we put on cost on the various epal signages and put them all together, we can build a road out of it,” he added, expressing dismay on the continuing display of \"epal\" signages in the province.

Duterte urged the energy distribution cooperative in Palawan to improve the province’s power situation or else he would expropriate its franchise and sell it to “major players” who can do it.","body":"MANILA -- President Rodrigo R. Duterte urged the energy distribution cooperative in Palawan to improve the province’s power situation or else he would expropriate its franchise and sell it to “major players” who can do it. The President gave the ultimatum Saturday to the Palawan Electric Cooperative (Paleco) and provincial government officials led by Mayor Lucilo Bayron and Governor Jose Alvarez during a visit here to join the Subaraw Biodiversity Festival 2018, in line with the commemoration of the “Puerto Princesa Underground River (PPUR) Day.” “I hold nothing against cooperatives, they are pioneering spirits. But on the extreme, maybe, I will give you about towards the end of the year [to have] a new set up that would provide enough energy so that it can operate and it can move. You have to upgrade your source of energy. Kung hindi, ang gagawin ko maghahanap ako ng may pera talaga – China, nangangati ang kamay nyan just to get hold of developments here (If not, what I will do is I will look for a [power player] with money – China, its hands are just itching to get hold of developments here),” he said. Duterte made this remark while lamenting Palawan’s power supply crisis causing frequent power outages. “Yung inyong sitwasyon dito, yung inyong ilaw dito (Your situation here, your lights here) at this late of the date of development in the country, may brownout kayo na (you experience brownouts) six to eight hours--that is not acceptable to me,” Duterte said. “Kung walang power, walang gumagalaw, walang produkto (If there’s no power, there’s no one working, there’s no products). That is the problem. I will simplify it for you,” he added. Duterte said he would buy out cooperatives and allow major players to improve the province’s power situation, noting that the long-term power outages can be very critical to the progress and growth of the whole province and the everyday lives of occupants. “I will expropriate your franchise. Bilihin ko ‘yan at a valuation that is fair – just compensation. Kung ganoon [lagi] dito… to end this impasse, i-expropriate ko yan, pabayaran ‘yang cooperative then ipabigay ko sa mag-o-operate na bago. If you want, may mga major players. I don’t care kung sino. Marami ‘yan sila, may [mga] partners. Gusto ninyo? (I will buy it at a valuation that is fair – just compensation. If it’s always like this her… to end this impasse, I will expropriate it, I will have the cooperative paid then I will have it be given to a new operator. If you want, there are major players. I don’t care who. There are many there, they have partners. Would you like it?),” he said. He added that he will not seize Paleco just to grab hold of it as a business, but the city and the province need to develop with the help of reliable power service. If it can provide the energy requirement that is needed before the end of the year, then he will not interfere. “Either you do it or I will do it for you. I will expropriate. There are basic powers of government - police power, the power of taxation… power of eminent domain. If there is not enough money, you have to bring in help. If there is no relief in sight, better begin to talk to the people who can help us,” President Duterte pointed out. He told Bayron and Alvarez that he wants to sit with them in Malacañang to talk about the problem and help them find a solution. Puerto Princesa City and the whole province have been dealing with persistent power outages since early last year. Paleco, the distribution franchisee, has blamed the prolonged electricity disruptions on the failure of its independent power producers (IPPs) to upgrade their facilities to deliver reliable energy supply when the demand peaks. Based on the demand and supply for the Palawan main grid, the actual peak in the province as of October is 52.22 megawatts (MWs) opposed to the actual peak for the year in May which is 53.85 MWs and the forecasted 50.97 MWs.

Grab completed the transaction legally, and did not violate the interim measures order,” Lawyer Miguel Aguila, Grab's counsel, said in a statement. The ridesharing firm reiterated that its transaction with Uber was done in a legal manner and did not violate the PCC’s orders particularly the maintenance of independent operations and other conditions such as platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, among others, prior to the merger on March 25. “Grab and Uber operations in the Philippines remained separate and without any integration nor was there automatic transfer of passenger and drivers’ data. Grab did not take over Uber operations and did not do anything to violate the interim measures after it was put into effect,” Aguila added. He said Uber’s acquisition of an equity stake and board seat in the company was consummated prior to the issuance of the interim measures order. “The interim measures should be interpreted to apply prospectively and should not cover acts already consummated before its issuance,” Aguila said. He said Grab's fares and surge rates are within the minimum allowed fares set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Grab’s price algorithm, until the LTFRB suspended the time component in its fares, remained the same. The supposed increase in price was affected by the higher incidence of surge, which was driven by the low supply of vehicles and high concentration of demand,” Aguila said. Meanwhile, the PCC said it has yet to receive a copy of Grab’s motion for reconsideration. “To date, we have not yet received a copy of Grab’s motion for reconsideration. The parties have until October 29 within which to file their MR,” PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a text message to the Philippine News Agency (PNA). PCC, in its decision issued on October 11, imposed a fine of PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review and another PHP4-million fine for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period. Uber was also imposed a fine of PHP4 million for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review. The commission said both Uber and Grab violated two of its seven-interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction. The commission has approved the acquisition deal last August after Grab has submitted its voluntary commitments to the PCC which includes improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints.

And at least we can say that at least we are now 80 percent restoring the pristine beauty and original situation of Boracay Island,” DENR Undersecretary Jonaes Leones said in a Palace press briefing. Leones said the inter-agency task force, led by DENR, is ready to reopen Boracay on Oct. 26 with some safeguards now in place. “In terms of addressing major environmental problems in Boracay, we are optimistic and confident that these issues were already resolved by the inter-agency,” he said. He said visitors of Boracay will be allowed to swim only at the front beach and Puca beach. “In Bulabog, there are still problems there, the water quality. That’s why we will not allow tourists there,” Leones said. Meanwhile, Leones reminded tourists to book first with the compliant hotels before buying their plane tickets. He said the Department of Tourism has released a list of 115 hotels that complied with the requirements set by the inter-agency task force. Department of Transportation Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon said the island now has new transport system, which addresses complaints such as tricycles charging PHP100 to PHP150 pesos per trip. “We will be using an app where all the passengers will be able to pay their rides through wristband or tap card system,” de Leon said. “You don’t need to bring in your cash or you don’t need to haggle your fare with the drivers, just tap the card or the wristband. And it will solve a lot of problems, it will solve congestions,” he added. De Leon said the tap card or wristband can be used to ride around 500 e-trikes and 50 jeepneys that will operate on the island. He said ridesharing firm Grab, in coordination with a local cooperative, agreed to give free rides up to December. Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority Assistant Chief Operation Officer Nestor Domalanta said the expansion of the drainage system will be finished by the end of 2019. After the Boracay Island rehabilitation, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Assistant Secretary Jonathan Malaya said the government will also look into environmental law violations in other beach destinations of the country. “There have been a lot of reports already that other parts of the country, in particular beach destinations, are also having problems with compliance with local laws and environmental laws,” he said. Malaya particularly mentioned the famous El Nido in Palawan. He said DILG Secretary Eduardo Año has directed all their field officials nationwide to monitor the environmental compliance of all islands resorts and beach tourism destinations.

The ridesharing firm’s \"Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap\" will be rolling out safety features on its app such as driver fatigue monitoring system, emergency SOS features for drivers, ,driver and passenger validation system as well as data protection. “I am glad to say we’ve raised the bar for safety standards of the overall transport industry in the region. The Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap represents the next phase in strengthening the safety of the Grab platform,” Tan Hooi Ling, co-founder of Grab, said in a statement. The driver fatigue monitoring system will provide reminders based on how long a driver has been active without rest in between trips. Drivers will regularly receive reports on their driving patterns such as speeding, acceleration and braking. These will enable drivers to understand how they drive and where they can improve. The Share My Ride and Emergency SOS features will enable drivers to share their live location with their loved ones. Driver and passenger authentification as well as stringent background checks which include criminal records and inspections on dormant driver accounts will be conducted for transparency purposes. Grab will also be enhancing its in-app data privacy center enabling passengers to have more control over personal information for their safety and protection. The firm will also be coordinating with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs, identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations and ensure a drug-free workplace in transportation network companies. PDEA will be leading in the investigation, arrest and filing of drug cases and will be conducting seminars and trainings on drug prevention with the cooperation of LTFRB and Grab. Grab will hold road safety, anti-carnapping, anti-highway robbery and other anti-criminal seminars and training under the Grab Academy roadmap in partnership with the PNP-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG). It will also provide PNP-HPG with information related to criminal acts that may happen within the platform.

He said the company will also continue to provide promos to its riders for them to avail of lower fares, while performance-based incentives will be given to drivers based on higher acceptance rates of rides, lower cancellation rates and consistently following traffic rules, among others. To date, Grab implements a surge cap of 1.6x from the previous 2x after its PHP2-per-minute charge was reinstated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board last September. The ride-hailing firm said the lower surge rate seeks to help passengers adjust their transportation costs.

The anti-trust watchdog said the non-compliance of both companies has prejudiced its review process and impeded their ability to impose remedies for the benefit of the riding public. “This would include an order for them to revert to their pre-merger condition. We asked Uber to come back to the market and operate independently of Grab,” PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo said in a press briefing held in Makati City on Wednesday. “Given the challenges, it was really just more difficult to complete the review process. We required more information, we required more analysis, we required more meetings with the parties which would not have occurred if they were able to return to the pre-merger conditions,” she added. The fines imposed against Uber and Grab are broken down as follows: PHP8 million against Grab for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; PHP4 million against Uber for failure to maintain the pre-merger business conditions during the review; and PHP4 million for proceeding with the execution of their agreements during the review period In its resolution issued last Oct. 11, the PCC said Uber and Grab violated two of its seven interim measures it has imposed last April. These are maintaining independent business operations and other conditions (platforms, pricing and payment policies, incentives, promotions, database, onboarding of drivers, etc.) prior to the merger on March 25 and refraining from executing any final agreement or contract that will transfer any asset, equity, interest, including the assumption by Uber of a board seat in Grab. Other measures include: refrain from providing access between parties any confidential information (i.e. pricing, formulas, incentives, operations, marketing and sales policies, promotions, customer and driver database); refrain from imposing exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees to drivers; refrain from acts that may lead to reduced viability and saleability of businesses; refrain from acts that will prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies; and refrain from performing any act that may lead and/or further lead to the consummation of the transaction. The commission has approved the acquisition deal between Uber and Grab last August 10. This was made after Grab has submitted its voluntary commitments to the PCC which includes improving the quality of its service, particularly response time to rider complaints.

Davao City Police Office (DCPO) spokesperson, Senior Insp. Maria Theresita Gaspan, said suspect Rico Jay Lauron Labao tried to grab the firearm of PO1 Reggie Eleazo during a jail inspection at about 9:15 a.m. Labao had been detained at the Talomo police station since Sept. 24 for a case of rape and homicide. Police said Eleazo's firearm went off during the scuffle with the suspect. A bullet ricocheted off the wall and nearly hit SPO3 Richard Dionisio, the station's chief investigator. Dionisio said he shot Labao who managed to briefly take possession of his colleague's firearm before the latter could use the gun. Labao was declared dead on arrival at the Adventist Hospital in Bangkal. On Sept. 24, Labao reported to the police to have found the body of the victim who was strangled and tied with wire in a grassy portion in Matina Pangi, a week after she was reported missing by her parents. Police, however, found inconsistencies in Labao’s testimonies. Investigators said they later discovered pieces of evidence inside Labao's residence, such as wires similar to the one used to strangle the child.

Is it to grab and interpret either reality or fantasy and thus, rule over and suspend them? This is what probably happens to Bador Bandoy and the pedestrians who gather around him whenever he sketches fantastic figures and colors them at sidewalks in downtown Zamboanga City.  Aside from being a daily scenario here, Bandoy said his art is his source of livelihood. He likes to move around -- one day he’s here, the next day he’s at a different “studio”.  He would not qualify as master artist, as there is a kind of flatness and crudeness in his pieces, somewhat child-like in quality, which is probably why they are interestingly innocent, catchy, and dramatic.  Using color pens and bond paper, he likes to paint imaginary mosques. He also paints humans displaying fantastic features, strange-looking, even mythic animals -- dragons, sphinxes -- even fishes, birds, and so forth. He always carries with him folios of his works, each piece wedged in cellophane. He sells each copy for only PHP30 apiece. Often though, students “commission” him to draw pictures for them for their class assignment, and that’s how he gets to earn real-enough money.  You would also see a donation box, in case appreciative spectators like to donate a coin or two -- a practice by street artists in art-crazy cities like London and Paris.  Prolific as he is, Bandoy, now 56, has fathered 10 children, most of them now grown-ups, though he has young children who depend on him.  One of them, he shared, already died. He and his housebound wife and children live in a suburban barangay, while some of his older children live independently in other places in Mindanao.  Both his parents are dead -- his father is a Bisayan from Surigao, and his mother is a Muslim from Maguindanao. He was born and grew up in Jolo, virtually qualifying as a Tausug.  All his life, he said, he worked in odd jobs -- as a boat crewman, garbage collector, jeepney conductor, watch-your-car boy. Sometime in the past, his interest was caught by the doodling and drawings made by street children -- they are aplenty in Zamboanga -- hanging around the city’s sidewalks.  He tried his hand, and since two years ago he has been “professionally” living as a street-side artist. Life is tough for many, but for Bandoy, grizzled, graying and going around in rubber slippers with a quiet mien about him, it is probably as colorful, wonderful and easy as he makes it -- in his artworks.

Paul Rillorta, one of Baguio's sports development officers, said the city government is now crafting a city sports code which will encompass all the city's policies on sports to fill the needs of the local athletes and the city as a whole. “We are just polishing the document and looking at what else we could have missed, to make the sports code encompassing and responsive to the needs of the athletes, coaches, and the city government,” Rillorta told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in the vernacular on Friday. The code, he said, will also consolidate provisions of the existing sports ordinances of the city government. The final copy will be ready by December, Rillorta said. The sports code will include policies on the use of city-owned facilities, incentives, and awards for athletes representing the city in national and international competitions. It will also include the protection and aiding of the athletes and coaches. “This will be a useful document in guiding us all on improving grassroots sports and encouraging our youth to go into sports,\" Rillorta added. Rillorta said developing grassroots sports is vital, as this is how international athletes start. He cited, for instance, mixed martial arts world titlist Eduard Folayang, who used to be a contact sport athletic scholar of the University of the Cordilleras (UC). The same goes with Divine Wally, also a UC athlete, who has earned a name in World Wushu competitions, and Jordan Dominguez of Saint Louis University, who has earned a gold medal at the Taekwondo Poomsae at the recent Asian Games. Rillorta boasted of Team Lakay, Baguio's pride and the Philippines' top bunch of mixed martial arts athletes. Formed in 2003 by mixed martial artist Marquez Sangiao of Baguio, Team Lakay is composed of athletes and ordinary youngsters from the highland communities of Baguio who have tried to venture into mixed martial arts and are now making good names for themselves in the international sports arena. Among them are Joshua Pacio, Geje Eustaquio, Mark Sangiao, Ezra Sangiao, Stephen Loman, Danny Kiyad, Gina Iniong, and Honorio Batario. Rillorta also mentioned Baguio's first female world boxing titlist, Jujeth Nagaowa, who has fought for world titles for the International Female Boxers Association and the Women's International Boxing Association. “Grassroots sports is where international athletes come from. They start from there and later on conquer world titles,” the city's sports development officer said. Baguio bested 155 provinces in the country and emerged as the top medal hauler in the recently concluded “Batang Pinoy,” hosted by the city and the province of Benguet. The onslaught of Typhoon Ompong failed to dampen the participants' fighting spirit, though it moved the youth sports event's schedule from Sept. 15-21 to Sept. 17-21. Based on the official medal tally sent by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) on Sept. 27, Baguio, like in 2017, retained the top spot in this year's Batang Pinoy with an 85-81-104 (gold-silver-bronze) medal haul. Cebu City came in second, with 37-40-44 medals, followed by Laguna province (33-13-31), Quezon City (32-17-17), and Pangasinan (22-21-21). Combative sports like Arnis, Wushu, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo served as the city’s gold mine, producing 18, 13, 11, and 10 gold medals, respectively, and most of the silver and bronze awards. Judo and wrestling also contributed eight gold medals each. Baguio also won five golds in pencak silat, four in archery, two each in athletics and boxing, and one each in cycling, karate, swimming, and triathlon. Cash incentives ready City Ordinance 20-2016 or the “new sports incentives ordinance of the city of Baguio” provides that athletes representing the city in national competitions are entitled to cash incentives for bringing honor to the city. “Gold medalists in every event are entitled to receive PHP10,000, PHP5,000 for the silver medalist, and PHP3,000 for the bronze medalist,” Rillorta said. With 85 gold medals, 81 silver, and 104 bronze medals, the city government is ready to release PHP1,567,000 in incentives for the 270 medals won by Baguio athletes during the PSC-run “Batang Pinoy.” “We are proud of you, our athletes, for giving honor to our city and to all other athletes nationwide, who participated in the sports event for giving your best despite the inconvenience brought by Typhoon Ompong,” Mayor Mauricio Domogan said at the culmination of the Batang Pinoy 2018. The PSC also gives cash incentives to local governments that land on the top five spots in the competition. The overall champion will receive PHP3 million. The second to fifth placers will respectively get PHP2.5 million, PHP2 million, PHP1.5 million, and PHP1 million. More than 2,000 competitors from various localities in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao were marooned in the school classrooms that served as their billeting centers, when “Ompong” battered the city and the Cordillera region last Sept. 15. The city government, through its city sports development office, city social welfare development, and others, including private donors, ensured the participants' safety and convenience during the howler’s onslaught. City information officer Dexter See said the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) has announced that Baguio City will become one of the sports body’s accredited regional sports training centers, following the city’s successful hosting of the 2018 Batang Pinoy national championships. He said the information was relayed by PSC Commissioner Celia Kiram, who represented PSC chairman William “Butch” Ramirez during the event's closing program on Sept. 21. See said that according to Kiram, the decision was because of the city’s suitability as a venue for the conduct of high-altitude training for the country’s athletes. See said the national sports body had left PHP18 million worth of sports equipment in hosts Baguio and Benguet for the further training of local athletes for future representation in the local, regional, national, and even international sports competitions. The PSC has also turned over PHP8 million as the city’s cash reward for landing No. 2 in the Philippine National Games (PNG) in Cebu City in May 2018. The original cash reward was actually PHP4 million, but President Rodrigo Duterte doubled the PSC incentive, making it PHP8 million.

In an interview after the regular Monday flag raising ceremony, Mayor Jose Espinosa III said it was the first time for Iloilo City to vie for the award given by the Department of Education (DeEd) and it was able to grab the third spot. He expressed gratefulness to teachers who were behind the city’s success in garnering the award. “We owe this to our teachers,” he said. Based on data provided by the Iloilo City public information office, this highly urbanized city had a 98.2 percent literacy rate during the last literacy mapping. In its 2013-2019 Comprehensive Development Plan under the Social Development Sector, it outlined to “promote access to quality education for all”. Among its major programs are the Iloilo City Alternative System (ALS), Technical Institute of Iloilo City (TIIC), Iloilo City Community College (ICC) and  the KAhublagan sa BArangay para sa LApnagon nga Kahandaan (KABALAKA), which translates to Movement for Community-Based Disaster Preparedness. Kabalaka means “to care.” The ALS program has recorded 12,100 enrolled elementary and secondary students since 2014, posting the highest performance rating in Western Visayas. Based on data from the Division of Iloilo City, there were 680 passers of ALS Accreditation and Equivalency (A&E) Test in 2016; 688 passers in 2015; and 383 passers in 2014. In January this year, the ALS at the Iloilo City District Jail- Male Dorm (ICDJ-MD) of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) produced 71 graduates.

(IPM). Earlier, LLDA General Manager Jaime Medina vowed to “implement the full intent of the law” when he formally filed a complaint against IPM at the Office of the City Prosecutor in Taguig City last March 5. Based on the LLDA inspection conducted by LLDA engineers Angela Aquino and Bernadette Valle on Aug. 27, it was found that IPM had undertaken their construction project within the Laguna de Bay region without clearance from the LLDA. On June 28, the LLDA ordered the closure of two construction companies in Taguig City for multiple violations of environmental laws -- IPM and Level Up Construction. According to engineer Generoso Dungo, LLDA’s assistant general manager and head of the Shoreland Management Office, the assessment revealed that wastewater coming from the two firms is highly toxic and they lack a systematic transfer station and material recycling facility. “Halos wala po silang segregation, segregator, o kung ano mang machines. Ang nakita lang po namin, talagang illegally dina-dump po nila iyong mga basura (They don’t practice segregation, they don’t have a segregator or any machine. What we saw is that they were illegally dumping their trash),” Dungo said last June. But in a six-page resolution dated Aug. 29 and penned by Associate Justice Priscilla Baltazar-Padilla of the CA’s Special 14th Division, the court likewise barred LLDA General Manager Jaime Medina and other officers, agents, and staff “from interfering, dispossessing, and intruding” with IPM’s right over the property until the final resolution of the case. The case stemmed from a petition filed by IPM against LLDA after the state agency closed down and seized control of a 22-hectare property leased by the company for its garbage transfer station and materials recovery facility along C6 Road, Barangay Calzada, Taguig City. The LLDA, an attached agency of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said IPM, the authorized garbage contractor of Taguig City, is engaged in garbage dumping and illegal reclamation in the shores of Laguna de Bay. Such claim, however, is vehemently denied by the company. In a statement on Wednesday, IPM welcomed the CA’s injunction order. The company maintained that it has not violated and has faithfully complied with environmental laws, rules, and regulations. It added that the operation of its Materials Recovery Facility and Transfer Station is covered by required permits and licenses. “LLDA itself, in a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) issued on June 13, 2018, did not make any findings as to alleged dumping of garbage in the C6 area occupied by IPM. There is also no backfilling nor reclamation going on in IPM’s property,” the company said. The firm insisted that the LLDA cannot use the CDO as a cover to land-grab. “This is what LLDA did to IPM. Faced with an abusive show of force by LLDA when it took over, dispossessed and effectively deprived IPM of the pursuit of its lawful operations, the company simply availed of a remedy available to it under the law. Where else will IPM seek refuge against this act of LLDA except to resort to the courts?” the company pointed out. IPM said its CA petition puts the spotlight on whether LLDA has the power and authority to seize and take over IPM’s property. “IPM questioned LLDA’s jurisdiction because IPM’s leased property is titled under the Torrens System, which LLDA cannot collaterally attack by simply claiming that it is part of the shoreland and forcibly ousting IPM thereto. Thus, the CA correctly ruled that pending resolution of conflicting claims, the parties should maintain the status quo -- the last peaceable and uncontested status -- in this case, IPM being in peaceful possession of the C6 property,” the company added in its statement. Following the court ruling, IPM said LLDA, as a government agency, “should be the first to show respect to the Courts and faithfully comply with the CA’s lawful order.” (PR)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1047094","title":"LTFRB allows TNCs P2 per-minute charge ","date":" September 5, 2018, 6:42 pm","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has allowed all transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose a PHP2-per-minute charge to passengers as part of their fare structure.","body":"MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has allowed all transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose a PHP2-per-minute charge to passengers as part of their fare structure.

DO 2017-11 allows transportation network companies to have pre-arranged fares as authorized by the LTFRB. “Respondent imposed the travel time rate of PHP2 per minute on June 5, 2017, which was prior to the effectivity of the said Department Order. Thus, it is clear that another DO was needed to supersede DO 2015-11, absent the former, DO 2015-11 remains valid,” Lizada said. “Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,” she added. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of transportation network companies (TNCs) on Dec. 27, 2016.

LTFRB’s decision to open 10,000 new vehicle slots is a step in the right direction towards resolving the current lack of supply on the road but it’s not going to be enough. Replacing the inactive vehicles in the masterlist would be an additional measure that could go a long way in improving TNC service,” Leo Gonzales, Grab Public Affairs Head, said in a statement Tuesday. Currently, Grab receives an average of 600,000 passenger bookings daily but only 35,000 drivers are on the road to address the demand. Its allocation rate for ride bookings in Metro Manila is at 40 percent, which is the lowest in the Southeast Asian region. “Supply is struggling to meet the massive demand from the riding public and only the LTFRB has the authority to address this,” Gonzales said. “We urgently request the LTFRB to replace inactive vehicles with active vehicles ready to serve the riding public. We also appeal to the LTFRB to increase the common supply base to 80,000 vehicles (equivalent to 65,000 active vehicles) and review the demand quarterly consistent with their earlier pronouncements.

It has likewise ordered all TNVS units included in the master list provided by transportation network companies to submit their applications and to secure the necessary provisional authority on or before August 31.

Going by several names, the suspect was already booked and arrested here in 2014 by the name Alfred Mataya Culani, allegedly from Davao City. He was able to post bail. An initial police investigation revealed that the suspect took the handbag of one of 10 Chinese nationals having lunch at a restaurant along Flores Avenue. Another man, believed to be an accomplice of the suspect, appeared to have caused some distraction that gave “Culani” the opportunity to grab the handbag, said Supt. Jonathan Pineda, police chief of Dumaguete. The woman, however, quickly noticed that her bag was missing and screamed, prompting the suspects to flee, Pineda said. Waiters, security guards and civilians caught up with “Culani” and mauled him, just before responding policemen arrived at the scene. At the police station, the Chinese individuals pointed to him as the one who stole the bag, Pineda said. The city police chief believes that there are now other members of “Salisi Gang” in this city taking advantage of the bloated population due to the 117th Founders’ Day celebration of Silliman University. “Hindi siya mag-isa kasi pag ganun, ang salisi ay libangin ka, kunin yung attention mo tapos sa blind side nimo doon kukunin ang valuables mo (he’s not alone because the “salisi” modus involves one getting your attention while on your blind side, another will take your valuables),” Pineda explained. The man identified as “Culani”, who has few other aliases, has a warrant for his arrest, disclosed Pineda, based on verification of the police’s database. At the time of his arrest, the man had no credentials or any identification on him except a knife and a small pouch, which Supt. Pineda said had contained suspected shabu. Pineda is appealing to business establishments to be on the lookout for suspicious-looking persons, such as those just hanging out in restaurants without making any orders. He also urged the public to be extra-vigilant with their personal belongings.

Calo explained the region aims to have its own updated registry to help their MHOs, CHOs and PHOs in identifying qualified applicants of PWD IDs. “Kasi may mga lumalapit sa kanila sinasabi may disability daw sila na ganito na ganoon, tapos magagalit sila kapag hindi sila mabibigyan ng tulong, ng IDs dahil di naman sila disabled (Because there are people approaching them that they have this or that disability, then they’ll be mad if they’re not provided help, with IDs since they are not disabled),” she said. Calo added that there is a national registry for PWDs which is updated every ten years only but DOH Calabarzon wants to have its own registry which would be updated yearly. Calabarzon consists of the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon. Having an updated regional registry will give all PWDs in the area an opportunity to be included in the database, be classified under the correct disability category and receive appropriate benefits. “Sa pamamagitan nito, mahahanap lahat ng PWDs dahil hindi naman lahat naka-register sa NCDA (National Council for Disability Affairs) at maserbisyuhan ang lahat. Maaari din sila sadyain sa kanilang mga bahay (Through this all PWDs would be located since not all of them are registered in the NCDA and provide service for all. They could also be visited in their homes),” she said. Apart from updates on the national disability program, the regional MHOs, CHOs and PHOs were briefed on the proper categorization of disabilities regarding PWD card issuance, benefits and discounts for PWDs and an overview on national disability. NCDA Officer-in-Charge of Technical Cooperation Division Dandy Victa said only those who have communication, learning, orthopedic, physiological, psychological and visual disabilities are qualified to have a PWD card. Meanwhile, NCDA Project Evaluation Officer II Crisanto Perez discussed the many benefits and discounts PWDs are entitled to, saying they can have discounts on food, medicine, fare and other services. \"Kahit sa Grab makukuha ang discount kasi meron po silang (Even in Grab you can get a discount because they have a) system once you declare you're a PWD and they're able to verify it you can avail of the discount,\" Perez said. He said having a PWD ID card is important when PWDs want to avail full benefits. On the part of the businesses providing discounts to PWDs, the PWD ID cards enable them to prove their claim for tax exemption. Perez encouraged PWDs who have not applied for a PWD ID to accept their disability and to connect with relevant government agencies and support groups to know their rights. \"Tanggapin nila ang sarili nilang kapansanan para makuha nila ang benefits and privileges. Makukuha naman nila lahat ng impormasyon sa internet kung saang government agencies sila dapat lumapit tungkol sa mga karapatan nila in particular yung NCDA kung saan pwede sila mag-walk-in (They must accept their own disability so they can avail all the benefits and privileges. They can get all the information on the internet as to which government agencies they must approach about their rights in particular the NCDA where they can walk-in),\" he said. Calo said the orientation will be followed by the creation of registry with the help of DSWD and other partner government agencies which might take a month or a few months to complete.

The LTFRB has ordered all TNVS units included in the master list provided by transportation network companies to submit their applications and to secure the necessary provisional authority on or before August 31. Starting Aug. 24, the Board will accept the online registration of TNVS applications for new certificates of public convenience (CPC) not included in the master list through the LTFRB website. No application for TNVS franchises shall be received by the LTFRB unless the online registration is completed, including the date for the actual filing of the application. The Board has noted that there were fewer applications for new CPCs for TNVS despite its order for the resumption of their acceptance last March. The LTFRB prioritized applicants that were included in the master list submitted by Uber and Grab, which was the subject of an audit review during that time. “Despite the call for application, the Board has taken note of the fact that there have been fewer applications for new CPCs for the primary reason TNVS owners have been unable or unwilling to file applications,” the LTFRB said. To date, the LTFRB has received 21,878 TNVS applications for new CPCs, 13,816 units of which were issued with provisional authority and 4,925 were issued with CPC. Last February, the LTFRB issued a memorandum setting the common supply base for TNVS units at 66,750 units nationwide.

The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) continues on its dry-run of the traffic scheme. The scheme allows vehicles with two or more occupants with driver to traverse in Edsa from North Avenue in Quezon City to Magallanes in Makati City on both northbound and southbound directions from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. during weekdays. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the agency respects the view of the senators, who cited that it was crafted without consultation with various sectors and this might lead to heavy vehicular volume on alternate routes. “We respect the resolution. What we are trying to do is to convene the Metro Manila Council hopefully soon,” Garcia said in a TV interview Thursday. The MMC is the policy-making body of MMDA, consisting of the mayors of the 16 cities and a municipality in Metro Manila. Senate Resolution No. 845 urges the MMC and the MMDA to suspend the HOV scheme and look for long-term solutions to ease traffic in Metro Manila. The resolution pointed out that the driver-only ban would effectively deprive thousands of people of the use of the country’s major thoroughfare since it would be in effect during the working and commuting hours of the week. Garcia said traffic has eased in Edsa during the first day of the dry-run Wednesday. “Lumuwag ang Edsa. Napunta yung traffic sa mga alternate routes (Traffic eased on Edsa and was diverted to alternate routes),” he added. He reiterated that the scheme aims to encourage carpooling among motorists and is one of the short-term measures being implemented by the MMDA to improve the traffic situation in the metropolis. “HOV is not a band aid solution; it’s a short term measure while infrastructure projects are being constructed for the long term,” Garcia said. Data from the MMDA show that a total of 2,905 vehicles were monitored to have violated the HOV scheme through closed circuit television cameras under the no contact apprehension policy and handheld cameras of its enforcers on the ground Thursday morning. A total of 3,628 violators were flagged down during the first day of the dry-run on Wednesday. The MMDA is eyeing to purchase thermal cameras to effectively catch violators of the expanded HOV traffic scheme. Ridesharing firm Grab Philippines, meanwhile, urged its passengers to avoid setting pickup and dropoff points along Edsa. The company encourages its drivers to use the yellow lane and take the nearest exit away from Edsa if it is unavoidable to pass by without a passenger. “We ask our drivers and passengers to be patient as we work with the regulators to set an acceptable scheme that carefully considers sentiment and suggestions of our TNVS market,” Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said in a statement. Around 60-70 percent of vehicles that pass along Edsa have only single occupants, according to data from the MMDA. There are 367,738 vehicles traversing the major artery daily, 67 percent of which are private vehicles based on Edsa's annual average daily traffic in 2017.

This is after the PCC has finally approved the voluntary commitments submitted by Grab to the Commission. Balisacan said even with the approval of the deal, Grab will be subjected to monitoring for a minimum of six months. Among the voluntary commitments that have to be met by the TNC include improving the quality of its service by bringing back market averages for acceptance and cancellation rates before the merger happened, and its response time to rider complaints. Grab fares shall not have an “extraordinary deviation” from the minimum allowed fares, which are set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo mentioned that the “extraordinary deviation” should not be above 22 percentage points of the fare before the acquisition. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion, meantime, explained that this commitment to eliminate the “extraordinary deviation” on Grab fares aims to revert prices of ride within the pre-transaction level. According to Asuncion, if a Grab ride fare cost PHP100 before it acquired Uber surged to PHP180 for the same route after the transaction, prices should go back to more or less PHP100 or only up to PHP120. Grab likewise pledges for transparency by giving a fare breakdown per trip in its receipt that shall include distance, fare surges, discounts, promo reduction, and per-minute waiting charge. The TNC will also remove the “see destination” feature for drivers with low ride acceptance rate. The company shall also not introduce policies that will result in drivers and operators being exclusive to Grab, in order to allow them to register with other TNCs through a multi-homing scheme. PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe noted that these commitments shall be implemented starting Friday. The PCC will be monitoring Grab's compliance with its submitted voluntary commitments through a third party monitoring, he added. The third party monitoring will be nominated by Grab but will be chosen by the PCC. The third party monitoring shall also come up with a quarterly report to be submitted to the Commission, it was explained. But the monitoring expenses will be shouldered by Grab, which is expected to reach PHP12 million, covering a one-year period. PCC will subject Grab to fines of up to PHP2 million per breach of the conditions.

CHR-Negros Oriental provincial chief and special investigator Dr. Jess Cañete disclosed on Wednesday that he still has to get the affidavits of witnesses in the anti-illegal gambling raid - during which Salvador Moises, 48 years old, of Sitio Taysikan, Barangay Tayawan in Bayawan City was shot - before he summons the police officers in question to determine whether, indeed, the use of their guns was legitimate. Cañete said Moises had sought the help of the CHR after he and another person, identified as Benny Tribajo, were arrested during a raid at a “hantakan” or cara y cruz (coin game of head and tails) last July 29 at Sitio Dayhagan in Barangay Minaba, Bayawan City. According to the CHR official, Moises recounted to him in an interview late last week that he did not grab any firearm from policemen during the raid contrary to the claim of the police, and was surprised when he was shot at. The policemen brought Moises to the Bayawan District Hospital but he was referred to Dumaguete City for further treatment of his gunshot wound. Moises, who is currently recuperating at a hospital in the city, called the CHR local chief on Tuesday afternoon, saying that some policemen were securing him, Cañete disclosed. He said when he spoke to the lawmen over the phone, he asked why they were securing Moises and they replied that the latter was under arrest and facing charges for violation of Presidential Decree 1602 (Prescribing Stiffer Penalties on Anti-illegal Gambling). “Tungod atong na apil na sya sa raid, mao nga gidakop siya karon ug wala pa gani nakagawas sa ospital kay wala pa nakabayad (Because of that raid, Moises was placed under arrest and could not be discharged from the hospital yet as he still has unpaid bills),” Cañete disclosed. While not concerned with Moises’ arrest and the filing of a case against him, Dr. Cañete said: “I am more concerned with the aspect on the allegation nga niaksyon sya ug ilog sa armas (that he grabbed the firearm) of the arresting police officer.” “What I am looking into are the circumstances behind the shooting of Moises because it appears that he was shot from the back,” Cañete pointed out. The fact that someone was shot during that raid, “the burden of proof will now shift from the victim to the police officers to prove nga ang ilang gihimo (that’s what they did) was in defense of whatever justification kay naa may napusilan (because somebody has been shot),” he said. And since shots were fired and somebody was hit, “ilang burden na karon pag prubar nga proper ang ilang paggamit sa armas (it is their burden now to prove that the use of their firearms was proper),” he added. Dr. Cañete said he will have to go to Bayawan City to talk to the witnesses and get their statements as well to secure a copy of the medical certificate of the injured Moises prior to moving forward with the investigation.

Under the policy, vehicles with two or more occupants, including the driver, would be able to pass through Edsa using the special lane. “Sa usapin po ng guidelines, implementing rules and regulations at penalties, ano 'yung rush hours mga oras na kung kailan bawal, paano ma-monitor ang mga heavily tinted vehicles, wala pa po kaming maisasagot dahil tinatapos po namin 'yung guidelines na mag-fit po sa lahat ng sektor (On the matter of guidelines, implementing rules and regulations as well as penalties, what are the rush hours and what time vehicles are not allowed, how to monitor heavily tinted vehicles, we cannot yet answer that at the moment as we are still crafting guidelines that would fit all sectors),” MMDA Spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a television interview Wednesday. The MMDA hopes the HOVL would encourage carpooling among motorists to further ease the traffic situation in Metro Manila. “'Yung mga guidelines kailangan pa pag-meetingan at i-submit for consultation. Hintayin ninyo po muna ang guidelines. Magkakaroon pa po ng dry run at publication within 15 days before implementation (The guidelines are yet to be deliberated and submitted for consultation. Let us wait for them. A dry run will be conducted and these guidelines will be published within 15 days before implementation),” Pialago added.

We will include your TNVS leaders in the discussions to make sure that your concerns will be well represented,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement. Other countries like Indonesia have the same policy and Grab has found a way to make it work, Cu said. He assured Grab's drivers and operators that they “will do (their) best to also make it work here.” The MMDA had proposed the HOVL last year to reduce vehicular volume along Edsa. Vehicles with at least two or more passengers were allowed to pass through Edsa using the fifth and leftmost lanes. A dry-run was conducted in December last year to test the feasibility of the scheme but the MMDA later decided to cancel its implementation as its traffic enforcers were having difficulty inspecting heavily-tinted vehicles.

Grab said the per minute rate was in accordance with Department Order 2015-011 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) which allows transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose their own fare rates subject to the oversight of the LTFRB. “DO 2015-011 shall be considered valid until it is set aside with finality in an appropriate case by a competent court,” the firm said in its motion for reconsideration which was filed on July 19 and released to the media late Monday. “As such, when respondent began imposing the assailed PHP2 per minute fare on June 5, 2017 to ensure that its hardworking TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) drivers would still be able to make ends meet despite the worsening traffic conditions, respondent did so in good faith and pursuant to prevailing government issuances at the time,” it added. The DOTr has issued DO 2018-013 last June authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. DO 2017-11 which was issued by the department on June 19, 2017 allows TNCs to have a pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB. “Any issuance by this Honorable Board which would ultimately determine the fare that may be charged by TNCs and TNVS should only be applied prospectively and should not prejudice respondent for relying on a valid and subsisting DO 2015-011,” according to Grab. The company further said that it has informed the Board of its fare structure which includes the per-minute charge. “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,\" the firm further said. MyTaxi.PH is the registered company of Grab in the country. The LTFRB said in its order that the fine shall be reimbursed through rebates that will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier. The amount of the rebate is limited to the portion of the income of Grab which is directly related to the PHP2-per minute charge during the period of its imposition. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any per minute rate when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flag down rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges.

The Zambales Mayors’ League (ZML), headed by its president and San Antonio Mayor Estela Antipolo, believes the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) expansion plan would result in more employment opportunities and community development for the province. “On the part of the Mayors’ League, we are here to support SBMA’s programs,” San Felipe town Mayor Carolyn Fariñas said during their meeting Thursday with SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma. “We are really excited to hear SBMA Chairman Eisma’s pronouncements that she is moving to expand the area and jurisdiction of the Subic Freeport. We can see that she is seriously working to put more businesses further up north in Zambales,” Fariñas said. Aside from Antipolo and Fariñas, other mayors who were present during the meeting were Jay Khonghun of Subic town; Jose Angelo Dominguez of Castillejos; Elvis Soria, San Marcelino; La Rainne Abad-Sarmiento, San Narciso; Joycelyn Apostol, Cabangan; Bing Maniquiz-Jeresano, Botolan; Rundy Ebdane, Iba; Napoleon Edquid, Candelaria; and Luisito Marty of Santa Cruz. Meanwhile, Eisma urged the Zambales mayors to take advantage of the Freeport’s development impetus and asked them to start identifying areas that may be suitable for the expansion program. She said that Subic faces brighter prospects than ever and that current developments like its emergence as a new cruise ship destination in Asia, are bringing more livelihood opportunities to local communities. The SBMA chief noted that the number of investors in the Freeport had grown to 1,587 in the first quarter of 2018 from 1,355 in the same period last year. The new investors that the SBMA signed in this first quarter, she added, have committed investments worth PHP866 million, which is 80 percent higher than the PHP480 million recorded in the same period in 2017. Eisma said, however, that because of lack of space in the former Subic military base where the Freeport is located, the SBMA could hardly accept any more investment proposals for major projects. “A lot of investors are really looking for bigger locations. And I’m serious about it— please don’t dawdle on this expansion offer. We have to do this now because the next official might not have the same inclination as we do,” she told the mayors. Eisma explained that any local government unit can nominate land for development as Freeport expansion area. With favorable resolutions approved by the Sangguniang Bayan, a memorandum of agreement will be signed by the municipality and the SBMA, granting the latter the right to take over the administration and regulations of the area. The SBMA will then market the area to investors. Fariñas said the ZML is committed to preparing their areas for a successful expansion program, noting that it will bring more jobs and community development in the entire Zambales. She and the other mayors also thanked Eisma for inviting transport service provider Grab Philippines to enter Zambales, saying this will help provide an effective, efficient and tourist-friendly transportation service that may further boost local tourism, a growing industry in Zambales province. “We share (Eisma’s) vision about 'malasakit', of a greater community helping each other as leaders, we intend to give a better quality of life to our people. And these things are a big boost to our efforts in accomplishing this mission,” Fariñas said.

In its statement, the ride-hailing firm said that the per minute charge was in accordance with Department Order 2015-011 and that this is still valid. “This DO is valid despite the position of the LTFRB to the contrary. LTFRB has no authority to declare DOTr order invalid. Only the courts, not LTFRB can rule on the validity of an order especially one issued by DOTr which has direct supervision and control over the LTFRB,” Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales said. “There is no basis for the fine being imposed by LTFRB. We disagree with the Board’s decision and we will file an appeal to protect the ridesharing industry in the country,” he added. Grab also said the per minute fare was also part of the presentation and discussions during its technical working group meeting with the LTFRB on July 2017 and that the LTFRB Chairman was also informed of the fare structure. “We likewise received an e-mail response from the Office of the Chairman. No concerns were raised by the Board at that time,” it said. However, Delgra said an e-mail response from his office cannot be seen as approval of the fare structure. “The Board is going to decide as to whether we are going to grant a fare increase or not. It’s the Board who’s going to decide, and that’s basically what happened to the taxi fare, to the PUJ,” he said. The Board earlier said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in Dec. 27, 2016, which stipulates that the company should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40 with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer excluding per-minute travel charges. In its order dated July 9, the LTFRB said the rebates will be availed only for 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab shall start its implementation whichever is earlier. The amount of the rebate is limited to the portion of the income of Grab which is directly related to the PHP2-per minute charge during the period of its imposition. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until Apr. 19, 2018 when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The DOTr has issued an order last June 11, authorizing the LTFRB to determine the fare, rates and other charges of TNCs after undergoing public hearings and consultations to ensure that they are just and reasonable. This will ensure that the TNCs will comply with policies, laws, and regulations as the DOTr recognizes their role in providing transport services to the public.

In her dissenting opinion dated last July 9, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the per-minute charge was imposed before the Department of Transportation (DOTr) issued Department Order No. 2017-011 or the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines for Public Utility Vehicles on June 19, 2017. The order authorizes the LTFRB to determine the fare structure of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS). “Facts would show that the basis of the respondent in prescribing the per-minute charge was Department Order No. 2015-011. Additionally, the assailed PHP2-per-minute charge was communicated to the Board, through the Office of the Chairman. Emphasis is made that the PHP2 per-minute charge was set when Department Order No. 2015-011 was not yet amended,” Lizada said. The Board order fines Grab PHP10 million for overcharging and to reimburse the per-minute charge through future ride bookings of its passengers. “Thus, in the imposition of any administrative sanction, the Board must only do the same after the effectivity of Department Order No. 2017-011. Said issuance should be applied prospectively and not retroactively. However, if after thorough evaluation and investigation, respondent will still impose the per-minute charge after the effectivity of the said Department Order, then and only then can the Board impose the appropriate penalty. Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,” she added. Grab has reiterated that the PHP2-per-minute travel charge is legal, adding that it is deliberating on its next legal moves regarding the LTFRB order. “But no matter how we decide to move forward from this, be assured, Grab will stay,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. Department Order No. 2015-011, which was issued by the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), authorizes transportation network companies to set their own fares subject to the oversight of the LTFRB. The per-minute charge was imposed by Grab from June 2, 2017 until April 19 this year, when it was suspended by the LTFRB. The LTFRB, in its order dated July 9, said the rebates should be availed of for only 20 days from the time the decision becomes final or when Grab starts its implementation. “The amount of the rebate shall be limited to the portion of the income of the respondent only, directly related to or arising from the PHP2-per-minute during the period of its unauthorized imposition,” according to the Board.

The LTFRB has previously said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs in December 2016.

The subsidy program, which the company rolled out last June 19, aims to ensure sustainable income for its drivers while meeting the demand for rides from its passengers. “We have provided around PHP70 million for over two weeks. Almost lahat affected (Almost everybody was affected) and they will be given subsidies,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of its Smart City initiative in Makati City. “The reason why we shifted to subsidies from incentives is that we saw that a lot of drivers who are driving part-time do not hit incentives anyway. May mga trips na nalulugi sila (They have trips wherein they are losing money). The subsidies ensure that the assistance for driver income occurs on a more broad basis. Rather than a few getting a lot, there are now a lot getting enough,” he added. Grab earlier said the earnings of its drivers have declined since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board suspended the PHP2-per-minute travel charge last April. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. Grab is eyeing to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy, which will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers get the ideal fare rate as computed by its system. The ride-hailing firm is also seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of the operations of its corporate rival, Uber. Grab makes some 600,000 bookings nationwide per day, which increase up to 800,000 during peak hours, while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. Meanwhile, the firm is eyeing to implement a multimodal transportation system, wherein its TNVS units will be integrated into other modes of public transportation. This will provide a variety of choices for transportation by commuters as they go to their destinations. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars traveling along congested roads and move them into higher capacity vehicles, like shuttles and buses,” Cu said. The Grab official said the company is coordinating with transport regulators to provide a free hand in franchising shuttles and other modes of transportation. “We are now meeting with P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transportation, either by cars or trikes,” he said. Grab hopes that this initiative would help encourage passengers to use public transportation to ease the traffic congestion in Metro Manila.

It’s only a stone’s throw away from the St. Philomena Catholic Church. But don’t mistake them for church-goers or late-evening shoppers. Instead, they’re a blend of “jackpot dreamers” comprising mostly of ordinary workers and pensioners, who simply couldn’t think of anything else to do but to battle it out with boredom. On such a given day, they made it a habit to wait for a private air-conditioned bus that will take them to casino resorts either somewhere in Las Vegas Strip or Pechanga -- a place where one of the casino resorts operates in California -- to try their luck on gaming. Each time, this sprawling parking lot is transformed into a melting pot where casino players would often loiter, a usual scene that’s nothing new anymore to many customers who are coming in and out of the supermarket. As they waited, they’re enjoying the luxury of exchanging pleasantries and whatever jokes they could afford to belt out in their own native languages --Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and, of course, English. From a distance, one could hear their laughter, and their faces brighten up as the driver of the white shuttle bus approaches and pulls over. As the door opens, each one climbs aboard and readily settles on a cushioned seat, which provides enough comfort to endure the long drive. As competition heats up in the gaming business, some casino operators have turned to this marketing strategy a long time ago. It is a means to lure bored people and gambling addicts to while away their time with a free commute to and from the different casino destinations in Las Vegas and nearby San Diego. According to Bing Paralejas, 49, who once worked as a passenger coordinator in one of the casino resorts, air-conditioned buses that transport casino-goers are assigned different routes to pick up prospective players. “It isn’t that easy as you have to establish connection first. And, of course, promos are needed, too.” “Each bus driver takes these players to a casino where he has a contract based on the number of people that he brings to the casino resort,” she said. “Of course, the bus owner gets the big chunk of the payments, after paying his driver his day’s drudgery,” she added. It’s short of saying that the bus driver is paid for taking players from the pick-up point to the casino, and vice versa. “Depending on the agreement between the bus operator and the casino management, which hands out discounted tickets and game cards to attract players, the bus operator needs to bring players to the casino either every other day or on a daily basis,” Paralejas explained. “Actually, it’s a good business. If I have the capital to buy an air-conditioned bus which could cost more than a million, I’ll do the same,” she said. And who wouldn't grab the offer? As a casino patron, each one needs to pay a small fee to ride the bus but is given a small voucher, which he can initially use on the slot machines upon arrival. And the same bus will take the passengers back early the next day on the same spot where they were picked up. No wonder many senior citizens and employees are spending their days-off by going back and forth to Las Vegas without letup. “This is more convenient and economical compared to driving your own car, which can save a lot of mileage and gas,” said one of the players who declined to be named, an avid gambler who works at one of the private hospitals in Torrance, California. Whether he likes it or not, he and his girlfriend are terribly hooked on this vice. Sources told this writer that the live-in couple would always set aside some extra money which they could use as bets whenever they’re in Las Vegas. It was learned that they seldom or don’t win at all. As the borrowing grew, their debts pile up. What is it that he’s after? “I just want to win the jackpot. Then, perhaps, I can go back home for good,” a hospital employee, who requested anonymity, told this writer once. However, dreaming of winning the jackpot is like “wishing for the moon.” For many years now, the gambler’s wish hasn’t come true yet. Who knows? It could be tomorrow or could be never. While other pensioners are always dreaming of hitting the jackpot in Las Vegas, Jessie B., 90, and a former Philippine Scout, would stick around. Besides, he has no interest in going to casinos. On most days, he could be seen leisurely shuttling between stores in search of the lucky scratch card that could give him the jackpot. If this happens, he said he would likely go home for good, especially now that he is alone. For now, he’s contented with his little pension. Las Piñas, where his home is, could wait, he said. His unmarried daughter is doing her best to take care of him as he battles it out in the sunset of his life. Others who are caught in the maelstrom of gambling seemed dead set on pushing through with their habits. Even if they know it destroys lives, these gamblers could not care less. All they could think of is to pay off their debts and the promise of retirement. Being hooked on gambling is a huge problem, not only among Filipinos, but also among immigrants who have the same ambition to instantly hit the jackpot. But reality shows the other way around. As the saying goes, “The more you dig out your pockets, the more you lose.” Unfortunately, some people only count the winnings but never the amount they lost in gambling. This habit doesn’t spare the pockets of the aging Filipino war veterans who depend solely on their meager monthly pension. There are instances, when they would drop those loose coins in slot machines, expecting that they’d win. (By Randy G. Altarejos) (About the author: Randy G.

This as Grab said that the earnings of its drivers have declined since the per-minute charge was suspended last April. Grab is expected to spend more than PHP100 million a month for the fare subsidy as it ensures to provide proper income to drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) for them to earn a decent living while assuring that trips are still affordable to passengers. “Based on our computations, a TNVS driver needs to make at least PHP330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel and vehicle maintenance costs,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Tuesday. “Since PHP2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in,” he added. Ideally, TNVS drivers should be earning at least PHP5.50 per minute or PHP330 per hour, according to the ride-hailing firm. The fare subsidy will be based on the duration of riding hours of passengers and will ensure that drivers will get the ideal fare rate as computed by Grab’s system. “For example, if a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance and fare is computed at PHP120 only. Grab will return to the driver the PHP210 difference to make sure he made PHP330 for that one hour trip. The subsidy will run as long as it’s needed and for as long as we have resources to do so,” Cu said. Grab is making an average of 600,000 bookings that increases up to 800,000 during peak hours while TNVS supply in its platform remains at 33,000. The firm has earlier said that it is seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of Uber’s operations last April.

The extra 1 km. will be given as spot incentive,” Cu said. Grab will offer subsidies out of its revenues and will not affect the fare that will be paid by riders. “This will be placed as part of the entire incentives program. This is a new feature on the technology side. We want to ensure that drivers will not be operating on a loss. Our current profitability is not the question here. The question here is how we can improve our services,” Cu said. The operating costs of Grab Philippines has increased to PHP4.57 billion last year from PHP2.45 billion in 2016 while its net losses amounted to PHP2.92 billion in 2017 compared to PHP1.56 billion in 2016. The increase in Grab’s operating costs was attributed to revenues from the 20 percent commission from rides that are being used for driver incentives. “We do not expect the situation to change in the next 12 to 18 months. We are still in investment mode and are not expecting to make money anytime sooner. But these losses are still within our budget forecast,” Cu said. Grab earlier said it is seeking for the migration of about 6,000 drivers to its platform, who were displaced following the halt of Uber’s operations last April. It currently receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests daily but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve the riding public. The company also said that the suspension of the PHP2-per-minute charge by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has resulted in the reduction of the number of its drivers on the road.

Grab made the statement following concerns aired by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) that its actions have drastically lessened market competition through unilaterally raising its prices while the quality of services has declined through longer waiting times for booking rides and increasing incidents of driver cancellations following its acquisition of the operations of erstwhile corporate rival Uber. “We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,\" the firm said in a statement Wednesday. It added that the situation is likely to be temporary given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB’s) accreditation of new transport network companies (TNCs). Grab said it would continue to address PCC's concerns. “We are presently engaging with the PCC to understand what it believes are the bases for its conclusions and to ensure that the PCC also has the benefit of our regulatory and market analysis, which would show that the Transaction has no anti-competitive effect,” the company said. Grab is set to file a comment to further clarify concerns raised by the PCC, as it expressed hope the latter would \"fairly assess\" their arguments. \"Rest assured, we understand the need to promote robust competition and consumer welfare and remain committed to engage with the PCC, the LTFRB and other government agencies to ensure a competitive TNC industry,” it said. Grab had earlier said it is seeking for the migration of around 6,000 drivers to its platform who were displaced following the halt of Uber’s operations last April. It currently receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests each day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve the riding public. The company likewise stated that the suspension of the PHP2 per minute charge by the LTFRB has resulted in the lessening of its drivers on the road.

This information is contained in the Statement of Concerns (SOC) report on the Grab-Uber deal done by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisition Office (MAO) released to the press Monday. The antitrust body through its report, reiterated that the acquisition of Uber by Grab has resulted in a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in the ride-hailing market. But the review also found out that “an overwhelming majority of riders” would still continue using on-demand car-based private transportation online booking service via mobile ride-hailing application despite a 5 to 10 percent increase, “which is borne out by actual events of post-transaction”. It was also noted that there are key qualitative differences between TNVS and other modes of public transportation. Moreover, the PCC stated in the SOC that in the aftermath of the merger, Grab now controls 93 percent of TNVS registered vehicles, solidifying its unrivaled dominance in the relevant market. Despite the increase in supply of drivers after the deal, Grab fares have continued to increase. “This upward trend in price is apparent through the higher fares and increased frequency of surge-pricing applied by grab,” the SOC read. “The review indicated that prior to the transaction, prices charged by Grab have been flat to declining, while post-transaction prices have been increasing, despite the supply of drivers available to Grab post-transaction,” it added. The Commission also cited the declining quality of service of Grab after the transaction, which include increased driver cancellation, forced cancellations of rides, and increased waiting time. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were likely less to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” the SOC noted. PCC’s issuance of SOC is part of its motu proprio review on the Grab-Uber deal launched on April 3. The Commission has given the parties time to file their comments on the SOC. The PCC earlier said that based on its review, the Commission has the power to approve or block the deal. But the parties can also give their commitments and remedies to address the anti-competitive concerns of the PCC.

Roque made this remark after think tank Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) announced on its website that the Philippines started long-delayed repairs to its crumbling runway at Pag-asa Island. According to the AMTI, “Satellite imagery from May 17 shows two barges anchored just off the western edge of the Thitu (Pag-asa) Island runway, which collapsed into the sea years ago.” “It appears that a grab dredger, consisting of a crane with a clamshell bucket, is installed on the smaller barge to the west, while the other carries a backhoe. Loose sediment from dredging can be seen in the water around the two barges and freshly-deposited sand is visible along the northern edge of the runway,” it added. The AMTI noted that this method of dredging is similar to that used by Vietnam at many of its outposts in recent years, noting that it affects surrounding reefs at a smaller scale . According to the AMTI, Philippine defense officials in April 2017 announced that they would be upgrading facilities at the country’s occupied islands and reefs, but little work was apparent until now. Roque earlier said that Duterte is expected to visit Pag-asa Island within his term to show the country’s claim over the Kalayaan Group of Islands. “I think, time will really come that the President will visit the Pag-asa Island,” Roque said in an earlier video interview. Roque said a visit of the President to the Pag-asa Island would serve as a statement of sovereignty. “If the President will not do it now, I think, before his term will be finished, he will go there, not only to show to the world our entitlement in Kalayaan but to visit our soldiers and our countrymen living there,” he said. Pag-asa Island is part of the Kalayaan Group of Islands, which is also being claimed by China. In July 2016, the United Nations-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruled in favor of the Philippines’ arbitration case saying that China’s nine-dash line map has no legal basis. Duterte temporarily shelved the PCA’s decision to give way to friendly and peaceful dialogues with China. He, however, vowed not give up any of the county's territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea amid China’s alleged militarization of the disputed area.

In its petition filed before the Board dated May 18, Grab said the suspension by the Board of the per minute fare has infringed the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as it has allowed other transportation network companies (TNCs) to impose similar charges prejudicing their operations. “The Honorable Board’s assailed Order dated 19 April 2018 suspending the petitioner’s imposition of its per minute charge as a component of its fare structure violates petitioner’s right to equal protection of the law since while the Honorable Board suspended such fee imposition by the petitioner, it has allowed other transportation network companies to include the same per minute charge in their respective fare structures,” Grab's petition read. The LTFRB has approved the accreditations of ride-hailing firms Hype Transport Systems Inc., Hirna Mobility Solutions Inc., Go Lag, Owto and MiCab Systems Corporation following the halt of the operations of Uber as a result of its acquisition by Grab last month. According to Grab, the Board has approved the fare structures of these new TNCs allowing them to impose per minute charges to their riders. The suspension will enable drivers and operators belonging to the common supply base which was imposed by the LTFRB to transfer to other TNCs as they are allowed to impose per minute charges, the firm said. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” its petition read. The firm also said that the filing of a motion for reconsideration will render the LTFRB’s suspension order not executory. \"Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,\" Grab said. The firm has said that it has the authority to formulate their own fare structures in accordance with the Department Order 2015-11 of the then Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). The LTFRB has suspended Grab’s per minute charge following the allegations raised by PBA Partylist Rep. Jericho Nograles that Grab is illegally charging PHP2-per-minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of PHP40 and charging PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer. Grab should refund around PHP 1.8 billion to its customers because of the alleged overcharging, Nograles added.

There are five universities and BPO (business process outsourcing) centers have more than 5,000 employees. That’s super rare, to be honest, outside Metro Manila,” Carlo Cu Unjieng, Grab Philippines head of expansion, told a group of the local media here on Tuesday. Unjieng noted the initial Grab operation involves 70 taxis and several electric trikes or e-trikes. He said the Grab in Naga will only use taxis with franchises, and Grab apps can be downloaded in their website. Unjieng further said the Grab, the owner of the apps, will get PHP5 for the PHP25 taxi booking fee. He said they are still working out with the e-trike drivers how to build the “livelihood of our partners sustainable.” “We will give incentive of PHP25 as long as they hit the number of rides per week,” he added. Unjieng claimed that in Pampanga and Balanga, where there is also GrabTrike, the drivers’ earnings have gone up to PHP1,000 to PHP2,000 per week. Jojo Estrada, representative of taxi drivers, said in Bikol “for us drivers, it will be a big help because we will stop searching for passengers if the trade terms will be okay. But we really still don’t know how Grab will work in Naga.” Alec Francis Santos, head of Naga City’s Arts, Culture and Tourism Office, said the city government invited Grab last year to come in to Naga after several complaints of overcharging by taxi drivers were reported to the Office of the Mayor. Santos said it came out from the mediation between complaining passengers and taxi drivers that the reason they were overcharging was because they did not know where to get passengers.

MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim thanked Grab Philippines head Brian Cu for the donation of 100 body cameras during Monday’s flag-raising ceremony. “These are the equipment that we need. This will go a very long way in terms of making a difference in performing the duties of our traffic enforcers. This is very important. Thank you very much. Let's continue to help each other for the good of Metro Manila,” said Lim during the turn-over ceremony. MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia said the donation would be a big boost to the agency’s operation, particularly in going after erring motorists on the road. “This will show transparency in our jobs because there will be evidence of the apprehension through video recording. These cameras will serve as protection ng traffic enforcers and also of the motorists,” Garcia said. He said that the donation will not in any way protect erring Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers under Grab should they commit any traffic violation. “There is no such order. These donated body cameras will show transparency. These gadgets will somehow protect our traffic enforcers who would be harassed or verbally abused. For motorists, there will be evidence if the traffic enforcers ask for bribes,” said Garcia. He said the body cameras will be issued to traffic enforcers manning Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue (EDSA) and chokepoint areas in the metropolis after undergoing training. “We are giving warning to all motorists who violate a traffic regulation, do not attempt to bribe our traffic personnel. If you know you are wrong, then just let the traffic enforcer give you a citation ticket,\" said Garcia. He said the agency hopes to procure more body cameras for other traffic enforcers in the future but it cannot be easily done due to budget constraints. For his part, Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, Grab Philippines Public Affairs head, expressed optimism that the body cameras would help the agency in managing traffic in the metropolis. “We are one with the MMDA. They need eyes on the road. They need to be visible during any apprehension or any part of their work to dispel any questionable transactions between the parties,\" Gonzales said. The body camera, which costs PHP9,000 each, can be used all throughout the day as they have 10 to 12 hours battery life. Gonzales also pointed out that the donation will not spare even their drivers if they are cited for a traffic violation. “We are putting our foot forward in saying that please go ahead. If there is erring TNVS driver under Grab that committed any violation, apprehend them by all means,” said Gonzales.

This, as Grab has reiterated its commitment to work with transport regulators on replenishing the supply of drivers in response to increasing demand from its passengers. “Our immediate priority is to work with regulators to onboard the 6,000 displaced drivers who are not part of the LTFRB masterlist. We are continuously working with government agencies to find a long-term solution on the supply issue,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a statement. To address the situation, Grab is regularly releasing incentives to increase driver productivity by at least 15 percent per day. The firm also encourages its riders to utilize the Grab Share feature on its mobile app to share its available cars to fellow passengers and to save on fuel costs. Passengers may also use GrabCar’s Multi-Stop feature for multiple destinations instead of booking separately. “We also seek our passengers to plan their trips and book ahead of time,” Toh said. Grab currently receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests each day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve the riding public. The overflow in demand and severe undersupply of cars has resulted in longer waiting times for passengers or not getting allocated a vehicle according to the ridesharing firm. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has imposed a common supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) units in Metro Manila.

It’s the weekend and you don’t have an itinerary, what now? Luckily, Ho Chi Minh is the perfect place to visit spontaneously since travel agencies are everywhere, which make immediate bookings easy, especially in District 1. The best part is that tours are cheap! Perhaps, this is one of the reasons why the city is in the midst of a tourism boom. Ho Chi Minh, formerly Saigon, is Vietnam’s largest city renamed after the first president of then North Vietnam and revolutionary leader who fought against the United States and won. There’s no denying that it has a brutal, tragic history of war but it also has a lot to offer in terms of art, culture, and nature. There’s so much to do and see in Ho Chi Minh, but if you’re in the city for only two days, make sure to make the most out of your stay by visiting these six tourist attractions (and more if you’re lucky):  Independence PalaceLocation: Ben Thanh, District 1 Travel back in time in the Independence Palace (Reunification Palace), the former presidential palace of the Republic of Vietnam also known as South Vietnam. This is the site where the end of the Vietnam War took place some 40 years ago after communist North Vietnamese tanks smashed through its wrought-iron gates in a scene photographed by journalists from all over the world. The tanks are still located within the palace grounds.    Notre Dame CathedralLocation: Paris Commune Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City Built by French colonists between 1863 and 1880, the Notre Dame Cathedral is the most popular Catholic church in the predominantly Buddhist country. The cathedral has a neo-Romanesque design including break walls, stained glass windows, and two bell towers tipped with iron spires. The cathedral is currently undergoing renovation and will be fully opened to tourists in 2019.   Saigon Central Post OfficeLocation: Paris Commune Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City Just across the Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Saigon Central Post Office, which has been described as “the grandest post office in all of Southeast Asia” was also built during the French colonial period. Inside are painted maps of Vietnam; and a portrait of Ho Chi Minh, the revolutionary leader, hangs at the end of its hall. Tour guides have likened the post office to a 20th century railway station. It’s also a good place to purchase souvenirs.   Mekong DeltaLocation: Mekong Delta Grab your Vietnamese conical hat and hop on to a motor boat ride along mud-colored waters of the Mekong Delta, where you can see rows of coconuts and other tropical fruits. There are no crocodiles as per the tour guides. You also get to ride a smaller boat and paddle along the canals. The boatmen and women don’t charge you, but you’re always free to tip them off!    Vinh Trang TempleLocation: My Tho City Just a short bus ride away from the Mekong Delta, the Vinh Trang Temple is not only a place of worship for Buddhists, but also a haven for those seeking time for reflection and peace, away from the engine sounds of motorbikes in the city. The temple, which is surrounded by a two-hectare garden, is also home two two gigantic Buddha statues -- a sleeping one and a smiling one.  Ben Thanh MarketLocation: Ben Thanh, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City Souvenirs, handicrafts, textiles, clothing, food, drink, anything under the sun, you name it, they’ve got it! The Ben Thanh Market, one of the earliest structures in Ho Chi Minh, is one of the busiest markets in the city. Aside from being a place to shop, it’s also a place to dine as restaurant stalls are aplenty. Don’t leave the city without trying Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup), Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich), and their world-famous Vietnamese coffee among other favorites. At night, when the market is closed, vendors open stalls outside on the surrounding streets.

For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Grab country marketing head Cindy Toh said in a press conference in Makati City on Tuesday. “When Uber was implementing it, there was friction between drivers in terms of connecting. We are reviewing that and will be rolling it out as soon as we have the solution,” Toh added. Uber used to charge a fee on riders who cancel trips, which they will have to pay on their next trip, before its ride-hailing operations in the country were halted last April due to its acquisition by Grab. Grab is imposing a maximum cancellation of one trip per day as part of incentives for its drivers. Currently, its drivers cancel 8 percent of their trips while passengers cancel 12 percent of their rides. The ridesharing company seeks to reduce the rate of driver cancellation by 4 percent, and passenger cancellation by 6 percent under its 100-day plan to improve driver behavior and welfare, provide better ride experience, and upgrade customer support. Under the initiative, Grab will enhance the performance incentives it offers to drivers to motivate them to provide quality services to its riders. Top performing drivers will be rewarded based on their number of rides, high rating, and good feedback from passengers. Grab is also considering to implement a breakdown on its fares to ensure transparency of its operations. “We are working already a breakdown of the fare on the receipt. I have a team that is working on revising the receipt that you get. On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers traveled. That is already a work in progress,” Toh said in an interview with reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the campaign. “We just have tech constraints. We will be rolling it out. Our target is this will also be implemented within the 100 days,” she said. Grab implemented the masking of passenger destinations last April 27, which was initially rolled out to 25 percent of Grab drivers with historically low acceptance rate. It has also activated an auto-accept feature that will automatically allocate trips to drivers allowing a more seamless experience in continuously accepting passenger requests. Grab has maintained that the main reason for the difficulty in booking a ride is the lack of cars, resulting in low supply. The company is appealing to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to increase the supply cap of 65,000 transportation network vehicle service units in Metro Manila. Grab said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. The suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles, leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides according to the firm.

We've seen people posting about driver cancellations, their rude behavior, all of this we see and we know that it's been a very difficult time for the people that we are serving,\" she added. To improve driver behavior, Grab will implement an improved Driver Code of Conduct (COC), a set of updated rules and regulations that will stipulate the tasks and traits of a responsible Grab driver-partner. Drivers must comply with the COC for them to continue access to the Grab app. A Driver Academy will also be established that will provide modules on road courtesy, customer service and data privacy and social media handling on top of driver onboarding and rehabilitation training services. Grab drivers will also be qualified for perks such as discounted gas prices, driver lounge and maintenance discounts under the company’s rewards program. Passenger will be able to expect a new app interface for iOS and Android by July. The new app will enable them to easily set their pick-up points and quickly select their preferred service. Rewards will also be categorized for easier selection and redemption of offers. Grab is urging its riders to utilize the Help Center to report their concerns as well as their location issues particularly pick-up and drop off points. The ride-hailing firm will also partner with a BPO company to upgrade its customer service team which will be operational by July. Dedicated service lines for passengers, drivers and platinum users will allow easier access to after-ride services. “We hope that with these new improvements, our driver-partners will continue to be good and responsible members of the TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) community and enablers of better journeys,” Toh said. “Our aim is to be our passengers’ partner for better trips at all times.

There is only a single pending application from Negros Occidental, said TEZ Regulation Department manager Nino Aquino, who led the agency’s investment roadshow at L’Fisher Hotel here on Thursday. Aquino said the applicant from the province is a developer of a resort-type leisure tourism enterprise in Silay City. He pointed out that Negros Occidental is a good tourism investment area because it has vast lands potential for real estate developments. He called on both the government and private sectors to look at these potentials and grab the investment opportunities within the TEZs. Aquino noted that some owners of sugarcane plantations have considered developing their lands for other sectors like tourism. “With some problems hounding the sugar industry right now, TEZs will be a good alternative,” he said. The TEZs are categorized into two -- private, and public or flagship zones.For private TEZs, or areas with private individual owners, the owners present their development plans, which Tieza checks for feasibility and sustainability. In flagship TEZs, the agency comes up with the master development plan for the areas identified through an inventory created by the Department of Tourism (DOT) and local government units (LGUs). Aquino said the establishment of TEZs will not only benefit the tourism enterprise itself, but also the community and the nation in general by contributing to inclusive growth. It helps in the generation of income and employment, he added. Tieza’s one-day investment roadshow here was held in partnership with the Metro Bacolod Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the DOT Region 6. The activity introduced TEZ to local stakeholders, especially to the private sector, underscored ways on how to create or designate an area for TEZ, discussed the incentives granted to these zones, and offered investment opportunities for the investors within TEZs.

Grab said the suspension of the PHP2-per-minute travel charge by the LTFRB has caused a shortage in the supply of vehicles leading to longer waiting time or non-allocation of rides. “Driver numbers continue to drop as uncertainty in maintaining sustainable livelihood increases. With the recent suspension of PHP2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that it receives about 600,000 passenger booking requests per day but only 35,000 vehicles are available to serve its riders. Grab has 24,000 vehicles serving 60 percent to 65 percent of bookings while Uber had 19,000 vehicles and a success rate of 50 percent before the acquisition of its operations. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles, only 11,000 have moved to Grab. Majority of the gap is due to the 6,000 active Uber drivers who could no longer continue driving as they were not part of LTFRB’s audited master list. As a result, only 53 percent of passengers are able to get a ride on their first booking attempt, but this goes down to as low as 37 percent on average during peak hours. To address the gap in the supply of TNVS units across the country, Cu said they will need the collaboration of transport regulators and ride-hailing companies. \"With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of the riders,” Cu said. In the meantime, Grab is advising its riders to utilize the GrabShare feature on its app to maximize the use of its available vehicles through sharing rides with other passengers. It will also review its incentives structure to enable its drivers to efficiently deliver services to the passengers. For its part, the LTFRB said it is open to a possible review of the supply cap it has imposed on TNVS units as it has approved accreditations for new transportation network companies (TNCs). “We need to see the churning rates of TNCs -- how many operators were blacklisted and how many drivers are no longer operating. These are the things that are unique to the TNCs. If we will subtract something from the pool, we will replenish,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a text message to reporters. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination, everyone is working on the fly. It is still too early to set rigid rules on a technology that is still being tested first by its newness vis-a-vis the owners, drivers, passengers, and competition,” she added. The LTFRB has imposed a common supply cap of 65,000 TNVS units for TNCs in Metro Manila. It has also approved the accreditation of Hype, Hirna, Go Lag, Owto, and Micab as new TNCs.

HPG Director Chief Supt. Arnel Escobal, in an interview, said the event that carried the theme, “Knowledge, Continuing Education: Contributing Factor to Economic Growth Through Road Safety,” was part of HPG's “Disiplinadong Driver” Campaign. The campaign started in Central Luzon-Region III, then in National Capital Region (NCR), and now in Region IV-A or Calabarzon Region comprising Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon. He said the campaign will continuously educate motorcycle riders amid the numerous fatal accidents involving motorcycles. Escobal said they included educating drivers of four-wheeled vehicles and above on road safety and security to protect pedestrians, bicycle riders, and motorcycle drivers, who are considered vulnerable to accidents involving cars and trucks plying the roads as well as highways. “We invited motor clubs to converge in one place and provide a venue to showcase their vehicles or if they are selling products that they can use,” Escobal said. Escobal recognized the need for collaboration and partnership with motorists, especially organized groups, and also offered training services for free in order to reduce road accidents as called for by the World Health Organization (WHO). “This also a venue for us to conduct, in a form of seminar, road safety and security and make them (clubs) our partners,” he added. He cited their partnership with LBC, a courier company that recorded minimal accidents after their service crew drivers attended the road safety and security seminar conducted by HPG personnel. He also mentioned their partnership with GRAB, a transport service company, turning their drivers into road safety ambassadors by serving as role models in observing traffic rules and regulations. They also do reporting of road crimes and accidents by texting to the newly-installed HPG hotline, PLDT-Smart number ‎7-444-474. Escobal also offered their willingness to train traffic enforcers hired by local government units (LGUs) on proper traffic management, when requested. In a related interview, Supt. Peter Dionisio, the HPG-Calabarzon regional director, said they invited auto clubs and motorcycle communities in the Calabarzon Region since they are the frequent road users, who needed more information on road safety and security based on international standards and on existing traffic laws. Dionisio pointed out that the motor show will eventually make the motoring sector HPG partners, as well as force multipliers in the anti-criminality campaign of the PNP. He cited the South Unite, the biggest auto club in the Calabarzon with more than 2,000 members spanning the cities of Santa Rosa, Biñan, San Pedro and Muntinlupa, who after getting proper knowledge can also report incidents they witnessed while on the road. In addition, Dionisio cited as an example the incorrect practice of motorcycle and car owners to install auxiliary or additional LED lights, which is considered illegal attachment if found above the headlight; if lack of separate switch from the headlight, if used within populated areas, if it has no cover when used within city limits, and if beyond the standard manufacturing specifications. Dionisio explained further that participating clubs and motorcycle groups will be subjected to continuing education since he considered knowledge to promote discipline, which is the primary factor among others, in easing road congestion, thereby promoting economic growth.

Grab said its driver cancellation rate doubled to 11 percent last Friday. This was primarily caused by lower fares, resulting in the firm being able to service only half of the passenger demand. “Drivers have to buy gas, pay the monthly amortization for the vehicle or the daily boundary, and when traffic stalls them, it is only the PHP2 per minute that saves their income. So with the PHP2 gone, many of our drivers earn less and drive less, if at all. No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them have resorted to cancelling booking especially when they know they will traverse traffic,” Grab country head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. Cu said 80 percent of the travel duration charge goes to the driver directly, while 20 percent is spent on driver incentives and rider promos. Last Friday, Grab filed a motion for reconsideration before the LTFRB, explaining that the PHP2 per minute travel charge is legal and in accordance with a 2015 order of the Department of Transportation that allows transportation network companies to set their own fare rates. Drivers will not earn a sustainable income and would be forced to quit their jobs as transport network vehicle services operators if the PHP2-per-minute charge is stopped, resulting in fewer vehicles for passengers, according to Grab. The firm had presented its fare structure including the PHP2-per-minute charge, in a technical working group meeting with the LTFRB in July 2017, after imposing the charge the previous month. Cu hopes that the LTFRB reinstates the travel time fare as this will benefit both drivers and passengers. “Let’s face it: kapag lugi ang driver, hindi lalabas yan. Walang masasakyan ang tao (Let's face it : if the driver is not earning, he will not drive. Commuters would have no rides),” he said. In its order dated April 18, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the suspension stands as the board investigates the issue. The board said there was no mention of any travel time rate, which Grab has been collecting, when it released its order on the fare structure of TNCs on Dec. 27, 2016. The December 2016 order states that Grab should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40, with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per kilometer.

He said 80 percent of the travel duration charge goes to the driver while 20 percent is used for driver incentives and passenger promos.

What the December 2016 order stipulates is that TNCs, such as Grab, should impose a flagdown rate of PHP40, with an additional rate of PHP10 to PHP14 per km. In the meantime, the ride-hailing firm has complied with the LTFRB’s order and stopped implementing the per-minute charge.

It turned out that the implementation of the PHP2 per minute in June 2017 did not undergo due process and only underwent Powerpoint presentation,” he added. Grab should refund around PHP 1.8 billion of alleged illegal charges to its customers, Nograles said.

The Commission reiterated that it will continue with its moto propio review despite the shutdown of Uber’s operations in the country. “As the antitrust authority, our lens is always focused on the market—in this case, we are reviewing the potential effects on competition in the merger between Grab and Uber in the ride-hailing platform,” the PCC said in a statement Monday. The mobile app of Uber was deactivated Monday after it has earlier announced that it will operate in the Philippines until April 15. The ridesharing company said that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. Grab has acquired Uber’s ridesharing and food delivery businesses in Southeast Asia integrating them into its transportation and financial technology (fintech) platform last March 26. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5 percent stake in Grab’s shares. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transportation network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” according to the PCC. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to 'network effects.' This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base. This is an advantage that a newcomer does not have. PCC’s review will take into consideration these factors to level the playing field in this market,” the commission said. The PCC has formulated various interim measures that would ensure the credibility and integrity of its review on the merger of Uber and Grab for possible anti-competition concerns. Among these include maintaining the independence of their business operations; refraining from sharing confidential information, such as pricing and operations; and refraining from imposing exclusivity clauses. Both Uber and Grab were also asked to refrain from performing any practice that could lead to reduced viability of their businesses and prejudice the PCC’s power to review the transaction and impose remedies.

Around 30 PWDs also called on LTFRB officials to ensure that the modern PUVs that would be coming out soon on the roads all over the country would be accessible to all commuters without discrimination. Abner Manlapaz, president of the Life Haven Independent Living Center, said the new PUVs' design must ensure the accessiblity for all PWDs. Manlapaz said that designs for accessibility of the modern transportation should include ramp or lift; spaces for wheelchairs with safety accessories like belts,clamps grab bar; audio announcement system; and visual announcement system. He noted that terminals for land, air and sea transport should also be PWD-friendly, with accessible facilities not limited to toilets, ticketing counters, waiting lounge, parking /drop off space for persons with disabilities; directional tactile in appropriate areas; and visible signages. The LTFRB should also require PUV drivers, operators and frontline personnel to undergo sensitivity training so that they can better understand the special needs of the sectors, Manlapaz added. He said that limitations on access to transport system would prevent PWDs from getting education, jobs, or go to other places whenever they want it. He also expressed fear that if there will only be fewer modern transport system which will be compliant to PWDs proposed designs, such will not equally promote their rights in a society. \"Sana lahat ng jeepneys maging accessible na dahil binabago na disensyo. Hindi pwedeng isa, dalawa o tatlo lang ang accesible (We hope that all the jeepneys will be accessible since they are already starting to change the designs. And it should never be just one, two, or three alone that will be accessible),\" he added. At present, he said that the only accessible bus operating around the metropolis and nearby provinces are the point to point shuttle service. In 2010, the Philippine Statistics Authority had recorded that out of the 92.1 million households in the country, 1.4 million or 1.57 percent had some forms of disability. Manlapaz also cited the Batas Pambansa 344, also known as the Accessibility Law passed in 1983,which seeks the enhancement of the mobility of disabled persons by requiring certain buildings, institutions, establishment and public utilities to install facilities and other devices. \"The Philippines as a signatory to the UN Convention On the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, is duty bound to respect, protect and fulfill the rights of persons with disabilities to accessible built environment, public transport and information and communication technology. The use of universal design as one of the principles of the convention must be used in the design of built environment, public transport and program designs for the benefit of greater number of users including persons with disabilities, children and older persons,\" he said. For his part, Transportation Assistant Secretary for Road Transport and Infrastructure Mark de Leon said that the very reason why they are modernizing public transport is to provide access even to PWDs. \"Doors are made to fit wheelchair ramps in some units,\" said de Leon in a text message. He said that some of the chairs are removed to have space for wheelchairs. \"They should not bark at PUV modernization. DOTr (Department of Transportation) and DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) have made it a policy to make the units PWD and elderly friendly,\" de Leon said.

Grab intends to discuss this matter with the PCC,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a statement Monday. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on 25 March and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure. In the spirit of cooperating with the PCC, Grab has also agreed to continue to bear the costs of the Uber app extension (from March 25 to April 8) until April 15, 2018. Our understanding from the PCC is that this interim arrangement, which was fully explained to the PCC, is not a breach of its Order,” Cu added. Grab also said that although the Uber app will be able to operate, it has already limited functionality and support. Uber has disclosed that it no longer has the funds and manpower to continue its operations. “Grab noted that the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) has expressed concerns pertaining to customer support and safety issues arising from Uber’s limited operations. Grab wishes to stress that this interim arrangement is only for the purposes of satisfying what the PCC appears to require until Grab is able to discuss with the PCC,” Cu said.

Pimentel made the statement following news of the imminent exit of ride-hailing platform pioneer Uber from the country next week. On March 26, Singapore-based Grab acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations, covering ride-sharing services in the Philippines, as well as Uber's operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Uber's last day of operations in the Philippines will be on April 8. Pimentel said that given these developments, it was incumbent upon the LTFRB to work overtime to process pending TNVS applications and to ensure that Grab would not take advantage of its monopoly of the TNVS industry. “Many regular TNVS users regularly compared the rates of Uber and Grab before booking a ride -- an option that will no longer be available to commuters when Grab becomes the sole TNVS provider come April 9,” he noted. \"There is a legitimate fear among regular TNVS users that Grab's acquisition of Uber's operations in the country will lead to higher fares, which is the natural consequence when a player monopolizes a particular industry,\" he said. He said that it would be beneficial if any one of them starts operation, referring to the reported application of other local ride-sharing companies for accreditation to operate in the country. Last week, the LTFRB said that Go Lag, Owto, and Hype were in the process of completing their TNVS accreditations before the agency. \"The LTFRB announcement that there are three new ride-sharing companies that want to enter the country can only be considered good news if any or all of these companies actually get to service our countrymen,\" Pimentel said. \"We need real competition, not potential competition. As long as riders have zero options, they will be vulnerable to overpricing and poor service -- and this is where the LTFRB must come in,\" he added. He also called on the LTFRB to \"strike a balance between encouraging the entry of new players and the need for these players to comply with the country's TNVS guidelines.\" He urged the LTFRB to pay close attention to feedback from TNVS users and put in place mechanisms to immediately act on rider complaints. \"Social media has provided the LTFRB with the tools to monitor the prices and the performance of Grab after Uber exits. But the real test will be how they respond to the feedback from commuters. LTFRB should be ready to act on complaints to discourage Grab and its drivers from violating TNVS rules and regulations,” Pimentel said.

Since last month, the PCC hiked the mandatory notification threshold for merger and acquisition deal to PHP2 billion for the size of transaction and PHP5 billion for the size of the party from the PHP1-billion threshold for both sizes of the transaction and the party. “In Resolution No. 08-2018, PCC said its preliminary assessment of the Grab-Uber transaction conducted by the Mergers and Acquisitions Office indicated that there are reasonable grounds that the said acquisition may likely substantially lessen, prevent, or restrict competition,” PCC said. The antitrust body noted that based on its preliminary assessment, the sudden merger may adversely affect the interests of both the riding public and partner drivers. However, since the transaction does not meet the mandatory notification threshold, the TNCs can push through with the deal even while the Commission recognized that the exit of Uber from the local market will put Grab in virtual monopoly in ridesharing market.

In a statement, the PCC has urged the parties to undergo a voluntary review of the deal, if the transaction does not meet the requirements for mandatory notification. Under the new mandatory threshold, entities involved in mergers and acquisitions shall notify the PCC if the size of transaction breaches PHP2 billion and PHP5 billion for size of the party. The PCC has reminded the parties that if the deal is notifiable, Grab’s acquisition of Uber should not yet push through until the Commission has reviewed and approved the transaction. “If the transaction does not meet the threshold and is not notifiable, the parties are not so precluded but Grab and Uber are urged to allow a voluntary review to take its course before consummating to minimize the need to unscramble the deal if found to have anti-competition concerns,” the Commission said, on the other hand. “Should anti-competitive concerns arise out of the transaction review, the parties may propose commitments to remedy, mitigate, or present the negative effects to competition in the market after the acquisition,” the PCC added. But if the parties refuse to undergo a voluntary review, the Commission cautioned that it can launch a motu proprio investigation on its own initiative regarding the transaction. The Commission said the review aims to determine if the Grab and Uber merger will substantially lessen the competition in the ride-sharing market in the Philippines. The PCC will evaluate and analyze if the acquisition will result in a fare increase, deterioration of service, lesser competition, and how it will fairly compete once new transport network companies enter the market. “PCC recognizes that the exit of Uber in the Philippines will put its rival Grab in virtual monopoly in the ride-sharing market until the new players come into operation,” the antitrust body said. “The Grab-Uber acquisition is likely to have a far reaching impact on the riding public and the transportation services. As such, the PCC is looking at the deal closely with the end view of potentially reviewing it for competition concerns, as a notified transaction, or by opening a motu proprio case,” the Commission said. PCC officials met with representatives of Grab and Uber Monday to determine if their deal warrants closer scruitiny. “The consultation is taken as a sign of the parties’ willingness to comply with the provisions of the Philippine Competition Act, including ensuring real competition among ride-hailing options and promoting the welfare of the riding public,” said PCC. “PCC is committed to ensure that Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines will not harm the interest of the riding public,” it added.

Grab will be coordinating with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in processing Uber drivers that are registered in its database. “The LTFRB has agreed to provide us the masterlist of Uber’s drivers. We will be working with LTFRB to ensure smooth transition,” Cu said. He encouraged Uber drivers to register online for them to transfer to Grab. Their system seeks to gradually integrate 2,000 drivers into its platform. Cu estimates that Grab will have a total of between 55,000 and 60,000 drivers once all Uber drivers are signed in to its platform. Grab is set to meet with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) next week as it expressed their openness to a possible review on its merger with Uber. The company said that the merger will enable them to efficiently provide rides to their customers. “With the increased supply base under one TNC, you should see that allocation times will get better because the density of cars across the maps should get better. It’s easier to allocate thus the surge will not be as frequent as it used to be,” Cu said.

Kabayan Rep. Ciriaco Calalang made the statement following the recent development that ride-sharing firm Grab has acquired Uber's Southeast Asia operations. \"Given the new development of the sale by Uber of its entire Southeast Asia business to Grab, the Philippines now suddenly finds itself with a ride-hailing service monopoly -- a situation that is not good for the riding public because of the lack of competition and competitive pricing,\" Calalang said. \"It may take some weeks or months for the effects of the Uber sale to Grab to cascade to the Philippines, but it will eventually happen,\" he added. Calalang said the LTFRB should proactively encourage other transportation network companies (TNCs) to enter the Philippine market to serve more passengers and break the monopoly of Grab. \"LTFRB can do so by reducing red-tape inside the office, setting new regulations opening the TNC sector to new investors both local and foreign, and creating an environment ready for the influx of new TNCs,\" he said. \"Such proactive move shall benefit the riding public as healthy competition naturally breeds innovations, new technologies, higher standards, and lower prices,\" he added. The party-list lawmaker noted that the riding public needs more choices and better price options by having two or three more TNCs that can address the \"huge demand\" not just in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, but also in the highly urbanized cities of Cavite, Laguna, and Bulacan. He said the LTFRB could issue a new policy through a board resolution encouraging more TNCs to be accredited. \"If, after some reasonable time, the LTFRB is unable or unwilling to protect the riding public with these measures, then it may very soon be necessary for Congress to divest the LTFRB of its power to regulate TNCs,\" he said.

Duque III reminded the public in a press statement on March 26. He added that by doing these simple tips, one can avoid diseases that are rampant during the dry spell such as heat stroke or severe exhaustion. “When feeling exhausted or hazy, immediately grab a glass of cold water,” Duque said. He also cautioned penitents or those having themselves nailed on the cross to ensure that nails and other sharp objects to be used during the penitential act are well sterilized to avoid contracting tetanus infection. Tetanus can be easily contracted with the use of unsterilized or rusty nails. Hypertensive or people with high blood pressure are advised to stay home, especially between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. usually when the temperature is at its peak, as hypertension can be aggravated by severe heat and too much sun exposure. The health department also advised to avoid bringing small children or babies in crowded places to prevent them from contracting diseases, as they have lowered resistance against infections compared to adult/teens. When travelling during the Holy Week, the public is advised to bring medicines along with other necessities as a safety precaution. Before setting on a journey, one must first check the road worthiness of the vehicle. The public is cautioned as well against other emerging diseases this dry season including sore eyes or conjunctivitis, cough and colds, skin diseases and rabies. “The DOH is one with the Christian community in observing the solemnity of the Holy Week.

The Board decided to hold a consolidated hearing on the proposed fare increases by Uber and Grab, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in a radio interview Friday morning. “We aim to come up with a general fare structure for this kind of denomination,” Delgra said. “One perspective we are looking at is the improvement of TNVS services.\" Grab had earlier filed its petition, asking that their fares be increased, in addition to the base rate of PHP40, from a rate of PHP10-PHP14 per kilometer to PHP11-PHP15 per kilometer and its time charge increasing to PHP2.10 from the current PHP2 per minute rate. On the other hand, Uber is seeking for an increase of its fare from PHP5 per kilometer to PHP12 per kilometer. Both ridesharing firms said that fare hikes are necessary in order to mitigate the impact of the recent series of oil price hikes and higher excise taxes under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law. Meanwhile, the LTFRB said it is eyeing to increase the number of applications for TNVS units following the resumption of their acceptance last Monday. The Board is eyeing to process 400-500 applications daily from its current 300 with 150 slots each for Grab and Uber. “Yung pag-aaply ng TNVS operators ikinakasa namin with the help of Uber and Grab araw-araw para hindi magdagsaan (We are coordinating with Uber and Grab for the orderly processing of applications of TNVS operators),” Delgra said.

The LTFRB official said both Uber and Grab have expressed their willingness to undergo a single hearing for their fare petitions. “We want a fare structure that is good for the riding public and at the same time that we may be able to sustain the viability of the TNVS (transportation network vehicle services),” Lizada said. Grab welcomed the proposed unified fare structure for TNCs, as long as it is flexible enough to sustain their operations. “We’re OK with the unified fare structure, but it has to have the flexibility. The fare should have a range of minimum and maximum per kilometer. The dynamic pricing scheme must still be implemented,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). “Having one single rate will defeat the purpose of making use of technology in making the booking and paying for the efficient rides,” he added. The ridesharing companies use a dynamic pricing scheme on their fares, based on various factors, such as traffic, rider and driver profile, time of day and number of active drivers at a particular time. They also offer incentives and promos as a marketing and business strategy to attract more riders to avail of their services.

Hirna, a company that offers convenience to the taxi-riding public, said Cagayan de Oro will be the next city to establish its operation. Hirna, a play on the phrase “here na” or “here already”, said it will open business in this city following its launch in Davao City last month. Aminoden Guro, LTFRB-10 director, said Hirna’s entry will redound to the benefit of local passengers, noting that the popular ride-hailing companies Uber and Grab have not yet established a significant presence here. Francisco Mauricio, Hirna chief executive officer and president, said by choosing Davao and Cagayan de Oro, they aim to establish a foothold in Mindanao and work their way up to Visayas and Luzon once the business starts to pick up. Maurico said one of the key differentiating factors of Hirna is the “driver rating system” that keeps track of the drivers’ disposition on the road. Mauricio said Hirna has data analytics that look at the number of rejections made by drivers, citations, attitude problem, and other negative issues. “It [analytics] will collate to a driver rating system that would be shared between taxi operators and the LTFRB. The driver is then rated. We will know who the model drivers are and who are not,” he said. He also assured the drivers and operators that Hirna will have favorable effect on their income as the new player will not be imposing extra charges but only a minimal fee. Guro hopes the driver rating system will change the drivers’ outlook since their driving behavior and how they treat their passengers will be monitored. This will enable the agency to take appropriate action if the drivers violate existing transportation laws, he added. Among the complaints that LTFRB has been receiving from passengers included rejection, bad hygiene, and drivers wanting in good manners. At present, the city has 2,691 taxi units and close to a thousand operators, who were encouraged by the LTFRB-10 to consolidate their franchise by forming a cooperative or a corporation so they could be united, Guro said.

Senator Joseph Victor Ejercito said a diplomatic protest should be filed because “it is our sworn duty to protect and fight for our sovereignty and protect our territorial integrity.” “What China has been doing is they are already bullying the Philippine government. Of course, admittedly they are a superpower... we cannot match them in terms of military might,” he said during a press briefing. “But we have to exhaust all possible legal and diplomatic means to fight for our territories and fight for our sovereignty,” Ejercito said. He added that giving Chinese names to undersea features in the Philippine Rise is already a sign that China wanted to infringe on our territory. “May balak talaga silang kunin din sa atin ito so bakit nila papangalanan ng Chinese names yun? (They really intend to grab it from us. In the first place, why will they give Chinese names to these features?)” Ejercito said. Meanwhile, Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV stressed that Benham Rise is clearly Philippine territory and its features are not for China to name. “It is only right that the government counter any further moves to name features of our territory and propose remedies for the two formally named by China through the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO),” he said in a statement sent to media. “It is imperative that we protect our territory from any foreign interest. Dapat nang magkaroon ng matibay at malinaw na plano ang pamahalaan sa Philippine Rise, lalo ngayong unti-unti nang kumikilos ang China para ito'y angkinin (The government must have a concrete and clear plan on what to do with the Philippine Rise especially now that China is slowly moving to claim it.) ,” Aquino said. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV also urged the Philippine government on Wednesday to file a diplomatic protest against China for naming five undersea features at the Philippine Rise (formerly Benham Rise). In an interview, the opposition lawmaker said that giving Chinese names to Benham Rise features warrants a diplomatic protest at the very least. “So palagay ko (I think) this time, it warrants at the very least, a diplomatic protest dahil hndi pwedeng hahayaan na lang yan (because we should not let that happen). At least ngayon maliwanag na (At least it is clear now), dapat off limits na sa kanila itong Benham Rise (Benham Rise should be off limits to them),” he said. “Yung (The) diplomatic protest is largely symbolic na (that) we are not agreeing sa ginagawa na yan (with what they do)…. A diplomatic protest is a good first step in the right direction,” Trillanes said. In a separate interview, Senator Panfilo Lacson said the Chinese action is a solid basis for filing a diplomatic protest as the features named by China were clearly within Philippine territory. Lacson said the Philippine government should immediately work to address the issue, warning that giving Chinese names to features in the Philippine Rise can create an impression that China could lay claim to the area. “Ang apprehension natin is, kung pinangalanan ng Chinese names ang sea mounts, di far-fetched na balang araw sabihin nila kanila na naman yan. At baka mag-establish sila ng mga structures and create artificial islands just like what happened sa West Philippine Sea (Our apprehension is if they gave Chinese names to these sea mounts, it's not far-fetched that someday, they will claim it as theirs. They may even establish structure and create artificial islands just like what happened at the West Philippine Sea),” Lacson said. The senators reactions were issued after a maritime law expert bared on Monday that the IHO approved last year the names proposed by China for the features their researchers discovered in Benham in 2004. Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said the features “successfully” named by China were Jinghao and Tianbao Seamounts located some 70 nautical miles east of Cagayan; the Haidonquing Seamount located east at 190 nautical miles; and the Cuiqiao Hill and Jujiu Seamount that form the central peaks of the Philippine Rise undersea geological province. He said that all these are within the 200 nautical miles of the east coast of Luzon, “well within the legal continental shelf.” Last week, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered an end to all foreign scientific research missions in the Philippine Rise after officials said the Philippines' undisputed sovereign rights in the potentially resource-rich body of water off its northeastern coast came under question. The President followed it up with a warning that he will order the navy to fire if other countries extract resources from within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone that covers the Rise. The Philippines claimed Benham Rise as part of its continental shelf in a claim filed with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on April 8, 2009. The claim was approved under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 2012.

The initiative was derived out of the current practice of TNVS drivers who are accredited by more than one transportation network company (TNC). “The policy on a common supply base for TNVS was envisioned to create a distinct denomination for this type of public transport service and not defined by the individual business models of the TNCs, thus giving the Board a more focused regulatory function on such service,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said in a statement over the weekend. “As it is now, the current TNCs and several other TNCs who have expressed interest to the Board to provide this type of service are now free to get the supply from the common supply base for their respective network unbridled by any preference over any TNC,” he added. The LTFRB, in a memorandum issued late last week, imposed a common base of 45,700 TNVS units nationwide which were broken down as follows: Metro Manila - 45,000 TNVS units Metro Cebu - 500 TNVS units Pampanga - 200 TNVS units The cap on TNVS units was determined from relevant data given by the leading TNCs, taking into consideration churning rate, percentage of full-time and part-time TNVS, peak and off-peak hours and average daily bookings, among others. The Board will review the policy three months after it becomes effective as demand varies from time to time. The common base will enable TNVS drivers to register under ridesharing companies that are accredited by the Board.  All valid and existing certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to operate TNVS and those with pending applications are included in the common supply base. The validity of existing CPCs to operate TNVS shall remain effective subject to the new terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Board. Accredited TNCs should accept and process for accreditation only valid CPC holders. For its part, Grab said LTFRB’s move would adversely affect the number of TNVS units that they are operating amid increasing demand from their passengers. The ridesharing firm needs around 70,000-80,000 units in order to replenish their supply of transport services to the commuters. “What this supply cap does is take away the power of the part-timer who adds supply during critical supply. 45k DAILY ACTIVE DRIVERS in Manila make sense, but we need around 70k-80k total franchise holders since not all of them will be driving every day, despite any minimum active hours required,” Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu said in a social media post. The new guidelines will take effect on Feb. 3, 2018. There are around 125,000 TNVS units in Metro Manila, according to the LTFRB.

NTC 11 Regional Director Nelson Canete said the recommendation for issuance of cease and desist order (CDO) was a result of ocular investigation of radio stations operating in different cities and municipalities particularly in Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental , Davao del Norte, and Compostela Valley provinces. The recommendations submitted to NTC central office do not yet include two radio stations in Davao City that use bamboo poles for their transmitters. These radio stations, which are still subject to further investigation, are located in Matina and Toril, Davao City. \"We have not yet inspected these stations, but even if they have papers, knowing that their tower transmitters are made of bamboo pole, I will recommend show cause or cease and desist order,\" Cañete said. Among those recommended were 10 radio stations in Davao del Sur, five in Davao del Norte, several others in Davao Oriental and Compostela Valley. Canete said the NTC earlier approved CDO for two radio stations in Digos, one in Bansalan in Davao del Sur and one in Lupon, Davao Oriental.Canete said some people have earned the notoriety of going on air using frequencies which can easily be spotted because everything is now digital unlike in the past when NTC will confiscate one device in the transmitter equipment to stop operation. Others use frequency in Davao City but operate in Mati. Cañete said there is a radio station in Davao Oriental owned by a congressman that has no permit yet. He said these stations are not given frequency from the commission and they just grab it from the legal radio stations. \"Kini nga mga istasyon, wala gyud na tagai og frequency (These radio stations, we do not give them the frequency),\" he said. \"Radio stations in Davao City, including Mati are their service area. So, we have to protect these legal radio stations to serve their service areas,\" he said. Cañete said these illegal stations usually use a portable transmitter which is allegedly manufactured at home. He said under NTC rules, if an individual wants to operate a radio station, the owner needs to secure permit to install their transmitters and towers and even the transport of this material. “This year will be harsh for the broadcast (radio). Wala pa ang TV and cable (Not yet for TV and cable),” Canete stressed. In the light of the Rappler controversy, Canete said NTC does not curtail freedom of media but only see that everybody complies with the technical requirements before going on air. He said even transporting transmitters need the permit from NTC. “We will do what is for us to do. Implement CDO and show cause order,” Canete told reporters during Wednesday’s AFP-PNP press briefing at the Royal Mandaya Hotel. Starting this year, Canete said operating radio stations, television stations, and cable would already need certification from the NTC when renewing business permits with the local government units, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Canete said it will not only be the NTC that will stop broadcast firms but also the LGU, BIR and SEC. Meanwhile, NTC also scored against non-registered cellular phones. Canete said there were thousands of illegal cellular phones that were confiscated during their inspections in 2017.

The National Electrification Administration (NEA) observed that investing in a sub-transmission consortium works wonders for both Fibeco and Buseco in the Northern Mindanao province. Fibeco credits its calm demeanor to its procurement of a 69,000-volt (69kV) sub-transmission line, which it shares with Buseco, making them client-owners of the said facility. Representatives from both Fibeco and Buseco acquired it through a lease-purchase agreement with the National Transmission Corporation (Transco) in 2015, after a long and winding legal dispute that lasted several years over who should get the majority stake. When the two groups finally agreed to a 50-50 deal, Fibeco and Buseco thought it was best to use the high-voltage power line under a consortium, which then led to the creation of Bukidnon Subtransmission Corporation (BSTC). The NEA noted that prudence had dictated its acquisition at the time, as both coops feared that if they lose control over the 69kV sub-transmission asset, a bigger company might pursue its own interests in it, affecting the welfare of their member-consumer-owners (MCOs). “In order to cordon Bukidnon and in order to protect the market, they have to buy the line. That's practically the concept,” said engineer Artis Nikki Tortola, Deputy Administrator for Technical Services of the NEA and erstwhile chief operating officer of BSTC. Investing on a sub-transmission facility turned out to be a smart move for both electric cooperatives (ECs), the NEA said, as it helped mitigate the impact of potentially adverse policies they would be forced to adopt under the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (Epira). BSTC operates the 69kV sub-transmission line that spans over the areas of Tagoloan to Lunocan at 14.4 kilometers (km), Kibawe-Maramag-Aglayan at 79.05 km, and the one-kilometer Maramag-Pulangi lateral line. Tortola described it as “just like a superhighway where electricity passes through the line” and collects a corresponding toll fee from its clients, Fibeco and Buseco, which are tasked to distribute energy to the end-users. “In essence, whatever income BSTC derives from its operations eventually redounds to ECs because it could be plowed back either as a form of a reduction of rates or of their capital expenditures,” Tortola explained. “This way, potential spikes in electricity rates are likewise curbed,” added Regin Mordeno, former Fibeco board president turned chief executive officer of BSTC. “It’s the reason they are not bothered by the coal tax hike today or even the rotating blackouts that befell Mindanao in 2016.” “If you don’t own it, you are at the mercy of whoever owns the highway. So that is what we have secured and that’s why we were insulated from the crisis that happened in Mindanao. We were the only two coops that did not experience it. We were not affected,” Mordeno said. Nea said it has long been advocating banking on this kind of asset and other ventures that aim to lower the operational costs of electricity distribution for the benefit of consumers without sacrificing the growth of ECs. NEA Administrator Edgardo Masongsong is actively encouraging all power cooperatives to put up similar projects to better position themselves in a more liberalized energy market under Epira and with the onset of the Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) policy. “I hope this BSTC is one of the structures that will help us expand the horizons of the electric cooperative movement, creating enterprises that will further the interest of the electric consumers and the electric cooperatives,” Masongsong said in a statement. Masongsong is known as one of the key figures who pushed for the creation of BSTC during his time as general manager of Buseco and until he was elected as representative of 1-CARE Partylist. He said he did this to protect the ECs in Bukidnon against the possible drawbacks of RCOA. “Both ECs were actually convinced that they should not exist as mere distribution entity but they should also invest in generation or transmission in order to evolve and compete; otherwise, they will get swallowed up by the industry,” Tortola added. \"Currently, BSTC is still pretty much in its nascent stages with hopes of a promising future,\" the NEA noted. \"Unlike Fibeco and Buseco, the company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a stock profit corporation, which allows it to easily venture into other businesses.\" “Hopefully, it will not just be the sub-transmission because based on the articles of incorporation, the SEC registration, the corporation is not bound to a single business. Anything is possible. So that actually is an opportunity that BSTC could grab in the future,” Tortola said. But then, Mordeno said expansion is not an immediate priority for them because they would like to focus first on strengthening BSTC to protect the ECs it serves and their MCOs. He also has his hands full at the moment after reluctantly agreeing to fix the internal problems of Buseco. “We are meant to protect the member-consumers in a way that they will not get adversely affected by the increases in electricity rates. We aim to reduce that burden on their part. Although (the help) is not direct, through the coops, which are the owners of BSTC, we can do it,” he said.

Gilberto Cruz said on Wednesday that 65 drug surrenderers from the region’s six provinces would join the first batch of 45-day training at the police regional headquarters in this town. The second group would join a similar training in March. The initiative is in partnership with Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), Department of Health, local governments from six provinces and seven cities, Department of Labor and Employment, Philippine Red Cross, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Tacloban City Rescue Unit, Bureau of Fire Protection and Newfoundway Treatment Center. Cruz said the skills training would include welding, food processing, tailoring, electronics, mobile phone repair, motorcycle and bicycle repair, and massage therapy. Those who will complete the training will receive certificates from TESDA. The trainees will also undergo disaster and risk management training, rescue operation during emergencies, traffic management, and environmental protection and preservation. “Those are the trainings they have to undergo so they can start a new life and also be useful and helpful during times of calamities and emergencies,” Cruz added. Among the beneficiaries of the program are Gilboy from Samar and Kimberly from Southern Leyte (not their real names). Both of them will take the training on massage therapy. The two recalled that their friends influenced them to use illegal drugs. Their family only learned that they are into it after President Rodrigo Duterte launched his anti-drug war. Gilboy is one of those who volunteered to undergo the program while Kimberly is the only female beneficiary. “I want to grab this opportunity that is why I didn’t hesitate to sign up for this training,” Gilboy said. With the certificate after the training, he is confident of landing a job and to live a normal and productive life. For Kimberly, even if she’s the only female in the group, she takes it as an opportunity to show that she is capable of becoming a productive worker. “Although, I feel uncomfortable because I am the only female in this group, but my desire to change my life and be a better person is stronger,” Kimberly shared.

As we become environmentally aware, of course, there's our subconscious telling us to save, to opt being frugal and to be a good example than indulge buying colorful wrapping papers, which, not by guess, will just end up in trash.  However, despite this growing prominence of resourceful presentation of gifts, or rather, gifting the gift just as it is, a.k.a. in its naked box or packaging, it cannot be denied that gift wrapping presents affect the recipient's perception of how their loved ones are making effort.  Even Daniel J. Howard in his 1992 journal titled \"Gift-Wrapping Effects on Product Attitudes: A Mood-Biasing Explanation\" proved that gift wrapping an item has a \"favorable influence\" on the recipients' attitudes toward owning the gift.  So, staying with the culture of making your stuff look neat but doing away with the guilt of another trash pile at the end of the unwrapping, two alternatives could just be of help.  FUROSHIKI  In using a furoshiki, you'd only need a piece of cloth depending on what size your gift will be. In the internet, there are a lot of tutorials that will give you a step-by-step guide of folding and knotting clothes, from wrapping a simple square box to encasing a wine bottle.  Of the most common shape, or square, you must first position the furoshiki like a rhombus on a flat surface before putting the box in the center.  Next, grab the two ends of the furoshiki, cross them to the sides and knot the first one to the untouched corner of the cloth. After repeating the process on the other side, you can now add accent to the gift with either available decorating pieces such as tassels, feathers or a clean small branch outside your house.  Other methods to try using furoshiki:  Different ways to use Furoshiki. Illustration courtesy of Japan Ministry of the Environment  Use of furoshiki dates back to Nara period or early 8th century to wrap special valuable items.  The wrapping was called \"Tsutsumi\" or \"Hiradutsumi,\" with which the main purpose was to originally carry garments.  In Meiji period or late 19th to early 20th century, furoshiki became mass-produced when cotton spinning was popularized in Japan.  In 2006, after what seemed like a long hiatus when furoshiki significance was gradually replaced with paper and plastic bags, Japan’s Ministry of the Environment launched a campaign to \"disseminate\" culture of furoshiki to put an emphasis on taking care of the environment and avoiding wastes.  WRAPPING (BAGGING) WITH FILIPINO ACCENTS  While the Philippines does not have a furoshiki of its own, it is \"developing\" a culture using native resources at disposal unique to be distinguished as purely Filipino.  \"Yung sa atin, mga bayong, we use native materials, we have the sako, sinamay and other stuff but we don't have that same tradition as Japan.  In Japan, even their candies are so well wrapped,\" Patricia Paterno, managing director of Papemelroti said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency.  Papemelroti is a Filipino company prominent for its handcrafted gift products and personalized gift bags made from eco-friendly materials.  Demonstrating how to personalize a gift bag, Paterno said the most important material is creativity.  Using kraft cuts, scissors and glue, a simple brown bag was able to appear as a classic Christmas bag. Papemelroti's customizable woven and paper bags made from recycled materials. Photo by Jesus Escaros  Paterno said that although not as elaborate as in other countries, Filipinos do have a penchant for details, an example of which is its colorful jeepneys decorated with numerous adornment.  \"With Filipinos, mayroon tayong pagka-horror vacui. Filipinos, we like to add stuff and it's not so much the simple. With the handcrafting movement getting more and more popular, we're developing our own culture (like furoshiki).\"     Patricia Paterno demonstrates how to personalize a gift bag in their newly opened Artisan's workshop in Papemelroti, 91 Roces Ave. branch. Photo by Jesus Escaros  In the 50 years that Papemelroti is in business, naming all occasions such as Mother's day, Christmas day, and Valentine's day, Paterno said the tradition of Filipinos giving gifts have somehow changed.  \"I can't say it's dying down but the way they buy, it's different now, with the technology, they now buy online.\"  But despite this, Paterno cleared that Filipinos in all occasions are still up and inclined to buying presents to signify how much they care for someone. \"It's part of our way of saying I love you or I care for you.\"  GROWING MOVEMENT FOR HANDCRAFTS  According to Paterno, \"there is already a movement where people make their handcrafts,\" one of the reasons they put up a workshop area in the middle of the city.  \"This is our first and we'll develop it further where people can really personalize gift without so much effort on their part because sometimes a lot of people don't have all the materials at home,\" she said.  \"If they come here, they can spend half a day or whole day and make all sort of gift for their loved ones.\"  The newly opened Artisan's workshop, located at 91 Roces Ave., is open to all with PHP50 per head entrance fee.  Inside the shop, several handcrafting materials are available.

Hirna is the new taxi booking application in Davao City developed by Davao-based developers and AVIS Philippines, in partnership with Globe Telecom. Hirna is a name that plays the phrase “here now\" to symbolize speed and convenience. The taxi hailing app is accredited by LTFRB as a digital platform. It also connects to most number of taxis in the city. Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, who led the launching of the application on Tuesday, commended the transport sector for streamlining the setting up of a taxi hailing. “This marks an important development in Davao City particularly in the transport system,” she said. She said the city’s vision of low-density load traffic condition could be achieved through Hirna. “With our collective efforts the vision of a low-density load traffic condition in Davao City is a possibility that we can all achieve,” she said. The mayor underscored the need to address the traffic condition in the city, thus, the city government is trying to double its efforts to address it. One of these is implementing the city’s Comprehensive Transportation and Traffic Master-plan. The mayor also witnessed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the city government and the Department of Transportation (DoTr) for the new taxi hailing application. \"The MoU is an affirmation of a productive collaboration of the city government and DoTr,\" she said. Hopefully, she said the partnership would result in more initiatives designed to address solutions in the current traffic problems. AVIS Philippines president Francisco Mauricio said the app is different from the existing Uber and Grab since it has unique features.It has no booking fee which is beneficial to the passenger. Mauricio assured there will be no charge surge with this app because this will only follow the metered fare. \"We are really dedicated in enhancing the quality of life of our riding public,\" he said. On the part of Metro Davao Taxi Operator Association (MDTOA), the app will be a big help to their drivers. MDTOA president lawyer Rogelio Largo said that with the application, their cab drivers don't need to roam around the city to solicit passengers. \"We would like to see a day that they will just stay in non-busy areas waiting for online mobile bookings,\" he said. Largo said if all drivers are using it, there would be possible reduction of volume of vehicles plying the roads, thus easing the traffic flow. He said the app also has a feedback mechanism feature where passengers could report the behavior of the cab drivers. \"This app will enable people to provide feedback to our regulators like LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board and LTO (Land Transportation Office), in order to improve driver discipline and driver behavior, \" he said. Largo said even if majority of the drivers in the city are good yet it could not be denied that some of them are arrogant. Although the taxi industry in Davao is 'a lot better from the rest of the country', Largo said there should be improvements in the industry. Largo added the operators would be the first to shoulder the operational expenses of the app just to provide comfort to the riding public in the city.

The company is projecting that there was a 30-percent increase in demand since October this year, while the supply of its transport network vehicle services (TNVS) remain the same, according to Grab Philippines Country Head Brian Cu. “The extra load of 30-percent growth in demand will be very hard to serve. What we are doing now is trying to improve our allocation methodologies and algorithms -- the way the supply is set, providing incentives to our drivers to get them to drive a bit longer and to expand their opportunities for this holiday season,” Cu said in a press conference at Grab’s main office in Makati City Friday. “The only thing we can do is to stretch our supply because we cannot add more supply,” he added. Grab is not accepting new TNVS applications in compliance with the directive of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last July for transportation network companies (TNCs) not to accept and activate new drivers into their systems, pending review of regulations governing the ridesharing industry. Cu stressed that the TNCs should not be the ones to be blamed for the traffic jams being experienced in Metro Manila. “Well, put it this way. We stopped adding cars in August. Has traffic got better or worse? Traffic has worsened. It’s not the TNCs or TNVS that are causing traffic,” Cu pointed out. He said an average Grab ride is now taking around 45 minutes, up from 38 minutes six months ago. Grab is advising passengers to adjust their travel schedules because of the expected heavy influx of vehicles for the Christmas season. Riders may avail of the app’s carpooling feature Grab Share, wherein they can share rides with passengers traveling in the same direction and split on the payment of the fares. “Grab Share is one of the features that we have to stretch supply because it allows passengers to share their rides. It will help stretch the existing supply base that we have,” Cu explained. Grab currently has around 54,000 accredited TNVS nationwide. Of this number, 20,000 are full-time drivers. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said TNCs are not being blamed but these are among the contributing factors to the heavy traffic in Metro Manila. “On the matter of Metro Manila traffic, we are not blaming them because there are other causes as well. However, they are contributing to the heavy vehicular volume, which is the top cause of the current traffic situation in Metro Manila,” MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago said in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The MMDA expects an increase of 50,000 in vehicular volume, based on data gathered from car dealers. Other causes of the traffic in the metropolis are the malls and bus terminals located along EDSA. Around 4,022 stalled vehicles along the major thoroughfare were likewise recorded by the MMDA from January to August this year. MMDA is urging TNCs to comply with the regulations that are being implemented by the LTFRB. “We hope that the TNCs will be able to settle the matter with the LTFRB. They need to comply with the regulations. Whatever the decision of the LTFRB is, we will just enforce it,” said Pialago. LTFRB is eyeing to create a common pool number that will manage the allocation of the TNVS of ridesharing firms to address passenger demand. The board is also considering extending the validity of the TNCs' franchises from one year to three years.  (PNA)"},{"url":"https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1017161","title":"Davao bid as PH Halal hub gets boost","date":" November 27, 2017, 5:13 pm","snippet":"The opening of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Halal Verification Laboratory in Davao City will boost the city’s bid as a halal hub not only in the country, but also in the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).","body":"DAVAO CITY -- The opening of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Halal Verification Laboratory in Davao City will boost the city’s bid as a halal hub not only in the country, but also in the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). This will also open more opportunities for Davao City as halal products have a huge market, especially in the Middle East. DOST assistant regional director for technical support services Mirasol Domingo said Davao entrepreneurs who are exporting or going to explore the halal food business should grab the opportunity now that the Halal Verification Laboratory has opened. “With the laboratory, they can really test their products and the buying public will be assured that the food they buy has the halal certified sticker,” she said. On Friday, DOST opened the laboratory as part of the implementation of Republic Act No. 10817 or the “Philippine Halal Export Development and Promotion Act of 2016.\" DOST regional director Dr. Anthony Sales said the facility will serve as a laboratory processing facility which can be used by the manufacturers for halal certification. “We can serve as third-party laboratory for halal producers to make sure that there are no 'haram' contaminants in their products,” he said. Under the certification process, the producers need to have a Halal Assurance System to ensure there are no contaminants on their product. “They (manufacturers) can come to us and have their products checked,” he said. He said the facility has the state-of-the-art equipment that will ensure that products to be checked are well analyzed. Services offered in the laboratory are Porcine DNA Detection, Alcohol Content Determination, and Amino Acid Profiling. Porcine DNA Detection is the test method that will determine the presence or absence of pork (porcine DNA) using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Alcohol Content Determination will analyze the concentration of ethanol by using head space Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. The sample scopes are fermented foods, sauce, vinegar, herbs, spices, carbonated and premix drinks. Then, the Amino Acid Profiling will determine the relative amount of 17 amino acids in raw collagen, gelatin and capsules by using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) lauded the opening of the Halal Verification Laboratory in the city. NCMF regional director Norhaida Lumaan said the Muslim communities not just in the Philippines but also abroad, will benefit from this project. “We Muslims should consume halal not only for ourselves but also for our business,” she said. Lumaan also encouraged food manufacturers to produce more halal products for export. With the establishment of the laboratory, she said the NCMF will organize an accredited halal certification body in Davao City.She said only three such bodies in the Philippines and are located in Manila, Cotabato City, and General Santos City. Some exporters have their products certified abroad as there are some certifiers in the country that do not follow the standards of Muslim countries in the Middle East. Earlier, Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio expressed optimism about the prospects of the city's halal products with the opening of the lab. \"The launch of the Halal Verification Laboratory is envisioned to increase the profitability of halal products from Davao in neighboring cities in Mindanao and in the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines-East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA),\" Duterte-Carpio said. The mayor, who is also the chairperson of the Davao City Halal Industry Development Council, said the acknowledgment of the importance of the halal industry is reflective of the respect for cultural diversity in the country. \"And since Mindanao has the biggest of Muslim communities, it is only appropriate that we are at the forefront in terms of the efforts to ensure that our products are halal-certified,\" she said. \"The advent of this Halal Verification Laboratory will also position us in a better advantage in the halal industry in Asia than ever before,\" she said.

During the proceedings, respondent Karen Aizha Hamidon, 36, submitted her counter-affidavit to Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Peter Ong on the complaint filed by members of the NBI Counter-Terrorism Division. In her counter-affidavit, Hamidon, the wife of slain Ansar Khalifa Philippines (AKP) leader Mohammad Jaafar Maguid alias \"Tokboy\", sought the dismissal of the “rebellion or 296 counts of inciting rebellion” complaint lodged against her. The AKP has been identified as the group behind the September 2016 Davao City night market bombing, which was carried out with the help of the Maute terror group, and the foiled bombing attempt of the United States Embassy in Manila in December last year. Maguid died last January during a shootout with police in Sarangani province. “The fact that the respondent became the wife of the leader of AKP made her life to be of special interest to arresting persons,” the counter-affidavit stated. “Please note that Karen has been captured before for three times already and in all those arrests, she was released because there was no evidence against her person. Such that the arresting officers made a way to incriminate Karen for them to have evidence against her,” it added. Hamidon denied that she intended to recruit fighters to join the Maute group, which has claimed allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). “I vehemently deny the charges against me because there was an instigation on my part which is illegal. The acts allegedly committed were not done voluntarily and against my will and caprice,” she said in her counter-affidavit. Hamidon was apprehended by operatives of the NBI’s Counter-Terrorism Division last Oct. 11 in Taguig City. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said Hamidon has been a person of interest for some time and that the NBI has been tracking her movements and activities even before ISIS-inspired groups attacked Marawi City last May. He said Hamidon tried to recruit several Indian nationals last year using social media to come to the country and join the Maute group in Mindanao. On the day that she was arrested, the NBI discovered Hamidon's post in the social media application Telegram, asking local and foreign Muslims to help Maute fighters battling government troops in Marawi city. Prior to her arrest last Oct. 11 at her home in Taguig City, Hamidon recounted that she was contacted by a person named \"JA\" on her Facebook account back in September 2016. She noted that JA, who used as his profile picture the photo of Junaid Hussain Al Bitani, a Briton who died in Syria in 2015, introduced himself as a self-proclaimed Murabit, a Ribat-Mujahid or Muslim soldier, stationed to guard the frontier in southern Philippines. During their conversations on the chat group “Salungat ng Taghut” in the phone app Telegram, she said “he tried to gain my trust and confidence”. On Oct. 11, JA promised her he would send a wi-fi gadget and several Globe sim cards via Grab Express. That same day, she said NBI agents who initially introduced themselves as partners from Grab Express arrested her. Hamidon said she was ”cajoled and seduced into doing several acts by JA”. In fact, she said, she was instructed and told to post messages in Telegram by JA against her will and this negates felonious intent. Hamidon said this is evident in the alleged conversations between her and the undercover agent “under the possession of the NBI to which they failed to exhibit and collate as evidence.” She claimed that there was “intentional oppression of material evidence to prove voluntariness to commit a crime” on her part. She also recounted how she refused the instruction of JA to hand-stitch a black ISIS flag. “He also instructed me to record a video showing allegiance to the Islamic State but I also declined,” she added.

In a press conference in UP Diliman, Confederate for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government Employees president Ferdinand Gaite said the plan to phase-out old-jeepneys would result in higher fares ranging from PHP12 to PHP20 from the current PHP8. Gaite said that several government workers with their meager salaries could not afford the more expensive options of transportation such as taxis and transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Grab and Uber. “As it is, transportation expenses already eat up a substantial portion of employee’s salaries. Our take-home pay is not even enough to take us home,” Gaite said. Gaite said that while he sees the need to improve the public transport system in the country, the modernization program should take into account the welfare of the affected sectors and not that of the private investors and capitalists. “In many countries, a highly efficient publicly-owned mass transport system is operated not for profit but as a service of the state to bring the people to their destinations,” Gaite said. For her part, Advocates of Science and Technology for the People (AGHAM) campaign officer Cleng Julve echoed Gaite’s sentiments, saying that the government should undertake schemes that would benefit drivers, operators, and the commuting public. Julve suggested that the government grant subsidy to small and single-unit operators for rehabilitation and upgrading of technology of their vehicles.

U-HOP said they have received their accreditation last March and stopped their activation after the suspension order was released in July. “When U-HOP received the TNC Accreditation last March 2016, we were only allowed to run for four months and immediately stopped after the July suspension. We incurred considerable losses but we never complained. We followed the order even if it almost got us to the ground,” U-HOP said. “During the TNC-TWG, we asked permission to allow us to run 5,000 units, to be able to survive the competition and provide decent service to our users. We got a verbal approval,” they added. U-HOP will remove the logo in all their future certification as well as on the vehicle markings in compliance with the LTFRB order. It will likewise file a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) and clarify the matter on the activation of new applicants to the LTFRB. The Board has directed TNCs including Uber and Grab last July 11 as it reviews guidelines on the TNVS accreditation. The LTFRB has earlier said it is eyeing to extend the validity of the franchises of the TNCs from one year to three years. It also plans to issue IDs and stickers to TNVS drivers who have franchises and would require the drivers to attend the Driver’s Academy.

Ramon Lopez said economic growth should be inclusive. At the TNK opening, he said: \"A lot of good things are happening, investments are coming in, economic growth is at 6.5 percent. You’ve heard of Dutertenomics, this is the summary of the 10-point socio-economic agenda of the government of President Duterte that basically tries to widen the gain of the growth of our country.\" The TNK, which ends on October 10, is a joint program of DTI and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Lopez stressed that these gains are not just for a few, but most importantly for those who really need the government’s help. “We really want to bring development, growth, and prosperity for all. We want to empower those who belong to the bottom of the pyramid because empowering them is empowering the nation. This is the passion of the current government, this is the core of the TNK program,” he said. Lopez also mentioned positive growth in some key sectors of the economy. “We are very happy that aside from the 6.5 percent economic growth, the manufacturing sector is growing by 7-8 percent but used to be growing by only 2 percent growth rate in the past years. Investment, as share to the Gross Domestic Product (GPD), is the one pulling up our economy growing by +20 percent,” he said. The export sector, according to Lopez, has also turned around from -5 percent to about +15 percent growth, and the same with agriculture from negative to +6 percent growth. The business confidence index has also reached 43 percent. “These numbers were very low before, so you can feel the economic growth of our country is enjoying,” he said. But what is important, Lopez said, is President Rodrigo Duterte’s standing order to ensure that these gains reach the masses. “Our President always reminds us to make sure that kind of growth is felt at the base of the pyramid, that is why in all this growth, jobs are created, if they can’t find jobs, there are those whose interest are into business,” he stressed. He further cited the growing number of people wanting to venture into entrepreneurship. “In our 13 years of our advocacy on MSMEs, there is a growing awareness and likelihood of people wanting to go into business by choice, not because they are desperate for survival,” he said. Lopez said TNK is giving all opportunities for the public to grab. “We are mixing everything here. Those who would like to search for jobs or venture into business, all these opportunities are made available for the public to take. We are trying to create a culture that is really enterprising. Creating a culture of Filipinos who are success-driven, value work, who would not just depend on government dole-outs, but rather would take control of their destiny,” he said.

This after the LTFRB central office recently approved the petition of taxi operators nationwide to add several pesos to the prevailing fare. LTFRB-10 Director Aminoden Guro said taxi operators, who have not calibrated their taxi meters, cannot charge passengers with the new fare. He advised the riding public to check the meters of the taxi before paying the additional charge.In the new LTFRB order, the flag-down rate for taxicabs remains at P40, but passengers will now pay P13.50 for every kilometer, instead of P3.50 per 300 meters. Drivers can now also charge P2 per minute for the waiting time. To ensure that taxi drivers and operators comply with the order, Guro said taxi meters must be calibrated by private companies, and the units must be checked by LTFRB first before they are allowed to operate. The LTFRB has decided to implement the increase based on the petition of the drivers and operators who are complaining of higher fuel prices, the traffic congestion in Manila, and the revival of operation of the ride-hailing services, such as Grab and Uber, especially in the National Capital Region. According to the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association, the fare hike for taxis is long overdue as the last increase was in 2010. The group said taxi operators are also suffering from financial hardship due to “record-low levels of dispatch and increases in spare parts prices and other expenses.” Ringo Lago, secretary-general of the transport group Solidarity of Transport in Region X-Pagkakaisa ng Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Starex-Piston), described the fare hike as \"very laudable\". However, Lago also called on the administration to do something to solve the plight of the public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers. At the root of the transport workers' suffering, he said, is the scrapping of the oil deregulation law. The enactment of Republic Act 8479, or the Oil Deregulation Law, in 1998, led to the non-interference of the government with the pricing, export and importation of oil products, among other provisions.

We will now be basing it on a per kilometer basis. There will be an amount for running time, no longer for waiting time,” Lizada explained in a text message to reporters. The current taxi fare is set at PHP40 at flagdown and the first 500 meters, and PHP3.50 for every 300 meters and for two-minute waiting time.

Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) spokesperson Aileen Lizada said Uber and Grab have agreed, during its technical working group meeting Wednesday afternoon, to comply with its memorandum circular providing for an enhanced personal accident insurance program. “We directed TNCs to provide insurance coverage the same as LTFRB is providing extensive coverage and all risk policy. We asked both Uber and Grab to improve the coverage that their TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should be having,” Lizada said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency (PNA). The Board has partnered with the Passenger Accident Management and Insurance Agency Inc. (PAMI) and SCCI Management and Insurance Agency Corporation (SCCI) for its insurance coverage. Under LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2015-028, passengers of public utility vehicles are entitled to monetary benefits from PHP3,000 to PHP200,000 including accidental death and other injuries. Usually, only TNVS units with provisional authority (PA) and certificate of public convenience (CPC) have government-mandated PAMI coverage since these are recognized by the LTFRB to have legitimate operations. Grab’s insurance policy mandates that those without PA or CPC should be enrolled to an insurance premium while those with PAs/CPCs get the same on top of PAMI. As such, all TNVS drivers accredited by Grab are covered by insurance and passengers can settle claims against the ridesharing firm. The LTFRB earlier said Uber offers limited insurance coverage compared to its competitor that has no fault indemnity clause and all-risk coverage. A no-fault indemnity insurance clause assures that the insurance company will pay for damages incurred regardless of whose fault has caused the accident. An all-risk insurance policy provides broader coverage as it insures passengers for losses that might arise from any extreme conditions. LTFRB will issue stickers for the identification of TNVS units with PAs or CPCs, Lizada said. The TNCs also agreed that their partner TNVS drivers and operators will participate in the Drivers Academy for public utility vehicles (PUV) which was established by the LTFRB to ensure road safety and discipline. Some of the issues that were also discussed in the meeting were: penalties for erring drivers; accountability of the TNCs; fare discounts and determination; and fleet management.

The guidelines will address various concerns such as dynamic pricing scheme, rating of driver performance, etc., she said.

The Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) has partnered with Micab to improve the traffic situation in Metro Manila and other parts of the country. MiCab offers an app-based solution wherein commuters can book rides from taxi drivers similar to the TNCs Uber and Grab. Unlike Uber and Grab, MiCab only connects passengers to a network of regular taxis with franchises, not private vehicles.  “We want to improve the quality of taxi services in the country,” PNTOA President Atty.

According to Suntay, it is urgent to implement a fare increase as it has been eight years since the last adjustment was implemented. “With the fare adjustment, we would see a change in the attitude of drivers and we expect that they will be more disciplined and professional,” Suntay said. The board is likewise coordinating with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to impose stricter penalties against erring public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers. The LTFRB proposes that the license of drivers be suspended for 3 months for first offense, suspension of license for 6 months for second offense and revocation of license or downgrade to nonprofessional drivers’ license category for third offense. Data from the LTFRB shows that there are currently 32,364 taxi franchises for 50,910 units nationwide with Metro Manila having 20,910 franchises for 30,195 units. LTFRB has earlier said taxi operators should comply with the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines issued last June as part of the government's public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program. The taxi units should have automated fare collection, WiFi connectivity, dashcam, among others, to comply with the franchising guidelines. Under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines, local government units plan public transport routes based on the current and projected travel patterns in their respective areas. These routes will be contained in the Local Public Transport Route Plan (LPTRP) of LGUs that will serve as basis for franchise issuance by the LTFRB. The LTFRB has also created a driving academy for PUV drivers and operators to inculcate road safety lessons to lessen accidents on the road and proper etiquette when dealing with passengers. The PUV Modernization Program seeks to provide safe, comfortable and environmentally sustainable mode of public transport by upgrading vehicles to meet safety, energy efficiency and emission standards.

The LTFRB, in its order dated December 27, 2016, directed Uber and Grab to limit their maximum price surge to twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled excluding their base fares. Grab country head Brian Cu earlier said price surge was limited at 1.4 times its regular rate, or about PHP20 to PHP50, after its competitor Uber was suspended for a month by the LTFRB. Meanwhile, Lizada said the suspension against Uber still stands despite its disclosure in a board hearing that it has provided PHP100 million as financial assistance for the affected transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) drivers. “That is their obligation to the TNVS who they put at risk. LTFRB cannot be faulted as we are doing everything to put a stop to this. We only want that the welfare of those affected TNVS will be protected,” she said. Lizada said the agency would review Uber’s petition asking that it pay a PHP10 million fine in lieu of the one month suspension, and come up with a decision the soonest.

This, as the agency plans to increase the number of taxis plying Metro Manila roads to address the demand of commuters. LTFRB board member and spokesperson Aileen Lizada said taxi operators should comply with the omnibus franchising guidelines issued last June as part of the government's public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program. “The taxis should have automated fare collection, WiFi connectivity, dashcam, among others to comply with the franchising guidelines,” Lizada said in an interview with reporters. Under the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines, local government units plan public transport routes based on the current and projected travel patterns in their respective areas. These routes will be contained in the Local Public Transport Route Plan (LPTRP) of LGUs that will serve as basis for franchise issuance by the LTFRB. The LTFRB said it is planning to meet with taxi operators who are partnering with taxi-hailing app MiCab to discuss the issue of granting more taxi franchises. MiCab has earlier said that it would partner with as many as 7,000 cabs in Metro Manila this year. The service, which is available in Cebu and Iloilo, is aiming for an initial 3,000 taxis in the metropolis by October. Unlike transportation network companies (TNCs) Uber and Grab, MiCab only connects passengers to a network of regular taxis with franchises, not private vehicles. It also allows users to give feedback about their taxi ride and rate their driver. The agency, she said, would coordinate with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to craft policies that will impose stricter sanctions on abusive taxi drivers. “The board is contemplating on the idea to link up with LTO to issue some policies. We are leaning towards the direction wherein a taxi driver’s license will be suspended for a certain number of months for the first offense and cancellation of their licenses for subsequent offenses,” she said. In a Malacanang press briefing Tuesday, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said the agency is considering more taxis on the roads to address the growing demand for them and at the same time, force abusive taxi drivers to shape up. \"We would like to get the help of transport planners and an expert of UP on how to calibrate giving or opening up more franchises again to address supply of taxi... I mean, to put in more supply in order to address demand,” Delgra added.

Leo Gonzalez, head of the Public Affairs, said Grab is testing the environment in Davao City if Davaoenos are ready to pay higher fares for a more convenient ride. Gonzalez stressed the company is looking more on the demand side under such operation. He said the company has already expressed interest with the Land Transportation and Franchising Board (LTFRB) to operate in the city. GrabCar is a car-booking application that dispatches private vehicles. The app has high demand in Metro Manila. Grab has been operating in Davao City since 2014 when it partnered with taxi operators and drivers in Davao for GrabTaxi. Jose Thor Villarreiz, Grab Davao Manager, said there are now 1,300 Grab-a-Taxi drivers still using the Grab platform averaging about 500 drivers active per day. When Grab started in Davao City there were about 2,600 because of the incentives they offered to establish the brand. Meanwhile, on Friday, Grab Philippines revealed it has already accepted 100 drivers from Uber as of Friday, August 18, after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) allowed transport network vehicle services (TNVS) units to transfer to two other accredited Transport Network Companies (TNCs). Grab Philippines Country head Brian Cu, however, is not sure how many will be joining Grab. “It is yet to be seen,” Cu said when asked how many the company would take in. Cu, who was here for the 32nd Kadayawan sa Dabaw, said Grab will just submit a list to LTFRB daily until his company will be told it is enough. The submission of a list is required by LTFRB. On Thursday, LTFRB released Board Resolution No. 19 stating Uber TNVS units will be allowed to transfer to two other accredited TNCs like Grab and UHOP to ease the burden of commuters. Under the said resolution, the TNVS should only show their proof of accreditation by Uber and insurance coverage. Grab and UHOP should submit to the LTFRB a list of operated TNVS on a daily basis. Cu said, “We will accommodate the members of the TNVs community who want to join Grab’s platform so long as they abide by the requirements clearly stated in the order and the company’s policies.” Cu said Grab is also looking at people whose livelihood is affected by the suspension of the operations. Uber was suspended last August 14 and was ordered to cease and desist the operations of its online booking applications. Cu stressed that Grab understands very well about the lack of supply to serve the need of the riding public. With LTFRB’s resolution, Cu is optimistic Grab can meet the demand beginning on Monday. To maintain Grab’s quality of service, Cu said drivers will undergo training, cross check their background. “We’re focused on serving drivers and consumers, and ensuring that the car-and-taxi-hailing transport continues to run as smoothly as possible,” he said. He added that aside from the fare cap which Grab put in place to ensure consumers continue to pay a reasonable fare, Cu said Grab also ensures that the onboarding process will be smooth so that TNVs drivers can start to make a loving again.

The complaint comes after the one-month suspension imposed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board against the transport network company (TNC). Based on the complaint filed by Kilusan sa Pagbabago ng Industriya ng Transportasyon chairman Vigor Mendoza II, Melencio “Boy” Vargas of the Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines, Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Associations of the Philippines (Fejodap) President Zenaida Maranan, Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) president Efren de Luna, Pasang Masda President Roberto Martin, Orlando Marquez of the Liga ng Transportasyon at Opereytor sa Pilipinas and Fermin Octobre of the Drivers Unite for Mass Progress Equality and Reality (DUMPER), Uber has accredited 74,687 vehicles but only 21,353 have been authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). This means that the remaining 53,334 vehciles are 'colorum' or operating illegally. “These vehicles were operating without a valid authority from the LTFRB, thus colorum…Respondents [Uber officials], as officers and members of the Board of Director of Uber, knowingly and willfully violated the orders of the LTFRB, and consented and approved their company’s illegal activity of operating vehicles as public utilities without the proper and valid authority coming from the LTFRB, otherwise known as ‘colorum’ activities,” the complainants said. Complainants said they are not against Uber but against its stance “of wanting to be above the law.” “Operating more than 50,000 colorum vehicles sets a dangerous precedent, and if not stopped would wreck havoc to the country’s transport plans and programs, specifically the Modernization Program, which aims to enhance transport service and uplift the lives of transport workers,” the complaint stated. “If Uber can get away with this, then all other modes of transport service might as well forget their franchise and just operate as colorum, just like Uber,” they added. Complainants also noted that LTFRB already ordered TNCs to suspend accepting applications for additional vehicles, but still, Uber continued to accept new applicants. They added that despite LTFRB’s order suspending Uber’s operation, it continued with its operation citing the experience of a certain Kenneth Lugtu who managed to book Uber services on Aug. 15, a day after the LTFRB suspended its operation. On Tuesday, LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said Uber' suspension remains in effect despite its pending motion for reconsideration asking the LTFRB to lift the suspension order issued Monday. Lizada said the agency will continue to apprehend the transport network vehicle services (TNVS) of Uber if they were found to be still operating on the road. In its motion, Uber stated that the LTFRB suspension order against it was a “blatant violation” of its right to due process. Furthermore, it said that there was no proof it violated the LTFRB’s order stop the activation of new drivers. “Over the course of this morning, tens of thousands of riders were left stranded, causing needless inconvenience, while drivers were unable to access the earning opportunities they rely on. We are looking forward to urgently resolving this matter with LTFRB in the interests of everyone who depends on Uber every day,” Uber said in its official Facebook page. Lizada questioned Uber for resuming operations despite the suspension order, after filing the MR. “What Uber did now saying that they will now be online, they are putting at risk all of its TNVS. What kind of a partner is that? We want Uber to uphold a level of accountability and not leave their TNVS partners behind,” Lizada said. She further said that the board considers Uber’s continuing operations despite the suspension of its accreditation as acts of contempt. For his part, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III reiterated that the mere acceptance of Uber of new drivers into its system is already a violation of its order. He said the board has apprehended 19 “colorum” Uber and 16 “colorum” Grab TNVS which have no certificates of public convenience or provisional authority. “The TNCs have already admitted that some of their TNVS are colorum.

Tabal, together with 37 other members of the Philippine track and field team, were given a special and upbeat send-off on Tuesday. The event was organized by Philippine Track and Field (PATAFA), headed by Philip Ella Juico, and backed by corporate supporters. The marathon will be the first event in athletics and is set on August 19 at 6:15 a.m. for the women’s event. The gun start for men is set 15 minutes earlier, at 6:00 a.m. Tabal settled for the silver (3:04:39) in the 2015 edition of the regional biennial meet held in Singapore. Her time was over 1:14 minutes against gold medalist Natthaya Thanaronnawat of Thailand, who clocked 3:03:25. “We studied the course and I’ve prepared for it,” said Tabal, as she noted that the course has five loops and mostly flat surface. “I think it’s a great advantage,” she added. “I'm aiming for the gold and just good conditioning, 'yun lang talaga,” Tabal said. Tabal, whose athletics career began when she was 12 years old, said that her current weight “is just perfect for a marathon weight”.

Its insurer Great American Insurance offers coverage in the event of accidental death, permanent dismemberment and bodily injuries in the event of accidents for drivers and passengers. For death or permanent disability, Grab's TNVS drivers, partners, and passengers can claim up to USD 4,100 or PHP 200,000; while up to USD 410 or PHP 20,000 can be claimed for medical reimbursements.  Moreover, coverage varies for different types of injuries. Grab also reminds its TNVS partners to always abide by the law. “Any violation that would result to serious physical injuries or would put Grab’s credibility in question would be tantamount to suspension or even deactivation of their respective accounts,” according to Gonzales. “Grab always puts the interests and welfare of its partners and passengers at the heart of its priorities. It is important for us that they are assured of peace of mind as they take and complete a Grab ride,” he added. Accountability was one of the issues discussed during the two congressional hearings held last week to tackle the issues involving TNCs. Insurance coverage for the passengers was identified as the means to ensure passenger safety and security.  (PNA)"}]}
