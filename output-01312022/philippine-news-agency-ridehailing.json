This, as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has licensed the firm to operate as an electronic money issuer last August. In its statement, Grab said that its users will now be able to order food, pay their bills and purchase from stores and restaurants starting this Thursday through its GrabPay mobile wallet services. “With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps,” according to Ooi Huey Tyng, Managing Director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Users can load their GrabPay credits through online banking, ATM deposits, selected business establishments, credit card payments or to any eligible Grab driver. GrabPay is currently used in booking rides, package deliveries and for topping up mobile prepaid credits. The company is working on its integration to food deliveries. The Philippines is the fifth country in the Southeast Asian region where the full suite of its GrabPay mobile wallet services becomes available. Grab is eyeing to diversify its services from ridehailing to mobile payments and food deliveries. (PR)"}]}
