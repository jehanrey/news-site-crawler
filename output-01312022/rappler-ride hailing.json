The new name was announced Friday, January 28, in Kuala Lumpur, as part of the group’s pivot to being a travel and lifestyle brand.  “It’s a significant milestone that marks a new era for the group. Today’s announcement reinforces we are not just an airline anymore,” said Capital A CEO Tony Fernandes. The name change is effective immediately, following registration on January 3 with the Companies Commission of Malaysia and the subsequent approvals received by the group on Thursday, January 27. Fernandes said that it has always been his intention to rename the AirAsia Group. The pandemic, he said, allowed the group to accelerate that strategy. “While the airline will always underpin the AirAsia brand, it has long been my firm intention, well before COVID hit, to leverage the strong data we have built up over 20 years and incorporate industry-leading new technologies to offer a broad range of products and services, over and above selling just airfares,” Fernandes said. In November 2021, Fernandes told reporters that the group was thinking of changing its name. Prior to that, AirAsia Investment, the group’s airline segment, was renamed AirAsia Aviation. Currently, Capital A has 16 products and services across the region, including airline, e-commerce, financial technology, ride-hailing, and logistics businesses. “While Capital A will be the new group holding company name, one thing that isn’t changing is the AirAsia brand name for our airlines. It’s one of the strongest brands in Asia and provides a solid platform for all of our other products and services to leverage from each other,” Fernandes said. Fernandes said that Capital A expects to see around 50% of overall group revenue by 2026 from non-airline businesses. Capital A also targets the following: From October to December, airline business AirAsia sold 2.7 million seats, a 103% jump year-on-year. AirAsia Philippines, meanwhile, sold over 350,000 seats during the fourth quarter of 2021, up by 201% from the same period in 2020. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/waymo-zeekr-partner-develop-driverless-taxis/","title":"Waymo and China’s Zeekr partner to develop driverless taxis","date":"Dec 29, 2021 1:15 PM PHT","snippet":"The vehicles will be designed and developed at Zeekr's facility in Sweden, and later integrated with Waymo's self-driving technology","body":"China’s Geely Holding said its premium electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will make electric vehicles for Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving unit, to be deployed as fully autonomous ride-hailing vehicles across the United States. The vehicles will be designed and developed at Zeekr’s facility in Sweden, and later integrated with Waymo’s self-driving technology, Geely said on Tuesday, December 28. Waymo said it would introduce the vehicles to US roads “in the years to come.” Concept images Waymo published on Tuesday show a roomy, low-to-the-ground minivan with seating for about five riders and sliding doors on each side serving as the lone entryways. Waymo is the first and only fully driverless taxi service in the United States. It has driven thousands of people since launching the service a year ago in Phoenix.

Yet, whether the Philippines or the United States, it might well seem like it is always a matter of two steps forward and one step back as the coronavirus continues to evolve and so too the responses to it.  In our annual look back at Asia’s winners and losers, we find even the good news was bad in the year that was. The chaotic US withdrawal in August 2021 brought to an end an era of advancements in Afghanistan, and hunger and misery are on the rise again in one of Asia’s poorest nations. Still, even amid the “worse off” some are even more “worse off.” Sadly we give “worst year’ in Asia to Afghanistan’s beleaguered and increasingly-at-risk women and girls. The US presence in Afghanistan – the “graveyard of empires” – was doomed in part by hubris and denial. But a bright spot of the last 20 years was the dramatic improvement in the lives and opportunities for Afghanistan’s women and girls.  A record number of Afghan girls went to school. Women ascended in public life, taking on roles as ambassadors, parliamentarians and civil society leaders. The “Afghan Dreamers” – an all-female, high school robotics team – won acclaim in international competitions. Now, under a back-in-power Taliban, the worst may still be to come for Afghan’s women and girls as the world looks away. One-time de facto leader of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi found herself at year-end 2021 back where she has spent so many years – under detention by a military government – and takes the prize for “bad year” in Asia. After a military coup, the Nobel laureate was detained, tried, and found guilty on charges of incitement and breaking COVID-19 rules. Stalled democratic reforms and the persecution of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority, which she did little to stop, had already dimmed the democracy icon’s prospects of instituting lasting change in her country. She is not alone though as the pandemic provided added cover for governments in Asia to restrict civil liberties and clamp down on protests. The awarding of a Nobel Peace Prize to Rappler’s own Maria Ressa and Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov underscored the challenges to free press and democracy worldwide. With her future now looking very much like her past, Suu Kyi offers up a case study of just how difficult it is for democracy to take root and thrive not only in Myanmar but in all of Southeast Asia. With the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics ultimately held in 2021 shining bright, and Beijing’s 2022 winter counterpart facing hurdles even before the games begin, the international Olympics sporting movement in Asia has had a decidedly mixed year. Despite concerns over budgets and COVID-19, the delayed Tokyo Olympics provided a much needed distraction from the pandemic. American gold medalist gymnast Sunisa Lee dazzled the world. And athletes from host nation Japan won the third most gold medals, after athletes from the US and China. Now in the countdown to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have announced a diplomatic boycott of the games over China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority and other human rights concerns. A now vanished social media post by Chinese star tennis player Peng Shuai that was interpreted as alleging sexual misconduct by a former communist party leader had many posting #WhereIsPengShuai? – and raising prospects of more protests to come. These developments have many questioning whether the International Olympic Committee had put profits over principle, and whether the organization can live up to its charter of “promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.” Amid the gloom and doom of 2021, Southeast Asia’s fintech firms benefited from changing consumer habits and growing investor interest. Lockdowns throughout Southeast Asia forced many indoors and increasingly online, accelerating a trend that was already gaining steam in Thailand and elsewhere before the pandemic hit.  In the first nine months of 2021, Southeast Asia saw a record 80 fintech deals worth US$3 billion, exceeding what was invested in 2019 and 2020 combined and making it a very good year for the sector. A one-time unicorn that has integrated itself into the lives of Southeast Asia’s citizens is Grab – the “Everyday Everything App” – which evolved from a ride hailing app to a digital platform and superapp that offers financial services, deliveries and much more throughout the region. In the largest SPAC merger and public listing deal of its kind, Grab went public at a nearly $40 billion valuation in December. Southeast Asia’s fintech players are also benefiting from venture capital shifting away from China as Beijing puts the brakes on the sector’s development and reins in one-time high-flying success stories, including Alibaba Group’s affiliate company Ant Group and founder Jack Ma. It now seems we will need to look also to Southeast Asia, rather than Northeast Asia, for digital trends that will shape our future. Hard-pressed to find anyone having had a great 2021, we give the dubious distinction of “best year” in Asia to the region’s new Cold War warriors. Year 2021 sadly proved to be a banner year for a return to Cold War rhetoric.  The election of US President Biden proved to be no panacea for troubled superpower relations as China’s President Xi Jinping stayed home, and Chinese nationalists and state-owned media including now “retired” Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin sought to push back against leaders from Australia, Canada and other nations whose views and values clashed with those of China. Social media in 2021 amplified the nationalistic rhetoric of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats, and bots and trolls made matters worse. The spread of COVID-19, China’s rapid military buildup and development of hypersonic missiles, militarization of the South China Sea and crackdowns in Hong Kong and China’s Xinjiang region as well as threats to Taiwan all heightened tensions. Is the United States in a Cold War with China? The answer could be “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” depending on the day of the week. The answer not only has deep implications for China and the United States, but for the Philippines, ASEAN and the world as nations navigate the US-China relationship and look to a better 2022. – Rappler.com Curtis S.

A police report said: “Victim was riding his Suzuki S-Presso car. As victim was maneuvering his vehicle going to the gate of Urban Deca Homes when suspects shot the victim on the right side of the driver’s window.”  The killing, which happened 8:25 am on Tuesday, was captured on CCTV. The video showed the two suspects riding  a motorcycle approached the driver side of the victim’s vehicle. The rider was wearing a black and blue shirt similar to the uniform of ride-hailing service Angkas. Police are still finding out if he was affiliated with Angkas or was only wearing a similar shirt.  After the first volley of gunshots, Inocando was able to get down from the passenger side of his vehicle and run for at least 35 meters. But the suspects still chased him on their motorbike. The victim’s body was found later in front of the EastWest Bank branch at the commercial building in front of the village. Some of the glass windows of the bank were shattered apparently from a hail of bullets.  The responding scene of the crime operatives (SOCO) team of Mandaue City Forensic Unit, led by Police Master Sergeant Joseph Bacuyan, recovered 6 spent slugs and 16 pieces of fired cartridge cases.  SOCO also found inside Inocando’s vehicle a Black Widow caliber 9mm revolver and 4 pieces of live ammunition. In a press interview, Major James Mosota Conaco, head of the Subangdaku Police Station in Mandaue City, said that Inocando was apparently arrested last February 24. “He has a case in Argao which is a violation of RA 10591on illegal possession of firearms. He was able to post bail and was released in March 2021. He still has an ongoing case,” Conaco said in Cebuano. Inocando was also booked on complaints of Alarm and Scandal.  Police do not yet know the motive for the killing. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/finance-and-industries/rising-food-businesses-share-secrets-surviving-covid-19-pandemic/","title":"These rising food businesses share secrets in surviving the pandemic","date":"Dec 10, 2021 9:27 AM PHT","snippet":"Golden Grab Awards winners Blake’s Wings and Steaks, Thai Mango, and Corndog 28 are some of the new kids on the block","body":"Editor’s note: This press release is sponsored by Grab and was handled by BrandRap, the sales and marketing arm of Rappler. No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. In the Food & Beverage (F&B) landscape, no restaurant owner is assured a win amid the highly competitive nature of the industry. And with the pandemic initially halting operations, restaurants were forced into an even tougher challenge of surviving the unexpected.  Despite these challenges, however, it soon seemed that not all hope was lost for small and medium food businesses. Despite many competing brands and changes in customer habits, online food deliveries helped provide businesses another avenue to reach customers.   While the online food delivery industry was already rising even before the pandemic, the shift from offline to online accelerated further when Filipinos were forced to stay at home. Since then, online food delivery services have become a way of life.  “Food is a big part of our culture, and online food delivery opened a world of endless possibilities for us food-loving Filipinos. Now, any food craving can be satisfied with just a few taps on your phone. And we at GrabFood are proud to contribute to that satisfaction by providing Filipinos with the widest range of restaurant selection,” said Greg Camacho, GrabFood Philippines’ head. Leading online food delivery service GrabFood consists of thousands of restaurants for Filipinos to choose from, including up-and-coming restaurants Blake’s Wings and Steaks, Thai Mango, and Corndog 28. More than just surviving the challenges of the pandemic, these businesses also brought home sought-after recognitions at the recent Golden Grab Awards 2021, which celebrated Grab’s best-performing merchant-partners. Known for its flavorful wings and steaks, casual dining restaurant Blake’s Wings and Steaks has been a GrabFood merchant-partner even before the pandemic. Starting out as a friendly neighborhood restaurant in Marikina, family-owned business Blake’s Wings and Steaks has since expanded to seven branches – all available for delivery via GrabFood. With the delivery app’s “long-distance delivery” feature, the restaurant was able to even further expand its delivery range up to a 10KM radius, reaching even more customers across the metro. “We got most of our sales from the Grab app – maybe 90% or even 95% come from the Grab app – so that’s really how Grab played a huge role in how we’re still thriving in the business now,” said Blake’s Wings and Steaks owner Joana Manalo. Aside from their presence in GrabFood, Blake’s Wings and Steaks recognizes the importance of a well-curated online menu. Because of its visually appealing and creative menu options, they were given the “Menu Maven” award. Aside from GrabFood’s Long Distance Delivery feature that expands restaurants’ delivery range, merchant-partners can also benefit from GrabFood’s 24/7 operations. Thai Mango Dessert by Chef Kim, which was recognized as the “Newbie No More” at the Golden Grab Awards, is one of the many merchant-partners that acknowledge the positive impact of the 24-hour service. What they once thought would only work for big-name brands, the 24/7 operations helped their business expand to a new set of customers: the night shift workers. With a goal of becoming the pioneer of 24/7 Thai food delivery, Thai Mango Dessert provides healthy options for those working at night or have late-night cravings. From one branch in March last year, this Newbie No More merchant-partner has now expanded to five branches across Metro Manila. A rise in online delivery services has also brought about the need for restaurants to adapt to a more delivery-friendly packaging that not only preserves the quality of their food, but also gives customers a more enjoyable eating experience. Korean corndog food business Corndog 28 bagged the “Pack It Like It’s Hot” award because of their dedication to innovating through their packaging. Beyond being functional, Corndog 28 owner Eugene Leo Uy also stressed the importance of creating an attractive packaging. “It’s one of the main entry points for the customer to really see and understand your product,” he shared. In the age of digital content creation, an aesthetically pleasing or “Instagrammable” dish is bound to make a restaurant more impactful to consumers. It goes without saying the pandemic took the world by surprise – but this did not stop Grab from rising up to the challenge of serving Filipinos. From being just a ride-hailing app to the super-app it is today, Grab now offers a food delivery service with GrabFood, an on-demand groceries and essentials service with GrabMart, a parcel delivery service with GrabExpress, and a safe and rewarding e-wallet with GrabPay. “At the onset of the pandemic, movement was much more limited—even for a delivery service like us. But that challenge is what motivated us to find solutions to how we can provide Filipinos their cravings and essentials. Aside from customers who needed safe and convenient access to their essentials, we also had our delivery, driver, and merchant-partners to think of – and how we can continue to provide them with income opportunities,” said Anton Bautista, Grab Philippines’ head of deliveries. GrabFood, first launched in the Philippines in 2018, is now available in 107 cities. As the company expanded its operations to more locations, even more merchant-partners have joined the platform, some even joining its GrabFood Signatures program which allows them to be available for delivery only on GrabFood and enjoy exclusive benefits and marketing opportunities from Grab.  To encourage customers to continue supporting their favorite food businesses, Bautista assures that both customers and merchant-partners can look forward to more promos and features in the coming year, including an enhanced Self Pickup service for a more convenient ordering experience, as well as new offerings through GrabFood Signatures. “With the country slowly easing back into the ‘old normal’, we anticipate more consumers choosing to eat out. Despite this, we at GrabFood are always thinking of opportunities to provide our merchant-partners the same level of support we’ve given them in the past two years. As we continue adapting, one thing is certain: We will continue to provide our fellow Filipinos with the safety and convenience they have relied on with us,” said Bautista. – Rappler.com Hungry?

No member of the news and editorial team participated in the publishing of this piece. As it becomes the first-ever bell ringing ceremony in NASDAQ for Southeast Asia, Grab makes its debut after the company agreed to go public in a record-breaking SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth. With Grab known for providing the community with their everyday needs, its merchant-partners and driver- and delivery-partners reciprocate their support to the company during this huge milestone. Known for its best-selling Spinach Dip pizza, Angel’s Pizza owner Justin Liu is one of the thousands of Grab merchant-partners who are looking forward to Grab’s listing in the US. Understanding what this will mean for the entire community of MSMEs and driver- and delivery-partners on the Grab platform, he shares how this milestone will benefit more aspiring entrepreneurs out there. Through Grab, his business was able to achieve the highest standard of food safety through a partnership with FoodSHAP, as they are guided by key food safety and food handling standards, as well as overall hygiene protocols. Apart from this crucial recognition from the industry, he also highlighted how they are given learning opportunities to further succeed and grow their businesses.  “It’s going to have a rippling effect. [It makes me happy to think that businesses like ours can grow] through Grab, and because of that, we will also be able to serve more customers, given the additional perks and benefits that we will receive from them. I am very happy to see how all the support Grab has been giving us, is and will continue to reciprocate three-fold.” Liu shared. Meanwhile, the suspension of mass transport on the onset of the pandemic has thrown challenges for the ride hailing services industry but GrabCar driver-partner Carlo Mamaril did not think twice about looking for other sources of income as Grab continues to support his everyday needs and prepare him for long-term growth. More than just a platform that gets drivers- and delivery-partners onboard and provides livelihood opportunities, Grab always finds ways to support its partners in their everyday needs and allow them to succeed in their roles within and beyond the platform. These, along with livelihood support such as financial aid, training, and incentives, help all drivers- and delivery-partners cushion the challenges they are faced today and prepare for greater opportunities ahead. “Nakakatulong po ang Grab sa aming pamumuhay sapagkat bukod sa mga kinikita namin sa ibinabayad ng passengers na fare at incentives sa Grab, ay hawak pa namin ang aming oras at mas may oras kami sa pamilya at sa pag-abot ng aking mga pangarap balang araw. (Grab has helped us truly in our livelihood because apart from the income we get from passengers’ fares and the incentives we receive from the platform, we are also flexible with our time and gives us the time to be with our family and work towards achieving our dreams someday.)” he said. These testimonials from Liu and Mamaril are just two from the thousands of merchants and driver- and delivery partners who share the same sentiments. The whole Grab community is empowered with the news of Grab’s listing because they have witnessed how the company has already given them the support they need for their everyday needs and to thrive even beyond the platform.  With its goal of providing the everyday needs of the Filipino people through its services, Grab Philippines Country Head Grace Vera Cruz highlighted on LinkedIn the importance of this event, not just for the company, but how it will affect their stakeholders. “Grab’s debut at NASDAQ will enable the company to accelerate its efforts to help support more Filipinos. Through this, we are hopeful that we will be able to reach more small business owners and driver- and delivery- partners like Kim and Roberto in more parts of the country,” the country head said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/didi-global-announces-plan-delist-new-york-stock-exchange-shares-december-3-2021/","title":"Didi shares plunge more than 20% on plan to delist from NYSE","date":"Dec 4, 2021 10:20 AM PHT","snippet":"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global loses about $8.4 billion in market value as it announces it will delist from the New York Stock Exchange","body":"HONG KONG – Just five months after its debut, ride-hailing giant Didi Global said it plans to withdraw from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and pursue a Hong Kong listing, a stunning reversal as it bends to Chinese regulators angered by its United States initial public offering (IPO). Reaction from investors was swift: the company’s shares fell 22.17%, losing about $8.4 billion in market value. At their close of $6.07 on Friday, December 3, Didi shares have fallen about 57% since their June 30 IPO price. “Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York Stock Exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,” Didi said on its Twitter-like Weibo account. Didi did not elaborate but said in a separate statement it would organize a shareholder vote at an appropriate time and ensure its New York-listed stock would be convertible into “freely tradable shares” on another globally recognized exchange. Market participants said the decision ramps up uncertainty for investors in US-listed shares of Chinese companies. US-listed shares of Alibaba, Baidu, and other Chinese firms fell on Friday. “If you are a money manager and don’t understand what the rules are, it’s easier to just sell and move your money where you better understand the rules of the game,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird. Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had pressed Didi’s top executives to devise a plan to delist from the NYSE due to concerns about data security. Didi’s board convened on Thursday, December 2, and approved the US delisting and HK listing plans, said two sources with knowledge of the matter. Didi pushed ahead with a $4.4-billion US IPO in June despite being asked to put it on hold while Chinese officials reviewed its data practices. The powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) then quickly ordered app stores to remove 25 of Didi’s mobile apps and told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest. Didi, whose apps, in addition to ride-hailing, offer products such as delivery and financial services, remains under investigation. Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, said Didi may need to buy shares at the $14 IPO price to avoid legal issues and at the very least pay more than the current share price. However, uncertainty remained over what the delisting means for investors. “There may also be some hope that by doing this, Didi management will improve its regulatory relations, but I am less confident on that,” Boodry added. The upending of Didi’s New York listing – likely to be a difficult and messy process – underscores the huge clout Chinese regulators possess and their emboldened approach to wielding it. Billionaire Jack Ma ran afoul of Chinese authorities after blasting the country’s regulatory system, leading to the dramatic scuppering of a mega-IPO for Ant Group last year. Didi’s move will likely further discourage US listings by Chinese firms and could prompt some to reconsider their status as US publicly traded companies. “Chinese ADRs face increasing regulatory challenges from both US and Chinese authorities. For most companies, it will be like walking on eggshells trying to please both sides. Delisting will only make things simpler,” said Wang Qi, chief executive of fund manager MegaTrust Investment (HK). Didi plans to proceed with a Hong Kong listing soon and is not looking at going private, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. It aims to complete a dual primary listing in Hong Kong in the next three months and delist from New York by June 2022, said one of the sources. The sources were not authorized to talk to the media and declined to be identified. Didi did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, and the CAC has yet to comment on its announcement. “Not long after the IPO US investors had been trying to sue DiDi for failing to disclose its ongoing talks with the Chinese authorities. This is unlikely to be taken any better,” said William Mileham, an equity analyst at Mirabaud. “It appears that DiDi are not waiting to be dual-listed, but could well be delisted from the US before it starts trading on the HK stock exchange.” Listing in Hong Kong, however, might prove complicated, particularly in a three-month timeframe, given Didi’s history of compliance problems and scrutiny over unlicensed vehicles and part-time drivers. Only 20% to 30% of Didi’s core ride-hailing business in China is fully compliant with regulations requiring three permits relating to the provision of ride-hailing services, vehicle licensing, and drivers’ licences, sources have previously said. Didi’s IPO prospectus said it had obtained ride-hailing permits for cities that together accounted for the majority of its rides. It has not responded to further queries about permits. Those problems had been Didi’s main obstacle to conducting an IPO in Hong Kong earlier and it is unclear whether the bourse will approve it now, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. “I don’t think Didi qualifies to be listed anywhere before it…sets up effective protocols to manage and ensure the drivers’ responsibility and benefits,” said Nan Li, associate professor for finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The Hong Kong bourse does not comment on individual companies, a spokesperson said. Didi provided 25 million rides a day in China in the first quarter, its IPO prospectus said. Its main shareholders are SoftBank’s Vision Fund, with a 21.5% stake, and Uber Technologies, with 12.8%, according to a filing in June by Didi. Sources have also told Reuters that Didi is preparing to relaunch its apps in China by the year’s end in anticipation that Beijing’s cybersecurity investigation of the company would be wrapped up by then. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/timeline-grab-holdings-history-launch-nasdaq-listing/","title":"TIMELINE: Southeast Asia’s Grab takes a ride to $40-billion SPAC listing","date":"Dec 3, 2021 1:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are some milestones for Grab, from the time it was conceptualized in a Harvard Business School venture competition plan in 2011 to its Nasdaq listing in 2021","body":"SINGAPORE – Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery platform Grab Holdings listed on the Nasdaq via the world’s largest special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal worth $40 billion.

The deal is the world’s biggest ever by a blank-check company and the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian firm. Founded in 2012, Grab is Southeast Asia’s largest startup, valued at just over $16 billion last year. It launched as a Malaysian taxi-hailing service and now calls itself a “superapp” after expanding into food, grocery, and parcel delivery and to digital payments, lending, and other financial services. Singapore-headquartered Grab operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region, counting Indonesia as its biggest. Its venture with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd was awarded a digital bank license in Singapore last year. Grab gained the global spotlight in 2018 when it bought the Southeast Asian business of Uber Technologies in return for the US ride-hailing company taking a stake in Grab. With some 8,000 employees, Grab has tech centers in Singapore, Beijing, Seattle, Bengaluru, and other places. Early investors include Japan’s SoftBank, China’s Didi Chuxing, and venture capital firms Vertex Ventures Holdings and GGV Capital. Grab raised about $12 billion ahead of the listing. Investors range from venture and hedge funds to automobile companies and other ride-hailing firms, and include Uber, Booking Holdings, China Investment Corporation, Coatue Management, Hillhouse Capital, Hyundai Motor Company, Invesco Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, Ping An Capital Company, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Yamaha Motor Company. In the SPAC deal, about three dozen investors came on board including Temasek Holdings, BlackRock, Fidelity International, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, and Malaysia’s Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Altimeter Capital. GoTo Group, formed by the merger of Indonesian ride-hailing and deliveries firm Gojek and local e-commerce leader Tokopedia, is Grab’s biggest competitor. Singapore-based Sea Ltd, which has e-commerce, gaming, and a digital payments business, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Sea has also won a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab is likely to increasingly start competing with banks as it expands its financial services. It also competes with such delivery companies as Foodpanda and Deliveroo PLC. Grab’s third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $157 million. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. Gross merchandise value hit a quarterly record of $4 billion. The delivery business has emerged as the biggest segment as more consumers shifted to online food delivery during the pandemic. Grab forecasts it will turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. Anthony Tan, 39, is the company’s chief executive officer and co-founder. Fellow co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, 38, runs Grab’s operations, including corporate strategy and technology. Both Tans, unrelated, met at Harvard Business School, where they conceived the idea of the ride-hailing company. Grab’s president, Ming Maa, is a prominent dealmaker from SoftBank, who joined the company in 2016. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-nasdaq-listing-united-states-december-2-2021/","title":"Southeast Asia’s Grab slumps in US debut after record SPAC deal","date":"Dec 3, 2021 9:45 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab makes the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian company. Its shares rise as much as 21% minutes after listing on the Nasdaq, before retreating to trade 23% lower.","body":"SINGAPORE – Shares in Grab, Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, slid more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday, December 2, following the company’s record $40-billion merger with a blank-check company. Grab’s shares rose as much as 21% minutes after the listing before retreating to trade 23% lower at $8.51 by 1834 GMT. “The price makes no difference to me. I’m going to celebrate tonight and get back to work tomorrow,” chief executive officer Anthony Tan told Reuters just after the shares started trading. The backdoor listing on Nasdaq marks the high point for the nine-year-old Singapore company that began as a ride-hailing app and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, insurance, and investment products. Grab kicked off the biggest US listing by a Southeast Asian company with a bell-ringing event in Singapore, hosted by Nasdaq and Grab’s executives. The event was attended by about 250 people including its investors, drivers, merchants, and employees, with many dressed in the company’s signature green. Thunderous handclaps reverberated in the hotel ballroom as an emotional Tan thanked them for putting Grab and Southeast Asia’s tech economy on the global map. CEO Tan and Tan Hooi Ling developed the company from an idea for a Harvard Business School venture competition in 2011. The two Tans are not related. The listing comes after Grab’s April agreement to merge with US tech investor Altimeter Capital Management’s special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Altimeter Growth Corporation, and raise $4.5 billion, including $750 million from Altimeter. Grab’s flotation “will provide a bigger cash buffer” to its “cash burn,” S&P Global Ratings said in a note. But it said the company’s “credit quality continues to be constrained by its loss-making operations, and free operating cash flows could be negative over the next 12 months.” Southeast Asia’s internet economy is forecast to double to $360 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025, prompting Grab’s rivals, including regional internet firm Sea Ltd and Indonesia’s GoTo Group, to bulk up.  GoTo plans a local initial public offering in 2022 after completing an expected $2-billion private fundraising, sources have told Reuters. A US listing will follow the Jakarta offering. “Longer term, we’re really excited about Grab Financial Group,” said Chris Conforti, partner at Altimeter Capital, referring to Grab’s financial services unit. “I think the bell curve on that is much wider in terms of what the outcome could be, but it could be extremely large.” CEO Tan, 39, expanded Grab into a regional operation with a range of services, after launching it as a taxi app in Malaysia in 2012. It later moved its headquarters to Singapore. “What we have shown to the world is that homegrown tech companies can develop great technology that can compete globally, even when international players are in town,” Tan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, December 1. “We can compete and win.” He will control 60.4% of voting rights along with Grab’s co-founder, and president Ming Maa, but hold only a 3.3% stake with them. Grab’s listing brings a payday bonanza to early backers such as Japan’s SoftBank and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, which invested as early as 2014. They were later joined by the likes of Toyota Motor Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Japanese megabank MUFG. Uber became a Grab shareholder in 2018 after selling its Southeast Asian business to Grab following a five-year battle.     In September, Grab cut its full-year adjusted net sales forecasts, citing renewed uncertainty over pandemic curbs on movement.  Third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier and its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. GMV in the quarter rose to a record $4 billion. It aims to turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were the lead placement agents on the fundraising, while Evercore and UBS were the co-placement agents. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/united-states-ftc-sues-block-nvidia-deal-buy-arm/","title":"US FTC sues to block Nvidia deal to buy Arm","date":"Dec 3, 2021 9:29 AM PHT","snippet":"The Nvidia-Arm deal is widely expected to fall apart after facing opposition in the chip industry","body":"The US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday, December 2, sued to block US chip company Nvidia Corp’s more than $80 billion planned acquisition of British chip technology provider Arm, adding to already significant global regulatory challenges of the deal. The FTC said the proposed deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their own competing chips. The deal has been widely expected to fall apart after facing opposition in the chip industry. British regulators said last month they would launch an in-depth probe of the deal, and it is also under scrutiny in the European Union. Arm licenses its chip architecture and blueprints to major chipmakers Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung Electronics, underpinning the global smartphone ecosystem. Arm was sold to Japan’s SoftBank in 2016. Nvidia said it would “work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.” Arm declined to comment. The stock-heavy deal has more than doubled in value since it was announced in September 2020 as Nvidia shares have risen on the performance of its data center business. Nvidia will owe only a $1.25 billion breakup fee if the deal does not close, and its shares closed up 2.2% at $321.26 on Thursday. “Nobody thinks the deal is going to close,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein. “The data center story has been really playing out. The software narrative has become a bigger piece of the story. I would love to see this deal, but I don’t think they need it.” Before Nvidia’s offer, Softbank had planned to file for an initial public offering for Arm. While Arm’s revenue is growing briskly, rising 56.3% to $1.46 billion in the six months ended September 30, it is unclear whether Arm, in an IPO, would fetch anything close to the $80 billion in value offered by Nvidia. That would be a new blow for the Japanese conglomerate whose Vision Fund assets sank by $10 billion last month, driven by plummeting valuations for investments in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc . The FTC, which is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats, voted 4-0 to approve the challenge to the planned merger. The FTC alleged “the proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive to use its control of this technology to undermine its competitors, reducing competition and ultimately resulting in reduced product quality, reduced innovation, higher prices, and less choice, harming the millions of Americans who benefit from Arm-based products.” The FTC added the combined firm “would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run datacenters and driver-assistance systems in cars.” Some semiconductor firms such as MediaTek Inc and Broadcom Inc have voiced support for the deal. But other firms such as Qualcomm have opposed it over concerns that Nvidia would have a first look at key technologies that they depend on and could then have better insights into their future products. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, made a biting comment at an industry dinner last month, saying that Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon, who recently took the helm of an industry trade group, had proven to be a master advocate in the battle over Arm. Qualcomm had its own extensive battles with global regulators, including the FTC, which Qualcomm prevailed over after the regulator brought an antitrust lawsuit against it. “He’s the perfect person to advocate for our industry,” Huang said from a stage as Amon sat in the audience. “I was trying to figure out, how is it possible that Cristiano knew every single regulator on the planet, and by the time I got there to tell them about my story on Arm, he was already there advocating against it?” Huang said, to stunned laughter from the crowd. The FTC said it has cooperated closely with staff of the competition agencies in the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/airasia-launches-facial-recognition-air-travel-lifestyle-offerings/","title":"AirAsia launches facial recognition for air travel, lifestyle offerings","date":"Nov 18, 2021 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"The Philippine rollout of AirAsia's Faces is eyed for the first quarter of 2022","body":"AirAsia Group launched a new version of its facial recognition boarding system, Faces, aiming to roll it out for various travel and lifestyle offerings. Faces will allow AirAsia customers to select and pay for travel and lifestyle offerings via the airline’s Super App, which can immediately identify the customers through facial recognition. AirAsia saw the need for technological innovation as part of its COVID-19 prevention initiatives, with air travel slowly returning. The feature was officially launched at RedStation in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, November 18. It is now available for use in Malaysia. “As the first airline to introduce this facial recognition technology tailored to our digital travel and lifestyle platform, we are continuing to deploy innovations that not only take the hassle out of flying in the new world, but make a difference to everyday lifestyle needs,” said AirAsia Aviation Group chief executive officer Bo Lingam. “Guests flying with us can check-in online anywhere, anytime in just a click of the button once registered with Faces, supporting our efforts to restore confidence in air travel through technology and enhanced safety measures.” In the Philippines, AirAsia Philippines CEO Ricky Isla and chief financial officer Ray Berja led the launch at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3. The Philippine rollout for Faces is eyed for the first quarter of 2022, as the airline is still awaiting regulatory approval. For now, employees will use it to pilot-test the technology. “This is the better normal in air travel that we are talking about. It’s convenient, contactless, and inclusive. At AirAsia, we always think two, three steps ahead, or more for the benefit of our guests,” Isla said. AirAsia Super App CEO Amanda Woo said the group is working on allowing guests to check-in for hotels affiliated with AirAsia using Faces. Eventually, Faces will also be used for all features on the Super App across the region, including ordering food, delivery, and ride-hailing. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-holdings-earnings-report-q3-2021/","title":"Grab takes a hit from coronavirus curbs","date":"Nov 11, 2021 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia hit Grab's mobility unit in the third quarter of 2021","body":"Southeast Asia‘s largest ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab Holdings on Thursday, November 11, reported a 9% decline in third-quarter revenue, as its mobility business was hit by coronavirus curbs in some countries in the region. Fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia hit Grab’s mobility unit that fell behind its deliveries business, its largest by billings. Its mobility business brought in $88 million in revenue, down 26% from a year earlier, while sales at its deliveries unit rose 58%. “Mobility and food delivery services were suspended in Vietnam for most of Q3, and six of our core countries in which we operate experienced tighter movement controls,” said chief financial officer Peter Oey. Grab is also seeing rising competition in the space from other “super apps” that provide a host of services under one app like Gojek in Indonesia. Singapore-based Grab, which clinched a $40-billion merger with blank check firm Altimeter Growth Corporation in April, the biggest of its kind, is nearing its US listing. Founded in 2012 as a regional taxi app in Malaysia, the SoftBank Group-backed company operates a “super app,” which provides ride-hailing, food, and grocery delivery, mobile banking, and payments in over 400 cities in eight countries in Southeast Asia.

But the world’s top two carmakers, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG, as well as major car markets China, the United States and Germany, did not sign up, highlighting the challenges in shifting to zero emissions. The Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, unveiled at climate talks in the Scottish city, sees the groups pledge to “rapidly” accelerate the transition to low-carbon emission vehicles, aiming to green leading markets by 2035. Headline signatories included Ford and General Motors , the world’s second-most populous country India and major corporate purchasers of vehicles including Leaseplan, which rents 1.7 million cars in 30 countries. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, said the absence of the major economies and producers was “gravely concerning.” “To stop new fossil fuels, we need to cut off our dependency,” he said. That means moving on from combustion engines towards electric vehicles and creating clean public transport networks without delay.” A German environment spokesman said the country’s government would not sign on Wednesday as it had not reached internal consensus on a “marginal aspect” of the pledge concerning whether fuels made from renewable energy but burned in a combustion engine could form part of the solution. Cars, trucks, ships, buses and planes account for about a quarter of all global carbon emissions, data from the International Energy Agency showed, mostly from road vehicles. Others who did sign up included Sweden’s Volvo Cars, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, China’s BYD Co Ltd and Jaguar Land Rover, a unit of India’s Tata Motors Ltd. Other countries signing up included New Zealand and Poland, joining a number of nations already committed to ensuring all new cars and vans are zero emission by 2040 or earlier, including Britain, host of the COP26 summit. Among other leading companies and cities on board are ride-hailing company Uber and food retailer Sainsbury’s , the South Korean capital Seoul and Brazil’s Sao Paolo. As countries look to agree a way to price carbon globally, Volvo Cars, which has already committed to going fully electric by 2030, said separately it would assume a carbon price of 1,000 Swedish crowns on all future projects. The commitment comes on a day dedicated to transport at the conference, where policymakers are looking to accelerate efforts to cap global warming by mid-century. But the apparent unwillingness of China, the world’s largest car market, and the United States – the world’s largest economy and second-largest car market – to join the pledge raises questions about its effectiveness. While the United States is not on board, key car-buying states like California and New York are. An industry source said some carmakers are wary of the pledge because it commits them to a costly shift in technology, but lacks a similar commitment from governments to ensure that the necessary charging and grid infrastructure would be built. The European Commission has proposed an effective ban on fossil-fuel vehicles by 2035, accompanied by a commitment to a charging infrastructure demanded by carmakers. The world’s No. 4 carmaker, Stellantis, was also missing from Wednesday’s pledge, as were Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd; Germany’s BMW and South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/court-appeals-mandaluyong-rule-vs-male-backrider-unconstitutional/","title":"CA: Mandaluyong rule vs male backrider unconstitutional","date":"Oct 27, 2021 7:52 AM PHT","snippet":"It violates equal protection as there's no substantial distinction between a male and a female back rider, says the Court of Appeals","body":"The Court of Appeals (CA) has struck down as unconstitutional Mandaluyong City’s ordinance barring males from being backriders of motorcycles, ruling that there is no legal distinction between a male and a female backrider when it comes to addressing crimes by the so called “riding in tandems.” “Mandaluyong City Orinance Nos. 550 S-2014, 595 S-2015 and 694 S-2018 are hereby declared unconstitutional. City of Mandaluyong is prohibited from enforcing and implementing Mandaluyong City Orinance Nos. 550 S-2014, 595 S-2015 and 694 S-2018,” said the CA Fifth Division, in a decision penned by Associate Justice Raymond Reynold Lauigan, with concurrences from Associate Justices Ramon Bato and Pablito Perez. “It does not rest on substantial disinction bearing a just and fair relation to the purpose of the ordinance,” said the decision, sent to petitioner Dino de Leon on Tuesday, October 26.  De Leon, a public interest lawyer, took the city to court in July 2019 after he was fined and sued for violating the ordinance. It’s a constitutional case that first went through the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court (RTC). The ordinances, slammed as sexist by riders and passengers, prohibit males from backriding on a motorcycle, except if the driver is their first degree family member or if they are seven to ten years old. The rationale was to have less crimes perpetrated by “riding in tandems.” Because of this ordinance, motorcycle ride-hailing service Angkas would not take male passengers if they are passing through Mandaluyong, or would choose another route. De Leon was on an Angkas commute on March 7, 2019, when they were apprehended, fined, and then sued criminally under the ordinance, which has a penal provision. De Leon asked the Mandaluyong RTC Branch 59, where the complaint against him was filed, to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. Branch 59 junked the petition in July 2020, finding that the city government did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The CA disagreed, saying the ordinance “is an oppressive measure that goes beyond what is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose.” The CA said there was “no proof that male backriders are more susceptible to commit crimes as opposed to female backriders.” This is in line with the principle of equal protection. Generally, the equal protection clause provides that one cannot discriminate against a specific class of people unless there was substantial distinction. For example, there is a special law protecting women and children against violence because as the Supreme Court said there is an “unequal power relationship between women and men.” In this case, the CA said the ordinances “violate the rule on equal protection” and are “discriminatory both as to gender and as to the use of motorcycles as a mode of transportation and dependent on broad generalizations.” Mandaluyong wanted to declare the petition moot because quarantine restrictions bar backriders anyway, but the CA said quarantine rules are only temporary. Besides, the CA said: “Not all citizens could financially afford to travel by car or other motor vehicles so as to avoid suspicion that their use of their motorcycle with a back rider is being used to facilitate the commission of a crime.” The CA noted that the city government did not show proof that it tried other means to suppress “riding in tandem” crimes. “The police measure shall be struck down as an arbitrary intrusion into private rights – a violation of the due process,” said the appellate court. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/government-suspends-move-it-grab-rides-partnership-september-30-2021/","title":"Just a week into operations, Move It rides on Grab suspended","date":"Sep 30, 2021 10:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The government says Grab and Move It failed to follow guidelines when they entered into their deal.

It added that the partnership makes it appear as if Grab is a “de facto member” of the pilot study on motorcycle ride-hailing services. “Grab’s entry is a circumvention of the processes and guidelines that had been laid down at the start of the study,” the TWG said. The TWG claimed that Move It and Grab “were not prepared to engage” in the collaboration. But Move It maintained that it has been transparent with the TWG and other stakeholders. “Our partnership has gone through several rounds of discussions with the TWG where all of their concerns were addressed. So bakit ngayong naka-launch na kami, tsaka kami ipapa-suspend (So why are they suspending us after we’ve already launched)?” asked Move It. Move It also said the “maneuvering,” which it blamed on “complaints” by other members of the pilot study, was tantamount to bullying. “This suspension was orchestrated by a number of stakeholders in the motorcycle taxi pilot against Move It – the smaller player in the pilot,” it said. “We strongly condemn this maneuvering by other stakeholders resulting [in] this suspension as it is anti-consumer, anti-Filipino, and is tantamount to bullying.” While Move It did not name the companies, the other two members of the pilot study are Angkas and JoyRide. Move It disclosed that the partnership it sealed with Grab was offered to Angkas and JoyRide as well, but the two declined. “Mahirap na po ang buhay kaya dapat tayong magtulungan – at hindi naman po masama ang humingi ng tulong,” Move It said.

Grab said it hopes that the partnership will be given the green light again soon. “The pandemic has brought upon many challenges to the transport industry, and these challenges would require a whole-of-industry solution,” it said. “As a community partner, Grab Philippines will continue to do right by our consumers and partners, encourage constructive dialogue using facts and objective information, and help contribute to the recovery of our transportation industry.” Aside from studying the legalization of motorcycle taxis, the government allowed their operations to augment transportation in Metro Manila starting October 2020, amid the limited options due to coronavirus restrictions. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/motorcycle-taxis-available-grab-philippines-starting-september-23-2021/","title":"Motorcycle taxis available on Grab starting September 23","date":"Sep 22, 2021 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines partners with Move It for its motorcycle taxi services","body":"Commuters will be able to book a motorcycle taxi on the Grab app starting Thursday, September 23.

It is the latest court victory for unions fighting for the rights of workers in the gig economy after a similar decision in Britain. The Amsterdam District Court sided with the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, which had argued that Uber drivers are in fact employees of a taxi company and should be granted the same pay and benefits as other workers in the sector. Uber said it will appeal against the decision and “has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands.” “We are disappointed with this decision because we know that the overwhelming majority of drivers wish to remain independent,” Maurits Schönfeld, Uber’s general manager for northern Europe said. “Drivers don’t want to give up their freedom to choose if, when and where to work.” The court found that drivers who transport passengers via the Uber app are covered by the collective labor agreement for taxi transportation. “The legal relationship between Uber and these drivers meets all the characteristics of an employment contract,” the ruling said. The FNV hailed the ruling as “a huge victory for drivers” who it said will gain more pay and benefits. “Due to the judge’s ruling, the Uber drivers are now automatically employed by Uber,” said Zakaria Boufangacha, FNV’s deputy chairman. “As a result, they will receive more wages and more rights in the event of dismissal or illness, for example.” Uber drivers are in some cases entitled to back pay, the court said. The judges also ordered Uber to pay a fine of 50,000 euros ($58,940) for failing to implement the terms of the labor agreement for taxi drivers.

Here are some of the largest names that have been affected so far: The woes of China’s biggest e-commerce company began in late 2020 when China abruptly suspended the record $37-billion stock market debut of its financial affiliate Ant Group and later fined Alibaba $2.75 billion for abusing its market dominance. The company’s US-listed shares have shed more than $400 billion in value since late October, when its founder Jack Ma made a speech that blasted China’s regulatory system, which is widely regarded as the trigger for the government backlash that followed. Alibaba’s sprawling empire of businesses has continued to face heat from regulators, over issues ranging from their use of algorithms, to consumer privacy and worker protections. China’s largest gaming and social media company has lost more than HK$2.7 trillion ($347.13 billion) in market value since its shares reached an all-time high in mid-February. The company has been fined for failing to report past deals to antitrust regulators, its $5.3-billion plan to merge China’s top two video game streaming sites was blocked, and it has been barred from entering music copyright agreements. Tencent has also been affected by China’s latest efforts to combat gaming addiction among minors. In August, under-18-year-olds were banned from playing video games for more than three hours a week. China’s largest ride-hailing company became the target of a cybersecurity investigation by Chinese authorities days after its New York initial public offering in June, who ordered its app to be removed from Chinese app stores and barred it from registering new users. Its shares have lost about $37 billion, or more than 40%, of their value since it raised $4.4 billion from its June 30 IPO. The company has also been criticized by state media over how it pays its drivers. Reuters has reported that Didi is in talks with state-owned Westone Information Industry to handle its data management and monitoring activities. The food delivery company became the target of an antitrust probe in April and experienced a sell-off in its shares a month later after its founder and chief executive Wang Xing posted an ancient poem on social media that was perceived by some as criticizing the government and President Xi Jinping. Meituan, whose share have lost more than HK$1.2 trillion ($154.28 billion) in value since reaching their all time-high in February, has also been criticized on other matters, including treatment of its delivery riders and violation of consumer rights. China’s largest provider of private educational services has seen the market value of its US-listed shares fall by $7.4 billion since July, when Beijing issued new rules barring for-profit tutoring on the school curriculum. Beijing wants to ease pressure on schoolchildren and reduce a cost burden on parents that has contributed to a drop in birth rates but analysts warn that the new rules threaten to decimate the country’s private education sector.

Close to 160,000 new infections are being reported each day in the United States – the highest sustained totals in months – in the country which has been hardest hit globally, with 39 million infections and 640,000 deaths since the pandemic began. More than 7 million people will be hit by Monday’s expiry of three federal programs to help jobless Americans during the pandemic, which also supplemented state benefits with a $300-per-week boost and gave extra money to the long-term unemployed. The majority of these – 4.2 million – are PUA beneficiaries, according to an analysis by The Century Foundation think tank, typically workers like drivers who are classified as independent contractors and do not receive regular employee benefits. The rise of the gig economy in the United States and across the globe has become a flashpoint for the labor movement and triggered legal challenges over pay and protections which could reshape the booming on-demand industries. Anwaar Malik, an Uber driver from New York State’s Long Island, said he would have to return to work when the federal benefits end so as to pay his rent and support his wife and child, as well as family back in Pakistan. “Who’s going to take care of them if I get killed by COVID?” he asked, adding that he knew other drivers who died from the virus because they had to keep working amid delays in receiving unemployment benefits. “Don’t let us die,” he said. The ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft declined to respond directly to questions as to whether they supported a benefits extension. “We are grateful to Congress for stepping up to provide crucial support to gig workers when they needed it most,” an Uber spokesperson said in emailed comments. In early 2020, Uber and Lyft announced policies to provide financial assistance to drivers who tested positive for COVID-19 or who had to self-isolate because of a suspected positive case. Uber said it also took steps to confirm that both drivers and passengers wear masks, and Lyft said its drivers could decline rides for health safety reasons with no penalty. “We anticipate more drivers returning after the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits,” Lyft said in an emailed statement, which noted that most of its drivers were either students or also had other jobs. “It continues to be a great time to earn, with drivers in some of our busiest markets making on average more than $35 an hour.” Half of US states, nearly all led by Republican governors, ended some of the unemployment benefits starting in June, saying the payments were discouraging people from looking for work and leaving companies without the workers they needed to reopen. Kelly Harris of Ohio, who spoke by phone while on a food delivery job, said the federal benefits, which were cut off in her state in June, had helped her get through the past year. “It’s harder because I can only work so many hours if I don’t have anybody to watch my kids,” Harris said. Economists at four universities, including Columbia and Harvard, found that states that withdrew from federal programs in June saw slightly higher job growth, but only one in eight people who lost benefits had jobs in the first week in August. Courts in several states, including Indiana and Maryland, have ordered the benefits to continue flowing amid legal challenges. Ending the expanded benefits makes sense given the record number of job vacancies in the country, said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the federal Congressional Budget Office, which estimates costs of proposed legislation for Congress. “Anything that appears to be an impediment to having the labor market work more effectively probably should be gotten rid of – and this is on that list,” said Holtz-Eakin, head of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. Tina Raveneau, an organizer with the Independent Drivers Guild, which advocates for ride-share drivers, said that people were “praying” for an extension of the benefits. “We ride to eat,” Raveneau said. “We are not being heard.” Raveneau and other advocates have been pushing for a broader rethink of the gig economy, saying the pandemic has highlighted the need for more specific labor and safety protections for ride-hail drivers. “This working force is not going anywhere…. We want to be in the conversation,” she said. “It’s no longer gig work – it’s our job.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-launches-covid-19-vaccination-center/","title":"Grab launches COVID-19 vaccination center","date":"Sep 1, 2021 12:01 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab riders and other economic frontliners can sign up to get a slot at the ride-hailing giant's vaccination center in Makati City","body":"Grab Philippines on Wednesday, September 1, launched its own coronavirus vaccination center at its office in Makati City. In partnership with the Makati City government, Grab aims to inoculate 200 to 400 people a day. Grab said the COVID-19 vaccines will be coming from the city government, but non-Makati residents are also welcome to register for inoculation. It partnered with Ayala Corporation subsidiary AC Health for vaccine administration. Grab public affairs director Booey Bonifacio said the ride-hailing giant is still waiting for the vaccines it procured. “Hopefully, when they arrive, we are able to use [them] while the vaccine center is still set up. At this point, we don’t have a definite date on when we can receive the supply that we ordered,” Bonifacio said. For the first two months of operations, the ride-hailing giant targets to vaccinate 7,000 economic frontliners, including Grab partners. Walk-ins are not allowed. Those interested will have to pre-register on the Grab microsite. So far, 60% of Grab drivers and 73% of its delivery partners have been vaccinated. “Majority are already vaccinated. Hopefully, with this new vaccine center, it will incentivize more of our drivers to get vaccinated and we hope to hit the 100% [vaccination rate] very soon,” Bonifacio said. Grab has launched several programs, including discounts for consumers and even rewards for drivers, to help ramp up inoculation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/china-plans-ban-overseas-initial-public-offerings-tech-firms-data-security-risks/","title":"China plans to ban overseas IPOs for tech firms with data security risks – source","date":"Aug 27, 2021 6:21 PM PHT","snippet":"The ban is also expected to be imposed on companies involved in ideology issues","body":"China is framing rules to ban internet companies whose data poses potential security risks from listing outside the country, including in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter. The ban is also expected to be imposed on companies involved in ideology issues, said the person, declining to be identified as the matter is private. Beijing said last month it planned to strengthen supervision of all firms listed offshore, a sweeping regulatory shift that came after a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just days after its US listing. Under the planned rules, the Chinese securities regulator would tighten scrutiny of overseas IPO-bound firms and ban those that collect vast amount of users data or create content that could pose possible security risks, said the person. All internet firms would be asked to voluntarily apply for reviews with the powerful Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) if they aim to list their shares outside China, said the person. CAC would conduct the review, if necessary, with other relevant ministries and regulators, the person said, adding after the cybersecurity watchdog’s approval companies would be allowed to submit an application to the securities regulator. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and CAC didn’t immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. The plan is one of several proposals under consideration by Chinese regulators as Beijing has tightened its grip on the country’s internet platforms in recent months, including looking to sharpen scrutiny of overseas listings. The crackdown, which has smashed stocks and badly dented investor sentiment, has particularly targeted unfair competition and internet companies’ handling of an enormous cache of consumer data, after years of a more laissez-faire approach. The Wall Street Journal first reported the new rules that would prohibit internet firms holding a swath of user-related data from listing abroad. The rules being drafted would also put an emphasis on the legal responsibility of underwriters in overseas listings and require a more thorough disclosure of shareholding for those with so-called variable interest entities (VIE) structure. The VIE structure was created two decades ago to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecommunications, enabling Chinese companies to raise funds overseas via offshore listings. It has been widely adopted by China’s new economy companies, mainly internet firms, that are generally incorporated in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands and therefore fall outside Beijing’s legal jurisdiction. It gives firms more flexibility to raise capital offshore, while bypassing the scrutiny and lengthy IPO vetting process that locally-incorporated companies have to go through. Reuters reported last month that China’s securities regulator was setting up a team to review plans by Chinese companies for IPOs abroad, including those using the VIE corporate structure that Beijing says has led to abuse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/google-self-driving-waymo-test-san-francisco/","title":"Google self-driving spinoff Waymo begins testing with public in San Francisco","date":"Aug 25, 2021 11:42 AM PHT","snippet":"The 'driverless' cars still have operators in the driver's seat with hands on their knees but are ready to steer in case of emergency","body":"Alphabet Inc’s Waymo has started taking a few San Franciscans on rides in its self-driving sport utility vehicles and hopes to open the robotaxis to anyone in the city in less than the three years it took to launch in its only other market. Waymo’s announcement on Tuesday, August 24, of its status and plans in San Francisco, a small peninsula of hills, trolleys, bicycles and narrow streets, shows the length that remains before driverless transport becomes commonplace. The company’s all-electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs initially are serving the more residential western and southern portions of the city, including Richmond and Bernal Heights. Operators are in driver’s seats with hands on their knees – but prepared to steer in an emergency. Anybody can sign up for Waymo’s ride-hailing app, though the company is hand-selecting who it picks up with the list expected to grow gradually to hundreds of people. Waymo bars them from publicly discussing rides. Sam Kansara, senior product manager at Waymo, acknowledged that autonomous vehicles are rolling out slower than Waymo and its many rivals had originally envisioned. “There’s a lot that remains to be done,” Kansara said. “This is a step about starting to now get more information so that we can inform our roadmap.” The company wants feedback from people with differing backgrounds and commuting needs. It expects many riders to weigh in on challenges with hopping on and off because of San Francisco’s limited curb space and rampant double parking. Employees riding in the city since February gave the company confidence to expand to the public, Kansara said. Waymo last October in a first-of-its-kind deployment in the United States for the industry started allowing anyone to buy rides in its fully driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans in some Phoenix, Arizona, suburbs. The launch followed three years of testing, but Kansara said he hopes lessons learned from that experience will bring about swifter progress in San Francisco. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/only-in-hollywood-with-pops-fernandez-arnel-pineda-and-more-la-feels-like-manila-these-days/","title":"[Only IN Hollywood] With Pops Fernandez, Arnel Pineda and more, LA feels like Manila these days","date":"Aug 11, 2021 7:31 PM PHT","snippet":"As Los Angelenos feel more confident about going out again, familiar faces abound","body":"Sometimes Los Angeles feels like Manila, with so many Filipinos living here. In fact, LA leads the top 10 US metropolitan areas by Filipino population, according to the Pew Research Center. In recent weeks, as more people got vaccinated, and Los Angelenos felt more confident about going out again, I saw many familiar faces I have not seen in a long time. Last Friday night, for instance, in Yamashiro, a Japanese restaurant atop a hill in Hollywood, several Filipino celebrities were seen. It’s not a coincidence, though – people of all races are flocking again to Yamashiro because the food is good once more. It’s all thanks to Ilocos Norte native Vallerie Castillo Archer, the first female and Filipino executive chef of the landmark LA restaurant. On this recent evening, Journey frontman Arnel Pineda and his road manager and stylist, Yul Session, were savoring Chef Vallerie’s sushi and California-Asian dishes. The duo, in town from Chicago where Journey performed at the 2021 Lollapalooza, were with a group that included Hollywood red carpet photographer Sthanlee B. Mirador, actress and comedienne Mary Grant, and talent scout AC Mangubat. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Warner Bros. project to depict the remarkable rock and roll fairy tale of Arnel, who rose from a homeless teenager to the lead singer of Journey in stadium concerts, will push through. First reported in the media in late 2018, stories mentioned that WB bought the rights to Ramona Diaz’s documentary, Don’t Stop Believin’: Everyman’s Journey, in preparation for the movie. The reports stated that Jon M. Chu (In the Heights and Crazy Rich Asians) and Scott Silver (The Joker, The Fighter and 8 Mile) will direct and write, respectively. Anderson Paak, who formed the duo Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars this year, came by to say hello to Arnel, who has stayed humble all these years. After their dinner, Arnel, Yul and company dropped by our table to say hi to Pops Fernandez, also in La La Land to co-host with Martin Nievera the recent coronation night of the 2021 Miss Filipina International and Miss Filipina Teen, an annual pageant presented by Mildred Deang and Norberto “Jojo” Reyes’ Insider Entertainment Group. Pops also graced the opening of the Beverly Hills location of iSkin Med Spa, owned by Richard and Imee Ong Maghanoy, who were in our Yamashiro table that evening along with my wife Janet and Bongbong Buan, who is also based in Beverly Hills as a hair stylist and make-up artist. Over dinner, I told Pops that she and Martin are still so watchable and entertaining together. In a video excerpt from their co-hosting stint in the Miss Filipina International, the two complemented each other – Pops’ reaction to Martin’s spontaneous stage antics was just as endearing. Pops, Richard, Imee, Bongbong, Janet and I traded stories about our life experiences, especially our fresh off the boat struggles in America. We could only laugh about them now, especially the first time in the USA incidents which are amusing now. Enjoying LA’s summer weather in an outdoor table was actor and TV host Raymond Gutierrez, who recently opened up about his sexuality in the August issue of Mega magazine and declared, “I am a proud member of the LGBTQ community.” The son of Eddie Gutierrez and Anabelle Rama and the sibling of Richard (his twin brother) and Ruffa beamed as he announced to our group that he is now based in LA for good. Seated al fresco with Raymond were fashion designer Joey Galon, who co-emceed the prelims of the aforementioned Miss Filipina pageant with former Miss Earth Jamie Herrell (who flew from Manila) and Tash Greizen, the Filipino-British founder of Now PR and editor-in-chief of Now magazine. Also spotted recently at Yamashiro were Piolo Pascual, Martin Nievera, Gary Valenciano, Angeli Pangilinan Valenciano, KC Concepcion, Apl.de.ap, Manny Pacquiao, Jinkee Pacquiao, Donita Rose, and Rufa Mae Quinto. Did I say that LA feels like Manila these days? A week earlier, Hilda Koronel, still beautiful as ever, beat the stunning view of Hollywood Hills from the penthouse location of iSkin Med Spa. Hilda came with her husband, Ralph Moore, Jr. Richard and Imee played host to Fil-Am talents that we haven’t seen for a long time, especially with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Thus, I was glad to finally show my coffee table book, Through a Writer’s Lens, to Isa Briones, star of CBS’ Star Trek: Picard. My photos of Isa and her dad, Jon Jon Briones, Ratched and Miss Saigon star, are among those featured in the book, published by Bessie Badilla in a hardbound edition and now out as a paperbound on Amazon.  Anna Maria Perez de Tagle-Kline made her first public appearance since giving birth to her first daughter with her husband, Scott Kline. Motherhood becomes Anna Maria. The singer-actress absolutely looked blooming and lovely. The couple’s baby, Amelia Grace Kline, the great granddaughter of the Philippines’ entertainment legend, Sylvia La Torre, is just as pretty, based on her photos. It was also good to catch up with Camille Mana, whose film, TV and theater credits include originating the memorable title role in Jesse Eisenberg’s play, Asuncion, which premiered in New York. Camille played the Filipina roommate of Jesse and Justin Bartha. Carlin James came straight off a plane after filming a guest spot in NCIS: Hawaii which stars another Fil-Am, Vanessa Lachey (formerly known as Vanessa Minnillo). Carlin’s credits include playing Christopher Cunanan, the brother of Elena (Isa) and Andrew (Darren Criss) and the son of Modesto (Jon Jon) in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Yes, the Fil-Am acting community is a small but tight circle. Beauty queen turned Daytime Emmy-winning producer Lisa Lew (nee Manibog) showed up with statuesque Mira Bhat, who modeled for Sunnies Studios, the eyewear brand of Georgina Wilson, the niece of Gloria Diaz, Lisa’s fellow Binibining Pilipinas title holder. Pops rushed from hosting Miss Filipina International to somehow still make it to the opening. On another weekend, actress Krista Ranillo and her husband, Niño Lim, a businessman who owns Island Pacific, a popular supermarket chain in California and Nevada, hosted a sumptuous birthday dinner in a Chinese restaurant for Krista’s mom, Linda Tupaz Ranillo. Linda and her husband, actor Matt Ranillo, don’t seem to age at all. It’s a small world – Linda, Matt and Bessie Badilla – modeled together in fashion shows in the 70s. And I must have written a magazine cover story on Matt or Linda or both back in the Manila days. If you’re still reading this – please understand this took place over several weeks – one evening, Lisa threw a despedida party for Stephanie Singson in her gorgeous home on a hill off Sunset Boulevard. Lisa and her husband, Peter Brennan, who jointly won four Daytime Emmy awards for best legal/courtroom program for Last Shot with Judge Gunn and Cristina’s Court and three nominations for Judge Judy, set up a picture-perfect dinner outdoors attended by friends. After this unforgettable dinner by the pool – the setting of glamorous Fil-Am events in the past – Stephanie got a terrific send-off present. She won the best makeup honors in the 2021 International Fashion Film Festival (IFFF) for her work in I Dream in Color, a fantasy short directed by Trixie Ayson. Held in La Jolla, California, IFFF is described as “the Cannes of the fashion film world.” Incidentally, a treat upon entering Lisa’s home, formerly owned by Guns N’ Roses lead guitarist Slash (a tidbit shared by a fellow dinner guest, Joey Luna) was the sight of my coffee table book, Through a Writer’s Lens, displayed beside a huge flower centerpiece, in the foyer. In a merienda gathering hosted by Jannelle So Perkins, who was a PBA courtside reporter in Manila and became a TV talk show host in LA, we met BB Gandanghari for the first time since she moved to the States. Tall and lovely, BB said she was doing a series of shows around California. Held in Jannelle’s beautiful new home with her husband Lester Perkins and their two kids, the get-together was in honor of chef, cookbook author and actor, Lorenzo Beronilla. I was glad to see singer Ivy Violan, a friend from way back in Manila, and Geoffrey Lapuz Jimenez, a businessman and community leader who feted visiting Miss Philippine Rabiya Mateo in his residence. Last but not least, the birthday dinner of Giji Kocher, who was known as Djhoanna Garcia in the Philippines, at Lem Balagot’s LA Rose Café, a favorite of many Fil-Ams, drew many friendly faces. Giji, who always has a color theme in her birthday parties, asked guests to come in yellow this year. Not for political reasons but the singer-actress said she chose yellow because it’s the color of happiness and hope. Friends, including Jennifer Cortes and Marilou Bendigo Christensen, former Binibining Pilipinas and Mutya ng Pilipinas, respectively, happily complied. Giji’s fellow singers, Maricar Balague Cabasag, Alvin Reyes, Heidi Tann and Matt Ranillo, took turns serenading the birthday celebrant. Of course, Giji – walang kupas, as we say in Tagalog – brought the house down with her tender yet stirring “Ang Tangi Kong Pagibig” and a brassy, tour de force “Big Spender.” I went home with Janet that night expecting to hail and ride a tricycle. That’s how the scene felt so much like being back home. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-coronavirus-updates-august-6-2021/","title":"China sees highest daily figure of COVID-19 patients in current outbreak","date":"Aug 6, 2021 8:06 PM PHT","snippet":"Confirmed cases are patients who display symptoms such as a cough or fever, or signs of infection when scanned. China does not include symptomless cases in its tally until signs of disease show up.","body":"China reported on Friday, August 6, its highest daily count of new COVID-19 patients in an outbreak that began in late July, fueled by a surge in locally transmitted infections. Officials blamed the latest clusters mainly on the highly transmissible Delta variant, though it has not led to widespread infection in some cities, while cases in some areas show initial signs they could ease. China reported 124 new confirmed cases for Thursday, August 5, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, up from 85 a day earlier. Of the new confirmed infections, 80 were locally transmitted, up from 62 a day earlier, it added. Confirmed cases are patients who display symptoms such as a cough or fever, or signs of infection when scanned. China does not include symptomless cases in its tally until signs of disease show up. The local cases were driven by a surge in infections in eastern Jiangsu province, which reported 61 new local cases for Thursday, up from 40 a day earlier. The latest infections were mainly in the provincial city of Yangzhou on the lower reaches of the Yangtze river, near the commercial hub of Shanghai. To keep the virus within its borders, Yangzhou closed the passenger entrances of two railway stations on Friday. It has already suspended domestic flights, and the flow of taxis and ride-hailing vehicles with other cities. The coronavirus first emerged in late 2019 in the central city of Wuhan in Hubei province, but China had until recently largely managed to prevent any major local outbreaks sparked by infections imported from abroad. Since July 20, when the first cases of the current outbreak were detected in the Jiangsu city of Nanjing, the virus has spread to about 40 cities, including the capital, Beijing. Nanjing and Yangzhou now account for more than 70% of local confirmed cases in China since late July, though not all the local cases are linked to the two cities. This week, NHC official He Qinghua said he expected China to bring the outbreak under control within weeks if local authorities took sufficient measures, though he acknowledged that efforts would be complicated. Still, there are signs that some regions have averted rampant spread with measures such as lockdowns of affected areas, swab tests to identify the infected, intensive contact tracing and curbs on domestic travel. By Friday, there were no new confirmed cases this month in five of the 16 provinces, regions and municipalities that had reported local cases since July 20, NHC data showed. Also since July 20, more than a dozen cities, including Shanghai, have reported no more than one locally transmitted case a day, and no new infections on some days, data from local authorities showed, suggesting they have managed to curb infections. Even Nanjing, which had the most local cases in its Delta-triggered outbreak since July 20, reported only one case for August 5. China reported 58 new asymptomatic cases, up from 54 a day earlier, but no new deaths. By Thursday, the nationwide tally of confirmed cases stood at 93,498, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-coronavirus-updates-august-4-2021/","title":"China reports most new COVID-19 cases since January amid Delta surge","date":"Aug 4, 2021 3:21 PM PHT","snippet":"Since late July, the highly transmissible Delta variant has been detected in at least a dozen Chinese cities, including Beijing and Wuhan","body":"China reported on Wednesday, August 4, the most new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases since January as some cities stepped up restrictions, cut flights and increased testing to get to grips with an outbreak driven mainly by the Delta variant. The travel restrictions and closures led Nomura to downgrade China’s July-September economic growth forecast, as well as its full-year prediction, saying the zero-tolerance approach to the virus was becoming increasingly costly. Since late July, the highly transmissible Delta variant has been detected in at least a dozen Chinese cities, including the capital, Beijing, and Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019. China reported 71 new domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases for August 3, official data showed, the highest daily tally since January 30. The number of cases has increased for five consecutive days since July 30. Most cities have yet to impose strict citywide lockdowns but a few have limited some movements. Nanjing and Yangzhou in eastern Jiangsu province, where the majority of China’s local cases have been reported since July 20, have suspended domestic flights, long-distance shuttle buses, taxis and ride-hailing vehicles from entering and leaving the two cities, and suspended some bus services. Cities such as Zhengzhou and Jingzhou have locked up some neighborhoods and limited public transport in areas considered higher-risk. Wuhan said it aims to test all its 12 million population in just three days to screen out infections. It has closed parts of an economic development and innovation zone. Many cities with domestic infections have closed tourist sites and shuttered entertainment venues. The southern tourist city of Zhangjiajie has banned residents and travelers from leaving. Including symptomatic patients arriving from abroad, the number of new cases stood at 96 for August 3, up from 90 a day earlier.

After discussions with the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), the DOTr proposal of retaining the current supply and 50% capacity in public utility vehicles (PUV) was approved. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade reiterated only authorized persons outside of residence (APOR) will be allowed to board PUVs. “Restrictions will be applied on passengers. There will be stricter enforcement to ensure that only APORs are permitted to use public transport, as mandated by the IATF,” said Tugade. “APORs are reminded to be ready to present to transport marshals identification cards issued by the IATF or other documents or IDs as proof that they are authorized to travel,” Tugade added. Tugade, however, said that should the IATF decide to take back its approval, the DOTr “will abide.” Metro Manila will be under lockdown from August 6 to 20. Initially, the IATF decided to suspend public transportation during the lockdown, but the DOTr recommended otherwise. Similar to what has been allowed during the general community quarantine, half capacity in mass transportation is retained, but standing passengers for PUVs will not be allowed. Only one person can sit in the front row for road-based transport. Motorcycle taxis and ride-hailing apps are also allowed to ply the roads. For tricycles, DOTr said that only one passenger can ride the cab. As tricycles are under local government units (LGUs), DOTr said that tricycle operations still have to be approved by the interior department and the LGU concerned. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-to-give-rewards-drivers-vaccinated-covid-19/","title":"Grab to give rewards for drivers who get vaccinated vs COVID-19","date":"Jul 27, 2021 6:30 PM PHT","snippet":"When all Grab drivers and delivery riders get vaccinated, the company will raffle off 30 Yamaha Aerox motorcycles","body":"Grab Philippines will be giving out rewards to ramp up COVID-19 vaccination among its drivers and delivery riders.

News of the policy change, which also restricts foreign investment in the sector, threatens to decimate China’s $120 billion private tutoring industry and triggered a heavy selloff in shares of tutoring firms including New Oriental Education & Technology Group and Koolearn Technology Holding Ltd. All institutions offering tutoring on the school curriculum will be registered as non-profit organizations, and no new licenses will be granted, according to the document, which says it was distributed by China’s State Council, or cabinet, to local governments and is dated July 19. China’s State Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curriculum-based tutoring institutions would be barred from raising money through listings or other capital-related activities, while listed companies would be banned from investing in such institutions, according to the document. China’s for-profit education sector has been under scrutiny as part of Beijing’s push to ease pressure on school children and reduce the cost burden on parents. Three sources told Reuters last month that the crackdown is being driven from the top, and in June the official Xinhua news agency quoted President Xi Jinping as saying that schools, rather than tutoring firms, should be responsible for student learning. The new policy would also bar foreign investors from investing in China’s curriculum-based tutoring businesses through mergers and acquisitions, franchises, or variable interest entity (VIEs) arrangements, according to the document. VIEs are a commonly used structure to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in certain industries. Those which have already violated the rules must make corrective measures, it added. After-school tutoring is also prohibited during weekends, public holidays and school vacations, the document said. “Such rules are tougher than market expectations, and we expect material impact on future business and capital market activities of listed (education) companies,” China International Capital Corp (CICC) said in a note on Friday. New Oriental’s Hong Kong-traded shares slumped as much as 50.4% to their lowest since its listing late last year. Scholar Education Group and Koolearn Technology Holding Ltd both tumbled nearly 30% in Hong Kong. “The regulations have not been published, and the Company has not received official notification of the regulations,” New Oriental said in a statement late on Friday. US-listed TAL Education and Gaotu Techedu Inc made similar statements. Education stocks also saw a sell-off in mainland China, with an index tracking the sector dropping nearly 5%. The move comes amid a broad crackdown on China’s massive internet sector, which has rattled investors and saw Beijing launch a data-related cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just two days after it raised $4.4 billion in a New York initial public offering.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/china-launches-cybersecurity-probe-united-states-listed-firms/","title":"After Didi, China launches cybersecurity probe into more US-listed firms","date":"Jul 5, 2021 2:22 PM PHT","snippet":"China ramps up its crackdown on the mainland's tech companies amid tightened regulations on data security","body":"China’s cyberspace watchdog said on Monday, July 5, it is investigating online recruiter Zhipin.com, and truck-hailing apps Huochebang and Yunmanman, ramping up a crackdown on the mainland’s tech companies amid tightened regulations on data security. The announcement comes a day after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered a suspension of app downloads for Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc , which went public in a US listing last month. Full Truck Alliance, the result of a merger between Huochebang and Yunmanman, and Kanzhun Ltd, the owner of Zhipin.com, went public in the US stock market last month. The three app-based businesses should halt new user registrations during the review, the CAC said in a statement, adding that the investigations are to “prevent national data security risks and safeguard national security.” The cyberspace agency did not offer further details about the investigation into the three apps, but cited China’s national security law and cybersecurity law. Chinese regulators have also recently tightened scrutiny of internet platform companies, including Alibaba Group and Meituan, for anti-competitive practices. Full Truck Alliance, often dubbed “Uber for trucks”, has over 10 million registered truck drivers and more than 5 million truck owners on its platform.

Earlier on Sunday, China’s cyberspace regulator ordered app stores to stop offering Didi’s app after finding that the company had illegally collected users’ personal data. “The Company expects that the app takedown may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,” the company said in a statement. The removal of Didi’s app, which does not affect existing users, comes days after Didi made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in an initial public offering that raised $4.4 billion. In a June filing, Didi reported revenue of about 42.2 billion yuan ($6.5 billion) for the three months ended March 31. Of that, 39.2 billion yuan came from its China mobility division while about 800 million yuan came from its international business. Didi has a dominant position in the online ride-hailing business in China and operates in 4,000 locations across 16 countries. Didi said it will strive to rectify any problems, and will protect users’ privacy and data security. Since late last year, Chinese internet regulators have cracked down more sharply on the country’s tech giants for violations of rules. The Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper, said in a Chinese-language commentary on Monday that Didi’s apparent “big data analysis” capability could pose risks to the security of individuals’ personal information. “No internet giant can be allowed to become a super database of Chinese people’s personal information that contains more details than the country, and these companies cannot be allowed to use the data however they want,” Global Times said. Didi gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data everyday. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis. In its IPO prospectus, Didi said “we follow strict procedures in collecting, transmitting, storing and using user data pursuant to our data security and privacy policies.” A senior Didi executive said on Saturday that the company stores all China user and roads data at servers in the country and it is “absolutely not possible” that it passed data to the United States. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/apps/china-suspends-didi-app-data-violation/","title":"Didi app suspended in China over data protection","date":"Jul 4, 2021 8:29 PM PHT","snippet":"(1st UPDATE) China's cyberspace administration says it found Didi had illegally collected users' personal data, but did not specify the nature of DIdi's violation","body":"China’s cyberspace administration said on Sunday, July 4, it had ordered smartphone app stores to stop offering the ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc’s app after finding that Didi had illegally collected users’ personal data. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on its social media feed that it had ordered Didi to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules. It did not specify the nature of Didi’s violation. Didi responded by saying it had stopped registering new users and would remove its app from app stores. It said it would make changes to comply with rules and protect users’ rights. Didi debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday following a $4.4 billion initial public offering (IPO). Didi was valued at $67.5 billion in the IPO, well down from the $100 billion it had hoped for, which potential investors had resisted. Redex Research director Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, said CAC’s move appeared aggressive, but that Didi had anyway been banned from adding new users during a review of its cybersecurity. “It indicates the process could take a while, but they have a large installed base so near-term impact (is) likely muted for now.” Didi’s app was still working in China for people who had already downloaded it. It offers over 20 million rides in China every day, on average. CAC on Friday announced an investigation into Didi to protect “national security and the public interest”, prompting a 5.3% fall in its share price to $15.53. The stock was sold at $14 in the IPO – the top of the flagged range. Chinese regulators have tightened data collection rules for major tech firms in recent years. Didi, which offers services in China and more than 15 other markets, gathers vast amounts of real-time mobility data every day. It uses some of the data for autonomous driving technologies and traffic analysis. Founded by Will Cheng in 2012, the company has already been subject to regulatory probes in China over safety and its operating license.

The stock market debut vindicated Didi’s decision to moderate its valuation expectations, after investors raised concerns over the pace and profitability of its expansion in new services and foreign markets. Reuters reported in March that Didi was hoping the IPO could value it at as much as $100 billion. SoftBank-backed Didi’s stock opened at $16.65, significantly higher than its $14 IPO price. The shares slid in the early afternoon after reaching an $18 high. Didi had priced an upsized offering of 316.8 million American depositary shares at the upper end of its $13 to $14 range, raising $4.4 billion. Didi is the latest in a string of Chinese companies seeking to capitalize on the frothy valuations of the US stock market. About 29 Chinese firms raised $7.6 billion in US IPOs in the first six months of the year, according to Refinitiv data. This is despite the ongoing economic tensions between the United States and China, as well as US concerns over the quality of the auditing of Chinese companies’ financial statements. Didi is also under investigation by Chinese authorities over potential antitrust violations, Reuters reported earlier this month. “All of the major Chinese internet companies are under much more scrutiny now than they’ve been in the past. It’s just a risk for the sector,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. Didi, which is also backed by technology investment giants Alibaba, Tencent and Uber, was founded in 2012 by Cheng Wei as Didi Dache, a taxi-hailing app. It merged with peer Kuaidi Dache to become Didi Kuaidi and was later renamed Didi Chuxing. Chief executive Cheng, who was born in 1983 in a small town in the southeastern province of Jiangxi and once worked as an assistant to the head of a foot massage firm, was worth $1.2 billion prior to Didi’s market debut, according to Forbes. Cheng got the idea for a ride-hailing platform on a freezing winter night in Beijing when he had trouble getting a taxi. SoftBank is Didi’s largest investor with a 20.2% stake. Tencent holds 6.4%, while Uber retains 12% of Didi. Cheng will own a 6.5% stake in the company he built, while having a 35.5% voting power due to a dual-class share structure that’s become increasingly popular among tech companies. Based on Wednesday’s closing price, Cheng’s stake in Didi is worth $4.45 billion. Uber’s stake in Didi is valued at $8 billion, significantly more than the $6 billion valuation that Uber assigned to it in 2016, when it received the stake in exchange for selling its China food delivery business to Didi, according to a regulatory filing from Uber. Like most ride-hailing companies, Didi had historically been unprofitable, until it reported a profit of $30 million in the first quarter of this year. The company reported a loss of $1.6 billion last year and an 8% drop in revenue to $21.63 billion, according to a regulatory filing, as business slid during the pandemic. Didi decided in 2018 to invest $1 billion in its auto services business, part of a larger unit rebranding. It has also invested heavily to expand its core business outside its home market by either pouring money in local partners or launching their services. Didi has a dominant position in the online ride-hailing business in China and operates in 4,000 locations across 16 countries. It has more than 490 million annual active users, according to a recent regulatory filing. Its offerings include private car-hailing, sharing bikes, delivery, freight and logistics, and financial services. Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C., Morgan Stanley and J.P.

The newest course, Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certificate program, is now available on the driver app for drivers and delivery partners to access. The program covers topics on computer basics, online communication, and creating and managing digital content. The course is available in English and Filipino. “COVID-19 has made digital transformation critical, and accelerated a global wave of technology adoption. But embracing digital opportunities requires having the necessary digital skills,” said Microsoft Philippines country manager Andres Ortola. “Alongside the adoption of technology, we have to empower the individuals within our workforces and communities with the skills and knowledge they need today, and tomorrow,” Ortola added. Apart from the Microsoft certificate course, GrabAcademy is also offering courses that will help drivers “thrive” beyond the platform. Here are some of the courses available: “Our GrabAcademy is a clear expression of our long-term commitment to the development and wellbeing of our partners – both within and beyond our platform, and we are blessed and excited to be with Microsoft on this journey,” said Grab Philippines country head Grace Vera Cruz. As GrabAcademy is now fully online, safety and refresher courses from trainings can now be accessed on the driver app: Grab also migrated its taxation and vehicle sanitation training courses. “Our driver- and delivery-partners have spent many years providing essential services to all our kababayans, and as a community partner to our Ka-Grab, we are committed to supporting their everyday needs and their long-term success,” Vera Cruz said. Vera Cruz told Rappler that Grab has already procured vaccine shots for drivers, and delivery partners who will not be covered by the national vaccination program. “As of today, we have procured a number of doses,” Vera Cruz said without elaborating how many. “We are procuring as much as we can. However the timing of the delivery of that is still a question,” she added. Under the COVID-19 vaccination program, economic frontliners, including those in the commuter transport and delivery services, are part of the A4 priority group. Asked about how many drivers will have to be covered by Grab, Vera Cruz said she doesn’t have an idea at the moment.  “We are prepared for the worse but hoping for the best as Grab. We are trying our best to work with the regulators, national government and local government, to understand it. When we ask them the question, they’re also unclear as of this point,” Vera Cruz said.

The series of photos show the all-too familiar battle the ordinary Filipino faces each day. “Commuting” is synonymous to the word “agony” for 13 million residents of Metro Manila, the nation’s capital region. Going to the workplace from home and back has been a constant source of distress for millions of Filipinos in one of Asia’s most congested metropolitan areas. Filipinos are no stranger to the apocalyptic scenes of commuters struggling to get a ride on Metro Manila’s main thoroughfares. This includes enduring long hours of queues for public utility vehicles and trains that last well into the night, and the exhausting travel time in cramped buses and jeepneys crawling through heavy traffic.  In 2019, a well-known navigation app, Waze, named Metro Manila as one of the cities with the worst traffic in the world. A study conducted in 2017 by the Boston Consulting Group, commissioned by ride-hailing app Uber, showed that a commuter in Metro Manila spent 66 minutes in traffic every day, the third longest in Asia. The heavy traffic has taken its toll on the physical and mental health of commuters. Many are used to sacrificing hours of sleep to wake up very early to beat the rush hour “carmageddon.” Others have to walk long distances in unsafe areas to come to work on time or be home safe with their families. These are just a few of the typical ordeals a regular commuter has to endure every single day. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the daily agony even worse. Since March 2020, the Philippines has been placed under various levels of community quarantine, making the country’s lockdown the longest in the world. Abrupt restrictions on public transportation left commuters like headless chickens on the roads. Even healthcare workers, who play significant roles during a health crisis and use public transport regularly, were not spared. As the lockdowns eased in the months that followed, buses, jeepneys, trains, and even tricycles were forced to adapt to the so-called “new normal.” Drivers were required to regularly sanitize their vehicles and install plastic barriers as part of health and safety precautions. According to AltMobility PH, these measures have increased the cost of public transportation. “Commuting is more expensive now across all public transport modes,” said Jedd Ugay, chief mobility officer of AltMobility PH. For instance, local governments have restricted tricycles to one passenger at a time. This means a passenger needs to pay more for a “special ride.” While the new health protocols take into account the welfare of commuters amid the pandemic, the riding public now has to choose between safety or savings.  “For most people, public transport is their primary choice. Regardless of whatever state our transport system is currently in, people still need to undertake essential trips for essential purposes. It is inevitable,” Ugay added. As Filipinos struggle to avoid the deadly coronavirus, they still have to contend with the agony of daily commuting, itself a malady that seems to have no cure in sight. “Commuting in Metro Manila right now doesn’t feel humane. Just see the pictures of commuters daily or experience it yourself. There is no dignity in commuting in Metro Manila,” Ugay said. – Rappler.com This piece is republished with permission from the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/indonesia-gojek-tokopedia-merger/","title":"Indonesia’s Gojek, Tokopedia merge to create tech giant","date":"May 17, 2021 5:04 PM PHT","snippet":"The combined entity GoTo will be the biggest privately-held technology company in Southeast Asia","body":"Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia have agreed to a merger to create a multi-billion dollar tech company called GoTo in the country’s largest-ever deal. The combined entity, which will span online shopping, courier services, ride-hailing, food delivery, and other services in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, will be the biggest privately-held technology company in Southeast Asia. It plans to list in Indonesia and the United States later this year, company executives said. In a joint statement on Monday, May 17, the companies said their combined past valuation was $18 billion based on fundraisings done in 2019 and early 2020. The merger of Gojek and Tokopedia – each backed by global heavyweight investors – comes amid a surge of competition in the ride-hailing and food delivery markets in Southeast Asia. Last month, Southeast Asia’s largest ridehailing and food delivery firm Grab clinched a $40 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company and Singapore-based regional internet firm Sea Ltd, which runs e-commerce platform Shopee, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services. GoTo’s top investors include Alibaba Group Holding, SoftBank Group Corp, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, Google, and Tencent Holdings. Sources said Gojek’s shareholders will own 58% of the holding company with the balance held by Tokopedia’s investors. “Our business model is now even more diverse, stable and sustainable. We have Gojek’s high volume, high frequency mobility transactions, combined with Tokopedia’s high value, medium frequency e-commerce transactions,” said Tokopedia President Patrick Cao. Cao will become the president of GoTo and Gojek CEO Andre Soelistyo will be chief executive. GoTo’s deal came together quickly in December after months of negotiations between Gojek and Singapore-based Grab fell apart. Using the model of Alphabet, Gojek and Tokopedia plan to remain separate but work together on payments, logistics and food deliveries. While e-commerce is booming in Indonesia, its 17,000 islands are sprinkled across an area bigger than the European Union, making it a loss-making market for e-commerce firms. Goldman Sachs is the financial advisor to Gojek, and Citi is the financial advisor to Tokopedia.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-considering-secondary-singapore-listing/","title":"Grab considering secondary Singapore listing after US SPAC merger – sources","date":"Apr 16, 2021 3:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, 3 sources say","body":"Grab Holdings, Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing to delivery giant, is considering a secondary listing in its home market of Singapore after completing a Nasdaq listing via a $40 billion SPAC merger, 3 sources familiar with the matter said. Listing on Singapore Exchange would enable Grab to have an investor base close to where its regional business is based, the people said, potentially offering its customers, drivers and merchant partners easier access to trade its shares. Grab, a household name across Southeast Asia, is in the early stages of considering a secondary listing in the city-state, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. The potential Singapore listing plans come after Grab this week agreed to a $40 billion merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), making this the world’s biggest SPAC deal. Grab, which began as a ride-hailing business in 2012, now operates in 8 countries and more than 400 cities and has expanded into food and grocery deliveries, as well as digital payments. Last year, it won a digital banking license in Singapore. It wasn’t clear how much Grab might aim to raise in any secondary listing, with financial terms and timetable still in the early stages of consideration, the sources said. The company with the top valuation on the Singapore bourse is bank DBS Group Ltd, currently worth about S$74 billion ($55.4 billion) by capitalization. Grab and SGX declined to comment on the listing plans. One of the sources said that while Grab has sufficient cash reserves and could end up raising only a small amount on SGX, a listing would mark a big win for the exchange. SGX has mainly only seen large IPOs from real estate investment trusts. Hindered by a small base of retail investors in the city-state, it has struggled with low liquidity and valuations, forcing a spate of delistings and also discouraging big-ticket listings from regional high-growth companies. The Hong Kong bourse, however, has benefited from diplomatic and political tensions between the United States and China that have led many Chinese firms to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. Global fund managers have also been swapping China holdings from Wall Street to Hong Kong. SGX has taken many steps to try to bulk up its stock market in recent years, and under Chief Executive Loh Boon Chye, who was appointed six years ago, it has acquired firms to transform itself into a multi-asset exchange. Currently, there are 28 companies with a secondary listing on SGX, including Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare and Top Glove Corp and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings. Last year, AMTD International became the first NYSE-listed firm to list on SGX. It also became the first to take advantage of a dual-class share structure in Singapore. For Grab, as part of the SPAC merger, it’s raising $4 billion from global investors including BlackRock, Temasek Holdings, Fidelity International, Malaysia’s Permodalan Nasional Bhd and some of Indonesia’s richest family groups. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/grab-set-to-announce-deal-us-spac-april-2021/","title":"Grab agrees to world’s biggest SPAC merger, valued at $40 billion","date":"Apr 13, 2021 2:35 PM PHT","snippet":"(1st UPDATE) Grab says its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance in 2020, despite the pandemic","body":"Southeast Asia’s biggest ride-hailing and food delivery firm, Grab Holdings, agreed to a merger on Tuesday, April 13, with US-based Altimeter Growth Corporation in a deal that gives Grab an initial proforma equity value of about $39.6 billion and will lead to a public listing. The merger, the biggest blank-check company deal ever, underscores the frenzy on Wall Street as shell firms have raised $99 billion in the United States so far this year after a record $83 billion in 2020. Singapore-based Grab’s agreement with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Altimeter Capital includes a more than $4 billion private investment in public equity by investors including BlackRock, Fidelity International, Janus Henderson Investors, and Temasek Holdings. The offering is led by $750 million from funds managed by Altimeter Capital. The transactions will provide Grab with about $4.5 billion in cash proceeds. Grab said its decision to become a public company was driven by a strong financial performance in 2020, despite the pandemic. Reuters earlier reported that Grab would announce the deal on Tuesday. The deals for Grab, which was valued at just over $16 billion last year, will be a big win for its early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp and China’s Didi Chuxing. The bumper valuation validates Grab’s co-founder Anthony Tan’s strategy to aggressively tap growth in new sectors and ramp up market share by pumping billions of dollars to localize its services and invest in high-growth economies. The proposed transactions, which have been approved by the boards of both Grab and Altimeter Growth, are expected to close over the next few months, subject to shareholder approvals Grab attracted global attention in 2018 when it acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia business after a costly five-year battle and in return took a stake in the company. Reuters reported in January that Grab, which has so far raised about $12 billion, was exploring a US listing. Grab’s agreed transaction will surpass electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors’ $24 billion deal struck with a SPAC in February. With operations in 8 countries and 398 cities, Grab is already Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up. Leveraging its ride-hailing business started in 2012, the firm has moved into food and grocery deliveries, courier services, digital payments, and is now making a push into insurance and lending in a region of 650 million people. The listing will give Grab extra firepower in its main market, Indonesia, where local rival Gojek is close to sealing a merger with the country’s leading e-commerce business, Tokopedia. Grab, whose net revenue surged 70% last year, has yet to turn profitable, but it expects its biggest segment – the food delivery business – to break even by end-2021, as more consumers shift to online food delivery after the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash-rich, US-listed Sea is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Both Grab and Sea won digital bank licences in Singapore last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/ways-metro-manila-cities-solving-covid-19-vaccination-challenges/","title":"Different strokes: How Metro Manila cities are solving vaccination challenges","date":"Apr 10, 2021 10:30 AM PHT","snippet":"PART 2: Metro Manila local governments are finding ways to smooth out snags in critical COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, from app glitches to lack of personnel for vaccination sites","body":"In Quezon City, the Metro Manila city with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, vaccination sites have been “blockbuster hits,” says Joseph Juico, head of city’s vaccination task force. Of the 6 sites that have been operating for weeks, four typically report hitting their targets of vaccinating 400 to 500 people a day. On Wednesday, April 7, they opened 6 more vaccination sites. Out of around 17,000 people the city has vaccinated, 41 called to report adverse side effects.  Roughly the same story is unfolding throughout the megacity, the epicenter of the Philippine COVID-19 outbreak. Getting vaccines into the arms of 50% to 70% of its 12 million people is seen as key to loosening the virus’ grip on the country. Though the vaccine rollout is happening in an orderly fashion and many Metro Manila residents have given positive feedback, Juico admitted there have been a lot of hiccups. The 17 local government units in the megacity have been encountering roughly the same set of problems, and finding their own ways of responding to them. Untangling these knots early on is critical as the cities prepare for the vaccinations of economic frontliners, a larger scale of vaccinations compared to the ongoing inoculations of health workers, elderly, and persons with comorbidities. Rappler reporters spoke with various local officials to find out what snags they’ve encountered and how they are addressing them.  Almost all vaccination drives in Metro Manila involve QR codes, apps, or registration through a web page to lessen face-to-face contact and the likelihood of people swarming outside. This means people who are not technologically-savvy, like some elderly individuals, have a hard time signing up. Their younger family members typically fill in the gap. To address this, most cities deploy barangay personnel to do information drives and set up desks in barangay halls for assisted registration. San Juan did house-to-house campaigning and registration, according to Brian Geli, the city’s public information chief.  During the enhanced community quarantine, Navotas even released cellphone numbers for residents to text if they wanted someone to come over to assist them with registration, Mayor Toby Tiangco told Rappler. In Manila, personnel at the city’s health department are designated to assist people registering online, according to public information chief Julius Leonen. In Makati, jeepneys outfitted with laptops and internet connection so that they become “mobile learning hubs,” went around barangays so people could use them to register, according to Makati government spokesman Michael Camiña. The heavy reliance of vaccination registration on technology often meant a surge in the use of a new platform that would predictably buckle. In Quezon City, there have been major problems with the EZ Consult app by Zuellig Pharma, which they used to set vaccine appointments for residents. Because the app was still being upgraded at the time when vaccinations started, some residents experienced glitches, like their appointment not appearing in the system on the day of their vaccination. City Hall has already raised concerns with Zuellig Pharma and are now encouraging people to register through EZ Consult’s web page, instead of the app, said Juico. Manila has won praises for its user-friendly web page-only registration process but it, too, dealt with some blips caused by a surge in registrations. San Juan faced the same problem with its web page registration. Text messages meant to confirm registration would be received late by residents or else they would be sent repeatedly, even after a resident had gotten vaccinated.  But Geli said the city is resolving these problems and may soon be using another system, developed by MultiSys Technologies, the same tech firm behind the national government’s contact tracing app StaySafe. With lockdowns limiting mobility, getting from your house to the vaccination center has been tricky for lower-income individuals, especially the elderly or those with health conditions.  In Manila, local personnel even go to the houses of senior citizens who are in no condition to go to vaccination sites. Navotas offers free tricycle rides for senior citizens and chose sites close to communities. San Juan, the smallest city in the capital region, doesn’t encounter this problem but still offers free rides to their vaccination site at FilOil Flying V Center. Quezon City, meanwhile, is in talks with tricycle drivers and ride-hailing services to address this issue. While some people said they took less than an hour to complete the vaccination process, others reported staying as long as 4 hours. Local governments are struggling to shave this down and make it more uniform. Quezon City, for instance, aims to limit the process per person to 45 minutes. San Juan said it has managed to keep the process under an hour, on average, through the help of the Vaccine Information Management System (VIMS-IR) developed by the Department of Information and Communications Technology, a system for collating vaccine master lists and automating the registration process. The number of vaccination sites a local government can put up greatly depends on the availability of people to man it. In Quezon City, around 50 people (mix of medical and non-medical staff) are required to operate one site. They need more volunteers to meet their target of 24 vaccination sites. San Juan reported the same problem, with only 10 doctors in the city’s health department and around 100 people from city hall assigned to pandemic programs.   “We need around 150 to 200 people to run the vaccination area smoothly. As a temporary solution, we have called for and accepted volunteer doctors and nurses who help with our screening, vaccination, and post-vaccination monitoring areas,” said Geli. They’ve also resorted to pulling out staff from other departments. Both Quezon City and San Juan hope the national government can provide them with more people. No vaccines mean the vaccination sites will turn idle. Already, vaccination sites have had to turn away many senior citizens who were not aware of announcements that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and they could not be given the Sinovac vaccine. Local governments currently rely on the national government’s supply of vaccines since those they procured, mostly from AstraZeneca, are set to arrive July at the earliest. More senior citizens are expected to get vaccinated in the coming days after the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Sinovac vaccines for the elderly. – with reports from Dwight de Leon, Mara Cepeda, Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-cover-covid-19-vaccination-drivers-delivery-partners/","title":"Grab to cover COVID-19 vaccination of drivers, delivery partners","date":"Apr 8, 2021 7:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Group CEO Anthony Tan says the GrabForGood Fund will begin 'immediate work on meeting the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines' in Southeast Asia","body":"Singapore-listed Grab Holdings announced on Thursday, April 8, that an initial $275-million endowment fund will be used to support its stakeholders over the long haul. Under the GrabForGood fund, Grab will fully cover the costs of COVID-19 vaccination for its drivers and delivery partners across Southeast Asia who are not covered by a national vaccination program. “The GrabForGood Fund will commence immediate work on meeting the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, where it’s not easily available,” said Grab Group chief executive officer and co-founder Anthony Tan. Grab said eligible drivers and delivery partners are those who have completed a ride or a delivery on the Grab app within 3 months leading up to inoculation. “Grab has started sourcing for vaccines and will look into setting up vaccine centers to inoculate eligible partners locally,” it said in a statement. Aside from the vaccine drive, Grab will also support other initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the endowment fund. Grab is planning an insurance subsidy for drivers and riders on top of the personal accident insurance coverage, education scholarships, and financial aid for people with disability to enable the use of the app for income generation. The holding firm said details of the initiatives will be announced eventually. The rest of the Grab community in Southeast Asia will also be able to access programs on financial and digital literacy, climate change resiliency grants, and catastrophic relief aid. The GrabForGood Fund will have a seed fund of $50 million in cash and $200 million in expected value of Grab shares. Tan, along with Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling and Grab president Ming Maa, also pledged a combined $25 million worth of shares as personal contribution. An advisory board will be created to give Grab partners and users representation in providing feedback and recommendations on how the funds should be spent. In the Philippines, Grab has already launched programs that support online sellers and small businesses amid the pandemic. It also covers swab tests for drivers and delivery partners.

But a study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Future Urban Mobility Interdisciplinary Research Group at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, and China’s Tongji University found that it may not exactly be the case.  The study is titled “Impacts of transportation network companies on urban mobility,” recently published in the journal Nature Sustainability.    In the US, they found the entrance of ridesharing services by transport network companies (TNCs) in the market reduced mass transport ridership by 8.9%, and only reduced private vehicle ownership by 1%.   The services also increased road congestion intensity by almost 1% and increased the duration of congestion by 4.5%, citing “deadheading” miles or miles travelled without a passenger as a possible cause for TNC services’ added effect on congestion. Studies estimate about 40.8% of TNC miles are deadheading miles in the US.  The study also found that the ease with which commuters can access ridesharing services discouraged them from merely walking or taking public transportation, which are greener alternatives.  These findings are showing that ridesharing services, according to the study, have a negative net effect on the environment, contrary to predominant belief.  The study takes into account Uber and Lyft, two of the biggest TNCs in the US.  “We are still in the early stages of TNCs and we are likely to see many changes in how these ridesharing businesses operate,” says Hui Kong, postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Urban Mobility Lab, and an author of the paper.  “Our research shows that over time TNCs have intensified urban transport challenges and road congestion in the United States, mainly through the extended duration and slightly through the increased intensity. With this information, policies can then be introduced that could lead to positive changes.”  The authors are not dismissing the potential of TNCs completely however, saying that their possible benefits could indeed be tremendous but translating this promise into actual environmental and congestion-easing gains could also be very complicated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/dotr-public-transportation-guidelines-ncr-plus-ecq-march-29-april-4-2021/","title":"DOTr sets public transportation guidelines for ‘NCR Plus’ lockdown","date":"Mar 28, 2021 8:55 PM PHT","snippet":"The government is allowing 50% passenger capacity for public utility jeepneys and buses, while maintaining the 20% to 30% capacity for railways","body":"The Department of Transportation (DOTr) on Sunday, March 28, announced new guidelines covering public transportation as Metro Manila and nearby provinces are set to be placed under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in a bid to control the worsening coronavirus crisis. The Duterte government announced on Saturday, March 28, that the strictest quarantine level will last from Holy Monday, March 29, to Easter Sunday, April 4. It covers Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite, or the “NCR Plus” bubble.  For public utility jeepneys and buses, the DOTr is allowing 50% of the vehicle’s capacity, excluding the driver and the conductor. It added that the one-seat-apart rule in between passengers, with no standing passengers, must be observed. This is different from the first ECQ implementation during the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 when the government banned mass transportation, angering drivers and commuters alike. Tricycles are only allowed one passenger in the sidecar. There should be no passenger seated right behind the driver. Operations should be approved by the Department of the Interior and Local Government and local government units (LGUs).  UV Express vehicles, meanwhile, are only allowed a maximum of two passengers per row. They should not exceed 50% of capacity as well. Taxis and ride-hailing vehicles are only allowed two passengers per row and one beside the driver. Motorcycle taxis are only allowed to be used by authorized persons outside of residences (APOR). The capital region’s rail lines will retain passenger capacity of 20% to 30%.  The Light Rail Transit Line 1 can only have 370 passengers per train set, while it is 274 for the LRT2, 372 for the Metro Rail Transit Line 3, and 310 for the Philippine National Railways. The railways also have limited operating hours and closures during Holy Week to conduct their annual maintenance activities. Maritime transportation services will only operate at 50% capacity and only authorized passengers under the government’s guidelines are allowed to go on board. The passenger capacity for international inbound flights arriving at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport will remain at a maximum of 1,500 passengers per day.

The electric-car maker had last month said it bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency soaring. Musk, who has been promoting cryptocurrencies through his Twitter account, had last month criticized conventional cash, saying when it “has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.” He had said that the difference with cash made it “adventurous enough” for the S&P 500 company to hold the cryptocurrency. Following Tesla’s investment in bitcoin, several companies, including Uber Technologies and Twitter had shared their views on the cryptocurrency. Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company discussed and “quickly dismissed” the idea of investing in bitcoin. However, he added that Uber could potentially accept the cryptocurrency as payment. Twitter had said earlier it was still undecided in holding bitcoin, while General Motors said it will evaluate whether bitcoin can be accepted as payment for its vehicles.

Pro-democracy protesters also held more candle-lit vigils overnight including in a district of the commercial capital Yangon and in Thahton in Mon State. The vigils came after staff at a funeral service in Mandalay told Reuters on Tuesday that a seven-year-old girl had died of bullet wounds in the city – the youngest victim so far in a bloody crackdown of opposition to the February 1 coup. Soldiers shot at her father but hit the girl who was sitting on his lap inside their home, her sister told the Myanmar Now media outlet. Two men were also killed in the district, it said. The military had no immediate comment on the incident. In what has now often become a deadly game of cat and mouse with security forces during street protests, pro-democracy activists switched tactics and planned to hold a silent strike on Wednesday. “No going out, no shops, no working. All shut down. Just for one day,” Nobel Aung, an illustrator and activist told Reuters. Social media posts and media indicated a range of businesses from ride hailers to pharmacies planned to close. The junta has faced international condemnation for staging the coup that halted Myanmar’s slow transition to democracy and for its lethal suppression of the protests that followed. It has tried to justify the takeover by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent – an accusation the electoral commission has rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency. Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said on Tuesday 164 protesters had been killed and expressed sadness at the deaths, a day after the European Union and the United States imposed more sanctions on groups or individuals linked to the coup. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group says at least 275 people have been killed in the security forces’ crackdown. Zaw Min Tun blamed the bloodshed on the protesters and said nine members of the security forces had been also killed. He said strikes and hospitals not fully operating had caused deaths, including from COVID-19, calling them “undutiful and unethical.” Opponents of military rule have regularly called for strikes and also a civil disobedience campaign, including among civil servants, that has paralyzed parts of the economy.  The junta spokesman also accused media of “fake news” and fanning unrest and said reporters could be prosecuted if they were in contact with the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), as the remnants of Suu Kyi’s government is known. The military has declared the CRPH an illegal organisation and said membership is punishable by death. He also gave details that he said showed how the NLD had created hundreds or even thousands of extra ballots by inventing voters, including in Suu Kyi’s own constituency. The NLD has denied making any attempt to rig the election. Also shown at the junta news conference was video testimony of former Yangon chief minister Phyo Min Thein saying he visited Suu Kyi multiple times and gave her money “whenever needed.” Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, has been in detention since the coup and faces charges that her lawyer says have been cooked up to discredit her. The ousted leader is due to appear for another court hearing via video conferencing on Wednesday after a previous hearing had to be adjourned due to internet problems. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/uber-to-give-uk-drivers-worker-rights/","title":"Uber to give UK drivers workers’ rights after court defeat","date":"Mar 17, 2021 1:22 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber's UK drivers will receive added benefits, including paid holiday time, being enrolled in a pension scheme and receiving no less than the minimum wage after accepting a trip request","body":"In a major victory for unions, Uber’s more than 70,000 British drivers will be paid the minimum wage while picking up and driving passengers as part of the ride-hailing company’s agreement to grant workers’ rights after it lost a groundbreaking Supreme Court case last month. Uber Technologies has pushed back against European and US labor advocates’ demands for better driver compensation with some success, calling for a “third way” of combining flexible on-demand work with more limited benefits than traditional employees receive. The agreement in Britain classifies Uber drivers as workers who are entitled to fewer rights than those classed as employees, who are also guaranteed sick pay and parental leave. Uber in California last year pushed and won a similar compromise on drivers’ status. In a case led by two former Uber drivers, a UK employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as paid holidays, prompting Uber to appeal all the way to Britain’s top court, which ruled against it in February. Uber said at the time it would consult with drivers whilst lawyers said it could take several months for the details of the ruling to be worked out at a further employment tribunal hearing. Meanwhile, more cases could be filed. On Tuesday, Uber said UK drivers would receive some added benefits, including paid holiday time, be enrolled in a pension scheme and receive no less than the minimum wage, which stands at an hourly 8.72 pounds ($12.07) for those aged 25 years and over, after they accept a trip request. “This follows the recent UK Supreme Court ruling, which provides a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status while continuing to let them work flexibly,” Uber said. Drivers will not receive minimum wage during the time they spend waiting for a passenger. That portion, known as cruising or dead-heading, can account for as much as a third of the time drivers spend behind the wheel with the app turned on, according to several US studies. UK and US labor activists have called on Uber to pay drivers from the moment they log onto the app and are available, but Uber has said it could not control what drivers did during that time and whether they were actually working. The Silicon Valley-based company said its drivers in London, by far its largest market in Europe, earn 17 pounds an hour on average and the flexibility to choose if, when and where they work will be retained. Uber has faced opposition from traditional taxi operators and unions who criticised the app for undercutting existing players, leading to protests and regulatory and legal challenges which have forced the company to pull out of some markets. France’s top court in 2020 recognised the right of an Uber driver to be considered an employee while European Union regulators are considering new rules to protect gig economy workers. California lawmakers last year implemented a bill that would have forced gig economy companies to treat their workers as employees, leading Uber to put forth its “third way” ballot proposition, which voters approved. That cemented app-based workers’ status as independent contractors while offering some benefits, including minimum pay while riders are in their cars, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance. In California, Uber has financed at least some of the added benefits by increasing prices for riders. Tuesday’s announcement could impact others in the gig economy, where millions of people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis. “Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives,” said Uber’s Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/softbank-grab-public-listing-talks-spac-deal/","title":"SoftBank-backed Grab in talks to go public in nearly $40-B SPAC deal – sources","date":"Mar 12, 2021 10:07 AM PHT","snippet":"Grab is expected to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion from private investors, according to a report","body":"Grab Holdings Inc is in talks to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that could value the ride-hailing giant at nearly $40 billion, making it the largest ever blank-check deal, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, March 11.

Uber drivers are currently treated as self-employed, meaning that by law they are only afforded minimal protections, a status the Silicon Valley-based company sought to maintain a long-running legal tussle. “The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Uber’s appeal,” judge George Leggatt said on Friday. “The legislation is intended to give certain protections to vulnerable individuals who have little or no say over their pay and working conditions.” A total of 25 drivers were part of the case and Uber said the verdict did not apply to all of its current 60,000 drivers in Britain, including 45,000 in London, one of its most important global markets. “We respect the Court’s decision which focused on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016,” said its Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood. “We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.” Uber shares fell 3.4% in premarket trading following the court announcement. Gig economy workers The gig economy, where people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis, has faced criticism from trade unions who say it is exploitative, while businesses say many of those working in it enjoy the flexibility. It could still take several months for the details of Friday’s decision to be worked at a further employment tribunal hearing to sort through practicalities over sums owed to drivers, according to lawyers. Law firm Leigh Day says eligible drivers may be entitled to an average of 12,000 pounds ($16,780) in compensation. It represents more than 2,000 potential claimants. Uber has faced opposition from unions and challenges to its business model in several countries as it disrupts the taxi market. In November, however, it saw off a challenge in its home market of California where voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees. One of the two former Uber drivers who led the British case, James Farrar, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to do more to reform the gig economy. “I am delighted that workers at last have some remedy because of this ruling, but the government must urgently strengthen the law so that gig workers may also have access to sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/former-grab-philippines-president-brian-cu-joins-cebu-pacific-board-directors/","title":"Brian Cu, former Grab president, joins Cebu Pacific board","date":"Feb 4, 2021 1:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Bernadine Siy, chair of Ateneo de Manila University's board of trustees, also joins Brian Cu in Cebu Air's board","body":"Former Grab Philippines president and co-founder Brian Cu joined Cebu Air as an independent director, the budget airline told the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, February 4.

The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalized and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO. Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region’s most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion. The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments, and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank license in Singapore. Grab’s total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. Moody’s said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency “expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses, and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next 2 to 3 years.” One of the sources said he expects Grab’s IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board. Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021. The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed. Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for an $18-billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month. As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders. Grab caught global attention when Uber sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly 5-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab. It now operates in 397 cities across 8 Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab’s food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company’s biggest segment last year. “It’s quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,” said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming, and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/new-renault-ceo-luca-de-meo-plans-leaner-electric-future/","title":"New Renault boss plans leaner, electric future","date":"Jan 14, 2021 10:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Renault plans to focus on its most profitable models and on new electric launches – including a revamped version of the classic Renault Super Cinq","body":"French carmaker Renault pledged to slim down and focus more on technology as its new chief executive officer laid out plans to revive a business hammered by management turmoil and the COVID-19 crisis. In a departure from the world-conquering view of former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn, CEO Luca de Meo said Renault would reduce the number of cars it turns out, focus on its most profitable models and on new electric launches – including a revamped version of the classic Renault Super Cinq. “We grew bigger, but not better,” De Meo said in an online presentation, which aimed to project a jazzier, more youthful brand under a street-art style “Renaulution” slogan. De Meo, who arrived last July after a stint running Volkswagen’s Seat brand, said the task now was to “steer our business from market share to margin.” Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the car industry, Renault was struggling to adjust to life without Ghosn, the architect and longtime boss of its alliance with Japan’s Nissan. Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges, which he denies, and later fled. The company also faces new challenges, as the European Union tightens emissions regulations and rivals PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles complete their merger to create Stellantis, the world’s 4th biggest automaker, with potentially more resources to meet the industry changes. Renault’s car production will drop to 3.1 million vehicles by 2025 from 4 million in 2019 – and down from the 5 million per year targeted by Ghosn in 2017. Half of new launches will be electrified, manufacturing will be simplified, and Renault will also focus on areas like car sharing and ride hailing, with the aim of deriving a fifth of revenues from these mobility services by 2030. De Meo ruled out further job cuts, beyond the 15,000 it earmarked last year over the next 2 to 3 years. But he hiked cost savings goals, with an extra 500 million euros ($608 million) planned to reach 2.5 billion euros by 2023, and then 3 billion euros by 2025. Investors were initially unimpressed, with Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois describing profit goals as “underwhelming,” reflecting the “depth of challenges at Renault.” Shares had largely recovered by 1153 GMT, trading down 0.3%. Underscoring attempts at a fresh start for its troubled alliance with Nissan, Renault included a video message in its presentation from the Japanese carmaker’s boss Makoto Uchida, who gave the plan his thumbs up. Under De Meo’s efficiency drive, Renault will build vehicles on fewer shared platforms to pare back costs by 600 euros per car by 2023, and aim to cut development time for new vehicles by a year, to under 3 years. The 53-year old’s shift to a more electric lineup will include building a battery plant in France with one of the company’s suppliers, while the company is working on partnerships in areas like technology. “We’ll move from a car company working with tech to a tech company working with cars,” De Meo said. Renault aims to lift operating margins to 5% by 2023. It also plans to lower capital spending and research costs to 8% of revenue from 10% by 2025. Together, these measures should lower Renault’s break-even point by 30% by 2023. The company has yet to publish margins for 2020, though following the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted operations, they are likely to be lower than the 4.8% hit in 2019. Renault also said it was targeting automotive free cash flow of 3 billion euros by 2023, and 6 billion by 2025. “The commitment to short-term cash targets is positive as it remains the key concern for investors,” Citibank analysts wrote in a client note. Renault said it had drawn an additional chunk of its 5-billion-euro government-guaranteed loan secured early in the COVID-19 crisis. The company said it would combine all its sports car efforts into one unit “dedicated to developing exclusive and innovative” vehicles, with Formula One racing “at the heart of the project.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-city-lockdown-new-covid-19-threat/","title":"Another Chinese city goes into lockdown amid new COVID-19 threat","date":"Jan 12, 2021 5:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Chinese authorities introduce new COVID-19 curbs in areas surrounding Beijing, putting 4.9 million residents under lockdown","body":"Chinese authorities introduced new COVID-19 curbs in areas surrounding Beijing on Tuesday, January 12, putting 4.9 million residents under lockdown as new infections raised worries about a second wave in a nation that has mostly contained the disease. The number of new cases in mainland China reported on Tuesday almost halved from a day earlier and remained a small fraction of what it saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020. However, local authorities are implementing strict curbs whenever new cases emerge to prevent the kind of economic paralysis seen a year ago. The National Health Commission reported 55 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, down from 103 a day earlier. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, accounted for 40 of the 42 locally transmitted infections, with the capital and northeastern Heilongjiang province reporting one local case each. The city of Langfang in Hebei on Tuesday said its 4.9 million residents will be put under home quarantine for 7 days and be subject to mass COVID-19 testing. Two counties under Langfang’s jurisdiction that border Beijing – Guan and Sanhe – had already announced home quarantine measures. Guan reported one new COVID-19 case but Sanhe did not say whether any of its residents were diagnosed with the disease. Shijiazhuang, Hebei’s capital, has been hardest hit in the latest surge in infections and has already placed its 11 million people under lockdown. The province has shut off certain sections of highways and is ordering vehicles registered to Shijiazhuang to turn back. Gaocheng district in Shijiazhuang is gathering more than 20,000 people living in 12 remote villages into centralized quarantine as part of the city’s COVID-19 control, state media China News Service reported late Monday. Authorities in Beijing’s Xicheng district said on Tuesday that the confirmed COVID-19 patient from Guan county works at a building in the district. At a village in the south of Beijing that shares a border with Hebei, residents were stopping vehicles and asking to see health-tracking codes on mobile phones. “Measures have tightened since Jan. 8,” said a volunteer security officer surnamed Wang. “We’ve to be careful as we’re near Guan, where COVID cases were reported today.” At a Beijing highway checkpoint near the border with Hebei, police officers in protective gowns ordered a car entering Beijing to return to Hebei after the driver was unable to show proof that he had passed a COVID-19 test. A new guideline issued by the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommended that taxi and ride-hailing operators suspend car-pooling services, the Communist Party-backed Beijing Daily reported on Tuesday. The guideline also said that drivers should get a nucleic acid test for coronavirus every week and be vaccinated in order to work. Other provinces in China are reporting new confirmed or asymptomatic cases. Heilongjiang province reported 36 new asymptomatic cases in Wangkui county, which also went into lockdown on Monday. Authorities do not classify asymptomatic cases as confirmed COVID-19 infections. The cities of Yichun and Qiqihar in Heilongjiang on Tuesday reported one and 7 new asymptomatic cases linked to Wangkui, respectively. The city of Changchun – the capital of neighboring Jilin province – reported 7 new asymptomatic patients on Jan. 11, 4 of whom had traveled from Wangkui recently. Residential compounds that these patients lived in were put into lockdown, preventing people and vehicles from leaving the premises. Authorities in Wuhan, where COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, on Monday launched contact tracing work after two infected people from Hebei visited the city. Across China, the number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 81 from 76 a day earlier. In a rare move, Jinzhong, a city in Shanxi province that shares a border with Shijiazhuang, said on Tuesday that it will administer COVID-19 tests on all travelers from Hebei on arrival, on top of other mandatory COVID-19 tests. Jinzhong reported on Monday two asymptomatic patients who had returned from Hebei. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in mainland China now stands at 87,591, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/google-workers-form-small-union/","title":"Google workers form small union, eyeing more protests over working conditions","date":"Jan 5, 2021 1:25 PM PHT","snippet":"The Alphabet Workers Union will be part of the Communications Workers of America labor group","body":"More than 200 workers at Google and other Alphabet Inc units on Monday, January 4, formed a labor union for US and Canadian offices, building on years of protests over working conditions and business practices but falling far short of the support needed to force the tech giant to the bargaining table. Backers believe the “Alphabet Workers Union,” which evolved from an informal group of activist employees, will better shield members from firings or other forms of retaliation. It will also enable the group to collect dues to hire support staff and attack the company more aggressively than in the past, internal leaders and outside labor experts said. The union will be part of the Communications Workers of America labor group, which also represents employees from Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. Alphabet members will pay dues of 1% of their total compensation. Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in response on Monday that the company supports its employees’ “protected labor rights” and will “continue engaging directly with all our employees.” Unlike traditional labor unions in the U.S., the Alphabet group is a so-called “minority union” that will not be able to force the company to collectively bargain over wages or other issues. Under U.S. labor law, Alphabet can ignore the union’s demands until a majority of employees support it. In addition, the union plans to represent third-party contractors, a class of workers whose demands Alphabet also may ignore. Union leaders acknowledge that widespread support is unlikely soon. Well-paying jobs, with perks such as free meals and gyms, mostly have kept unionization out of the tech industry. But labor activism is creeping into the tech industry as workers and regulators grapple with the power of sprawling internet companies including Alphabet. Chewy Shaw, the Alphabet union’s vice chair, said small fractions of the workforce successfully protested in recent years over workplace equity and ethical business practices. Those actions helped prompt Google to introduce new policies around workplace investigations and to drop a drone software project with the U.S. military. The union aims to mount similar campaigns, with the new funding and structure lending greater legitimacy and resources, Shaw said. Google has been under fire from the U.S. labor regulator, which has accused the company of unlawfully questioning several workers who were then terminated for protesting company policies and trying to organize a union. Google has said it was confident it acted legally. Non-traditional unions of contractors or a small slice of employees at companies, universities and government agencies have successfully pressured for changes for more than a century, said Joseph McCartin, labor historian at Georgetown University. Shaw, a site reliability engineer at Google, said he studied unionizing by small groups including Chicago public school teachers as well as staff and faculty at Tennessee colleges. More recently, the Independent Drivers Guild, a 4-year-old group representing 80,000 ride-hailing app contract drivers in New York City, has won benefits for members around tips, disciplinary appeals and rest breaks.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/angkas-provisional-authority-operate-metro-manila-november-24-december-9-2020/","title":"Angkas allowed back on the road in Metro Manila","date":"Nov 24, 2020 3:55 PM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) The government grants Angkas provisional authority to operate until December 9","body":"Motorcycle taxi giant Angkas can resume operations in Metro Manila starting Tuesday, November 24, until at least December 9. In a statement on Tuesday, the Motorcycle Taxi Technical Working Group (TWG) said it has granted Angkas provisional authority (PA) to operate. Following the announcement, Angkas said it would begin operating again on Wednesday, November 25, with around 6,500 of its riders to return. To secure a certificate of compliance, which would allow Angkas to operate beyond the December 9 validity of the PA, the motorcycle taxi giant would need to comply with government requirements. “[The] certificate of compliance will give them authority to operate during the pilot study,” said Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Hope Libiran. One of the requirements is insurance for both riders and passengers. “Aside from the heightened protocols and training that we employ, we are compliant with ensuring there is insurance coverage for every ride booked on our platform and will be providing the documentation to the TWG,” said  George Royeca, Angkas chief transport advocate. The TWG also told Angkas to provide thermal scanners to detect if a passenger has fever, but this requirement, according to the TWG statement, is still “for discussion” with the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19. Libiran said the thermal scanners are not in the existing guidelines of the NTF, but the “TWG believes these are necessary.” “We will take it up with the NTF for their consideration,” Libiran added. Angkas previously designed a barrier between driver and passenger to “protect” both of them from COVID-19 transmission. But some have argued that barriers are unnecessary and unsafe. Later on Tuesday, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said JoyRide was also given provisional authority to operate until December 9. MoveIt, another ride-hailing firm, has yet to be issued a PA. Libiran said the TWG has yet to receive a letter signifying MoveIt has complied with requirements. In 2019, Angkas motorcycle drivers were allowed to offer rides under a DOTr-led pilot study.  The test run was extended to accommodate JoyRide and MoveIt, but it had to be cut a few days short because of the coronavirus lockdown last March. In October, the Philippine government allowed motorcycle ride-hailing services to augment transportation in Metro Manila, which has been limited due to coronavirus restrictions.

The new app update – which would be rolled out to some users starting Wednesday – includes the Cash-in with Driver feature which essentially allows sedan-service passengers to top up credits with the drivers. Previously, users could only top up with select drivers. Now, the update will fully integrate the feature into the platform. All users will have the update by mid-November, according to Grab. The move is seen to minimize cash transactions – a requirement set by transport regulators given the pandemic. Under the initial run, users will be able to top up with their drivers in the following services: Grab Philippines head of transport and shared services Ronald Roda said the feature will be expanded to other services in the coming months. Users who have yet to set up the ride-hailing firm’s virtual wallet GrabPay will be asked to do so. The national government’s coronavirus task force recently allowed motorcycle taxis to resume operations, pending guidelines from transport agencies. Asked whether Grab would consider venturing into the service again, Roda answered that they could “if given a chance.” “I think it would be easy [to return]. We have 70,000 two-wheel drivers which would make it easy for us to convert if needed,” he added. In mid-2016, Grab used to offer motorcycle hailing services, but this was discontinued as the antiquated law banned two-wheelers from being hired.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to issue guidelines on the pilot study. Previously, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) had endorsed the request of Metro Manila mayors to resume the motorcycle taxi pilot study which expired last April. The pilot study allowed Angkas and JoyRide services to continue while lawmakers studied a bill that would legalize and regulate such services. Motorcycle taxis are seen as an affordable alternative mode of transportation sorely needed given the passenger seating restrictions in trains, buses, and jeepneys to ensure physical distancing. Calls for motorcycle taxis to resume operations grew as the government allowed more types of business establishments to reopen, putting more pressure on public transportation to answer the needs of a growing number of commuting workers. Angkas presented a barrier between driver and backrider designed to protect them from COVID-19 transmission. Backriding in motorcycles was previously limited to people from the same household. The government also initially required a barrier between the driver and backrider who lived together.

Uber drivers split ahead of California vote","date":"Oct 18, 2020 6:41 PM PHT","snippet":"Proposition 22 will determine whether California can enforce a law requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors","body":"Ahead of a referendum that could upend the whole gig economy, Uber driver Karim Benkanoun says his relationship with the rideshare giant must stop being a one-way street. “If you’re a driver with Uber or Lyft, you’re nothing,” said Benkanoun as he speaks of how he will vote in California’s Proposition 22 referendum. “They don’t consider us as employees, they consider us as independent contractors but we have no say in the contract. “It doesn’t work this way and it has to change.” Proposition 22, which is being put to voters on the same day as the November 3 presidential election, will determine whether California’s government can enforce a law which became effective this year requiring on-demand companies to treat drivers as employees, instead of independent contractors. Were the referendum to be approved, drivers would remain independent contractors but Uber and Lyft would pay them a number of benefits promised as part of a compromise package, including a minimum wage, a contribution to health care and other forms of insurance. If it doesn’t pass, the drivers would be classified as employees and thus entitled to all the benefits laid out in California labor law.  Supporters in the “Yes” camp are warning of mass job losses if they lose as the companies could not afford to keep on all their drivers and say others will quit because they will automatically have less flexibility. While supporters argue the bill would mean increasingly hard-pressed drivers are guaranteed to earn between $25 and $28 per hour, critics cite a University of California study showing that compensation equates to only $5.64 per hour after subtracting unreimbursed costs, taxes and waiting time. The measure has divided drivers, some of whom want the benefits of regular employment while others such as Sergei Fyodorov enjoy the flexibility of being able to work on weekends or whenever he chooses to pick up extra income. “If you make a living out of it, great, but for me it’s supplemental income and flexibility,” said Fyodorov, who has a regular job as a project manager at a tech company. “Let’s say Proposition 22 does not happen. I can guarantee that Lyft, Uber and all these services will lay off at least 80 or 70 percent of the drivers and the main thing is that we’re not going to get the flexibility.” Geoff Vetter, a spokesman for the “Yes” campaign, said hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost across a global industry headquartered in California, arguing many drivers would quit if they have to work set hours. “With Proposition 22, we’re trying to recognize first that these drivers want to remain independent contractors – more than 70 percent of drivers say they want to remain independent contractors because it gives them flexibility and choice – while also getting new benefits like a minimum guarantee (for wages) and health care,” said Vetter. Benkanoun, who began working with Uber in 2012, says he used to make between $1,500 and $2,000 a week but is now lucky to make $500 before expenses despite working a seven-day week with demand shrunk by the Covid-19 pandemic. As his income has dwindled, so has his faith in the rideshare companies. “I don’t trust anything Uber or Lyft says,” he said. Another driver, Erica Mighetto of Sacramento, said she was making $40 an hour when she started driving 4 years ago but only $20 earlier this year and now that’s closer to $10 an hour in pandemic conditions. “Uber and Lyft are just trying to exempt themselves from the benefits that drivers need,” said Mighetto, who drove from her home in Sacramento to take part in a recent demonstration calling for a “No” vote. She slept in her car. “We need a guaranteed minimum wage and overtime and in this time we desperately need employment for drivers who are unable to work and support their families.” Uber and Lyft have said they may need to terminate service in the state if their business model is upended.  Lyft said its survey of drivers showed 86 percent worked fewer than 20 hours per week and most preferred to keep the flexible contractor model; Uber has also said the majority of its drivers want to keep their situation. “While these services feel ubiquitous to our lives, they’re very new,” Vetter told Agence France-Presse. “I think there’s recognition we need to apply a 21st century solution to 21st century challenges.” But drivers like Mighetto are not convinced. “They’re really trying to scare drivers and scare voters into doing what they want,” she said. “I think that billionaire companies are able to offer flexibility as well as minimum protection.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grace-de-vera-new-grab-philippines-country-head/","title":"Grab Philippines names Grace Vera Cruz as new country head","date":"Oct 15, 2020 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Grace Vera Cruz takes the helm of Grab Philippines on Thursday, October 15","body":"Grab Philippines on Thursday, October 15, said it has named Grace Vera Cruz as its new country head, months after Brian Cu resigned.

Grab driver Florence Norial, 26, was detained from around 7:40 pm on Tuesday evening up to as late as Wednesday afternoon after  she was accused of direct assault, alarm and scandal, and disobedience to authority from the encounter. This developed after Florence asked a driver to move his vehicle which was blocking the exit driveway of Grace Mall in Taguig City. At that time, she just picked up her Grab passenger from the mall. It turned out the driver of the vehicle blocking the passage was a certain Captain Ronald Saquilayan “Help pls! Nasa…police station po ako ngayon. Gusto po ako ikulong. Nag pick up ako pasahero sa Starbucks, ngayon kahit anong pakiusap ko s [pulis] na nasa harap ay ayaw umalis,”  Florence said in a Facebook status on Tuesday 8:41 pm, before she was detained. (Help please. I am at a police statioon now. They want to jail me. I picked up a passenger at Starbucks, and whatever pleaded  I made to ask the police to move, he still didn’t want to leave.) Mirza Miguel Shahzad – Florence’s boyfriend who spoke and stayed with her before she was locked away – denied the allegations of the police, providing an hour-by-hour account of the events to Rappler in an email.  Narrating Florence’s and his experience on Tuesday evening, Miguel said that the policeman was first to hit Florence. He said that Florence only acted on self-defense, and that the charges against her were fabricated, with the help of other personnel of the Taguig City Police. In a text message to Rappler, Taguig police chief Colonel Celso Rodriguez said Saquilayan was not assigned in their area, but was detailed with the Pateros police. He did not confirm whether they would launch a probe into the incident.  Meanwhile, Pateros police chief Colonel Ramchrisen Haveria Jr confirmed in a phone interview with Rappler, that Saquilayan was assigned with them.  Still,  Haveria said Taguig police should investigate the incident as it happened under their territorial responsibility. In a text message to Rappler, Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said they were “already investigating the matter” and have “reached out to the family of the driver.” At around 7 pm on Tuesday evening, October 6, Florence was taking a passenger to the Starbucks branch in Grace Mall.  They stopped at the  driveway of the mall because a stalled dark grey Ford Ranger blocked the passage. Florence flashed her headlights and honked her horn, but the vehicle did not move. She walked over to the stalled vehicle and knocked on the driver’s door. Still, she was ignored. Florence asked the assistance of the guard nearby, and they knocked on the Ranger’s door once more.  This time the door swung open “suddenly and forcefully,” Miguel said, knocking Florence down to the bushes beside the driveway and injuring her. On impulse and in self-defense, Florence stood up and slapped the driver. The driver then said he was a police officer and arrested Florence.  The man who arrested Florence was wearing a printed black shirt and camouflage pants.

In her last Facebook status before her arrest, Florence attached a video of her argument with the driver of the stalled vehicle. In the video, the man said “I am police Captain Ronald Saquilayan,” and said he was arresting Florence “for hurting me, for hitting me.”  Aside from the vague reason for the arrest, the police officer did not read her rights which is the standard protocol."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/investors-load-funds-uber-freight-october-2-2020/","title":"Investors load $500 million into Uber’s trucking business","date":"Oct 3, 2020 7:55 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber says it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation","body":"Uber on Friday, October 2, said an investment group led by Greenbriar Equity is pumping $500 million into its trucking unit. The preferred stock financing values Uber Freight at $3.3 billion, and comes as the San Francisco-based company’s core ride-sharing service is stalled due to the pandemic. Uber Freight matches truckers to shippers in much the way the ride service connects passengers with drivers in the so-called on-demand economy. While Uber’s ride service has suffered due to people hunkering down or being reluctant to get into cars with strangers due to COVID-19 risk, the freight unit, which launched in 2017, has grown. “We have led the industry with technology, transforming dated and analog processes to ensure that both shippers and carriers are equipped to succeed in a rapidly changing industry,” said Uber Freight chief Lior Ron. Uber said it will retain a majority stake in Freight, using the money to expand the logistics platform and speed up technology innovation. “We are excited to support Uber Freight in the next stage of its development,” said Greenbriar managing partner Michael Weiss. “We believe that carriers and shippers will be increasingly attracted to the convenience and simplicity that Uber Freight offers in a complex marketplace.” Greenbriar has been involved in the logistics sector for decades and brings expertise that Uber Freight can tap into, Weiss added. Uber reported a $1.8-billion loss in the 2nd quarter of this year as the COVID-19 pandemic caused its shared-ride business revenue to plunge. Meanwhile, California has filed lawsuits against Uber and Lyft for alleged wage theft by misclassifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, in violation of a recently enacted state law. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash are backing a state ballot initiative in November’s election which would classify rideshare drivers and other gig-economy workers as independent contractors, while offering certain benefits such as minimum wage, sick leave, and workers’ compensation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-city-prepares-for-gradual-return-of-jeepneys/","title":"Cebu City prepares for gradual return of jeepneys","date":"Sep 29, 2020 4:17 PM PHT","snippet":"Mayor Edgardo Labella forms a task force to prepare for the comeback of the city's trusty main public conveyance","body":"The Cebu City Government created a task force Tuesday, September 29, to study steps it would take leading to the return of the traditional jeepneys here. Jeepneys and other forms of public transportation were pulled out of the streets when the national government imposed a lockdown in key areas of the country in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In a virtual presser Mayor Edgardo Labella said he signed Tuesday Executive Order No. 093, establishing a task force to study the prospect of allowing the reoperation of public utility jeepneys (PUJ) when quarantine restrictions are lifted.   Among the task force’s responsibilities were to assess the feasibility of allowing the reoperation of PUJs, as well as, to draft guidelines and procedures, and safety protocols  for passengers and drivers . The task force is headed by Cebu City councilor James Anthony Cuenco. The members are  Traffic Office head Alma Casimero, Land Transportation Office (LTO)- Central Visayas director Victor Caindec, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)- Central Visayas director Eduardo Montealto Jr, councilors Renato Osmeña Jr and Niña Mabatid, legal officer Rey Gealon, and Anne Marie Cuizon of the Planning and Development Office.  Labella clarified that any decision endorsed by the task force would still be subject to approval by LTO and LTFRB.  “Bisan og naflatten na ang curve, hinay-hinayon nato og pabalik ang atong mga jeepneys (Even though the curve has been flattened, the return of our jeepneys has to be gradual). With certain guidelines and of course, with the approval of  LTFRB and LTO,” he told Cebu media.  With Cebu City currently under the least restrictive modified general community quarantine, taxis and ride-hailing companies have become the main mode of public transport. Greg Perez, the spokesperson for Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide- Cebu, said this move by the city government is a welcome development. He added that his fellow drivers had been calling for the return of PUJs for months. “Truthfully, we’ve long awaited this move from the local government unit to allow our PUJ drivers, who are currently starving and have nothing to eat, to reoperate,” he told Rappler in Cebuano. According to him, some of the displaced drivers have decided to return to their provinces while some have opted to work for construction companies or drive taxis.  On September 28, Cebu City recorded 3 new cases of COVID-1 – the lowest number of single-day new cases recorded by the city. As of Monday, Cebu City has reached a total of 9,978 cases. Of this, 392 are active cases.

The company, which has 3.5 million customers and 45,000 drivers in the British capital, has now overturned Transport for London’s (TfL) refusal to renew its operating license around the issue of unauthorized drivers. The San Francisco-based firm was permitted to continue operating in London during the appeal process. Despite pointing to Uber’s “historical failings,” judge Tan Ikram on Monday said Uber was “a fit and proper person” to hold a private hire vehicle operator’s license in the capital. He noted that Uber had sought to explain how breaches had taken place and how they would be remedied. Jamie Heywood, Uber’s general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said Monday’s decision was a recognition of the company’s “commitment to safety.” Heywood admitted that Uber’s behavior over the problem of unauthorized drivers had been wrong. “It was not what we would do now. It was inadequate, we could have done better,” he said. TfL, which is chaired by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, acknowledged on Monday that Uber had implemented a number of changes to improve passenger safety. “Public safety is paramount, so TfL was absolutely right not to renew Uber’s license last November after identifying failures that directly put passengers in danger,” said Khan in response to the news. “I am pleased that Uber have admitted that their response to very real concerns about passenger safety was inadequate, and since then Uber has made improvements. “I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers.” The transport authority had argued in November that some Uber trips across London had taken place with unlicensed, suspended, or dismissed drivers. And it contended that there was a “pattern of failures,” including the use of unauthorized drivers on other Uber drivers’ accounts, allowing them to pick up passengers. In court, the judge said Uber had tightened up review processes over issues of document and insurance fraud. “Uber does not have a perfect record, but it has been an improving picture,” Ikram added. “The test as to whether Uber are a ‘fit and proper person’ does not require perfection. “I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,” the judge said. Uber’s London operation has suffered previous license suspensions in addition to protests from the capital’s traditional black cab drivers. Monday’s decision was meanwhile slammed by an industry group representing those black cab drivers. “The judge himself has recognized that Uber has more to do, noting that [Uber] is ‘not perfect’ but ‘improving’ and has ‘reduced incidents,'” the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association said in a statement. “He is playing Russian roulette with the safety of Londoners and I fear it’s only a matter of time until the next incident.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-philippines-extends-ride-hailing-operating-hours/","title":"Grab extends ride-hailing operating hours","date":"Sep 2, 2020 1:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing giant extends the operating hours for GrabCar and GrabTaxi","body":"Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story said the operating hours were being shortened.

The Labor Department reported a worse-than-expected 1.1 million new claims for unemployment benefits, a jump from the prior week that underscored the continued weakness of the US economy. But Wall Street pushed higher anyway, led by large technology companies that have benefited during the coronavirus, which has kept consumers at home and boosted e-commerce and streaming services. Led by Apple, Facebook, and other giants, the tech-rich Nasdaq rocketed to yet another record and was joined in positive territory by the Dow and S&P 500, which won more modest gains. Earlier, bourses in Paris, London, and Frankfurt all fell more than 1%. A note from Charles Schwab said recent upticks in new COVID-19 cases in European countries are “continuing to drag on sentiment.” While Italy registered 845 new cases on Thursday, its highest daily tally since May, France reported 4,700 fresh infections — a massive increase on the previous day. While Spain’s daily increases topped even those of France, Germany was examining its own resurgence. Despite the rise in cases, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official said additional lockdowns should not be necessary. “With the basic nationwide and additional targeted measures, we are in a much better position to stamp out these localized virus flare-ups,” the head of the WHO’s European branch, Hans Kluge, told reporters. “We can manage the virus and keep the economy running and an education system in operation,” he added.  Among individual companies, ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft surged 6.8% and 5.8%, respectively, after a California appeals court gave them a reprieve from being required to reclassify drivers as employees in their home state of California. Shortly before the appeals court decision, Lyft said it would suspend its rideshare service in the state rather than treat drivers as employees entitled to benefits. American Airlines dropped 1.4% as it announced it will eliminate service to 15 smaller US markets as cash-strapped carriers downsize their operations to cope with the ongoing coronavirus crisis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/california-court-tells-uber-lyft-classify-drivers-employees/","title":"California court tells Uber, Lyft to classify drivers as employees","date":"Aug 12, 2020 12:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber CEO says outdated employment system 'forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net'","body":"A California court has given Uber and Lyft until the middle of next week to reclassify drivers as employees in compliance with a new state law. The order came Monday, August 10, when a judge granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based. The suit calls on the companies to comply with a state law that went into effect at the start of this year that requires “gig workers” such as Uber and Lyft drivers to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits. “The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,” Becerra said in a release. “While this fight still has a long way to go, we’re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve.” Uber is backing a referendum in the state to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent. The judge wrote in the ruling that Uber and Lyft could not indefinitely put off their “day of reckoning” when it came to complying with the law. Uber has argued that most of its drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits. Lyft vowed to appeal the judge’s ruling, referring to the court battle as a fight for driver independence. “Drivers do not want to be employees, full stop,” Lyft said in response to an AFP inquiry. “Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.” “Misclassification hurts drivers and it puts the burden on taxpayers to pay for benefits that Uber and Lyft should be providing,” said San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera. “During this global pandemic, it’s even more important for drivers to get access to protections like unemployment insurance.” The judge gave Uber and Lyft 10 days to comply with the order, which the companies can appeal. Uber outlined proposals this week for a new type of relationship with gig workers, including its own drivers, that would keep them as independent contractors but with some guaranteed benefits. The ride-hailing giant described “a new model for independent platform work” in a document it hopes can be used as a blueprint for Uber and similar firms relying on independent workers. The company seeks “to deliver certainty for millions of independent contractors who will increasingly rely on independent work to help them face the economic challenges that lie ahead,” Uber said in its document. Uber proposed that gig economy companies be required to establish “benefits funds,” allowing gig workers to accrue and use the money for benefits or paid leave. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, writing in The New York Times, said that the current employment system is outdated and “forces every worker to choose between being an employee with more benefits but less flexibility, or an independent contractor with more flexibility but almost no safety net.” Uber argues that requiring drivers to be classified as employees would leave jobs only for a small fraction of its drivers and that costs would become more expensive. More than 85% of Lyft drivers in California work fewer than 20 hours weekly, with many of them seeking flexible hours because they are parents, students, retirees or hold other jobs, according to the company. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/tiktok-wechat-app-primer/","title":"TikTok and WeChat: Chinese apps dogged by security fears","date":"Aug 7, 2020 6:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are some key facts about Chinese-owned social media platforms TikTok and WeChat","body":"The United States has fired a new salvo in its rivalry with China, ordering sweeping restrictions against Chinese-owned social media stars TikTok and WeChat. Here are some key facts about the platforms: WeChat, known as “weixin” or micro-message in Chinese, belongs to tech giant Tencent and has grown to become ubiquitous in daily life across China since its 2011 launch. It has more than a billion monthly users and is a “super app” used for everything from messaging to ride-hailing and mobile payments, while also serving as a social media platform. Tencent surpassed Facebook’s net worth after it became the first Asian firm to be valued at more than $500 billion in 2017. The Hong Kong-listed company now has a market capitalisation of HK$5.32 trillion ($686 billion), compared with Facebook’s $756 billion. While WeChat is available in various languages, its main user base is in mainland China, where potential rivals such as Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging service are barred from competing. It is also a widely used among the Chinese diaspora, and foreigners doing business in the country, to keep in touch with people there. Tencent has shares in many American companies, including electric-car maker Tesla, social media company Snap, and top games developers such as Riot Games, Epic Games and Activision Blizzard. WeChat has been dogged by privacy concerns. The platform censors content for all users registered with Chinese phone numbers, even if they go abroad or switch to an international number, according to a University of Toronto study from 2016. Another report from the same university in May said accounts not registered in China were also subject to “pervasive content surveillance”. Chinese authorities routinely censor online content and block Western websites such as Facebook, Twitter and the New York Times. WeChat’s privacy policy says the platform only shares user information “where necessary” with governments and law enforcement agencies. TikTok features kaleidoscopic feeds of short user-made videos of anything from hair-dye tutorials to choreographed dance routines. It belongs to Chinese tech firm ByteDance and targets the international market while Douyin, a domestic version of the platform, caters exclusively to Chinese users. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times since its 2017 launch, according to data from US-based research agency SensorTower. The app is most popular among teenagers but has found fresh popularity during coronavirus lockdowns around the world as adults look for new ways to pass the time. It attracted huge followings in the United States, Indonesia and other countries, but it recently became one of 59 Chinese mobile apps banned by India over national security and privacy concerns. TikTok has in recent months sought to distance itself from its Chinese owners. It appointed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, an American, as its new chief executive in May. It also withdrew from Hong Kong shortly after China imposed a new security law on the city that gave police fresh powers to censor the internet — a move that analysts said was an effort to avoid the suggestion it was a Chinese-controlled company. But the app has nonetheless been accused of privacy breaches. Trump previously set a deadline of mid-September for TikTok to be acquired by a US firm or be banned in the US. Microsoft has expanded its talks on TikTok to a potential deal that would include buying the global operations of the fast-growing app, the Financial Times reported Thursday. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/how-governments-around-the-world-protecting-healthcare-workers/","title":"How governments around the world are protecting their healthcare workers","date":"Aug 4, 2020 7:39 PM PHT","snippet":"While Duterte taunts overwhelmed Filipino frontliners, other governments push harder to protect workers from infection, give extra pay, and provide mental aid","body":"Around the world, the medical community is tired. The coronavirus pandemic has yet to show signs of an end, but how well medical frontliners will hold up greatly depends on how well their governments take care of them. In the Philippines’ Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, President Rodrigo Duterte mandated protections for healthcare workers (HCWs), such as entitlement to a “COVID-19 special risk allowance” on top of hazard pay, insured medical expenses, and compensation if they should severely contract the virus or die from COVID-19. By the beginning of July, the Department of Health scrambled to find ways to compensate the workers as the law expired on June 25. Congress is also investigating reports of corruption in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). On the evening of August 3, Duterte heard the plea of the overwhelmed healthcare workers and brought back lockdowns, but not without daring them to stage a “revolution.” The government has insisted that healthcare capacities are still holding up, but the situations on the ground tell a different story. How are healthcare workers – also fatigued by the pandemic – taken care of in other parts of the world? Italy was once the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, but charts show that daily confirmed cases have gone down from the thousands to the hundreds. The grind was so heavy on emergency medical technician Quintin Cavite, that he said he never experienced a lockdown situation as he was always on the run. The first responder is also an overseas Filipino worker (OFW). “One of the first problems was the need for more personal protective equipment (PPE), but the government did everything [to] make sure that the PPEs were guaranteed to all frontliners,” he told Rappler via Facebook Messenger. Cavite said the Italian government also provided increases in regular salaries from €30 to €97 (P1,734 to P5,608), and a bonus ranging from €800 to €1,800 (P46,243 to P104,048) for medical workers – the amount depending on the role. Frontliners were also offered psychological support and intensive courses for specialization. He said there is a “well-organized” network of collaboration among frontliners, with everyone knowing what their task was. A civil protection department became the lone body responsible for releasing official updates about the pandemic, and so the community was able to avoid confusion over information. “The Italian government was able to flatten the curve because of clear programs to fight COVID-19. [Forms of government aid] still continue up to the present even if the pandemic issues seem to calm down,” said Cavite. When it came to HCW protection, South Korea’s strategy angled on prevention. A recent study found South Korea was able to maintain low rates of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers during the first few months of the pandemic. The study said the Korean government crafted measures to mitigate burnout for its HCWs in line with findings of a China-based report that workers from high-risk departments would be infected if they worked for more than 15 hours a day.  These measures included putting a cap on 40 hours a week with overtime pay for workers deployed to COVID-19 hot spots like Daegu and Gyeongbok area. Korea kept HCWs protected through a multi-pronged approach of “centralized coordination, local adaptation of key protocols, and a strong backbone of public health fundamentals (physical distancing, contact tracing, testing, isolation, and treatment).” “Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was foundational, but HCW infection control could not have been successful without a robust system of triage (screening patients) and coordination that increased health system capacity,” according to the study. As of posting, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has yet to record a daily new increase of cases over 1,000. It has been able to carry out more than 5 million tests among its 9-million population, although it has yet to show a flattened curve. Joanne Rico, who does marketing and sales for a hospital in Abu Dhabi, said the government from the get-go focused on expanding healthcare capacities to avoid the point of overwhelming the frontliners. Rico said these include testing, insurance coverage, segregation and management of cases, and efficient use of PPE sets. “This is the beauty of a non-overwhelmed healthcare system. We are not crying for any monetary reward or recognition because we [have felt] the UAE government’s presence in flattening the curve since day one,” said Rico via Facebook Messenger. Rico also stressed the UAE government’s efforts to curb the mental toll on frontliners and other vulnerable groups. The UAE National Programme for Happiness and Wellbeing launched its “Mental Support Line” in May. “I think this is a remarkable initiative by the UAE government to support the mental health of vulnerable people during the coronavirus outbreak, especially [since] many residents are becoming extremely concerned, not only [about] their own physical and economic health, but also about the physical and economic conditions of their families back in their home countries,” she said. If New York were a country, it would rank as the 8th country in the world to have the most confirmed coronavirus cases at 421,550 as of August 4.  New York has an existing law in place that protects workers in times of outbreaks and crises called the Worker’s Compensation Law. “From diseases like tuberculosis and asbestosis, to the tragedy of 9/11, and to the opioid crisis, the Board has always risen to meet the needs of injured workers across the state. COVID-19 is no exception,” the New York Workers’ Compensation Board’s website says. The law provides for the following: payment of an injured worker’s medical treatment for a work-related illness or injury, wage replacement benefits if illness prevents work, benefits to an employee’s surviving dependents in the event of a death, and reimbursement of funeral expenses up to $12,500 (P613,000). Frontliners in New York are also entitled to free mental health services through a hotline. The experiences of a nurse in the UK are far from perfect. The British government’s response to the pandemic has long garnered criticism, one of the reasons being its priority placed on maintaining the economy. In the first months, the strategy was to allow the virus to spread to build up the population’s herd immunity. (READ: Working with fear and anxiety: Filipino nurses as UK frontliners vs coronavirus) “Aside from scrapping the debt of the National Health Service, nothing was directly [provided to] nurses. [The government] gave pay raises to doctors, police, armed forces, and teachers, but not nurses. We were so disappointed with that,” said Filipino nurse Rodnie Oro in a Whatsapp conversation with Rappler. However, Oro said it was the British community that filled in the gaps of support they looked for in government. Restaurants gave free food, businesses gave discounts, and ride-hailing service Uber provided free rides for frontliners. Groups also gathered donations to provide PPE sets to nursing homes and small hospitals. “That was great motivation for us frontliners to get up in the morning [and help] our patients fight the virus, even though we know we are at risk as well,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/grab-resumes-services-cebu-august-2020/","title":"Grab resumes services in Cebu after 5 months offline","date":"Aug 3, 2020 7:27 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab will waive their cut of drivers' earnings for the first two weeks of operation","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines – After 5 months off the road, Grab resumes services in Cebu City and Talisay City, the company announced on Monday, August 3.  “As Cebu City reopens its economy, Grab is one with the city in protecting the lives and livelihoods of the Cebuanos,” Grab said in a press statement.

So how do you manage change during a crisis? First, it’s important to acknowledge whatever emotions you have during this time. Being called to change could make you feel anxious. You might feel ambivalent, going back and forth between wanting to be in your safe place and needing to make the necessary adjustments. The whole thing can make you feel awkward, as you force yourself to try new things. Worse, in all these, you might be feeling alone. You’re not! Whatever you might be feeling, the best place to begin is to own up to your emotions. Only then can you create a plan of action. Here are 3 steps to help you manage change well through this crisis. Amid a crisis, when you are on survival mode, is having a personal purpose still relevant?  On the contrary, this is the season when having a clear sense of purpose will be most important to you. This is the time when the value of your purpose is put to the test. If it’s genuinely essential and lasting, then a crisis would not be enough a reason to throw your purpose out the window. Rather, it will serve as your motivation for you to soldier on.  Take this opportune time to find clarity. What are you living for? What are you working toward? When your answers become clear to you, you will have better reasons to forge on aside from simply surviving. Having a sense of purpose will give you that extra kick in your step when you start your day.  Think of your strengths. Think even of your failures and triumphs. Think of those valuable life lessons that others can learn from you. Think of your design. You were God’s idea: you were not put in this world simply to exist.  With a clear purpose, no setback will cause you to despair. Its importance is something you’ll keep in your heart, and you will find ways to fulfill it. Even if you feel like there’s no avenue to achieve it now, this might be a time to work or prepare for it.  Even the Apostle Paul had to go into the tent-making business to support his goal of sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Purposefully living will give sense to even the seemingly smallest task. Actually, no task will be small as long as you see it contributing to a bigger purpose, and you will find meaning in everything you invest time on.  Once clarified to yourself what your purpose is – what is important to you, and what your goals are – then communicate it to other people. Remember that it may not always translate to pesos.  For example, if your purpose is to support a child or a sibling’s education, you will need to ensure that, but that is not the sole means to your end. The quality and quantity of the moments spent also contribute to that goal, and so make sure you put in the time. Purpose then becomes the filter through which you decide how to use and invest your time. Remember that you may not be profitable at the moment; however, this should not discourage you. You still have a purpose, and being purposeful is key.  If we know our purpose, we can seek not only to survive but even thrive in this quarantine.  Once your purpose and goals are clear to you, you will find that while being productive is valuable, being proactive too has great value. It’s time invested in things that may not have immediate returns, but the eventual payout will be great in fulfilling your goal. Try out new things that get you closer to that destination. What does that look like?  If you are in between jobs, some proactive actions might be: well, first of all, reviewing your purpose; then reacquainting yourself about your strengths, skills, and passions; and, investing in upskilling yourself in relation to your field of interest. There’s also pursuing further studies, casting a net on the opportunities available to you, updating your CV and LinkedIn profile, and expanding and revisiting your network.  On the other hand, if you run a business that is affected by this crisis, being proactive means taking time to plan how to capture opportunities so that your business will continue to thrive. Michael Wade and Heidi Bjerkan identified 3 ways businesses can respond proactively to challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic:  An example of Wade’s strategy #1 is how the corporate learning and development industry found itself maximizing online channels to continue delivering training workshops and executive coaching to client companies. The fashion industry’s pivot to producing personal protective equipment when this was needed the most is an example of strategy number 2.  Another example, Angkas – with 95% of its motorcycle ride-hailing business affected by the requirement for social distancing during this pandemic – pivoted its services to deliveries for the sake of its bikers. Whether seeking work or finding ways to make your business profitable, proactively thinking will make you assign values to your various efforts and lead you to prioritize some activities over others. To chart your next steps in managing change, apply this feasibility vs. impact grid.  What activities are doable for you, given your resources, that will impact your purpose and goals? These are what you need to prioritize as they are highly feasible and will yield the most impact.  Perhaps if you need clients, being visible online can be a good investment. Your products and services will be known to others through digital media. What about getting an MBA at this time? While this might be of high impact for you, if you do not have the resources for it now, it might be a low feasibility action. Do your research to see when this is doable.  Activities that are feasible but have little impact on your goals should be set aside, while efforts that have little impact and are hardly feasible anyway should be disregarded altogether. How much of your time should be given to which activities? This crisis cone helps you figure that out. Change is not entirely bad. Change can bring you from the old to the new: from depressed to determined, from sidelined to significant, from barely surviving to thriving. You just need to remember that you were made for a purpose, and having compassion for others while surveying the resources and opportunities you have in your hands, embrace the new trails you might be called to blaze. – Rappler.com Boris is the president and CEO of Breakthrough Leadership Management Consultancy, Inc., founder of the Project Purpose Team, Inc., a corporate educator under the Duke CE Global Educators Network (UK) and a registered Investors in People (UK) specialist.  A management and marketing professional, Boris was involved in various industries both local and international for more than two decades.

In a video posted on Facebook on Thursday, July 16, Cu announced that he will leave the firm to pursue other entrepreneurial interests and to make more time for his family. Cu will step down on August 14. “I decided to pursue other business interests and focus on my family, sa aking mga anak na lumalaki na (my children who are growing up). It’s with a heavy heart that I have to tell you all that I decided to leave Grab,” Cu said. Grab managing director for operations Russel Cohen said transport head Ronald Roda will continue to lead Philippine operations, while lawyer Nicka Hosaka remains as spokesperson. “We send our heartfelt thanks to Brian for managing the Grab Philippines business for the past few years, where he’s grown the business from a fledgling startup to where it is today,” Cohen said. It is still unknown whether Grab will appoint a new country president. Cu gave assurances to Grab drivers and merchants that the current leadership will continue to assist them. “Susuportahan po namin kayo sa inyong mga kabuhayan at tuloy-tuloy ang aming pag-coordinate sa inyo para mag-grow kayo with the Grab platform,” he said. (We will continue to support your livelihood and coordinate with you to help with your growth within the Grab platform.) Grab entered the Philippine market in 2013 as GrabTaxi – the first foreign destination for the Singapore-based start-up. Under Cu’s watch, Grab Philippines expanded to 9 key cities around the country after its Metro Manila launch. The firm also became the dominant ride-hailing company in the country, after Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations.  Before Grab, Cu had co-founded Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek and fashion e-retailer Zalora Philippines. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/266448-barriers-motorcycle-back-riders-unsafe-useless-netizens-reaction/","title":"Barriers for motorcycle back riders ‘unsafe’ and ‘useless,’ say netizens","date":"Jul 13, 2020 7:32 PM PHT","snippet":"The barriers required by the national government’s lockdown implementers raise serious concerns for their safety and effectiveness in containing the coronavirus","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The national government’s task force against the coronavirus has finally approved the request of motorcylists to be able to travel with pillion riders, although for limited types of passengers.

(READ: Robredo: ‘Complacent’ at the start, PH playing catch-up in COVID-19 fight) Education takes a hit in pandemic. Among the sectors most visibly affected by the coronavirus pandemic was education. Many schools and universities canceled classes altogether, while some resorted to online means to continue discussions or impose class requirements. Mass promotion became one of the most urgent discussions online, as students debated which steps would be best to take. Some clamored for mass promotion, following Ateneo de Manila University’s immediate action to end classes early and give its students passing (P) marks, in a bid to ensure the safety and welfare of the students. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>If mass promotion means giving a fairly passing grade after the semester then yes, they all deserve it because sino ba namang estudyante ang makakapagfocus sa studies in the middle of a pandemic?

University of the Philippines (UP) experts had earlier recommended the suspension of classes until December to contain the spread of the virus. This drew mixed reactions from Filipinos. On the one hand, some favored the suspension as it would put first the safety of students and teachers. On the other hand, netizens raised the concern about teachers not receiving ample pay during lockdown. Some students also believed that suspending classes until December was “a little over the top.” Later in May, the Department of Education (DepEd) announced that the school year 2020-2021 would open in August, a decision that was also met with criticism by students and parents. Many argued that forcing the opening of classes as early as August could be at the expense of the students’ welfare. Meanwhile, a public school teacher shared that her students would still struggle should they opt for an online classroom setup.      Duterte later on rejected DepEd’s move to start classes in August, and insisted that there should be a vaccine first. MAY 2020 The month of May saw some of the biggest controversies not only concerning the pandemic, but also the Duterte administration – Philippine press freedom suffering one of its biggest blows in recent history, and Congress railroading the passage of the “draconian” anti-terror bill. No to ABS-CBN shutdown. The closure of media giant ABS-CBN on May 5 was undoubtedly one of the biggest issues that would mar the history of Duterte’s administration – the last time it was forced to shut down was during the reign of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Enraged netizens slammed the decision to shut down the network at a most inopportune time, when people are relying on news outfits for information on the ongoing pandemic. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>How the Philippines is handling a pandemic?

As if terminologies weren’t already confusing enough, the government went on to baffle Filipinos with its last-minute announcements on whether the lockdown would extend yet again, and whether it would be enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), or general community quarantine (GCQ), or their more relaxed counterparts. On May 12, a few days before ECQ in select areas was set to end on May 15, Filipinos aired their dismay after Duterte left them guessing, providing no updates on the government’s next steps – if there were any at all. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”tl” dir=”ltr”>So huhuulaan nalang namin kung anong mangyayari after May 15?

Birthday bash. Mañanita became a favorite buzzword in May, thanks to Metro Manila top cop, Major General Debold Sinas. Despite the ban on mass gatherings under lockdown, dozens of police officers attended the birthday celebration of their chief. Photos of the celebration captured how the attendees violated a number of quarantine protocols, among them physical distancing and the liquor ban. Sinas’ manañita immediately drew criticism on social media as he initially denied that a party took place. Many called out the administration’s double standards in implementing laws and policies during the pandemic.  “Law is law,” a phrase commonly used by staunch Duterte supporters to defend the closure of ABS-CBN, trended on Twitter as netizens questioned why the administration was being easy on Sinas.

The Philippines is approaching its fourth month under quarantine, but COVID-19 cases still continue to rise unabated. Many Filipinos from various sectors continue to suffer the consequences of having inadequate policies in place – locally stranded individuals feel they were abandoned by the government, some of the returning overseas Filipino workers remain stuck in quarantine, some workers have yet to receive aid, and access to education has only gotten worse for poverty-stricken households. Most of these problems have long been existing, but are now even more pronounced as the pandemic exposes the gaps one by one. On top of that, basic human rights have been put on the back burner as the President prioritizes hurling threats against the media, the marginalized, and the very people he is tasked to serve.  In the last two years of Duterte’s term, the question is no longer what’s in store for Filipinos, but what’s left for them. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/264709-indonesia-gojek-job-cuts/","title":"Indonesia’s GoJek latest app to cut jobs as virus takes toll","date":"Jun 24, 2020 3:46 PM PHT","snippet":"GoJek says it will cut 430 posts – or about 9% of its full-time staff – as it cancels massage, house cleaning, and GoFood Festivals, which supplies vending space for food sellers","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesian app giant GoJek said it will cut hundreds of jobs and ditch at-home massage and cleaning services as the global pandemic slashes demand for face-to-face businesses, after Singapore-based rival Grab also announced layoffs. Starting as a ride-hailing service in 2010, GoJek launched an app 5 years later with a wide range of offerings, including deliveries, takeaway food and financial services, that could be ordered via smartphone. The company attracted investments from tech giants including Google, Facebook and Tencent. But on Tuesday, June 23, it said it would cut 430 posts – or about 9% of its full-time staff – as it cancels massage, house cleaning and GoFood Festivals, which supplies vending space for food sellers. “These businesses are dependent on close human interaction, and have seen a significant downturn over the past few months as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected consumer habits,” the firm said in a statement. “These will be the only COVID-19-related layoffs,” it added. However, GoJek said its logistics and grocery delivery businesses had surged since the pandemic hit. The firm – which claims some 170 million users in Indonesia and has expanded to other Southeast Asian markets – employs freelancers for many of its services, including ride-hailing drivers. It did not respond to requests for comment on how many of its freelance staff would be affected by the cuts. Last week, rival Grab announced that it would dismiss 360 employers, or about five percent of its full-time workforce. In May, US-based ridesharing giant Uber said it was slashing a quarter of its global workforce — about 3,000 employees — and trimming investment to survive the financial hit to its business from the disease crisis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/264615-china-punishes-live-stream-apps-vulgar-content/","title":"China punishes live-stream apps for ‘vulgar’ content","date":"Jun 23, 2020 5:47 PM PHT","snippet":"Ten live-streaming platforms have been reprimanded and ordered to suspend new user registrations and overhaul their feeds, the Cyberspace Administration of China says","body":" BEIJING, China – China has punished 10 live-streaming platforms for “chaotic” content including revealing clothing on female stars and “vulgar hot dances”, the cyberspace watchdog said Tuesday. The sites including Nasdaq-listed Bilibili and ByteDance-owned iXigua have been reprimanded and ordered to suspend new user registration and overhaul their feeds, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said. “Some female live-stream hosts wore revealing clothing, while some male hosts used vulgar words and actions, performed vulgar hot dances, spoofs, called names and other phenomena despite repeated prohibition,” the authority said. The CAC, which recently inspected 31 platforms, said it also found some used “pornographic” content to attract users and were suspected of organising illegal gambling, “seriously deviating from the core values of socialism”. The 10 platforms are required to “rectify” their content and add the most egregious live-streaming offenders to a cross-platform blacklist. Chinese authorities, used to controlling social and traditional media through censorship, have scrambled in recent years to maintain order in the fast-growing live-streaming sector and limit sensitive or politically undesirable content. Last year, LGBT discussion groups and search terms were removed from Bilibili as part of a larger censorship of China’s LGBT community.

In spite of all this, we recognize that we still have to become leaner as an organization in order to tackle the challenges of the post-pandemic economy,” he added. Tan explained the measure was done in line with other initiatives – such as shutting down some non-core projects and right-sizing teams – to reduce the number of jobs cut. To save more jobs, Grab also refocused its efforts on redeploying Grabbers “to meet the increased customer demand for deliveries.” (READ: Grab expands grocery delivery service GrabMart) “We were able to save many jobs through this redeployment of resources and it helped limit the scope of the reduction exercise to just under 5%,” he said.

The COVID-19 resurgence – believed to have started at the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food market in the capital – has sparked alarm as China had largely brought its outbreak under control through mass testing and lockdowns imposed earlier in the year. The new cases took the number of confirmed infections in Beijing over the past five days to 106, as authorities locked down almost 30 communities in the city and tested tens of thousands of people. “The epidemic situation in the capital is extremely severe,” Beijing city spokesman Xu Hejian warned at a press conference. The World Health Organization had already expressed concern about the cluster, pointing to Beijing’s size and connectivity. Officials in the capital have said they will test stall owners and managers at all of the city’s food markets, restaurants and government canteens. Beijing’s coronavirus testing capacity has been expanded to 90,000 a day, according to China’s official news agency Xinhua. On Tuesday, the capital’s transport commission banned taxi- and ride-hailing services from driving out of the city, Xinhua reported, in another move to try and contain the new outbreak. All indoor sports and entertainment venues in Beijing were ordered to shut on Monday, June 15, and some other cities across China warned they would quarantine those arriving from the capital. The National Health Commission also reported four new domestic infections in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and a case reported in southwestern Sichuan province was linked to the Beijing cluster. Authorities were also racing to track people from Beijing who had travelled to other parts of China, and those who visited the capital have been encouraged to get tested. Beijing spokesman Xu said: “High-risk people who have left Beijing must inform local authorities immediately.” Market inspections Authorities shut down another market on Tuesday – Tiantaohonglian in the central Xicheng district – after one employee there was diagnosed with COVID-19, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Seven residential estates surrounding that market were also locked down. In total, Beijing officials said Tuesday they have disinfected 276 agricultural markets, closed 11 markets, and disinfected more than 33,000 food and beverage businesses in a bid to stamp out the new cluster. Officials had warned Sunday, June 14, that since May 30, 200,000 people had visited the Xinfadi market — the original site of the new outbreak. More than 8,000 workers from Xinfadi have been tested and sent to centralised quarantine facilities. Until this recent outbreak, most of China’s cases in recent months were nationals returning home as the pandemic spread to other countries. China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that the virus strain found in the Beijing outbreak was a “major epidemic strain in the European countries.” While the virus was detected on chopping boards used to handle imported salmon at Xinfadi, “it does not clearly or definitely indicate it’s from imported seafood”, Wu Zunyou, the body’s chief epidemiologist, said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV. “Ever since new cases suddenly emerged in Beijing, we have tried to figure out the reasons for the outbreak since there were no COVID-19 cases found over the past two months,” Wu Zunyou said. “We came up with several possibilities, and the most likely one is that the carrier of the novel coronavirus comes from outside China or other parts of China and brought it here.” On Tuesday, another eight imported cases were reported. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/263811-saudi-arabia-sovereign-wealth-fund-shopping-spree-belies-economic-pain/","title":"Saudi wealth fund ‘shopping spree’ belies economic pain","date":"Jun 14, 2020 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Amid Saudi Arabia's worst economic crisis in decades, the seemingly contradictory state policy to splurge billions on overseas assets is raising eyebrows","body":" RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has snapped up around $8 billion worth of stakes in global giants – from Boeing to Facebook – in a spree that belies deep and unpopular austerity measures at home. The twin shocks of the novel coronavirus pandemic and a plunge in oil prices have prompted the government to triple its value-added tax (VAT), suspend a monthly allowance to civil servants, and slash spending as it seeks to tame a ballooning budget deficit. The harsh measures are straining a so-called “rentier” social contract, which for decades saw the kingdom use its oil wealth to provide citizens with generous subsidies, jobs, and a tax-free lifestyle. Amid its worst economic crisis in decades, the seemingly contradictory state policy to splurge billions on overseas assets is raising eyebrows. The kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) is emerging as one of the world’s biggest bargain hunters, dishing out billions to buy minority stakes in American and European blue chip firms. “You don’t want to waste a crisis,” PIF governor Yasir al-Rumayyan said in April, indicating the $300-billion fund was taking advantage of a virus-induced recession to snap up stakes at knockdown prices. In the 1st quarter of this year, it bought $7.7 billion holdings in a host of companies – from Boeing, Walt Disney, and Starbucks to Marriott and Citigroup. It also took stakes in energy giants including Royal Dutch Shell and Total – a move at odds with Saudi policy to steer away from oil dependence – as well as Facebook, which has triggered privacy concerns from a United States watchdog. The PIF is also backing a proposed £300-million ($372-million) takeover of football club Newcastle United, though the deal looks to be in trouble over allegations that Saudi Arabia was behind a pirate sports broadcaster. Spending ‘nest egg’ The painful austerity drive could heighten public scrutiny of such spending – especially after VAT, introduced just over two years ago, is tripled to 15% from July. “Companies are happy to see their stocks in demand and share prices buoyed,” Karen Young, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “However, it is more important to think about how Saudi citizens view their savings and collective national nest egg being spent on international equity markets at a time of a national economic crisis.” Shopkeepers in Riyadh privately wonder why the crucial investments were not instead used to prop up struggling small and medium enterprises choked by the pandemic.  The investments are also unlikely to soothe concern among young Saudis worried about finding jobs amid already high youth unemployment. In an absolute monarchy where few publicly question official decrees, columnist Khalid al-Sulaiman wrote in a pro-government newspaper that the austerity measures will have a “significant effect on society’s purchasing power.” “A football club, entertainment, mega projects. Throwing money at all this is absolutely unnecessary at a time of deep austerity,” said one Saudi government worker, who also works part-time for a ride-hailing app to supplement his income. Such is the economic anxiety that some Saudis dubbed as “insensitive” a light-hearted video by entertainment chief Turki al-Sheikh, in which he breaks a television screen out of frustration after losing a Playstation game. The central bank’s foreign reserves saw a sharp fall in March and April, with the government saying $40 billion had been transferred to the PIF to fund its stake-buying spree. The reserves, which tumbled to about $450 billion in April, a multi-year low, are expected to be further depleted to finance a growing budget deficit, analysts say. ‘Big bet’ De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has transformed the once-torpid PIF into a key investment vehicle to develop mega projects to diversify the oil-reliant economy, while also building an international portfolio of investments. In a statement, the PIF described itself as a “patient investor with a long-term horizon.” “The PIF is making big bets on a few stocks,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst and author. “Smart or not, we’ll only know when we look in the rearview mirror.” Some of those “tactical” investments in undervalued assets, including the struggling cruise operator Carnival, chime with Saudi Arabia’s goal of developing its tourism and entertainment sectors from scratch, Shihabi added. The PIF reportedly struggled in the past to attract a cruise liner to the Red Sea, where the kingdom seeks to develop a mega tourism project as well as NEOM, a $500-billion futuristic megacity. But many of the other acquisitions are “unlikely to yield a substantial return over the short run,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The Facebook investment has raised concern among US watchdogs after two former Twitter employees were charged last year with spying for Saudi Arabia. “I’m particularly concerned about the large Facebook stock buy given that we already know the Saudis had agents at Twitter to spy on Saudi dissidents,” Ben Freeman, a director at the Washington-based Center for International Policy, told AFP. “Would the company remove a disinformation campaign run by one of its stakeholders?” Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/263608-pandemic-no-match-indonesia-door-teachers/","title":"Pandemic no match for Indonesia’s door-to-door teachers","date":"Jun 12, 2020 10:45 AM PHT","snippet":"'No one's forcing me to do this – it's something inside telling me to do it,' the 57-year-old teacher Henrikus Suroto says","body":" MAGELANG, Indonesia – Teacher Henrikus Suroto vowed his students wouldn’t be cheated out of their education when the global pandemic forced schools to be closed in Indonesia’s remote Kenalan village. So he braves windy mountain roads and sheer cliff drops to visit the poor farming community in Central Java, where online classes are out of the question due to a lack of Internet service – a luxury few parents could afford anyway. Not only is Suroto risking death or serious illness from COVID-19, he is violating government orders not to hold in-person classes to prevent the spread of the disease. “No one’s forcing me to do this – it’s something inside telling me to do it,” the 57-year-old told AFP. “I feel a bit guilty about breaking (orders) to hold online classes, but the reality is that it isn’t easy here. “The only solution is to be close to students with door-to-door teaching,” he added. Suroto is one of a small number of teachers taking on dangerous terrain, bad weather, and the chance of contracting the novel coronavirus, to reach home-bound students across the world’s fourth-most populous nation, home to a quarter of billion people. Nearly 70 million children and young people have been affected by school shutdowns which started in mid-March. While the pandemic has sparked a boom in online learning, especially in wealthy nations, about one-third of Indonesia’s nearly 270 million people don’t have access to the Internet or even, in some cases, electricity. ‘Feet on the street’  Suroto and other Indonesian teachers say they wear face masks, but the threats of becoming sick or infecting students are ever-present. Avan Fathurrahman, an elementary school instructor on East Java’s Madura island, visits up to 11 students a day, an experience he wrote about in now-viral Facebook posts. He admits to being scared of getting ill. “But my fears were overcome by the call to teach,” Fathurrahman said. “I would not be comfortable staying at home knowing that my students couldn’t study properly.” Aside from government calls for online learning, educational programs are being aired on a state-owned TV channel. Education minister Nadiem Makarim – a co-founder of local ride-hailing app GoJek – has acknowledged the challenges in remote learning, however, and even expressed shock at how many rural Indonesians lacked Internet service. “We have to rely on the feet on the street – the actual teachers that mobilize themselves to teach door to door,” he said last month. The pandemic has underscored huge challenges in updating creaky infrastructure across the nearly 5,000 kilometer (3,100 mile) Southeast Asian archipelago – a key priority for president Joko Widodo. “Infrastructure-wise, Indonesia is not fully ready for online learning,” said Christina Kristiyani, an education expert at Sanata Dharma University.  “Even if it was possible to do real-time video conferencing, it costs too much in rural areas,” she added. ‘Can’t help them’  Meanwhile, many rural parents struggle to fill the gap as they juggle often low-paid jobs and child care. “I can only remind (the kids) to study because I can’t help them like a teacher can,” said Orlin Giri, a mother from East Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia’s poorest regions. “And we don’t have enough money for an Internet plan,” she added. That is a common story nationwide, said Fina, a teacher on Borneo island. “Many parents only graduated from elementary school or junior high school – or they didn’t even go to school,” she said. “Just being able to send their children to school is an extraordinary achievement.” Fina, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, opted not to visit students as she has a baby and lives in an area with a high infection rate. “But this pandemic has taught us that, while technology is good and very helpful, it so far cannot replace the presence of teachers,” she said. Call to teach   As Indonesian authorities consider reopening schools, critics warn it is too early as the nation’s virus curve has yet to flatten. (READ: How other countries are reopening schools during coronavirus pandemic) Officially, the country has more than 35,000 cases of COVID-19 and 2,000 deaths. But with one of the world’s lowest testing rates, Indonesia’s real toll is widely believed to be much higher. And the country’s paediatric association has warned that malnutrition and mosquito-borne dengue fever may be putting children at a greater risk of dying from the respiratory illness.  Nearly 18% of Indonesian children under 5 years old suffer from nutritional deficiencies, while kids aged 5 to 14 make up nearly 42% of dengue fever patients, according to health ministry data.  The risk was highlighted in April when an 11-year-old girl with dengue fever, which itself can be fatal, died after contracting COVID-19.  Health authorities said the pre-existing illness could have exacerbated the effect of the virus on her weakened immune system. Still, getting back to school can’t come fast enough for some students. “I’m bored at home. I miss the school and all my friends and teachers,” said Gratia Ratna Febriani, a pupil in Kenalan village. That feeling struck a chord with junior high school teacher Yunedi Sepdiana Sine who says she will keep answering the call to visit some 50 children a week. “Students really miss their teachers so I feel needed,” she said. “And that’s what makes me content.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/263504-just-eat-takeaway-to-buy-grubhub-food-delivery/","title":"Just Eat Takeaway to buy Grubhub, forming food delivery giant","date":"Jun 11, 2020 11:20 AM PHT","snippet":"With Just Eat Takeaway set to acquire Grubhub, they will have a major presence in 4 key markets – the United States, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands","body":" NEW YORK, USA – Anglo-Dutch meal delivery firm Just Eat Takeaway.com agreed to acquire United States company Grubhub for $7.3 billion to form the world’s largest online food delivery company outside of China, they announced on Wednesday, June 10.

The combined company will have a major presence in 4 key markets – the US, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands – and position the enterprise for greater growth in the US, they said in a news release. Grubhub has been effective in navigating the “fragmented” US market – but “the US remains an underpenetrated market” that is “nowhere near its end-state,” the companies said. “Just Eat Takeaway.com will prioritize sustainable growth over profits, as this has been a major driver of its strategy and success in Europe,” the press release said.

Saudi Arabia has announced a tripling of its value-added tax (VAT) from July and halted a monthly allowance to state employees from next month as oil prices collapse, while simultaneously going on a buying spree of overseas assets including an English football club. The shock move underscores Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s risky strategy to further erode a once generous welfare system, leaving the mostly young population to cope with a new reality of reduced incomes, fewer jobs, and a lifestyle downgrade. The changing fortunes could fuel public resentment and pile strain on a decades-old social contract whereby citizens were lavished with subsidies and tax-free handouts in exchange for loyalty to the absolute monarchy. For Abdullah, a 40-year-old father of 3, a 5% VAT introduced in 2018 and the apparent phasing out of a longstanding government policy to offer interest-free housing loans – among several subsidies whittled away in recent years – was bad enough. Struggling with a stagnating government salary, Abdullah took up part-time gigs including offering plumbing services and working for a ride-hailing app as he took out a second mortgage to build a home on the outskirts of Riyadh. Now, a threefold VAT increase – which would raise the cost of all construction items, from cement to bricks and rebar – has set him back even further. “Expensive construction material has become more costly with triple VAT,” said Abdullah, who is now uncertain whether his house will ever be built. He requested his real name be withheld for fear of government retribution. Few Saudis are likely to openly speak out amid growing nationalism and a strident crackdown on dissent. ‘Magic decade’ But many citizens are nostalgic for what Saudi expert Karen Young calls the “magic decade” between 2003 and 2014, when the kingdom accrued spectacular oil wealth that funded a generous welfare state. Scaling back the state largesse is likely to reduce consumption, with businesses predicting depressed sales of everything – from cars to cosmetics and home appliances.  “For the average Saudi household, the cost of living just got a lot higher. The spillover effects will…[hurt] private sector business growth,” said Young, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. “VAT increases household expenditure – from food to housing, water, electricity, restaurant bills, transport, education, health.” The kingdom also risks becoming less competitive compared to other Gulf states which introduced VAT at the same time but have so far refrained from raising it beyond 5%. Saudi Arabia, however, has limited options, as state finances are battered by sliding oil revenue as well as the coronavirus crisis, which has practically shut down the local economy. State oil giant Aramco – Saudi Arabia’s cash cow – posted a 25% drop in profits for the 1st quarter, and the rest of 2020 could be even bleaker. The $27-billion austerity measures will only partially rein in a yawning budget deficit, forecast to rise to a record $112 billion this year. But the government is careful not to cut public jobs and salaries amid already high youth unemployment. Nearly two-thirds of all Saudis are employed by the government, and the public sector wage bill accounts for roughly half of all government expenditure. ‘Shopping spree’ While it has cut the “cost of living” allowance for state employees, the government is preserving another monthly handout known as “Citizen’s Account,” which benefits around 12 million Saudis and costs billions of dollars annually. “Cutting subsidies as people reel from economic pain is a risky move,” said Quentin de Pimodan, from the Research Institute for European and American Studies. “To avoid a backlash, Saudi is cutting one allowance but preserving the other even though it can ill-afford either.” The pro-government Okaz newspaper said the austerity measures include an $8-billion cut to “Vision 2030,” Prince Mohammed’s ambitious blueprint to pivot the economy away from oil. But it remains unclear whether that will include his dream project, the $500-billion NEOM megacity on the kingdom’s western coast. The austerity drive has led some like Abdullah to question the government’s lavish spending on entertainment and sporting extravaganzas, part of a slow but costly economic diversification.

It will confiscate the licenses of drivers who have more than 3 passengers.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said Friday, April 17, it would go after vehicles whose passengers do not follow the rules of physical distancing and slap owners/drivers with a P5,000 fine. This covers cars carrying more than 4 persons inside – a driver and 3 passengers. MMDA Spokesperson Celine Pialago said drivers caught driving these vehicles will be fined P5,000. At the Laging Handa briefing, Pialago said that together with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, the licenses of those apprehended may be confiscated. “Kami po ay nagiinspect katuwang ang HPG, maari pong makumpiska ang inyong lisensya. Pwede po kayong matikitan ng HPG… ang MMDA naman po ay pwedeng maniket ng violation ng physical distancing, nagkakahalaga po yan ng P5,000,” Pialago said. (We will be inspecting vehicles, together with the HPG. Your licenses may be confiscated and you may be issued tickets by the HPG. The MMDA, meanwhile, can issue tickets on violation of physical distancing, that amounts to P5,000.) During the briefing, Pialago cited the Bayanihan Act and the Land Transportation Office’s mandate of administering land security as basis for the violation. “Lahat po ng lalabas [at] dadaan ng EDSA gamit ang quarantine pass, hindi po kayo papayagang makatawid,” Pialago said. (Everyone who will go out and pass through EDSA, must use your quarantine pass. We will not allow you to cross.) Asked what was MMDA’s basis for the penalty, Pialago told Rappler that it was based on the Department of Transportation guidelines – which was implemented during the community quarantine. Under DOTr guidelines, sedans (which include ride-hailing services and taxis) should not have more than 4 passengers. Pialago explained that it was “up to the barangay” how much fine it would impose, based on city ordinances. But for MMDA, she said it was P5,000 that was “cascaded by the MMDA higher-ups” during the traffic management meeting when the total lockdown started. The enhanced community quarantine in Luzon was implemented on March 17. Asked for a copy of “what was cascaded” to them, Pialago could not provide this and said she would have to “look for it.” Rappler asked what was the MMDA’s basis for the fine, and whether there was a Metro Manila Council resolution. Pialago said: “We have to act immediately. We are responding to an emergency situation. Hindi naman tayo pwede maghintay. (We cannot wait).” At the Laging Handa briefing, Pialago cited PNP spokesman Brigadier General Bernard Banac as saying that the HPG would issue tickets with a P1,000 fine for “disobedience.”  The legal basis of the penalty for “disobedience” was also unclear, as the LTO penalizes “disobeying traffic lights,” with a fine of P1,000 for first offense. LTO deputized HPG cops to confiscate drivers’ licenses. An MMDA staff told Rappler that there was no resolution by the MMC on the said penalty. The MMC, the policymaking body of the MMDA composed of the 17 Metro Manila mayors, decides on matters like imposing or raising fines for traffic offenses in the metropolis. The MMC usually comes up with a resolution like what it did for illegal parking. MMDA started strict enforcement of lockdown guidelines this week, when an unusual number of vehicles were seen along EDSA and Metro Manila roads on Monday, April 13. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said that the HPG has been authorized to issue tickets against drivers found transporting non-authorized persons. Authorized persons include medical and healthcare workers, employees of essential services, and other frontliners. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/257936-kumu-series-a-funding-globe-abscbn-summit-media/","title":"Globe, ABS-CBN, Summit Media join $5M funding round for livestreaming app Kumu","date":"Apr 14, 2020 8:45 PM PHT","snippet":"Kumu intends to scale up operations and introduce new features with the Series A funding","body":"   MANILA, Philippines – Kumu Holdings Pte.

Openspace’s first investment in a Philippine company was with e-commerce platform BeautyMNL.  Filipino investors in the round include the Gobi Core Philippine Fund; Kickstart Ventures, the corporate venture capital firm of Globe Telecom; ABS-CBN; and Foxmont Capital Partners and Summit Media, which led a funding round for Kumu worth $1.2 million  back in December 2018.  With the funding, Kumu will be scaling up its current operations. The company says that the app has at least 3 million registered users now, with almost one hour of average daily usage from a “mostly Gen Z and millennial userbase.” About 25,000 livestreams are broadcast on Kumu each day and has shown solid performance in the Philippines, Canada, US, and other countries, the company reported. About 100 of its livestreamers are said to earn at least P20,000 each month.  “We are betting on the exponential growth of the Philippines’ digital GDP while optimizing a user experience that is razor-sharp focused on Gen Z’s and millennials’ attention spans.

Violators face heavy fines and up to a year in jail for breaking the new rules, which include a ban on gatherings of more than five people, limiting restaurants to online delivery orders and reducing public transport. Motorbike taxis seen everywhere in the megacity of some 30 million were banned from picking up passengers and residents were ordered to stay home. “I’ve been checking my smartphone all day but no orders so far,” said Embari, a ride-hailing driver who goes by one name. “I know drivers can’t pick up passengers but I was hoping for some food delivery calls.” Mosques and other houses of worship were ordered to shut for at least the next two weeks – after millions continued to attend Friday prayers in the Muslim majority nation, despite calls to worship at home. President Joko Widodo declared a state of emergency last month as coronavirus deaths in the world’s 4th most populous country jumped. But he resisted calls for a nationwide lockdown fearing a collapse in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, where tens of millions eke out a living on poorly-paid, informal jobs. Indonesia’s government has faced heavy criticism over its handling of the crisis and questions about the true number of deaths. Officially, 280 people have died of the respiratory illness with 3,293 confirmed cases as of Thursday in the archipelago of more than 260 million. That is the highest death toll for an Asian nation outside China.  But testing rates are among the lowest in the world and there are fears the number of dead could be much higher. Jakarta city data showed some 776 suspected and confirmed victims had been buried in local cemeteries under COVID-19 protocols requiring bodies to be wrapped in plastic and quickly buried.  That is more than five times the official 142 dead in Jakarta, the epicenter of the outbreak in Indonesia. Officials have admitted data collection among different jurisdictions is patchy and incomplete.  “The Indonesian government needs to ramp up testing to know the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the country,” said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.  “The authorities should also uphold the right to information and provide accurate statistics to the public.” Indonesia’s spy agency has projected some 95,000 infections by June. A bleak assessment by the University of Indonesia’s public health department warned that the country could see a death toll of more than 240,000 if testing and quarantines are not ramped up. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/256402-grab-philippines-provides-e-scooter-service-coronavirus-frontliners/","title":"Grab provides free e-scooter service to frontliners","date":"Mar 30, 2020 6:05 PM PHT","snippet":"The GrabWheels service is initially available in 7 cities in Metro Manila","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines activated its electric scooter service GrabWheels, free of charge, for frontliners.

Reyes Memorial Medical Center (JRRMMC) were already part of her daily sacrifice. But with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines and the subsequent lockdown of Metro Manila and the island of Luzon, Cristy also has to contend with the daily risk of being infected. After all, having to take 6 public utility vehicles each day just to reach her destination and get back home exposes her to these risks. Cristy said she does not want to harm herself, her loved ones, and patients at the 75-year-old hospital, many of them coming from Manila’s poorest communities. As of Monday, March 16, there has been no confirmed case in their hospital just two minutes away from the Department of Health (DOH) headquarters.   But self-quarantine – usually lasting 14 days – is almost out of the question, given the already thin workforce and the vague assurances of assistance from no less than the DOH. There’s little comfort, aggravated by the measly salaries of government nurses that range from P19,000 to P25,000, depending on salary grade. “Walang malinaw na alituntunin regarding sa leave credits kung ma-quarantine kami,” she said. “Walang sinasabi kung ito po ba ay ibabawas sa current numbers namin o hindi. Paano kung mag-positive kami?“ (There are no clear guidelines regarding our leave credits if we go on self-quarantine. They don’t tell us if it’s going to be deducted from our current number or not, What if we get the virus?) At JRRMMC, where there are 485 doctors and 366 nurses, hospital staff have also been asked to improvise with their protective gears. Cristy said they were told to transform cloth like linen into face masks, even if there has been no evidence of it being a sufficient protection against the virus. Still, it’s better than wearing nothing while dealing with patients every day.  “Kami na ang hahanap ng paraan kasi iyong government, hanggang salita ang ginagawa nila, hindi sila gumagawa ng action para bigyan kami ng sinasabi nilang sapat na supply,” Cristy said. (We are the ones looking for ways to address the problem because the government, they’re all talk, they don’t do anything to give us enough supply.) “Paano kung magkasakit kami, paano iyong pamilya namin, makakasigurado ba kami na mapapakain sila ng tatlong beses sa isang araw?” she said. “Hindi naman makatarungan ito.“ (What if we get sick? How about our families? Are there assurances from the government that they will be fed 3 times a day? This is not fair.) Cristy, unfortunately, is not alone in her predicament; nor is her experience unique. Health workers on the frontlines across the Philippines are put in a perilous situation where compromise and sacrifice are the name of the game, for the benefit of the public they serve.   Philippine General Hospital   A little over 5 kilometers away from JRRMMC is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the country’s largest government health facilities, where long lines at the outpatient department or the crowded emergency room and wards are a common sight. PGH, after all, is where many of the country’s indigents flock to, braving long commutes from their provinces to get much needed medical assistance. On average, the PGH outpatient department sees around 3,000 patients a day. On an annual basis, the hospital services at least 600,000 to 800,000 patients. On Tuesday morning, March 17, nurse Marie (not her real name) finished her 12-hour overnight duty and stepped out into a city where mass transportation is prohibited, in accordance with the enhanced community quarantine that President Rodrigo Duterte declared the day before. It had been a long night for Marie, who handles patients under investigation (PUIs) for novel coronavirus at PGH. She is one of the only 3 nurses per 12-hour shift in her group that receives patients referred to by the ER staff.  As of posting, PGH has had one confirmed case, 8 admitted PUIs, and had already sent home 34 PUIs showing mild symptoms. That night, Marie handled a patient who tested negative.  She just wanted to go home and prepare until her next shift in two days. Yet the jeepneys and buses that normally traverse Taft Avenue and contribute to the usual traffic were nowhere to be seen.  Marie tried hailing cabs, as ride-sharing applications didn’t work, but not one wanted to give her a ride home out of fear of being apprehended by authorities. Philippine National Police Chief General Archie Gamboa had ordered the arrest of “disobedient” drivers. Local government units were given the responsibility of setting up transportation for health workers in their jurisdiction. But during the first 7 hours of the lockdown, no help was in sight, at least at PGH. Fortunately, before giving up hope and starting what could be a two-hour walk, a tricycle driver took pity and offered his services. But he could only take Marie until Welcome Rotonda, the border between Quezon City and Manila. She held her breath throughout the 5.9-kilometer ride inside the clanky metal sidecar, through roads not normally meant for tricycles, away from the eyes of law enforcers. “Hindi lang life ko ang at risk, pati ang buhay niya kasi sobrang delikado iyong ginawa namin, pero ang hirap na kasi, baka gusto rin kasi niya kumita (We placed both our lives at risk because it was very dangerous, but it’s so hard, and maybe he wanted income),” she said. Getting home should have been the least concern for Marie, or any of the health workers. But the latest pronouncements of the national government that caused confusion among many Filipinos have been an added burden to the frontliners. “Nagpapatupad sila ng protocols na walang proper guidelines (They implemented protocols without proper guidelines), we’re left and living in the dark,” she said. “We don’t know how we’ll get to work, how we’ll get home, and how we’ll be safe in between.”   Only line of defense  If the serious lack of proper guidelines wasn’t enough, public hospitals also have to face and deal with long-standing issues that should have been better handled by the national government.  The problems – from lack of basic medical supplies to understaffed health facilities – become all the more glaring and hard to ignore amid the novel coronavirus outbreak that is threatening the nation. Marie recalled how during the first few days of the outbreak, fear was palpable among health workers in PGH buildings that had previously seen the horrors of World War II. There was a general lack of information on the novel coronavirus that had already affected thousands in several countries, especially China.  “After the news na sa floor namin na-admit yung isang PUI, it was scary,” she said. “We have general information about it pero iyong kung gaano katagal nag-stay sa air, parang sobrang limited ang information kasi bago pa iyong virus.” (After the news that the first PUI was admitted in our floor, it was scary because we didn’t know how it was transmitted. We have general information about it but information on how it stays in the air, things like that, were so limited because the virus was still new.) Aside from the vague protocols, especially on how to handle patients suffering from the virus, personal protective equipment (PPEs) were running low. Their supplies had been almost depleted in the aftermath of the Taal eruption. In the beginning, they were given two face masks to be used for one week. Staff were eventually provided one box good for a week – at least 52 pieces to be shared by 3 nurses, two assistants, and one utility worker. “Protection-wise, hirap na hirap na kami kasi (we’re having a really hard time),” she said. “We’re worried that we’ll get sick or we might bring home this virus.” “We already are worrying about taking care of patients, tapos madadagdagan pa ng burden na hindi namin alam kung ang families ba namin ay safe at kung makakauwi ba kami sa kanila (Then there’s the added burden of making sure our families are safe and worrying if we’ll get home safe to them),” Marie added. With PPEs running low, it’s still vague for many health workers at PGH how they’ll go on in the coming days, as the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus is expected to rise.  “It’s very frustrating kasi walang guidelines, walang help from the government na nare-receive right now (no guidelines, no help from the government),” Marie said.  Mark (not his real name), a resident doctor at PGH who asked not to be named, said masks and alcohol are their “only line of defense at the moment.” “We are grateful for those who have donated, but there still remains a shortage of the said materials,” he said, adding that full gowns and headgears are reserved for workers directly supervising people suspected of carrying the virus.  Some organizations have taken it upon themselves to address the problem government health workers are facing.  The student council of the University of the Philippines Manila, the institution that operates PGH, started a donation drive for health masks and other basic hospital needs. (READ: How to help healthcare workers, frontliners during coronavirus pandemic)   Not enough manpower Beyond the lack of basic supplies, one glaring characteristic of the country’s healthcare system is the lack of manpower.  There are about 721 public hospitals, with at least 3,131 doctors and 5,975 nurses. Many of them are underpaid, compared to their counterparts abroad, with an entry-level nurse earning P15,000. The current roster pegs the ratio of government doctors to population at 1:33,909 – far from the ideal 1:20,000 – and 1:17,769 for nurses. “Some of our colleagues have fallen ill and are warranted to go on a 14-day quarantine, thinning out our workforce,” Mark said, adding that this has pushed residents to their limit. On a normal day, there are about 10 nurses assigned at the PGH ER while the number of doctors varies, depending on the day’s load.  The management suspended its outpatient services to deploy some workers to other wards. It has also welcomed over 100 interns who volunteered, despite an earlier suspension of internship programs. The mass transportation may lead to more problems, however. In fact, two of Marie’s colleagues were barred from crossing the QC-Manila border even if they showed their IDs. They were just told by authorities to walk the distance to PGH – a near-impossible task as much as it was ridiculous, especially under the heat of the sun. In the end, they were left with no choice but to go home, possibly missing a day’s wage. Helping themselves In Quezon City, health department head Dr Esperanza Arias said that hospitals are augmenting their staff by pulling in personnel from other departments. They are filling in the slots left by those assigned to an isolated area where patients suspected of having the coronavirus are being held. The city was also able to procure several PPEs before the threats of the virus increased in the metro.  “Sabi namin, kumuha na kami kasi (We said we should already get because) if we will not be able to use them now, we will still find use for it, in case,” she said. Local governments outside Luzon are also preparing for a possible increase in confirmed cases.  Beyond Metro Manila Dr Leonell Quitos is no stranger to the issues faced by government hospitals, having just completed his fellowship in Adult Infectious Diseases at PGH in 2019.  The 33-year-old is now on the frontlines as the only infectious diseases specialist in Iligan City in Northern Mindanao, doing his best – along with at least 300 doctors – to protect a population of at least 342,618 people against the coronavirus. “Iyong problems noon, nakikita ko pa rin ngayon (The problems I saw then, I still see today),” he said.  As the city is placed under a state of calamity over its first confirmed case, Quitos and his colleagues are working double time to manage the situation, including a plan to set up a hospital solely for suspect cases. On top of doing rounds, Quitos has been reaching out to officials to see their plans through.  He takes calls from colleagues and even the occasional media while driving to meetings – one of the few moments he’s free.  “Sama-sama natin tapusin itong problema (Let’s work together to end this problem), they will be properly compensated,” he added, urging doctors and workers to join them. Megan (not her real name), a health practitioner also in Iligan City meanwhile, said doctors are trying to raise funds to be able to buy them in bulk for distribution to all health workers. “The implication is the fear, especially if you don’t have masks or alcohol, some doctors are thinking of not holding clinic hours anymore, including those who are not working directly with departments against the virus but are still exposed nonetheless,” she said.   Too many lives at stake There is much to be desired in the way the Philippine health system is handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, and the ball is in the court of the national government.  On Twitter, PGH consultant neurosurgeon Dr Ronnie Baticulon acknowledged that many health workers are afraid of what could possibly happen in the near future because they’ve seen this health care system let them down before.  “Too much, too many lives are at stake,” he wrote.  Marie of PGH will go on shift Thursday. To avoid more problems, she already asked help from her barangay, requesting a shuttle service to her hospital. But not all have the same cooperative and helpful local officials. To address this, PGH started a carpool system. Dormitories have already been prepared for some health workers, though Marie admits that it will most likely not benefit all those in need.  But she said PGH is now handling the situation better than before, even without direct help from the national government. For Cristy of JRRMMC, however, the following days don’t show reason for optimism.  “Ina-accommodate namin pa rin ang mga taong pumupunta sa ospital as much as possible, kahit kami mismo hirap na hirap na rin, kasi pasyente iyan eh na dapat bigyan ng treatment na nararapat sa kanila,” she said.  “Pero gustuhin man namin na ibigay ang lahat, hindi namin kayang kumilos na 100% kasi hindi sapat ang pangangailangan ng mga ospital.” (We accommodate those who go to the hospital as much as possible, even if we’re having difficulty, because those are patients who need treatment. But even if we want to give them our all, we can’t do so 100% because hospital supplies are inadequate.) Clearly they need help. – Rappler.com TOP PHOTO: ISOLATION.

Duterte also announced the raising of alert levels to the maximum Code Red-Sublevel 2, which signifies the presence of sustained community transmission that is beyond the capacity of government to trace. Before the announcement, Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said a lockdown would mean that people will be confined in one area and will not be allowed by authorities to leave. Metro Manila mayors had their own apprehensions about imposing such a lockdown. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier expressed a preference for localized lockdowns instead of a lockdown of the metropolis. This would mean that only areas with recorded localized transmission would be placed under lockdown. But the lockdown announced by Duterte covered all 16 cities and one municipality of Metro Manila, as recommended by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the coronavirus outbreak. Under the IATF’s resolution, land, domestic air, and domestic sea travel to and from Metro Manila will be suspended. Community quarantine will also be imposed in the entire metropolis. Further, classes in all levels and government work are suspended until April 12. Widescale lockdowns were imposed by China and Italy as a measure to contain the outbreak. Compared to the Philippines’ 52 confirmed coronavirus cases, China had over 80,000 cases and Italy over 10,000 cases, respectively. Pending the President’s executive order and more defined guidelines from concerned government agencies, what else could happen in Metro Manila under the lockdown? How is it being done in other countries? Movement would be severely restricted. Being the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, the city of Wuhan in China has been under lockdown since January 23. Residents were told not to leave the city. Planes and trains were banned from exiting the area and road tollways out of the city were closed. While departures were prohibited, trains and planes were allowed entry into Wuhan. Soon after, Huanggang also suspended public transport and train services and prohibited residents from exiting the city. Other cities, including Ezhou, Xiantao, and Chibi, also restricted mobility. Ezhou closed its train station, Xiantao closed highways, and Chibi suspended public transport, respectively. By January 28, over 56 million people in the province of Hubei were placed under lockdown as public transport was effectively halted. Beijing and Shanghai, among other megacities, suspended the entry and departure of long-distance bus services. Over 400 inter-province train services were canceled for weeks. In Italy, people were not allowed to travel except for “serious reasons” like urgent work or family matters that cannot be postponed. On the same day that the Metro Manila lockdown was announced, the city government of Davao also prohibited residents from exiting the city. Further, all short-term visitors were advised to leave the city immediately. The IATF’s resolution allowed mass public transport systems, including the Light Rail Transit and Metro Rail Transit lines and the Philippine National Railways, to continue operations, provided that social distancing will be implemented by the Department of Transportation (DOTr). Meanwhile, highways leading out of the metropolis could be blocked due to the ban on land travel. Provincial buses may also be prohibited from taking passengers from Metro Manila. The DOTr is expected to define the guidelines of this provision. A similar situation took place during the threat of the Taal Volcano eruption, wherein several towns in Batangas were put under lockdown. The military cordoned off roads that led to these towns, prohibiting residents from going back to their homes. Large public events would be prohibited. In some areas in China, group tours and large public events for the Lunar New Year holiday in January were also canceled. Outside the epicenter, Beijing canceled mass gatherings as well. In Italy, all forms of gathering in public places were prohibited on a national scale. All organized public events, including cultural, recreational, religious, and sports activities, were suspended. (READ: Serie A, all sport in Italy halted because of coronavirus crisis) Indoor events that are open to the public, such as those conducted in cinemas, theaters, pubs, dance schools, game rooms, etc, were also prohibited in Italy. Civil and religious ceremonies, including funerals, were also suspended. Some regions in the Philippines had already enacted similar measures prior to the announcement of Metro Manila’s lockdown. A few local government units outside the National Capital Region had taken steps to prohibit crowd-drawing activities across their locales. As early as February 13, for example, eco-tourism activities in the municipality of Sagada were suspended. The suspension was partially lifted on February 21, except for spelunking and sunrise viewing activities. But on March 11, tourism-related activities and events with 50 or more participants were suspended anew, covering festivals, family reunions, concerts, sports events, etc. Meanwhile, Baguio canceled the 2020 Panagbenga Flower Festival and the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association Games. The IATF resolution also banned mass gatherings in Metro Manila. Since the coronavirus outbreak continued during the Lenten Season, banning mass events in Metro Manila could also mean that Holy Week practices such as pilgrimages, processions, etc, may be canceled. Commercial establishments and public institutions would be closed. In China’s Huanggang, cinemas, internet cafes, and the central market in Huanggang were closed. Schools and universities were also closed. In Italy, establishments may open and/or commercial may activities continue if management or organizers take steps to ensure that their visitors stay at least one meter away from one another. This applied to restaurants, bars, and religious spaces. If this provision is violated, the structure will be closed or the activity will be suspended. Entry to places of worship in Italy was conditional depending on organizational measures to avoid large gatherings, considering the dimensions and characteristics of the structure. Classes in all levels are also suspended. Meanwhile, public and private employers were asked to promote employees’ leave periods. Duterte already previously suspended classes in Metro Manila from March 10 to March 14. (READ: How Metro schools continue lessons amid coronavirus threat) Sagada implemented less restrictive measures, only discouraging advance bookings in inns and other homestay establishments. Walk-in guests were advised to visit the Rural Health Unit for monitoring and must remain indoors during their stay in Sagada. Graduation ceremonies were supposed to last for less than 5 hours, and attendees of these ceremonies were required to submit themselves for monitoring at the local health unit. In the province of Quezon, Cagbalete Island and other tourist sites have also been closed to domestic and foreign tourists. In the IATF resolution, manufacture, retail, and service establishments were advised to continue operations provided that they adhere to social distancing. “Flexible work arrangements” were also encouraged. Buying groceries could be more difficult. In February, new restrictions in Wuhan included barring residents from leaving their neighborhoods. These residents had to depend on online group-buying services to acquire food. In some neighborhoods, supermarkets deliver orders in bulk through the group-buying services. In other districts, supermarkets were prohibited from selling to individuals, which forced neighborhoods to either buy in bulk or not at all. However, some cities in China also suspended online taxi services. In Metro Manila, a similar lockdown would mean that ride-hailing apps and food delivery services may be suspended. Carpooling service Grabshare is suspended is the metro and in Cebu starting noon of March 13. Due to fears of a lockdown, Metro Manila residents have resorted to panic buying. Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto, for one, called on his constituents to stay calm and be considerate of those who may be affected by lack of supplies. –  Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/253761-video-daily-struggle-metro-manila-commute/","title":"WATCH: Daily struggle of every ‘mandirigma’ commuter in Metro Manila","date":"Mar 8, 2020 4:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Rappler reporter Aika Rey documents her commute as the end of motorcycle taxi pilot run draws near","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In every commute, there’s this running joke that goes,“Papasok kang empleyado, lalabas kang mandirigma.” (You enter as an employee, you come out as a warrior) It’s no secret that Metro Manila commuters have to endure the terrible state of public transportation on a daily basis. It has grown worse as the years go by that people have been looking for alternatives. When sedan ride-hailing firms entered the Philippine market in 2014, the demand was high to the point that some commuters were actually reliant on it just to have a little dignity in commuting. Half a decade has passed since Uber was first launched in the Philippines. There will always be a hint of nostalgia thinking about the days when Uber and Grab competed for consumer-friendly prices. Enter Angkas. The pioneer motorcycle taxi firm seemed to be a “savior” for many commuters, as the two-wheel vehicle can easily zip through traffic and save time on the road. But it’s not legal. Amendments to the law has to be done to legalize its operations, along with new entrants JoyRide and MoveIt.

But a look at the construction worker’s home in a rundown neighborhood quickly convinced officials that Prayitno was the latest victim of tax evasion by one of Jakarta’s wealthy elite. Rampant tax dodging costs Indonesia billions of dollars in lost revenue annually and it has taken on a renewed urgency as Jakarta moves to pass a raft of bills aimed at revving up Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and adding millions of poor to the middle class. “I was shocked and asked them ‘what car’?” Prayitno told AFP about his visit from tax officials. “How could I afford a car when you see me living in a house like this?” Prayitno – whose top pay is about 150,000 rupiah ($10) a day – later learned he’d been duped by a former boss who took his government ID card ostensibly for a legitimate purpose. But instead, the employer registered his luxury car in Prayitno’s name to dodge taxes. About 350 Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other top-end cars in Indonesia’s capital – punctuated by a yawning divide between rich and poor – are improperly listed in the name of low-income people like Prayitno, the tax agency said. Cars, not bricks  But it’s just a fraction of the tax evasion problem. In December, the CEO of state-owned airline Garuda Indonesia was sacked after allegedly smuggling a Harley-Davidson motorbike and expensive bicycles into the country on a commercial plane. He was accused of using a subordinate’s name on import papers to avoid detection – and taxes. Days later, Indonesia’s customs office said it had foiled a separate plot to smuggle dozens of luxury cars and motorbikes in mislabelled shipping containers to dodge more than $3 million in levies.  “We’re going to crack down on this illegal activity,” finance minister Sri Mulyani said at the time. “The contents of the shipping containers were listed as bricks but we found cars instead.” Last year, the Global Financial Integrity Report (GFI) estimated Indonesia lost some $6.5 billion in tax revenue in 2016 due to mislabelling on goods flowing in and out of the country. The corruption-riddled Southeast Asian archipelago of more than 260 million is also one of the world’s worst for illegal movements of funds across international borders, according to GFI. Indonesia has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios regionally and the World Bank in January called for better tax collection efforts. The call comes as parliament debates a raft of new legislation that would cut corporate taxes while making big internet firms pay more levies, part of a broader effort to cut red tape and loosen rigid labor laws to spur investment. But raising domestic tax revenue is also key as President Joko Widodo kicks off a second term with plans for more costly infrastructure spending, including a planned move of the capital to Borneo island from congested Jakarta.  ‘Manipulated‘  In 2016, Jakarta offered an amnesty for tax evaders who would declare their hidden assets at home and abroad, which raked in levies totalling nearly $10 billion. But that was just a fraction of assets thought to be stashed away. Registering a car, a company or other property in the names of low-income people and subordinates is a common scheme used by wealthy Indonesians to avoid paying tax, experts said. “Authorities should look at the beneficial owners not the people who are used to register that wealth,” said Fair Tax Forum researcher Nurkholis Hidayat. “It’s been a problem for a long time but if the government manages to crack down on it that could help boost tax-collection efforts.” Recently, Jakarta tax officers started slapping a “tax not paid” sticker on offside cars in rich parts of the city. But it is cold comfort for victims like Prayitno. The construction worker wants to become a ride-hailing driver for steadier work, but banks refused him a loan after the Rolls-Royce affair. “I’ve been rejected 3 times because of the tax problem. But they’ve all seen my home and know that I was manipulated,” he said. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/252361-new-york-ordered-pay-debt-hit-taxi-drivers/","title":"New York City ordered to pay debt-hit taxi drivers $810 million","date":"Feb 21, 2020 3:04 PM PHT","snippet":"New York's taxi industry has been upended by the arrival of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft","body":" NEW YORK, USA – New York City must pay $810 million to its debt-ridden cabbies, the state attorney general said Thursday, February 20, accusing the city of fraudulently inflating the value of permits needed to drive its famed yellow taxis. Letitia James, head prosecutor for the state of New York, said an investigation by her office showed that the auction price of thousands of permits, known as medallions, had been artificially inflated by hundreds of millions of dollars between 2004 and 2017. The attorney general’s office alleged that the Taxi and Limousine Commission knew in 2011 that the price of medallions had passed actual value. Yet the administrative body “published false and misleading medallion prices” in a number of cases, James’ office said, causing the price of a single medallion at auction to spike from $283,300 in 2004 to $965,000 in 2014. The city allowed brokers and top players to collude on prices, the prosecutor said, as the TLC encouraged drivers to use the medallions as collateral for loans. The state’s prosecutor said medallion prices were fraudulently set so high that drivers could not pay them off with their earnings from cab operation regulated by the city itself. “These taxi medallions were marketed as a pathway to the American Dream, but instead became a trapdoor of despair for medallion owners harmed by the TLCs unlawful practices,” James said in a statement. “The very government that was supposed to ensure fair practices in the marketplace engaged in a scheme that defrauded hundreds of medallion owners, leaving many with no choice but to work day and night to pay off their overpriced medallions.” New York’s taxi industry has been upended by the arrival of ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft. More than 950 licensed taxi drivers have declared personal bankruptcy since 2016, according to a New York Times investigation of court records published last year. Recent years have also seen a spate of suicides from cab drivers suffering under crushing debt. The sum of $810 million corresponds to the city’s revenues from medallion sales and resale tax, according to the attorney general, and must be paid within 30 days or James’ office intends to sue, it said. Contacted by AFP, New York City Hall did not immediately respond. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-china-creeping-influence-philippine-telco-electricity-water/","title":"[ANALYSIS] China’s creeping influence in PH telco, electricity, water","date":"Feb 20, 2020 11:30 AM PHT","snippet":"China’s creeping influence and encroachment in our vital infrastructure shows we ought to be extra careful especially where the nation’s security is at stake","body":"Lawmakers are busy passing a bill that would make it a lot easier for foreigners to invest in public services like telco and transportation. If House Bill 78 eventually becomes law, it will mean that only a handful of sectors (namely, electricity transmission and distribution, as well as water pipeline and sewerage distribution systems) will be deemed “public utilities” subject to the Constitution’s 60-40 ownership rule. All the rest will be open to foreign investments, and can only be considered public utilities upon the recommendation of two economic agencies, and if Congress passes separate laws to that effect. Lots of people, including economists, support House Bill 78. By defining exactly what “public utility” means, they hope amendments to the 84-year-old Public Service Act will promote economic competition and bring down costs. Opponents fear, however, that opening the floodgates to foreign investments could jeopardize our national security. There are good arguments on both sides. But here I want to point out that one country in particular – China – has already taken hold of key segments of our utilities, specifically telco, electricity, and water. This, despite the supposedly stringent foreign ownership restrictions in our Constitution. In short, China is encroaching not just on our territories and resources in the West Philippine Sea, but also on our vital infrastructure. This should give some pause for thought among lawmakers moving to liberalize our public services and utilities any further. Let’s start with Dito Telecommunity, which was selected by government in 2018 as the third telco player to break the incumbent duopoly of PLDT-Smart and Globe. Competition in telco is very much welcome. We can all attest that signal and data speeds can often be spotty, and customer service downright crappy. But I noted before that the bidding for the third telco wasn’t really a bidding at all. Competitors dropped out mysteriously in the run-up to bidding day. In the end, the only firm that came forward was Mislatel, later rebranded as Dito Telecommunity. (READ: Disturbing red flags in the 3rd telco selection) The key fact about Dito Telecommunity is that it’s a consortium between Udenna Corporation (owned by Davao-based tycoon Dennis Uy) and Chinatel, the largest fixed-line provider and the third-largest mobile telco provider in China. Crucially, Chinatel is a company owned by the Chinese government. Through this firm, China owns 40% of Dito Telecommunity. Chinatel’s involvement in Dito Telecommunity is unsettling for a number of reasons. First, Chinese law mandates that state-owned companies like Chinatel submit intelligence to the Chinese government. One study found that Chinatel had misdirected large amounts of internet traffic from the US to China, allegedly for surveillance purposes. Second, Dito Telecommunity signed a deal last year with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) allowing the firm to “build facilities in military camps and installations,” ostensibly to help beef up the AFP’s ICT infra. Military experts themselves admitted in an internal report this deal could lead to interception, eavesdropping, and jamming – but ended up saying the overall risk was “low.” Independent cybersecurity experts say the deal is far more dangerous than the military cares to admit. Dito Telecommunity also wants to erect similar structures in police camps, but this plan hasn’t come into fruition yet. Less known but equally disturbing is the fact that another state-owned Chinese firm managed to gain substantial power in our electricity market, particularly in its transmission segment. Transmission towers – those rows of steel towers crisscrossing expressways and delivering power from the mountains to towns and cities – are massively expensive. It makes economic sense for just one firm to provide them, and that so-called “natural monopoly” is called the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Disturbingly, NGCP is a consortium involving the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) – yet another firm owned by the Chinese government. Akin to Dito Telecommunity, 40% of NGCP is owned by China (via SGCC). How did that happen? NGCP secured a 50-year franchise from Congress back in 2008, during the term of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo – a known China ally. Last year CNN obtained an internal report warning our lawmakers that Chinese engineers maintain tremendous control over “key elements” of NGCP’s transmission grid system. Ominously, the report said “power could in theory be deactivated remotely on Beijing’s orders.” China’s outsized role in the transmission sector has long been a source of worry, even for the previous administration. The recent leaked report tells us the security risks aren’t going away. In fact, they may be compounding. It should be “cause for concern,” said retired justice Antonio Carpio. Finally, under the Duterte administration, China also tapped into a third vital sector: water. But here China entered using a loan agreement, unlike in telco and electricity. Despite the current lovefest between Manila and Beijing, only two loan agreements have been signed so far between the two: one for the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, another for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Kaliwa Dam is notable because government is touting it as a much-needed solution to the growing water problems of Metro Manila. I wrote before that the bidding for Kaliwa Dam bore many red flags. Metro Manila’s water regulator bid out the project exclusively to Chinese contractors, and ended up selecting China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC) – again, a firm owned by the Chinese government. (READ: Kaliwa Dam: Is China’s involvement cause for concern?) The notoriously austere Commission on Audit (COA) itself reported that the bidding for Kaliwa Dam was likely rigged. According to them, “the two bidders/contractors were included merely to comply with the at least 3 bidders requirement as stated under the procurement law.” Far from being competitive, the bidding was “a negotiated contract from the inception of the bidding process.” CEEC also failed to submit required documents on time, and COA said this might invalidate the loan agreement for Kaliwa Dam, which amounts to P11.05 billion from China Eximbank. Although famous for its majestic Three Gorges Dam, China also has a spotted track record in building dams especially in poor countries. China is also known to leverage on such projects politically in what’s known as “hydro-diplomacy.” Don’t get me wrong. Opening up some sectors of our economy to foreign investments is not necessarily bad. It may even work wonders. For instance, Indonesia’s Go-Jek sought to break the current monopoly status of Grab in the ride-hailing business. But our government denied entry to Go-Jek because it’s a foreign-owned company. Initial opposition to Angkas, a well-loved motorcycle-hailing service, was also grounded on foreign ownership issues. Yet China’s creeping influence and encroachment in our vital infrastructure shows we ought to be extra careful about greater openness – especially where the nation’s security is at stake.

From Luang Prabang in northern Laos to Pattaya in Thailand, Hoi An in Vietnam and the Cambodian casino town of Sihanoukville, takings have plummeted as Chinese travelers find themselves subject to a host of restrictions at home and abroad. “We haven’t had any Chinese for 10 days since they closed the road from Yunnan,” says Ong Tau, 47, from behind her stall of fruit shakes in the temple-studded Laotian colonial town of Luang Prabang. “Business is down 20 to 30%…. It will get worse.” Tour guides, mall workers, and restaurant staff are all feeling the burn as Chinese – the world’s biggest travelers – stay at home in the middle of a global health crisis. “My friend has lost 4 or 5 big tour groups…. They would have paid for his low season,” said Tee, a guide in Luang Prabang, giving only one name in the tightly-controlled communist country, a mass of tuk-tuks standing idle behind him. But in one of Southeast Asia’s least well-resourced countries, there may be one bright side to the sudden economic pain. “We don’t know how to protect ourselves,” he added. “The government doesn’t tell people anything…so maybe less Chinese is a good thing for now.” Loans and job losses The slump is being felt sharply in Thailand, where tourism authorities say arrivals from China – usually close to one million a month – have plunged by 90% so far this February. At the Chang Siam Elephant Park in Pattaya, a few hours south of Bangkok, owner Nantakorn Phatnamrob fears he will soon be pressed into debt to float a business which has lost nearly $65,000 since the outbreak. “People are afraid to visit,” he told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “If it stays like this, I will have to get a loan from the bank.” Crocodile farms and tiger sanctuaries – controversial tourist beacons where visitors can pet the animals – are also deserted, leaving owners to feed expensive star attractions. The outbreak has also spooked western tourists at the height of peak season in what has already been a tough period for Thai tourism thanks to a strong baht. Thailand anticipates shedding 5 million tourists this year, taking with them “250 billion baht (over $8 billion) in revenue,” according to Don Nakornthab, director of economic policy at Bank of Thailand. “Our hopes that the economy will do better than last year are very low…. It’s possible it could grow below 2%,” he added. That will spell bad news for the untold number of Thais working in the tourism sector. Ma Mya, 22, who sells trinkets in Pattaya, says she may soon have to return to her home in northern Thailand. “There’s no more profit – everything has gone bad.” Things can only get better With so much riding on the seasonal influx, some Mekong countries are desperate not to deter those Chinese still traveling. Thailand offers visa on arrival for Chinese tourists despite having one of the highest numbers of confirmed infections – 34 – outside of the mainland. At least two of those cases were Thais who contracted the virus after driving infected Chinese passengers, raising fears that the economy was taking priority over tackling the health crisis. For staunch Beijing ally Cambodia, where only one case of the virus has been confirmed so far despite a large Chinese presence, strongman leader Hun Sen has repeatedly played down the risk to his country. Still, Cambodian tourism is taking a hammering. Ticket sales at the famed Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap have fallen between 30% and 40% this year, while in Sihanoukville, a southern beach resort notorious for its casinos, the tourist take has shriveled. “I used to make $100 a day,” said Chantha Reak, a ride-hailing driver. “Now it’s $10.” Businesses are praying for a bounce back if and when the virus is controlled. With 10 million Chinese visitors each year, Thailand hopes the pain will ease in a few months. Regular visitor Yen Ran, 25, from Chengdu, came to Pattaya despite the health warnings. “I am a little concerned how other countries perceive us,” she told AFP. “But when there’s a cure, things will get better.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/251903-china-cleans-locks-away-banknotes-stop-virus-spread/","title":"China cleans, locks away banknotes to stop virus spread","date":"Feb 15, 2020 2:43 PM PHT","snippet":"China's central bank says banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills, then seal and store the cash for 7 to 14 days before recirculating them","body":" BEIJING, China – China is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, officials said Saturday, February 15. Banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills, then seal and store the cash for 7 to 14 days – depending on the severity of the outbreak in a particular region – before recirculating them, China’s central bank said at a press conference. The virus, which has infected more than 66,000 people in China and spread to more than two dozen other countries, has sparked a rush to disinfect public places and minimise contact between people. Pharmacies across the country sold out of disinfectants and surgical masks in just days after a lockdown was announced in late January on Wuhan city, where the COVID-19 illness is believed to have emerged. Office buildings have installed packets of tissue in elevators that tenants are encouraged to use when pressing buttons, while ride-hailing company Didi exhorts drivers to disinfect their cars daily. Emergency issuance Fan Yifei, deputy governor of China’s central bank, said Saturday that banks have been urged to provide new banknotes to customers whenever possible.  The central bank made an “emergency issuance” of 4 billion yuan in new notes to Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, prior to the recent Lunar New Year holiday, Fan added. The measures are intended to “secure the public’s safety and health when using cash,” Fan said. But it is unclear how wide an impact the central bank’s disinfection work will have, with increasing numbers of Chinese people preferring mobile payments over cash in recent years. In 2017, nearly three-quarters of Chinese respondents told an Ipsos survey they could survive a whole month without using more than 100 yuan in cash. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 can be spread through contaminated objects in addition to droplets and direct contact with infected patients. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/251718-senators-sign-report-legalizing-motorcycle-taxis/","title":"16 senators sign report legalizing motorcycle taxis","date":"Feb 13, 2020 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"The measure seeks to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to recognize motorcycle taxis as public utility vehicles","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Senate bill pushing for the inclusion of motorcycle taxis among public utility vehicles will soon be tackled at the chamber’s plenary. On Thursday, February 12, Senator Grace Poe filed Committee Report 46 with substitution bill Senate Bill 1341, seeking to amend Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to recognize motorcycle taxis as PUVs. Committee Report 46 hurdled the Senate public services committee, which Poe heads, and the committee on Local Government, which Senator Francis Tolentino chairs. Apart from Poe and Tolentino, 14 other senators signed the report: SB 1341 defined motorcycle taxis as “any two-wheeled motor vehicle which is registered with the Land Transportation Office which transports passengers and goods on a for-hire basis, and which may utilize online ride-hailing or pre-arranged transportation platforms.” Under the measure, motorcycle taxis have a prescribed weight of below 1,000 kilograms, and must be able to travel faster than 50 kilometers per hour. They must have a minimum engine displacement of 125 cubic centimeters. The substitute bill consolidated the measures filed by Recto (SB 50), Poe (SB 128), Marcos (409), Revilla (SB 1262), and Senator Sonny Angara and Senator Joel Villanueva (1025). In the previous years, motorcycle taxi operations faced a government crackdown as the 50-year-old Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) But since June last year, motorcycle taxi operations had been temporarily allowed by the Department of Transportation through a 6-month pilot run, which was later extended for 3 months or until March this year. (READ: The long road to legalizing motorcycle taxis) The technical working group on the motorcycle taxi pilot-run said that the pilot implementation will no longer be extended after March. That meant that there would no longer be motorcycle taxi operations until Congress moves to approve the measure, and have the President sign it. Apart from pioneer motorcycle taxi firm Angkas, JoyRide and MoveIt joined the extended pilot run.

I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.'","body":"  I never really felt that being Chinese-Filipino was any different from being a pure-blooded Filipino. I call the Philippines my motherland; I respect, more than any other, the Philippine flag; I memorize both the Panatang Makabayan and national anthem by heart; I speak Filipino as well as any other fellow Juan; I love eating sinigang and lechon; and I have always embraced our polluted, traffic-choked, sweltering Metro Manila streets as home. But recently, I found this notion crumbling whenever I would see fellow Filipinos, whom I have always considered family, treating each and every Chinese national (including those originally from the Philippines) with disgust and prejudice because of the sudden mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV). Indeed, the virus originated from the city of Wuhan in China, but China being ground zero for the virus has resulted in numerous adverse effects for all of its citizens, the most rampant of which is (extreme) xenophobia. In the past few weeks, unfortunate stories of Chinese individuals all over the world, including the Philippines, have constantly been making rounds on different social media platforms. I see and hear of Chinese nationals being shunned and treated with utter disgust for being who they are. All individuals who “look” Chinese are ostracized and stayed away from. Many are also refused basic services such as cab rides and the use of certain facilities such as public comfort rooms and elevators. Once an individual is classified as Chinese, no matter what their citizenship, he or she is automatically denied these rights. (READ: [OPINION] Like us, the Chinese are victims of the virus and a despotic government) Selected schools and offices have also issued a notice for mandatory self-quarantine that singles out only Chinese individuals. Recently, Adamson University was mired in controversy because of this issue. Many more stories like these abound, both locally and internationally. I have never seen the Chinese be more sorry just for being Chinese. I have also never felt more ashamed for having a Chinese family name.  As a Chinese living in the city of Manila, which serves as a home to many Chinese locals in the country and houses renowned hospitals (e.g. San Lazaro Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital – which both reported and confirmed cases of the coronavirus), discrimination, however disheartening, was to be expected.  Recently, I noticed how some Filipinos have become more wary of me. For example, when staff at food establishments ask for my name and I tell them my family name, they always seem to give a certain look or make an awkward pause. Similarly, the other day, when I went to the grocery store with my mother and she spoke in Chinese, I noticed how the people around us looked our way, when in the past it didn’t matter. So I just put my head down and hurriedly spoke in Filipino to show them that I was from the Philippines – that I’m Filipino, like all of them, and free from the virus.   Through this whole ordeal I have constantly felt that Filipinos have this ridiculous and untrue notion that Chinese families such as mine all feast on exotic mammals at home, like how they perceive those in mainland China, and that we could thus carry the virus and infect them. Instead of doing proper research on the topic to curtail its spread and help the masses be aware and alert of the virus, some Filipinos choose to blow things out of proportion and throw their own baseless opinions here and there.  I see posts on Facebook claiming that being infected by the virus equates to automatic death, when in fact Chinese public officials have stated time and again that although the virus has a high contamination rate, its mortality rate, on the other hand, is very low. In fact, most of those affected make a full recovery and the others who died didn’t not because of the virus per se, but because of old age or other ailments that compromised their immune system. Public health experts also noted that panic over the virus outside of China is “unproductive and unwarranted,” asserting that there are reasons for hope during the coronavirus outbreak. (READ: WHO launches campaign against China virus misinformation) First, the virus was identified and determined more quickly than ever before. Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with laboratories around the world only a week after it was discovered. Second, advancements in medical technology since the discovery of coronaviruses in the 1960s have allowed clinical laboratories and virologists to conduct thorough research into the way these viruses work.  Fear will not stop the spread of the virus and will only lead to negative social impacts. Instead, the public should take precautions to avoid getting sick, with the most effective preventative measure being everyday actions such as increased handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who is sick.   In the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, along with keeping up with news regarding any development with the epidemic, I find myself re-evaluating what it means to be a Chinese-Filipino in the Philippines. Having lived in the Philippines the entire 17 years of my existence, I have never considered being able to function normally, in its most basic sense, as a privilege. Walking the streets peacefully, hailing a Grab ride, ordering food in my name, speaking in Chinese to my family in public places – all of these were mundane tasks that were simply part of my daily life, and which I considered basic rights.  But the masses’ reaction to the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak made me realize that there lingers a divide between Chinese-Filipinos and pure-blooded Filipinos despite having shared one home country for hundreds of years. It dawned on me that my view of Filipinos as a family might have only been one-sided, and that the notion is not shared by everyone.  Experts claim that a cure for the coronavirus is in rapid development. It is my hope that we may also soon see an improvement in cultural acceptance wherein all individuals, no matter what race or nationality, are treated with empathy and respect (and not ostracization) even and especially during times of crisis. – Rappler.com Col Tiu is a Chinese-Filipino grade 12 senior high school student and a proud Manilenya."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/249772-senators-slam-twg-ending-motorcyle-taxi-pilot-run/","title":"‘Paghihiganti?’ Senators slam TWG for ending motorcycle taxi pilot run","date":"Jan 20, 2020 7:56 PM PHT","snippet":"The Senate committee on public services finds no compelling reason why the TWG had to terminate the motorcycle taxi pilot run","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Senate committee on public services questioned the motive of the inter-agency technical working group (TWG) after it decided to terminate the motorcycle taxi pilot run without consulting stakeholders, reading it as retaliation. In its recommendation to terminate the pilot run, the TWG said that some actions by motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas and its bikers served as “obstacles” to the study, including the rally against the new cap and the petitions for a Temporary Restraining Order against the guidelines. The extension of the pilot run forced Angkas to slash up to 17,000 of its bikers. TWG head Antonio Gardiola Jr said the subsequent Temporary Restraining Orders issued against the pilot run guidelines made it hard for them to gather data, prompting them to terminate the pilot run entirely. But during the hearing on Monday, January 20, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto said the cap on the motorcycle taxis seemed arbitrary and lacked public consultation. He also found that the tone of the recommendation was laced with anger. “Kaya kayo na-TTRO ng korte. yun ang dahilan. Tapos ngayon na na-TRO kayo, galit naman ang pinapakita ninyo. [Maliwanag] sa dokumentong ito eh, puro galit din eh. Dahil nagrally laban sa inyo galit na ka agad kayo,” Recto said. (That’s why the courts issue TROs against you. And now that they issued the TRO against you, you’re showing anger. It is so clear in this document that you are angry. Just because they rallied against you, you’re lashing out.) Senator Sherwin Gatchalian agreed with the sentiment, saying the failure of the TWG to conduct its data-gathering activities should not be blamed on legal impediments. “Paghihiganti ho ‘tong ginawa niyo eh. Wala ho kasing basehan ‘to lahat eh (This is retaliation. This does not have any basis),” Gatchalian said. After the hearing, committee chair Senator Grace Poe expressed the same thoughts. “Alam mo ang nangyayari dito? Gantihan. Kasi naiinis sila dahil nagrarally ang ibang kompanya, naiinis sila dahil nagfifile ng kaso sa kanila, kaya nila ginawa ito… Sobrang nakakadismaya na ganyan magpatakbo ang mga ibang miyembro ng gobyerno, kung ano lang ang gusto nila, hindi dahil sa kung ano ang tama,” she said. (You know what is happening here? Retaliation. They are annoyed because of the rallies and the petitions, that’s why they did this… It’s very disappointing that some government officials act this way, that they do what they want regardless of what is right.) She added that the TWG’s capacity to lead the motorcycle taxi pilot run should also be questioned. The TWG will be convening within the week to discuss the committee’s push for reconsideration. Poe urged the public to file cases against the TWG if they push through with the termination. As of posting, the TWG said it is considering the sentiments of the Senate panel and the resource persons, and will further discuss them on Wednesday, January 22. A report will then be submitted to Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade. Meanwhile, on Friday, January 24, the TWG will meet with stakeholders, resource persons, and the 3 motorcycle taxi providers to “iron out the specifics”. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/249709-road-legitimizing-motorcycle-taxis/","title":"The long road to legalizing motorcycle taxis in the Philippines","date":"Jan 20, 2020 1:01 PM PHT","snippet":"At least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seek to amend the 55-year-old Land Transportation and Traffic Code","body":"AT A GLANCE {source}<hr />{/source} MANILA, Philippines – Every day after work, Jenlain Impat, 26, finds herself rushing to go home to take care of her one-year-old baby. The fare is cheap. It would only take a total of P25 for her to travel from her office in Urdaneta Village in Makati City to her home in San Juan City – but that’s the case only if she’s willing to spend more than an hour stuck in EDSA and another 30-minute jeepney ride to their house. She’s not. “Alam mo [ang] traffic sa Makati, hindi uubra ang normal commute. Sayang oras mo,” Impat told Rappler. (You how the traffic is in Makati. Your normal commute won’t do. Your time is wasted.) As a new mom, Impat started using the pioneer motorcycle taxi app Angkas to book trips, even if that meant a higher fare. By booking a motorcycle taxi, her commute time is now down to 30 minutes. “Before kasi umuuwi ako ng San Juan or Antipolo, super traffic ‘pag rush hour. And being a mom, gusto ko mabilis makauwi sa baby ko for quality time, kahit ‘yung pamasahe is P25, if naka-Angkas ako, P150 to P170 depende sa surge,” Impat said. (Before, whenever I go home to San Juan or Antipolo, traffic is heavy during rush hour. And being a mom, I want to get home immediately to spend quality time with my baby, even if that increases fare from just P25 to, if I would choose Angkas, around P150 to P170, depending on the surge rate.) Ana Lubiano, 25, is another regular user of motorcycle taxis. She found it as a cheaper option than other ride-hailing services such as Grab. “Kaya talaga ako gumagamit ng Angkas is to beat traffic, lalo na ‘pag nakikita ko na malala na ‘yung traffic. Mase-save ka talaga ‘nya para hindi ka ma-late, kasi nga motor. So p’wedeng sumingit-singit, hindi katulad if naka-4 wheels, ka stuck ka na – stress ka pa talaga – sa traffic,” Lubiano said. (The reason why I’m using apps like Angkas is to beat traffic, especially when I see that traffic congestion is bad. It will really save you so that you won’t be late because you’re using a motorcycle. Motorcycles can cut in between vehicles, unlike 4-wheeled cars that can get you stuck – and stressed – in traffic.) Whenever she finds it hard to book a ride on Angkas, which is usually the case now since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) imposed a 10,000-rider cap per firm, Lubiano would “book” habal-habal on Facebook. “‘Pag mahirap mag-book and walang available na Angkas within the area, no choice na kundi ‘yung sa FB group or mga Habal sa daan,” Lubiano said. (When it’s hard to book and there’s no available Angkas within the area, I don’t have a choice but book on Facebook or hail one on the streets.) Mobility as service The prospects of a “dignified commute” in Metro Manila seem bleak in the short term, as the population growth rate continues to accelerate to a point that is beyond the current public transportation’s capacity. According to a report by Bloomberg, driving a kilometer in Metro Manila has worsened in 2019. In September 2019, data from navigation app Waze showed that it took an average of 5 minutes per kilometer to travel around Metro Manila, longer than the April record of 3.8 minutes per kilometer. The population outlook for Metro Manila is not seen to decrease in the coming years either, as a United Nation report in 2018 showed that the metropolis is projected to have an annual increase of 1.9% in the next decade. Because of heavier traffic in cities, “mobility as a service” has been on the rise to provide an alternative mode of transportation that is faster than current options, according to a 2017 report by United Kingdom-based financial consultancy firm Deloitte. “Mobility as a service” is a model taken on by ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber, and the new motorcycle taxi firms JoyRide and MoveIt, along with Angkas. While more Filipino commuters shift to motorcycle taxis as their preferred mode of transportation because of its ability to “beat traffic,” the motorcycle-hailing industry may hit a dead-end, pending the passage of a law that would allow its permanent operations. The long and winding road to legalization As early as 2017, the government led the crackdown on motorcycle-hailing services of Angkas because it is illegal. (READ: Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition)   But even then, underground habal-habal operations were already widespread, it’s just that Angkas was able to train the bikers to drive more safely. Romeo Maglunsod, who used to be a habal-habal driver before joining Angkas, said this in one of the public consultation hearings at the LTFRB in 2017. The point is to regulate instead of turning a blind eye, Maglunsod said. Under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was enacted 55 years ago, motorcycles can only be registered as private or government vehicles. Therefore, it can’t be used by its owners to carry passengers and be paid for it. In the 17th Congress, bills amending the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was tackled by the House of Representatives and the Senate. House lawmakers passed their version of the bill in February 2019, but it remained pending under the Senate committee on public services, which Senator Grace Poe headed. In one of the Senate hearings in 2019, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to just issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate, just like what it did with Grab and Uber (when the latter was still here). Arguing that legislation is the way to go, the DOTr started the 6-month pilot run, which was extended by 3 months to March 23, 2020. The point of this pilot implementation is to “collect” data that may be used by lawmakers when crafting the bill. However, on Monday, January 20, the inter-agency technical working group overseeing the test run terminated it – more than two months earlier than end of the extension period. The announcement was made just as Senate committee on public services was about to start its hearing on the matter. Proposals In the 18th Congress, there are at least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seeking to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. All of these carry more or less the same language: {source} <blockquote style=”border-left: 5px solid #FFD700;“> Section 7. Registration Classification. Every motor vehicle shall be registered under one of the following prescribed classifications: (a) XXX (b) XXX (c) XXX … (j) XXX and (k) motorcycles-for-hire. </blockquote> {/source} At the Senate, Poe, Recto, and senators Juan Edgardo Angara and Imee Marcos have filed separate proposals to legalize motorcycle taxis. Poe and Recto propose that motorcycles-for-hire must be less than 1,000 kilograms in weight, can travel more than 50 kilometers per hour, and has an engine capacity of 125 cubic centimeters. In the proposals of Poe, Angara, and Marcos, government regulators would be mandated to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycle taxis before registration. No modification shall be made apart from the luggage carrier at the back, a saddlebag, a foot peg, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring devices. In Poe’s bill, there is a section on fare setting, specifically saying that LTFRB should “determine, prescribe, approve, and periodically review and adjust” reasonable fares for the operation of motorcycle taxi services. Meanwhile, Marcos, in her proposal, “urges” local government units (LGUs) to issue guidelines for the operations of motorcycle taxis in their jurisdictions. She also proposed that the Land Transportation Office require insurance for passengers and cargo. Similar measures have been filed by Muntilupa Representative Ruffy Biazon, Batangas 6th District Representative Vilma Santos-Recto, Quezon City 2nd District Representative Pecious Castelo, and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas. Meanwhile, majority of the bills in the House of Representatives include the proposal for motorcycles-for-hire to only be allowed “for a limited period, with limited number of units and in specific routes only,” which should be determined by the DOTr and the LTFRB, in coordination with LGUs. At least 11 congressmen argue that the transportation department should give priority to higher-capacity vehicles or mass transit sytems. This specific measures have been separately filed by Makati City Representative Romulo Peña Jr, Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Barba, Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, South Cotabato 2nd District Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, Bohol 1st District Representative Edgar Chatto, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Luis Villafuerte, Cebu City 1st District Representative Raul del Mar, the late LPGMA Representative Rodolfo Albano III, and Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio Albano, and Quezon City 6th District Representative Tyrone Agabas. Instead of adding another classification specific to motorcycles-for-hire, Makati City 2nd District Representative Luis Campos’ bill proposes to amend Section 7 (c) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to allow the registration of motorcycles “either as private or public utility vehicle.” ‘It’s needed’ As traffic congestion worsens, Impat and Lubiano said it’s even more important for lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow commuters like them to have options to beat traffic, save their time, and use it somewhere else. “[Motorcycle taxis like] Angkas helps commuters to beat the traffic, especially in Metro Manila. I can say, they can be considered as part of the solution,” Lubiano told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. “Regulations lang din [kailangan] kasi sa super traffic ngayon. Heaven-sent ‘yung may option ka na mas mapabilis ‘yung travel time mo, given na ‘pag rush hour talagang almost two hours ang b’yahe na ‘pag sa Angkas 30 minutes mo lang makukuha,” Impat said. (Authorities only need to regulate them. Because of the heavy traffic nowadays, it’s heaven-sent to have an option that would make your travel faster, especially during rush hour when you would have to spent almost two hours, but which an Angkas ride can shorten to 30 minutes.) Public Works Secretary Mark Villar says some road projects will be done by 2020, removing private car volume along main roads. But in terms of public commute, majority of big-ticket railway projects are set to be in partial operations only by the end of the Duterte administration or in 2022. However, if commuters are to escape horrors of current state of public transportation between now and 2022, lawmakers will need to make motorcyle taxis stay on the streets – legally. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/249553-regulating-motorcycle-taxis-ensuring-competition/","title":"[OPINION] Regulating motorcycle taxis and ensuring competition (Part 1)","date":"Jan 18, 2020 2:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The online platform industry – which is easy to enter, is relatively inexpensive, and is clearly innovative – is simply for now, difficult to regulate","body":" In our view, there is enough ambiguity in the law that allows for a provisional framework in regulating motorcycle taxis. A similar approach was used in dealing with Uber and Grab when they began operating in the Philippines. Even without a law, the LTFRB established a system to regulate Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and Transportation Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) that continues to be the regulatory framework for that type of service today. The emergence of motorcycle taxis in the past few years has created a lot of debate. Replete with controversies, the motorcycle taxi business has battled car owners and drivers, law enforcers, and regulators.  Some argue that it is  prohibited  by law as Republic Act No. 4136  or the Land and Traffic Code specifically excludes two-wheeled motor vehicles as allowable public transportation; others believe it has become the most viable option for segments of the riding public seeking out a good, reliable, and (relatively) inexpensive transport system.  It is of course urgent for Congress to enact a law on motorcycle taxis. We have had enough experience to come up with good regulations. Although there are currently 9 pending bills in Congress as of this writing, in the meantime, the government must regulate pending legislation.  Regulation absent legislation As a middle ground for pending legalization of motorcycle taxis, a pilot run was allowed (but limited geographically to Metro Manila and Metro Cebu and extended through March 23, 2020) by the Inter-agency Technical Working Group (TWG) created to monitor the current stream of motorcycle taxi operations. The TWG’s tasks are to set regulatory guidelines to ensure safety and security, ensure compliance of data sharing, general monitoring and evaluation, price regulation, setting of vehicle specifications and operational requirements, and to provide a final report to the DOTr and the House of Representatives, to aid the latter in its future and potential legislative actions. The same TWG, moreover, has now allowed two new players, JoyRide and Move It, to join the current industry player, Angkas.  The regulatory guidelines released last December 19, 2019, is the working document which the pilot run for motorcycle taxis is based on.  This document, however, does not contain the ride-capping mechanism imposed by the LTFRB. Section 11 of the document included operational requirements imposed upon the ride-hailing platforms.  It included that (1) all bookings shall only be made within and via the app platform; (2) accident insurance should be secured on par with or above Passenger Personal Accident Insurance Program (PPAIP) rates; (3) a comprehensive safety campaign should be conducted for the public so that all passengers become knowledgeable; (4) existing motorcycle units with OR/CR as of December1,  2019 shall be allowed to be included in the pilot implementation; and (5) “one motorcycle-one rider” must strictly be observed in the implementation. Participating Riders shall be registered to one ride hailing platform only.  The last statement is deemed problematic.   Competition vis-à-vis regulation  The new and current players are capped at 39,000 registered bikers – or a limit of about 10,000 bikers per transport network company (TNC) in Metro Manila and 3,000 in Metro Cebu.  Angkas strongly opposed this cap as their registration is at the 27,000-mark as of late December 2019.  Thus, to impose the price cap means 17,000 of its riders can lose their means of livelihood.  As a remedy, it has asked the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court to issue a temporary restraining order against the policy. This was granted as the court had said that the policy “puts a cap on the number of bikers that Angkas is entitled to” and enjoined the respondents “from performing any act that limits and impairs their rights to deal with and continue with their contracts with Angkas.” This TRO was only valid for 72 hours. In a similar fashion, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has, through one of its commissioners, stated that “forcing Angkas to displace 17,000 riders will take away what was rightfully obtained by the company” and appealed to the LTFRB to consider other solutions such as to allow riders to use more than one ride-hailing app.    It is in this very precept that the entry cap imposed shows that the LTFRB regulation is anti-competitive. The regulator’s perspective in this regard,looks to defend its policy of preventing Angkas from becoming monopolistic in nature. However, anti-competitive conduct does not rely solely on how big or how dominant a particular business/company has become; but rather also looks at the interplay of other factors surrounding the circumstances of the industry.  Competition authorities all over the world have allowed individual riders/drivers multiple registration in the different ride-hailing platforms (driver/operator non-exclusivity clause) as a solution for competition rather than to restrict. A fundamental concept of competition, after all, is not to restrict entry but to open the market as freely as possible to allow small and big players alike to participate in the market.   It can be conceded that anti-competitive conduct may be affected when unfair individual fare pricing affects the industry as a whole. As an illustration, surge pricing has been disallowed and specifically included in the regulatory guidelines of the LTFRB. This also makes fare prices fixed a justified regulatory intervention.  Likewise, it is also not a displaced fear that Angkas might take control because of its first-mover advantage and more commercially popular reputation in the motorcycle taxi market, which can greatly affect consumer welfare in the long term.  Look at how Grab has emerged in the TNC market.    Moreover, the ongoing debate on the seemingly overlapping competition and regulatory issue does not end today.  In fact, in many parts of the world, the ride-hailing platforms and similar digital platforms which disrupt different sectors (not limited to transportation alone), are being declared illegal due to industry concerns of “virtual monopoly,” tax arbitrage, surge pricing violations, and labor issues. Some of these issues are not even anti-competitive conduct per se but can be considered more as regulatory setbacks.  We stop at this rider cap issue for now but there lies the bigger problem we might face in the next few years. The online platform industry – which is easy to enter, is relatively inexpensive, and is clearly innovative – is simply for now, difficult to regulate.  Joseph Schumpeter is right to think of “creative destruction.”  That is precisely what ride hailing platforms has become in the transport industry.  Now transportation has to battle the bigger issue of safety and mobility.

I spent 10 days outside of the country, saw many beautiful sights, and brought back lots of delicacies for pasalubong. It was a great trip overall. One of the things I noticed during my trip was how efficient their mass transportation system was – they were able to make it cost-efficient enough to the point that they could offer discounted fares or even free bus rides, in addition to having transit systems that work 24/7! Their ride-hailing systems were also efficient and convenient for consumers; in these countries, people didn’t have to worry about going back home extremely late. To be honest, I admire – no, I envy – their mass transport systems. Despite the fact that they also have rush hours and their load of day-to-day traffic, millions of locals and tourists from all over the world are still able to move from one place to another without having to worry about whether the train line will buck, or worse, burst into flames.  While it’s also true that both countries have their share of skeletons in their closets, I’m pretty sure that they excel way better than the Philippines when it comes to transportation. We Filipinos have to endure colorum buses, outdated light rail systems, the sluggishness of our politicians to create and innovate – there are a lot of things that need to be fixed. (READ: FAST FACTS: State of Metro Manila’s transportation system)  So when I saw the question “How will the end of the motorcycle taxi pilot run affect you as a commuter?” on Rappler’s social media accounts, the issue also felt close to my heart. After all, between all these problems, motorcycles taxis are among the few things that have worked as far as the atrocious conditions of Metro Manila are concerned. I live 2.5 kilometres away from where I work, at the very far end of Annapolis Street in San Juan. Most of the time, when I’m able to wake up early, I have the option to walk for 10 minutes and then ride a jeepney at Club Filipino to EDSA. I know I’m way luckier than those of us who have to endure 3, even 4 hours of exhaustion and frustration commuting to work. However, there are times when my body feels like it just went on a 10-month long pilgrimage, so I prefer using Angkas motorcycle taxis to keep from being late for work. It’s relatively easy to book, it’s cheap, and it can negotiate the notorious traffic that Metro Manila is known for while being impeccably safe and well-equipped. When the LTFRB’s Technical Working Group issued a crackdown on Angkas, it came as no surprise that there was a lot of public outrage regarding the matter. If the LTFRB claims in its mandate to “regulate land-based public transportation, and to safeguard the welfare and interests of the commuting public,” then why can’t it use its discretion to further allow these ride-hailing solutions? More importantly, the Technical Working Group acted on the matter secretly – they did not publicize the results of the trial period and they excluded major players such as the MMDA and Congress from the said group.  When one goes deep into the heart of the matter, one fact remains clear: even if the regulatory board actually wanted to allow these motorcycle taxi companies and cooperatives to operate continuously (and legally), our outdated transportation laws simply don’t allow for it to happen. As such, the main solution for this burgeoning transportation issue is for Congress to amend the law and legally allow new forms of transportation to operate in the country, which includes motorcycle taxi services such as Angkas, among others. On top of that, the government should intensify its ongoing efforts to open new LRT lines and improve the quality and serviceability of existing platforms. There has been some progress earlier this year, such as the acquisition of new air-conditioning units for trains, as well as whole new train units; and the intensive maintenance and repair work for existing tracks. These are good places to start.  Finally, the relevant agencies should develop means to encourage commuters to use alternative modes of transportation, such as the newly-opened and refurbished river ferries, as well as the inter-city ferries that have started to operate from Cavite to CCP and Lawton back in 2019. No one has to suffer from a lack of transportation options at the start of the new decade. We Filipinos deserve better than to be envious of other countries’ transportation systems. – Rappler.com Earl Carlo Guevarra is a teacher of English at an international school in San Juan City. When he’s not teaching writing or grammar, he likes to drink fruit shakes and dabble in poetry."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/248991-angkas-says-weight-not-yet-factored-bookings/","title":"Weight not yet factored into bookings – Angkas","date":"Jan 10, 2020 11:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Angkas head of operations David Medrana says the 'weight safety check' feature is part of a data collection phase to 'study implementation for a safer ride for all'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas made clarifications on Friday, January 10, regarding its new in-app “weight safety check” feature, saying a passenger’s weight is not factored into bookings – at least not yet. In a recent update of the app, Angkas asks users to provide their weight range, saying government guidelines require the provider to ensure that small bikers with small bikes do not get paired with passengers they may not be able to ferry. The guidelines for the motorcycle taxi pilot run stipulate that participating riders must observe maximum payload of the motorcycle. Why it matters: If a passenger’s weight will significantly lessen the number of motorcycle taxis available to ferry them, motorcycle taxi firms will have to ensure that there are enough riders to serve passengers of any weight. However, the technical working group tasked to oversee the motorcycle taxi pilot run also imposed a 10,000-biker cap for each provider for Metro Manila, and 3,000 for Metro Cebu. In a statement, Angkas head of operations David Medrana said that the provision on weight was already referenced in passenger safety cards. In particular, the cards read: “Heavy passengers may be denied. We don’t judge, [but] safety above all else.” “It’s all about safety,” Medrana said, adding that the weight check was based on discussions with the Department of Transportation when the initial motorcycle taxi pilot run started in June 2019. Medrana then explained that Angkas is still in the data collection phase to “study implementation for a safer ride for all.” “Eventually, our goal is to ensure all bookings match you with the most appropriate bike and biker. For now, this should not impact anything from before, and rest assured we are treating this sensitive data with the utmost care,” Medrana said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/249001-qc-court-denies-angkas-bid-exclude-joyride-move-it-pilot-run/","title":"QC court denies Angkas’ bid to exclude JoyRide, Move It from pilot run","date":"Jan 10, 2020 10:42 PM PHT","snippet":"Quezon City Judge Catherine Manodon points out that the two players are already operating, so 'nothing more can be restrained'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A Quezon City regional trial court denied the petition of motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas that sought to prevent new players JoyRide and Move It from participating in the motorcycle taxi pilot run.

The app-based ride-hailing service was bound to become popular in cities where commuters spend hours in traffic jam every day. Under Philippine laws, however, Angkas’ status remains illegal. Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code provides that motorcycles can only be private or government vehicles. Private vehicles cannot be used for hire, while government vehicles can only be used in fulfilling government functions. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) With 9 pending bills in Congress seeking to recognize motorcycle taxis, the technical working group (TWG) set strict and specific guidelines on Angkas’ operations during the pilot run to ensure commuters’ safety. While Angkas maintained a 99.997% safety rate, new players JoyRide and Move It have yet to show similar statistics. (READ: Metro commuting in 2019: The shortcomings of the motorcycle taxi pilot run) In neighboring countries of Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, motorcycle taxis started as an informal sector and evolved into ride-hailing apps-based service that received government attention and regulation. This is how Angkas-like services operate in other Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia Ojeks, or motorcycle taxis, existed in Indonesia for many years prior to the rise of ride-hailing apps. Similar to the Philippines’ habal-habal system, ojeks were an informal means for moving people around the city. Commuters would look for an ojek shelter or hail for them wherever they could find them. Some lucky commuters developed rapport with drivers to service them regularly. Indonesia’s ride-hailing startup Gojek traces its roots back to 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing call center, where the company would match calling customers with ojeks.  The practice was in a gray area – no existing legal framework or regulation, but still done. For a while, the government was silent on ojeks, with no impetus to go after them since it was understood that they provided a necessary service in a city always snarled by traffic. In 2015, the Gojek app was launched as it began to expand its services beyond motorcycle taxis. Grab entered the picture in 2012. The two apps generated wide popularity as millions in investments poured in. When the apps came, the ojek system had somewhat been formalized, and that’s when the government stepped in. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation announced in January 2019 that they had begun working to regulate fares. They understood that the mere presence of these motorcycle services needed regulation even without official government recognition. The 2009 Traffic and Land Transportation Law does not recognize two-wheeled vehicles as a public transport mode. A petition by 54 drivers to amend the law was junked by the Constitutional Court in 2018. The ministry released an ojek regulation in March 2019, with provisions on standard fares and customer safety. A ministry officer said  they would arrange meetings with Gojek and Grab to discuss minimum fares. The regulation requires drivers to wear uniforms, have valid drivers’ licenses, have adequate knowledge of street routes, and follow traffic rules. Ride-hailing companies are also required to have an emergency button and accident compensation. There are also procedures for hiring and suspending drivers. The ride-hailing companies still receive complaints and protests over their services, but there reportedly has not been much noise with regards to the government’s regulation. Thailand Ride-hailing companies have been operating in Thailand for several years. Among them is Get, a unit of Indonesia’s Gojek, that offers motorcycle taxi rides. Thailand deals with an unregulated market. An earlier form of motorcycle taxi service was called motosai, where drivers were managed by an informal operator that would provide their uniforms for a fee.  In 2014, the military government attempted to regulate the business by making the drivers buy their uniforms directly from the Thai Department of Transport. The arrival of similar services by Uber and Grab later on threatened this arrangement. Thailand suspended motorcycle taxi services from Uber and Grab in 2016, with reports saying at least 66 drivers from the companies were arrested. The actions were done on claims they “broke local rules” and were “clashing with registered transport companies.” The crackdown came 3 months after Uber launched its motorcycle taxi service in Bangkok. The Transport Ministry announced in September 2019 that it was drafting guidelines to regulate ride-hailing companies.  Currently, police reportedly stop and fine drivers for improper registration. Reports of violence among motor taxi drivers have come about amid the arrival of ride-hailing apps. “We have to look at what is possible within the law to give choice to the public – not increase competition with taxis in the system,” Transport Ministry Deputy Permanent Secretary Jirut Wisarnjit told Reuters. The regulatory framework is targeted for finalization by March 2020. Malaysia Local startup Dego Ride was the first of its kind in Malaysia, starting motorcycle taxi operations in the country in late 2016. The government quickly declared it illegal in January 2017 due to safety concerns.  Malaysian political coalition Pakatan Harapan’s Transport Minister Anthony Loke upheld the decision in September 2018, saying high motorcycle accident rates were enough reason to not legalize the services. Taxi company founder Shamsubahrin Ismail also brought up cultural factors that may show motor taxis to be problematic, asking if women passengers hugging riders would be acceptable. In August 2019, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq lobbied with the Malaysian Cabinet to approve legalizing the service. Saddiq arranged for Loke, Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim, and the Prime Minister himself to be at the meeting. Malaysia’s The Star reported that Saddiq pitched to create youth employment through motorcycle taxi services, in line with a Pakatan election promise of creating one million job opportunities.  The Malaysian Cabinet then allowed the introduction of motorcycle taxi services in the country, subject to viability studies and legal provisions. Saddiq later met with Dego Ride after excluding the homegrown startup from the previous meeting and ensuring that the Cabinet’s approval would be applicable to all motorcycle taxi apps, not just Gojek. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/248737-thewrap-january-7-2020-evening-edition/","title":"Duterte offers Maynilad, Manila Water new deals | Evening wRap","date":"Jan 7, 2020 9:32 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler’s evening newscast with Acor Arceo","body":" Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte gives water companies Maynilad and Manila Water the option to accept new deals crafted on his term, after lashing out at the companies over supposed ‘onerous’ provisions in their government contracts.

(This is just a study and yet you’re opposing the regulator. What if they choose to stop the pilot run, who will suffer?)” he said. According to an Inquirer.net report, the TWG earlier stated that the pilot run will no longer have an extension.

The registration on Sunday saw a total of 2,720 applicants who still have to go through another round of screening as well as training.

Fortun questioned the mandate of Gardiola as the chairman of the TWG, since the initial 6-month pilot run guidelines were approved by Transportation Undersecretary Mark de Leon and signed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade.  The revised guidelines for the extension, however, were only signed by Gardiola and Land Transportation Office Chief Edgar Galvante. Gardiola is also a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. (DOCUMENT: Updated guidelines on the motorcycle taxi pilot run)  Fortun claimed that the Department of Transportation did not release a department order delegating the TWG as the one solely responsible for the pilot implementation of motorcycle taxis.

I dont think it really helped us dahil hindi naman umusad ang aming application (because it didn’t move forward) until much later. And nobody acted on that letter, based on that letter of Senator Pimentel,” Eala said. JoyRide’s entry into the pilot-run was approved in December, under the new TWG headed by Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Member Antonio Gardiola Jr. (READ: Metro commuting in 2019: The shortcomings of the motorcycle taxi pilot run) Not owned by politicians Eala categorically denied that the motorcycle firm is owned by politicians “I just want to put it very, very clearly. Wala pong kahit na sino na tiga-gobyerno na miyembro ng JoyRide [officials]. (No one in the government is a member of JoyRide),” Eala told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino. Rumors of JoyRide being owned by Senator Christopher “Bong” Go made rounds on social media in December, a claim that the senator himself denied. Eala said that business owners and family friends Ralph Nubla Jr and Bea Chua own JoyRide, as they simply “decided to venture into another industry.” Nubla is a director at the Philippine Bank of Communication and has businesses in real estate. “They started last year where we are seeing the motioning of the industry in delivery services. They wanted to do more at the industry, hoping that it will not only be profitable but [for it to] make a difference in the industry,” Eala said. Prior to becoming “JoyRide”, the firm first dabbled in logistics under the name “Happy Move”, which was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission as We Move Things Philippines Inc. JoyRide, along with Move It, are now challenging pioneer firm Angkas during the extended motorcycle taxi pilot implementation, as stakeholders await for the passage of a law that would legalize its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/248299-uber-postmates-sue-california-over-gig-economy-labor-law/","title":"Uber, Postmates sue California over gig-economy labor law","date":"Dec 31, 2019 6:03 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The companies claim that the new law treating gig-economy freelancers as employees is unconstitutional","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA (UPDATED) – Ride-hailing giant Uber and delivery company Postmates have filed a lawsuit against the state of California, claiming a new law that would treat gig-economy freelancers as employees is unconstitutional. The legislation, due to go into effect on Wednesday, January 1, would mean that – under certain conditions – independent contractors are classified as employees and granted the minimum salary and health insurance benefits that entails. This would include drivers for both Uber and Postmates. “Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to protect their constitutional rights and defend their fundamental liberty to pursue their chosen work as independent service providers and technology companies in the on-demand economy,” said the lawsuit filed on Monday, December 30. Uber warned earlier this year that it would oppose any change of status for its drivers, which will cost the company extra in social security costs. In the suit, Uber and its co-plaintiffs argue the law targets independent service providers while exempting direct salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers and commercial fishermen. “There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions,” it said. In the suit, Uber and its co-plaintiffs argue the law targets independent service providers while exempting direct salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers, and commercial fishermen. “There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions,” it said. Uber and its American rival Lyft have each put aside 30 million dollars to organize a referendum, allowed under Californian law, to replace the legislation with a compromise on social rights that has been put before the state Governor.  Drivers are divided between those who want the same security as employees and those who want the flexibility of being able to choose the hours they work.  The gig economy has given drivers “opportunities to earn money when and where they want, with unprecedented independence and flexibility,” the lawsuit said. California is one of Uber’s key markets, with around nine percent of its sales on ride and delivery platforms made in the state, CNBC said, citing the company’s head Dara Khosrowshahi. The new law comes as the ride-hailing company is also facing legal clampdowns on its operations elsewhere. A German court ruled earlier this month that Uber – which relies heavily on the use of vehicles from local car rental companies in the country – must have a rental car licence of its own to operate.  In November, London’s transport authority refused to renew the company’s operating license because of safety and security concerns. That came as a big blow to Uber, which has about 3.5 million customers and some 50,000 drivers in the British capital. It has said it will appeal the decision. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/248272-netizens-reaction-grab-refund/","title":"‘Thank you sa piso’: Netizens feeling ‘grateful’ for Grab refund","date":"Dec 31, 2019 1:29 PM PHT","snippet":"'Hanggang saan aabot ang piso mo?'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Make no mistake: it’s a non-gratitude gratitude.

For its initial pilot implementation, Angkas was only authorized to operate in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. But the TWG, composed of transportation officials, said field reports and social media posts showed the availability of Angkas in Cagayan de Oro City and General Santos City in Mindanao.  “This is a clear breach of the terms of reference by Angkas, and a blatant, and very dangerous disregard of the agreed guidelines set by the TWG,” the group said in a statement. The TWG then urged Angkas to explain the breach to determine if the TWG should impose sanctions. In response, Angkas said that they worked with local government units (LGU) on a case-to-case basis, dependent on the LGU’s need or request.  Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said that General Santos City and Cagayan de Oro “gave their blessing” for the ride-hailing firm to serve in their locales. Royeca also claimed that Cagayan de Oro had a local ordinance that allowed motorcycle taxi operations. Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member and TWG chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr reiterated that there was no law that covered the operations of motorcycle taxis as a mode of public transportation. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) Transportation Assistant Secretary and TWG consultant Alberto Suansing added that LGUs cannot go above the national law, adding that any local ordinance that allowed motorcycles-for-hire was defective.  “The action of Angkas and their admittance of having arranged their motorcycle taxi operations to whoever in CDO and Gen San only shows their arrogance to even challenge existing laws and the government and overtly displays their blatant defiance and disregard to the guidelines,” Gardiola told Rappler on December 28. He added that those who operated outside the pilot run may be penalized under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. Under this law, violators may be fined, suspended, or imprisoned for using motorcycles for hire.  Gardiola then said that should motorcycle taxis be legalized, Angkas may be prohibited from operating because of this breach. “Ang hirap dito sa Angkas ay namisconstrue nila na ‘yung pilot run is a license for them to make money (What’s difficult about Angkas is that they misconstrued the pilot run as a license for them to make money),” Suansing told Rappler. This development was the latest in the clash between the TWG and Angkas, after the announcement of the revised guidelines spurred concerns that 17,000 Angkas bikers may lose their jobs due to the new cap of the pilot run extension. With regard to the extension of the motorcycle taxi pilot run until March 2020, Suansing said Angkas would be cited for this violation. The revised guidelines of the motorcycle taxi pilot run indicated that ride-hailing providers and riders that operate without authority will be blacklisted if motorcycle taxis be legalized for public transportation. The pilot run is set to end on March 23, 2020, and the TWG is scheduled to submit its final report and recommendations regarding the pilot run to both houses of Congress on April 15.

Kalanick, who was pushed out as chief executive in 2017 amid revelations about the controversial business practices that accompanied the company’s stunning rise, will resign from the board of directors effective December 31 “to focus on his new business and philanthropic endeavors,” Uber said in a statement. “Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits,” Kalanick, 43, said in a statement released by the company. “I’m proud of all that Uber has achieved, and I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines.” In March 2018, Kalanick announced the creation of a new investment vehicle, 10100, that will focus on both for-profit and non-profit ventures. The key areas of focus for the fund include real estate, e-commerce and innovation in China and India. Among his most recent ventures, Kalanick has developed the so-called “ghost kitchen” company, CloudKitchens, which will rent communal kitchens near population centers that can prepare food for delivery services. Even before Tuesday’s announcement, Kalanick had taken steps to further distance himself from Uber, selling a large portion of his shares in early November. The youthful Kalanick has been the personification of the go-go Silicon Valley disruptor associated with visionary entrepreneurship that upends traditional businesses, accompanied by unfettered growth. Growth and growing pains Kalanick and fellow Uber co-founder Garrett Camp got the idea for Uber while visiting Paris in December 2008 when they were unable to find a taxi. UberCab launched in July 2010 in San Francisco. The company name was shortened in October to Uber. The venture has grown rapidly since then, with operations in 700 cities in 65 countries at the time of its initial public offering in May.  Kalanick resigned from Uber in June 2017 amid heavy pressure following a series of disturbing reports about a cutthroat workplace culture, harassment, discrimination and questionable business tactics to thwart rivals. The company appointed former Expedia chief Dara Khosrowshahi as chief executive later that year.  Khosrowshahi has taken steps to clean up the company’s image, including as upgrading its rider safety programs and disclosing figures on sexual assaults.  But the company also still faces plenty of challenges as critics complain of excess traffic, aggressive labor practices and other ills. A regional court in Germany last week barred Uber from offering rides through car hire firms. Wall Street analysts have also questioned the company’s long-term profit prospects.  Khosrowshahi said Tuesday that “very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber.”  Board Chairperson Ron Sugar thanked Kalanick for “his unique expertise, honed over 10 years building Uber from a scrappy startup into the global public company.” Uber shares, which have fallen more than 25% since the company went public in May, rose on Tuesday in a holiday-shortened session.  Shares gained 0.4% to finish at $30.44. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/247874-netizens-post-boycott-ride-hailing-company-joyride/","title":"Amid rumors and dubious posts, netizens call for #BoycottJoyRide","date":"Dec 24, 2019 4:43 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipinos online raise eyebrows at JoyRide's introduction in the market for motorcycle taxis, given a number of suspicious posts from apparent bots and endorsers","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Motorcycle ride-hailing firm JoyRide is getting flak online, with netizens calling the company out for seemingly suspicious online behavior from apparent bots and endorsers.

Access to data: The TWG or a designated information technology expert will have access to each provider’s database for validation and verification. Apart from this, all riders will have to register with the LTFRB to form a database of participating riders. The providers will submit a list of riders registered in their platform. The providers must also submit data on any modifications or updates to their mobile application on a monthly basis. TWG members: The members of the technical working group have now been specified. These include members from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), the Land Transportation Office, the Inter-Agency Council on Traffic, and the legal office of the Department of Transportation (DOTr).  Representatives from Congress, commuter groups, and biker/rider groups have been delegated as observers. Earlier, commuter groups and safety road advocates who claimed to be part of the original TWG said they were not consulted in the decision on the extension of the pilot run and accommodation of new players. Riders: Instead of a vest-based strap, riders must now wear a belt-based strap with at least 4 handles that can be held on to by the passenger for stability. Moreover, riders will be registered under one ride hailing platform only. Fare matrix: The indication for dynamic pricing (1.5x surge cap) has been removed. Motorcycle specifications: Motorcycle requirements have been changed from 100-200 cubic centimeter (cc) conventional engine displacement to 100-150 cc.  Blacklisting: Ride-hailing platforms found operating outside the pilot run will be blacklisted from applying and operating should motorcycle taxis be legalized.  Registration fees: According to the new rules, the LTFRB will be providing guidelines for the collection of registration fees from participating providers and riders. The amount and payment process has not yet been stipulated. Period of pilot implementation: The pilot run may be extended for another 3 months upon recommendation by the TWG.  If motorcycle taxis get legalized in the course of the pilot run, the TWG and the pilot implementation will expire.

He added that if the other two providers cannot fill the 13,000 biker cap, then the TWG can adjust in the future and allow Angkas more bikers.  According to new provisions announced by the TWG on Friday, December 20, Angkas, the sole motorcycle taxi provider during the pilot, has to share the new 39,000 biker cap with two new providers in the 3-month pilot extension, JoyRide and Move It. (READ: After 3 years, Angkas is still not making money) This new rule, which allows per ride-hailing firm 10,000 bikers for Metro Manila and 3,000 bikers for Metro Cebu, will cost 17,000 bikers their livelihood, said Angkas, given their previous cap of 27,000. Angkas and its bikers protested the new rule on Sunday, December 22, demanding that the government “save Angkas” and questioning the TWG’s intentions, given what Angkas described as TWG’s sudden announcement.  But the TWG said in a release and at the press conference on December 23 that the focus of the extended trial period is not livelihood. Rather it is to study the safety and viability of using motorcycles as public utility vehicles. The two new players begin their operations for the extended pilot run on Monday, December 23.  According to TWG spokesperson Joel Bolano, Angkas has already registered 2,210 bikers with the TWG as of December 23.

This is the explanation made by the inter-agency technical working group (TWG) that oversees the motorcycle taxi pilot run, in response to the public appeal of pioneering firm Angkas to save 17,000 of their bikers from losing their jobs.  These bikers stand to lose their livelihood following the TWG’s decision to impose a new cap of 39,000 for all 3 motorcycle taxi providers during their extended pilot implementation. The new cap would reduce Angkas’s biker fleet from an overall 27,000 to 10,000 for Metro Manila and 3,000 for Cebu.  The regulators earlier suggested that the Angkas bikers at risk of deactivation be absorbed by the new providers, JoyRide and Move It. However, Angkas bikers seem more likely to return to unregulated habal-habal service than join the new competitors. The TWG, however, said this was beside the point of the pilot. “Hindi issue ng hanapbuhay ang focus ng TWG sa gagawing pag-aaral,” the TWG said in a statement on Monday, December 23. (Livelihood is not the focus of the TWG in the study.) The TWG said the purpose of the pilot run is to determine if motorcycles would be a viable mode of public transportation. This would need real-time information from all riders and not just from Angkas, said the TWG. (Metro commuting in 2019: The shortcomings of the motorcycle taxi pilot run) “Hangga’t hindi pa natatapos ang pag-aaral, hindi pa pormal na kinikilala ng TWG ang motorcycle ride-hailing service bilang isang legal at ligtas na PUV service,” the TWG said. (While the pilot run is ongoing, the TWG does not formally recognize the motorcycle ride-hailing service as a legal and safe public utility vehicle service.) Moreover, the TWG said the 39,000-rider cap was not allocated to serve all motorcycle taxi users, but only to serve as a sample for the study. Instead, the TWG calls on commuters to give feedback on the motorcycle taxis. The group also made assurances that passenger safety will be strictly monitored during the pilot run. Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca earlier said that ensuring passenger safety and maintaining service quality would be more difficult to do with the new cap.  However, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member and TWG chairman Antonio Gardiola Jr said Angkas was only “overreacting” because their fleet would be reduced. He said Angkas bikers will now have the option to choose from two other providers. “Hindi trabaho ang usapin dito. Ito ay isang pag-aaral.

So when we found a company that showed concern for us, that loved us, that considered us partners, did you expect us to leave that kind of company?) In an appeal to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Friday, December 20, Angkas expressed its concern that the lower cap assigned to the company – which would force it to part with 17,000 bikers it had trained – would cause passengers to also turn to habal-habal, or the unregulated motorcycle taxis. Angkas data show that demand for rides would outstrip supply.  In the motorcycle taxi services’ 6-month pilot run, which ends December 26, Angkas, being the pioneer, was the only participating company. It was allowed to have up to 27,000 bikers. When the LTFRB’s technical working group decided to extend the test run for 3 more months, it set a cap of 39,000 slots for bikers in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu, but split evenly among Angkas and two more companies: JoyRide and Move It.  With only 13,000 slots for Angkas, it will have to let go of some 17,000 previously trained and accredited bikers. At the protest rally Sunday morning, Angkas Pabebe Warriors’ Claire Lastimosa said she wouldn’t join the two other companies. “Bakit kami sasali sa ibang apps ng ride-hailing nang itong Angkas ay subok na? Kami ang nauna, bakit iba ang aani? Hindi kami papayag niyan,” she said. (Why would we join other ride-hailing apps when Angkas has been tried and tested? We were first. Why should someone else reap the benefits? We won’t allow that.) Angkas Pabebe Warriors is a group of Angkas female bikers. Lastimosa said she is one of many single mothers who are part of the group who enjoy the flexible work hours that Angkas allows them.  Angkas appealed the new provisions set by the government’s technical working group on the extended motorcycle taxi pilot run on Friday, December 20.

This means that some 30,000 motorcycle taxis will be available, provided that the two new companies will deploy the maximum number of allowed drivers. Meanwhile, some 9,000 bikers will be allotted for Metro Cebu, with each ride-hailing firm getting an equal share. This would bring the number of motorcycles to 39,000 nationwide.

Gardiola added that the cap ensures a competitive market and avoids a monopoly by Angkas. “Also, please note that when the cap was discussed during the consultation meeting with Angkas and the other [transport network companies], Angkas did not, in any way, express disagreement.

The ball is in the government’s court whether Angkas and other motorcycle taxi firms will be allowed to operate after December 26, the supposed end of the pilot run. So far, officials from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have recommended to extend the pilot run and accommodate new players, but the final decision has yet to be announced. While this may seem like a good development for those who use motorcycle taxis daily to get around the metropolis, the process that led to these recommendations is being called into question. Commuter welfare groups and road safety advocates have come forward, pointing out how the entry of new players into the pilot run poses risks to the riding public. As the fate of Angkas and the motorcycle taxi industry itself is being determined, stakeholders wonder: What has the pilot run achieved? What will happen if an extension is granted and if new players join the pilot testing? Lack of transparency In May, the DOTr approved the pilot testing to aid lawmakers in crafting a bill that would legalize and regulate motorcycle taxis. They then issued a set of guidelines for the pilot implementation. According to the DOTr, the technical working group (TWG) that was tasked to craft the guidelines and monitor the pilot run is comprised of representatives from the following: The guidelines stipulate that the TWG is required to convene every month to discuss data gathered from the pilot operations. However, commuter welfare groups and road safety advocates who took part in crafting the guidelines for the pilot run claimed they were not consulted on the decision to extend the pilot implementation and to accommodate new players. They have not been invited to any meetings in the past 6 months. These stakeholders include the Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection (LCSP), Legal Engagement Advocating for Development and Reform, Komyut, and Move Metro Manila. Komyut convener Toix Cerna said they had been following up on the pilot operations and asking the TWG to convene since August, but her requests had gone unheeded. She said they had not been invited to evaluate the potential new providers either, unlike how they did with Angkas. “We went to the Angkas warehouse in Taguig, saw their onboarding process, asked questions/clarifications, suggested some additional safety protocols [like the] vest, info board,” Cerna told Rappler. According to Cerna, the TWG members had an email thread for their communications, which was where these groups shared inputs on the draft guidelines. “Nandun ako nagkukulit about TWG meeting, where I would share news articles on [motorcycle] taxi which should warrant a meeting…. Nothing there at all,” Cerna said when asked if they were consulted on the new providers.  (There I was, following up, sharing news articles on motorcycle taxis which should have warranted a meeting, but there was nothing there at all.) Rappler reached out to the DOTr and the TWG for their response, but has not received a statement as of writing. The risks of allowing new players To ensure the safety of commuters during the pilot run, the TWG set strict and specific guidelines for the operations of Angkas. Among others, these guidelines included rules and/or limitations on: While Angkas was able to maintain a 99.997% safety rate during the 6 months, potential new players cannot provide the same assurance as of yet. In this regard, the Lawyers for Commuter Safety and Protection group earlier filed a petition for a temporary restraining order against 5 motorcycle taxi firms for operating outside of the DOTr-approved pilot implementation. “Ito pong limang korporasyon po na ito ay operating as far as we are concerned. Meaning that meron po silang mga posts dun sa kanilang mga Facebook pages that they are already in the process of hiring motorcycle riders, that there is an ongoing training program for them, some of them are actually already booking,” said LCSP member lawyer Raymond Fortun during a press briefing. (These 5 corporations are already operating, as far as we are concerned. Meaning, they have posts in their Facebook pages that they are already in the process of hiring motorcycle riders, that there is an ongoing training program for them, and some of them are actually already booking.) Fortun said these operations pose a threat to the riding public since they are not being regulated and monitored by the members of the TWG.  “We are being very unfair to the consumers who might be affected by the results of trying to include new players who have absolutely no track record when it comes to operating a motorcycle taxi system that is app-based,” Fortun added. Meanwhile, before the petition was filed, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said that if the pilot would be extended, Angkas and new players would have to be compliant with security measures, rate control, insurance, speed limiters, and other requirements as set in the guidelines. LTFRB Technical Division chief Joel Bolano said the new players that presented their proposals are being evaluated if they are fit to enter the extended pilot implementation, according to the same set of guidelines. “If that is the case, good. [Pero] bakit hindi sila ina-apprehend ngayon? Dapat sana, ang LTFRB nag-announce ng extension, pero in-announce na rin nila sana, na dun sa mga nagbabalak diyan, ‘wag muna kayong mag-operate, kasi hindi pa kayo nakapag-ano sa pilot testing,” said LCSP member lawyer Ariel Inton in response. (If that is the case, good. But why are they not apprehending these motorcycle taxi firms now? The LTFRB could have announced the extension with the caveat that those who want to enter the pilot testing should not yet operate without being evaluated for entry into the pilot run.) Legislation, not extension Since the groups were not consulted in the decision to extend the pilot run, they are also left in the dark as to how helpful the pilot run had been with regard to providing a basis for legalizing motorcycle taxis.  “Kulang ba ‘yung data na natanggap in order for there to be a report which can be the basis for the passage of a law [regulating] motorcycle taxis?” Fortun said. (Was the data not enough for a report which can be the basis for the passage of a law [regulating] motorcycle taxis?) Fortun added that the fact that new players are being considered means there is already a basis for the regulation of motorcycle taxis. “[Instead] of allowing two new players to be included in an extension of the pilot program, why don’t you just pass the law right now on the basis of the standards that have already been set and agreed upon? And now everybody can now be subjected to the same standards under a governing law,” Fortun said. Thus, these stakeholders go back to why the pilot run was conducted in the first place: legislation. The groups are now urging Congress to prioritize the bills on motorcycle taxis that have already been filed. “We know that there are 9 bills pending in the House and in the Senate…. We hope that these are being acted upon. That is our hope for the commuters, that while the pilot run is ongoing and the TWG is evaluating it, Congress is also working on a law so that by the end of the pilot, there will already be a law stipulating the standards to be followed by all players,” Cerna said in a mix of Filipino and English.

Not against competition The lawyers said they were not against accommodating more players in the motorcycle ride-hailing market. Vicente Topacio, LCSP Secretary, said that while they are pushing for competition, they are taking the safety of the passengers into account. “What we are saying is that bago kayo makapasok, kailangang dumaan dun sa parameters ng TWG (What we are saying is that before they enter, they need to go through the parameters of the TWG),” said LCSP member Ariel Inton. DOTr Undersecretary for Roads Mark de Leon earlier said new motorcycle taxi firms will be accepted if they are compliant with the guidelines of the pilot run, to be evaluated by the technical working group.  Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade also said that should the pilot run be extended to accommodate other players, they will also be held to the safety requirements that they earlier imposed on Angkas. Left out? Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Technical Division Chief Joel Bolano earlier said that 6 motorcycle taxi firms have submitted their proposals to enter the pilot testing and are now being evaluated. The LCSP claimed that despite being part of the TWG, they were not informed about these developments. Further, they said they were never consulted about bringing in other players in the first place. Inton said the petition was “very timely,” since some authorities seem to be open to allowing these firms entry into the pilot run. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/246720-dotr-says-angkas-pilot-run-extended-pending-ltfrb-approval/","title":"Pending LTFRB approval, Angkas pilot run to be extended – DOTr","date":"Dec 8, 2019 11:19 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The official report of the technical working group is set to come out on December 9, according to DOTr Undersecretary Mark de Leon","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Arthur Tugade ordered the extension of the pilot run of motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas, according to DOTr Undersecretary Mark de Leon. “The initial finding is that [the] Secretary really wants this pilot implementation continued, [si] Secretary Tugade mismo nag-utos (He ordered it himself), and that we should open up the pilot implementation to other operators,” De Leon told Rappler on the sidelines of the Cavite-Metro Manila ferry service launch.

The first day of a strike, seen as a major test for President Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious vision of reforming France, saw giant rallies across the country coupled with walkouts that paralyzed transport and closed schools. Friday was set to follow a similar pattern, with almost all high-speed train services cancelled, most of the Paris metro system shut down and hundreds of flights set to be axed. Yves Veyrier, head of the hardline FO union, warned the strike could last at least until Monday, December 9, if the government did not take the right action. “The strike is not going to stop tonight,” added Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the CGT union, late on Thursday. But it remains far from certain the protests will match the magnitude of the 1995 strikes when France was paralyzed for 3 weeks from November to December in an action that forced the then government into concessions. Possible fuel shortages  As on Thursday, December 5, national train operator SNCF has axed 90% of the high-speed TGVs on Friday and just 30% of regional trains will run. On the Paris metro, 10 lines will remain totally shut, four will work at a much reduced capacity and only two — the driverless 1 and 14 — will work normally. Flag carrier Air France is again axing 30 percent of domestic flights. There will also be severe disruptions on the Eurostar, with some two dozen trains cancelled on the cross-Channel route. A weekend of travel misery is also expected. National newspapers were unable to publish their print editions, and the CGT union said workers had blocked 7 of the country’s 8 oil refineries, raising the prospect of fuel shortages if the strike continues. Bike paths were packed as commuters turned to bicycles and electric scooters while ride-hailing companies were offering special strike promotions. Macron’s government has yet to set out its plans in full but is pushing for a single pension scheme which critics say would require everyone to work longer. A pre-school teacher demonstrating in the eastern city of Belfort, Anne Audier-L’Epingle, said she was striking because “I don’t know what I will be able to offer two-year-old children when I’m 65.” The minimum pension age in France is 62, one of the lowest among developed countries. But railway workers, opera employees and a host of other workers have more advantageous schemes, with train drivers for example generally retiring in their early fifties. ‘Calm and determined’  Police fired teargas to disperse small groups of rioters in Paris as well as in the southeastern city of Lyon and western city of Nantes. But the dozens of demonstrations held nationwide were mainly peaceful. More than half a million people protested across France, according to a tally of official figures, even excluding a protest that unions said gathered around a quarter of a million in Paris. Macron has faced a wave of opposition this year, from the “yellow vest” movement demanding improved living standards to more recent protests from police, firefighters, teachers, hospital workers and lawyers. So far the former investment banker has largely succeeded in pushing through a series of controversial reforms, including loosening labour laws and tightening access to unemployment benefits. But this is the first time the various disgruntled groups have come together in protest. Macron has sought to rise above the strikes and has chosen to make no official comment in the days leading up to the stoppages. A presidential official, who asked not to be named, said he was “calm” and “determined to carry out this reform” in a mood of “listening and consultation”. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/246573-uber-us-safety-report-results-december-2019/","title":"Nearly 6,000 U.S. sexual assaults reported to Uber in 2017 and 2018","date":"Dec 6, 2019 11:37 AM PHT","snippet":"Uber and its rival Lyft face increasing pressure to cope with the growing number of complaints of abuse","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Nearly 6,000 instances of sexual assault, including more than 450 cases of rape, were reported to Uber in the United States in 2017 and 2018, the ride-sharing company said in a report on safety released Thursday, December 5. It is the first time that Uber has released the figures – which also revealed 19 fatal assaults related to the company over the two-year period – as it and rival Lyft face increasing pressure to cope with the growing number of complaints of abuse. The company received 464 reports of non-consensual sexual penetration and 587 of attempted non-consensual sexual penetration in 2017 and 2018. The other assaults fell into categories such as non-consensual kissing or touching. While the number of reports went up from 2017 to 2018 in 3 of the 5 categories, including non-consensual sexual penetration and non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, the ride-sharing service hailed across-the-board declines in the “incident rate” based on a larger number of overall trips occurring in the latter year. “From 2017 to 2018, Uber saw approximately a 16% decrease in the average incident rate across the 5 most serious sexual assault categories reported. Additionally, there were rate decreases across each of the five individual categories,” the report said. Uber also reported 10 “fatal physical assaults” related to its service in 2017 and 9 in 2018. “During 2017 and 2018, there were 19 fatal physical assaults occurring in a total of 18 incidents in relation to Uber,” the company said.

On Wednesday, December 4, Angkas founder and chief executive officer Angeline Tham said the investment they put in to maintain the standards of the platform makes it hard for them to earn money, even with around 27,000 Angkas bikers on the street. The motorcycle-hailing firm fails 70% of biker applicants, which Tham says allows it to keep certain levels of safety standards. In the case of Angkas, the free training program for its riders results in a 99.997% safety rate.  “That’s the price you pay for keeping the quality of the platform,” Tham said during a panel discussion on corporate governance. It remains unclear when the company can gain profitability. For now, Tham said it has become more of an advocacy for road safety.  Tham said that riders who fail the training can still re-apply. She cited one that took the program 7 times before becoming an Angkas rider. “Talagang binubusisi po talaga natin ‘yung bawat isang driver natin to make sure na talagang ‘yung pinakamagagaling na driver ang nasa daan para sa Angkas,” said Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca. (We really evaluate each driver to make sure that the best drivers become Angkas partners.) Further, Royeca said run-ins with the government in the past have also taken a toll on the company. “We operated for a few months in the beginning, then after that nagkaroon po ng injunction, we operated for about 4 months, and then ngayon another 6 months during the pilot phase.

In September 2018, the firm got a preliminary injunction allowing them to continue operations. Then finally, earlier this year, the Department of Transportation approved a 6-month pilot run for Angkas which started in June.

Officials are bracing for major protests that could snarl rail and metro traffic across the country, raising the spectre of a second French winter of discontent a year after the start of the “yellow vest” protest movement. Unions have called a new indefinite strike against an overhaul of the pensions system that they say will require people to work longer or accept a lower pension. The national rail operator SNCF has taken the unusual step of halting all ticket sales for December 5-8 on expectations of sweeping train cancellations. RATP, which operates the Paris metro, said it would team up with companies offering travel alternatives for commuters, such as carpooling groups and ride-hailing firms. It will also provide “complementary mobility services” such as bicycles and the electric scooters which have inundated the French capital since last year. Many schools in Paris have warned parents that classes might be cancelled next Thursday and Friday, and firms already expect many employees will be unable to make it in to work. In September, the city already got a foretaste of the possible disruption in store when a one-day strike shut down most of the 16 lines on the metro. Alongside the rail and metro workers, unions at Air France and the electricity group EDF have also announced plans to strike, as have lawyers who say the pension reforms will drain the financial reserves of their own separate pension scheme. The government has vowed to do away with dozens of advantageous pension schemes enjoyed by workers in state transport and utility companies, as well as sailors, solicitors and Paris Opera workers. Metro workers say the reforms would remove their long-held rights to early retirement, secured decades ago to compensate for spending long hours underground. A recent report from France’s state auditor, the Cour des Comptes, found that the average retirement age for public transport workers in Paris in 2017 was 55.7, compared with 63 years for most French workers. The strike poses a stiff challenge to President Emmanuel Macron’s reform agenda, feeding into a growing mood of discontent that has brought tens of thousands of hospital workers, students, firefighters, police, farmers and lawyers onto the streets in the past three months. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/245508-grab-riders-rebate-range/","title":"Grab says riders to get rebate of ‘less than a peso to over P100’","date":"Nov 22, 2019 1:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines also insists that 'no overcharging happened' as the higher fares were driven by 'uncontrollable factors' such as booking demand and traffic conditions","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab riders would have to manage their expectations as the ride-hailing company clarified on Friday, November 22, that that some of them may get a rebate of “below P1” and others over P100. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu made the statement in a news briefing on the P5.05-million refund that the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) had ordered the company to give to its customers. “If we take P5 million over 3 million (riders), the average that the passenger would get is around P1.50. There are some that will get below a peso, there are others who will get over a hundred pesos,” Cu said Grab Philippines said that there were 3.2 million riders from February to May 2019, the time period covered by the penalties. Miguel Aguila, lead legal counsel of Grab Philippnines, said that the amount each rider will get will be “proportionate” to the amount that they spent during that time period.  “If you are a rider [who] spent P1,000, you should get 10 times more than a rider who just paid for P100. So as much as possible we want it to be proportionate,” Aguila said in a mix of Filipino and English. The PCC had ordered Grab to refund P5.05 million to its riders as the company had breached its pricing commitments to the government agency. Grab  had said that it looked forward to paying its passengers, and will announce the mechanics at least 5 days before the refund. Cu said on Friday that the payment will be sourced from the company’s contingency funds. He also emphasized that drivers will not be affected by the fines. Cu also maintained that there was “no overcharging,” saying that the company was compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB. “Walang overcharging na nangyari (No overcharging happened). So even if we disclose to consumers how we charge, which we do in the receipt, sang-ayon naman ‘to sa fare matrix ng [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] (It is compliant with the fare matrix of the LTFRB),” Cu said.

In a press conference on Monday, November 18, the PCC said that, during the period of February to May 2019, Grab exceeded the allowable deviation from before its merger with Uber. This means that the increase of Grab fares from before its acquisition of Uber to its current operations exceeded by more than 22%, under its old set of voluntary pricing commitments to the PCC. This violation incurred a P5.05-million penalty. The PCC amended its conditions so that Grab will refund the penalty to its riders instead of paying it to the antitrust authority. In the new round of monitoring, a 22.5% allowable fare deviation has been imposed on Grab. Riders can check if Grab is breaching its pricing commitments by comparing what they were paying before March 2018 to the fares they are paying now, checking if the increase is more than 22.5%. Should Grab breach this deviation, the company will have to pay P2 million to the PCC as well as refund any penalties to riders within 30 days. According to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan, riders will directly be given a rebate through their individual GrabPay accounts.  For the current P5.05-million penalty, Grab can file a motion for reconsideration within 15 days, and the PCC will be allowed 30 days to submit a final resolution. After this period, Grab is required to refund the amount to its riders within 60 days. This measure is in line with a newly-approved disgorgement mechanism that will take effect on the second year of PCC’s monitoring of Grab operations, to prevent the company from having a “virtual monopoly” on the ride-hailing market. PCC Commissioner Amabelle Asuncion reiterated that only the recipient of the penalty payment has changed, not the formula for computing the penalties. In a statement, Grab said it “looked forward” to paying the passengers who took Grab rides during February to May 2019. Further, the company maintained it complies with the fare matrix imposed by the Land Transportation Regulatory and Franchising Board (LTFRB). Grab will announce the payment mechanics to the riders at least 5 days prior to paying. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/lifestyle-and-entertainment/244704-crossing-the-great-wall/","title":"Crossing the ‘Great Wall’","date":"Nov 14, 2019 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Love will never be enough, but through mutual effort it can persist","body":" MANILA, Philippines – “Back when I was a kid, I thought all restaurants were take-out counters—the kind where you ordered by knocking on the kitchen back door.” Growing up, my father often shared with us stories of his impoverished youth. It’s one of those things that, now in adulthood, I feel bad laughing at as a kid. But you know, at the time, they were these sorts of stories that became an inside joke between us siblings. How our Debby Downer of a dad would always find a way to add a sad punchline to any situation by sharing how these mundane comforts we barely thought about were alien luxuries in his day. There’s the story of how he thought breakfast cereals were tsitsirya (basically eaten like kornik). There’s also how—and this was before green salads were a thing—he unintentionally surprised my mom by making a bagoong and kangkong salad when she was expecting something closer to potato or macaroni. “It was the only ‘salad’ I was familiar with,” he told us. The irony of things is that, while he often shared these sadly comedic anecdotes of his life, they would often come with a juxtaposition. He would also tell us of the affluence of his Chinese grandfather. “For a time, he had the tallest house in all of Tuguegarao!” “Our family could have owned half of Tuguegarao if only he accepted all those land titles as loan collaterals.” A large part of my father’s humble beginnings stemmed from how he was the first-born of a forbidden marriage. His mother, my grandmother, was a near 100% Chinese woman, born of a mainlander and an Aparri-raised tsinay, who married a pure Ybanag kutsero-turned-teacher. And she was disowned because of this. “Langit ka, lupa ako” My grandparents’ love story is that of the typical meeting of two worlds. My grandmother was the first-born of a prominent Chinese businessman in Tuguegarao. Even amongst the wealthy Chinese in the province, he held a certain distinction. He was the president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, he owned multiple businesses, and he sort of functioned as the godfather-type in Tuguegarao, whom those with problems in the Tsinoy community often turned to. I’m reminded of Grease whenever I’d hear descriptions of how my grandparents were back. My Lola Emilia was prim-and-proper, bespectacled, bright, and ultra-religious. When she’d leave the house, she had an assistant who followed her with an umbrella and would hail rides for her.  My Lolo Greg (short for Gregorio), on the other hand, grew up poor but was quite the rough-around-the-edges charmer. Like his father, he was a kutsero (kalesa coachman). Yet he also had the body of a dancer, showcasing his folk dancing skills in schools, smooth-talking women along the way. (Based on the stories, he was quite popular.) Their paths would soon cross once my grandfather was hired as the CAT instructor in the school where my grandmother was teaching Physics. Back then, there was no dating for Lola Emy. Guakong would only allow suitors who were 1) Chinese and (not or) 2) successful. Neither of which my grandfather was. My grandparents’ coupling is something we’re still baffled by to this day. One is cordial and will draw you into hour-long stories, whether you like it or not. The other is quiet, analytical, and reticent. Needless to say, after a year, my grandparents traveled to Manila and got married in secret.  Their marriage would cause outrage in Tuguegarao and it only had guama’s blessing, my father would tell me. And true enough, she was shunned by her father for it. Left to their own devices and without a home to go back to, they raised their family in whatever small home they could rent. The shadow of our guakong’s towering home loomed over them both literally and figuratively—as the three-story mansion did stand out amongst the mostly bungalow homes in Tuguegarao. It was only our guama who maintained contact with our grandmother.  My grandparents, however, along with my father and his siblings, would eventually end up living in the house of our guakong after some time. Albeit, it was in the weirdest of arrangements. One which wasn’t a gesture of reconciliation but one of convenience. My grandmother’s only brother—who was the one living with our guakong and guama back then—moved to Manila to start his own family. Aging and without company, our guama invited my grandmother to live with them. Though in the same house, there were still literal divisions in their living arrangement.  My father’s family had to eat at a different dining table, one in the middle of the house’s storage room. They also had their own separate food, one which was mostly composed of vegetables our grandfather farmed in their backyard, while our great-grandparents feasted on adobo and lugaw. “We didn’t even have enough money for rice, we ate boiled corn,” my dad would tell me. My father would soon move out of the province at the age of 12, after getting into Philippine Science High School. And my grandfather would become an OFW during the first wave of Saudi migrant workers. Aftershocks I’d love to say that this story ended with a grand gesture, a mahjong game similar to that scene in Crazy Rich Asians, where the outsider gains the favor of the conservative head of the family by a cinematic display of worthiness. But it doesn’t. It isn’t even a story of warming up through time. Life just continued. At the end of his life, our guakong spoke to our grandfather from time-to-time, but I wouldn’t classify it as a friendship nor a familial bond. It was just something that they eventually had to do. There’s no story of a surprise inheritance—and I don’t think it was much of a surprise that my grandparents weren’t left with much. My grandfather was able to support his family by working in the Middle East. However, this was already well into my father’s college years, after he got a DOST scholarship at the De la Salle University. Whenever I see my father, and the person he is today (and this may also affect the person I am today), I think our grandparent’s choice to love no matter what still has aftershocks 60 years after. My own father’s love language is built upon acts of sacrifice. Being the first-born, even though un-required, he took it upon himself to do what it takes to secure a better future for his siblings.  He had to leave his family at an early age for a better education. He had to forego the long-process of building a career as a chemical engineer (which, until this day, he wishes he took the boards for) for a sales job that paid better and churned a quicker profit so he could help his family out. And I, in turn, was also raised to equate love with service, to romanticize hardship even though it shouldn’t always be the case. The economics of love can be tricky. Life is too complex for love to be enough in securing a fairytale ending. Things don’t always end up rosy–and my grandparents, my father and his siblings, and, in some ways, even us, went through a lot of financial hardships. But when it comes to love in its purest form, I do believe it can persist.  My Lolo Greg and Lola Emy are still together until this day, and so are my parents, and so are most of my father’s siblings and their spouses. And though they may not all be aware of it, I’d like to credit my grandparents’ display of love amidst all as the cornerstone of all our definitions of love. We don’t choose the people we fall in love with. However, the choosing comes when we decide to let love continue. Like my grandparents, absolutely all of the situations around them beckoned that life would be more comfortable if they went their separate ways. And yet they made a move, chose each other – breaking barriers in the process. Even if it meant a life of hardship and disapproval. So, for those that do find that special connection, I want to tell you that no, love alone cannot sustain a relationship. Love cannot conquer all.

The blast happened around 8:45 am local time (0145 GMT) at the police compound in Medan on Sumatra island during morning roll call. “For now, we believe he was a lone wolf,” national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta. “The anti-terror squad and forensics unit are still examining the crime scene,” he added. At least 6 people were wounded in the blast, including 4 officers and two civilians, but their injuries were not severe, he added. The attacker – whose identification listed him as a student – wore an explosive device on his body, but Prasetyo did not say what kind of bomb was used. A bloody corpse lying in the compound’s parking lot appeared to have been blown apart. Police said the attacker was active on social media, while CCTV footage showed him entering the compound wearing a uniform worn by drivers of a popular ride-hailing service. The attack came a day after Indonesia launched a website that lets the public report “radical” content posted by government workers, including material that promotes hate or intolerance. The Southeast Asian nation of some 260 million has significant numbers of religious minorities — including Christians, Hindus and Buddhists — who have been targeted by radical Islamist groups amid concerns about rising intolerance. Police stations have also been a frequent target of militants, some of whom have called for the pluralist country to become a strict Islamic state. In August, authorities shot and arrested a militant who attacked officers at a station in Indonesia’s second-biggest city, Surabaya, while in June another was seriously wounded when he tried to blow himself up outside a police building on Java island. Last month, Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered beefed-up security after two militants from an Islamic State-linked terror group stabbed his chief security minister.  He survived the attack, which led to the arrests of dozens of terror suspects. The attackers were identified as members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an extremist network loyal to ISIS and responsible for several previous attacks — including deadly suicide bombings at several churches in Surabaya last year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/243290-indonesian-president-taps-election-arch-rival-defense-minister/","title":"Indonesian president Jokowi taps election arch-rival for defense minister","date":"Oct 24, 2019 12:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Jokowi unveils his new cabinet at an informal presentation, with more than 3 dozen new ministers in eye-catching batik shirts sitting in front of the imposing neoclassical columns of the Merdeka Palace","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesian President Joko Widodo Wednesday named his election arch-rival – a former general accused of abuses – as defense minister, a move which dismayed human rights activists. Widodo unveiled his new cabinet at an informal presentation, with more than 3 dozen new ministers in eye-catching batik shirts sitting in front of the imposing neoclassical columns of the Merdeka Palace. Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, beat Prabowo Subianto in April elections to secure another term as president of the world’s third-biggest democracy. His victory followed a bitter campaign plagued by mudslinging, fake news online and claims from Subianto that the government staged a “massive, systematic and fraudulent” election, which sparked deadly post-poll riots. At least 9 people died in the unrest. But the pair have since appeared together in public, and this week Subianto, 68, hinted that he and another member of his Gerindra opposition party were tapped for top government posts. Announcing Subianto’s new role, Jokowi said: “I believe I don’t have to tell him about his job – he knows more than I do.” Online, Subianto supporters cheered the appointment. “They used to compete but now, together, they’re going to build this country,” said one. “We appreciate Prabowo for being big-hearted enough to be willing to help Jokowi for the progress of the nation.” ‘Dangerous for democracy’  Amnesty International Indonesia earlier warned against appointing the former general, saying it would mark “a dark day for human rights”. Subianto, a former son-in-law of Indonesia’s late dictator Suharto, was commander of the notorious Kopassus special forces. He was accused of abuses – including the kidnapping and disappearance of several pro-democracy activists – in the lead-up to massive street demonstrations that brought down the regime in 1998. Subianto however has never been charged in relation to the allegations. Subianto lost the presidential race by a whisker in 2014. But the ex-general faced an uphill battle against Widodo 5 years later. During the 2019 campaign, Subianto came out as a fiery nationalist who courted Islamic hardliners and promised a boost to military and defense spending, and accused Widodo of selling the mineral-rich country to foreign interests, including China. Critics feared that – if elected – he might try to roll back 20 years of democratic reforms, including direct presidential elections. “This is dangerous for Indonesian democracy,” said Arya Fernandes, a researcher at the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, referring to Subianto being tapped for a powerful cabinet post. But Jokowi’s decision was likely aimed at keeping an old rival and his party in check, said Syamsuddin Haris, a political analyst at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. “Picking him means that he would have full support from (Subianto’s) party,” Haris said. “It means minimizing the political noise.” Among Jokowi’s 38 ministers, former World Bank managing director Sri Mulyani Indrawati was picked to serve another term as finance minister, while Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi kept her post. Nadiem Makarim, 35, co-founder of ride-hailing startup Gojek, was chosen to be education and culture minister. This week, Makarim announced his resignation from running a firm valued at some $10 billion. Media mogul Erick Thohir – a former owner of Italian football club Inter Milan – was appointed minister of state-owned enterprises. However, fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti – a popular chain-smoking, tattooed politician known for blowing up illegal fishing ships caught in Indonesian waters – was not picked to continue in cabinet. Wiranto, a 72-year-old former army chief, also did not return to cabinet as chief security minister. Islamic State group-linked militants this month staged a failed assassination attempt on the powerful politician, who is recovering in hospital. Jokowi and his Vice President Ma’ruf Amin were sworn-in at a heavily guarded weekend inauguration ceremony amid fears of another attack. Indonesia, the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation, has long struggled with Islamist militancy. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/243072-puv-drivers-random-drug-tests-october-2019/","title":"Random drug tests for PUV drivers ahead of Undas 2019","date":"Oct 21, 2019 9:11 PM PHT","snippet":"The Land Transportation Office also intensifies roadworthiness and terminal inspections in preparation for Undas","body":" MANILA, Philippines – To keep both travelers and motorists safe during Undas, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) is activating on Tuesday, October 22, Oplan Biyaheng Ayos: Undas, which will include random drug testing for public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and conductors before they leave their terminals. “Bago mag-drug test, kailangang i-surrender ng tsuper ang kanyang lisensya. Kapag nagpositibo sa drug test, agad na kukumpiskahin ang lisensya niya upang hindi na makapag-drive sa pagkakataong iyon,” LTO chief Edgar Galvante said in a statement. (Before undergoing the drug test, the driver will need to surrender his license. If the drug test turns out positive, his license will be confiscated immediately so that he won’t be able to drive right in that instance.) PUV drivers and operators with confiscated licenses will need to take a confirmatory test. If they test negative, their license will be returned. If they test positive, their license will remain confiscated until it is proven that the drugs have been flushed out of their system.  In the past, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board also eyed drug testing for PUV drivers and operators after it was discovered that ride-hailing services were used to deliver illegal drugs. LTO enforcers will also be deployed for Oplan Isnabero, an initiative that aims to apprehend abusive taxi drivers and other PUV operators. When it was launched in 2016, Oplan Isnabero aimed to apprehend taxi drivers who do not give change to passengers, refuse to convey passengers, and do not properly use taxi meters, among others. Preparations for Oplan Biyaheng Ayos: Undas began on Monday, October 21, which included intensified motor vehicle roadworthiness inspections and bus terminal inspections. These will determine if vehicles are fit to operate during Undas season. If a vehicle fails the inspection, the owner will either be advised to assemble or replace damaged parts, or keep the vehicle parked in their garage. The LTO also promoted road safety and law compliance through seminars and brochures for drivers and operators, in cooperation with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group.  Thousands are expected to travel to and from provinces for All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day on November 1 and 2. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/242978-new-motorcycle-taxi-firm-joyride-set-challenge-angkas/","title":"New motorcycle taxi firm JoyRide set to challenge Angkas","date":"Oct 20, 2019 4:10 PM PHT","snippet":"While the prospects for competition may seem bleak this year, new motorcycle taxi firm JoyRide ramps up preparations ahead of its official app launch","body":" MANILA, Philippines – New motorcycle ride-hailing firm JoyRide may soon challenge Angkas, even as the industry navigates legal hurdles to operations.

With worsening congestion in the metro, Filipino commuters became fond of Angkas because of the “opportunity to beat traffic.” JoyRide acknowledged this reality, but it presented the idea of market competition. “The motorcycle taxi industry was able to offer a temporary reprieve, but even that is teetering on the edge of decline because of the lack of market competition,” the firm said in a statement. Legal hurdles The prospect of competition among motorcycle ride-hailing companies, however, may seem bleak this year. In May, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allowed the 6-month pilot operation of motorcycle taxis, with Angkas as its sole partner to gather data. The DOTr’s intention is to collect data that will be used to draft a bill to legalize the industry. The pilot implementation will end December this year. Currently, Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. This is the reason why Angkas faced legal hurdles in its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) In 2018, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board stopped accepting applications for transportation network companies’ accreditation. (READ: Will Indonesia ride-hailing giant Go-Jek enter PH?) Industry stakeholders are hoping a law to legalize motorcycle taxis would be passed in the 18th Congress. At the Senate, 4 senators have already filed their own versions of the motorcycle-for-hire bill – Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto, Senator Grace Poe, Senator Juan Edgardo Angara, and Senator Imee Marcos. At the House, 14 lawmakers have filed their own bills, too. All these are still pending in the chambers’ respective transportation committees. Congress is on break and will resume session on November 4. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/242572-undeniable-transportation-crisis/","title":"[OPINION] Our undeniable transportation crisis","date":"Oct 17, 2019 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"'Heroic' commuters are prone to imagining moving abroad, where there is higher quality of life, and you can't blame them","body":" There’s been a transportation emergency engulfing the Philippines for decades, and administrations of whatever political color haven’t done much about it.

Spokesman’s commute challenge: a mere one-way, one-day stunt It was a stunt, nothing more. Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo took several jeepneys and a motorcycle from New Manila to the presidential palace for only one day and one way. He left at 5:15 am and arrived at 8:46 am. That’s a 3.5-hour ordeal. The only reason he arrived at 8:46 am is because a motorcycle rider offered him a ride and media vehicles were following him. If he’d stood in line for the MRT or LRT, he would’ve arrived way past 9 am. Merely saying people should wake up earlier and commute earlier is not a solution – it’s an out-of-touch statement.

Property developers have built very tall condo buildings near schools and universities because they know they have a captured market – rich or well-to-do parents whose kids (or themselves) cannot afford to be late. What the rest do: the ‘heroic’ commute Tiis na lang (Just put up with it). What else can the majority do? It’s not like most can buy a car tomorrow, as those cost hundreds of thousands of pesos plus gas and maintenance. It’s costly to use ride-hailing apps all the time. Taxi drivers still reject riders, and not everyone would want to hop on a motorcycle. With ensnarling traffic, the rest wake up very early and hope for the best. But there’s no work-life balance. In desperation, others even opt for unsafe, improvised transportation like trolley riding. As a London School of Economics professor said, “Their patience in the face of long commutes is nothing short of heroic.” ‘Heroic’ commuters: OFWs in the making  If you’re a low-paid staffer or laborer who has to wake up at 4 am just to reach your workplace by 8 am by public transport, and who then has to fight it out with other commuters later in the day to get home by 9 pm, you’d be wondering if there’s an alternative.  Manila (and Cebu) traffic triggers low quality of life. As a parent working hard for the family, for instance, you won’t see your kids as much whether you drive or commute. You’re stuck in traffic, just talking to them on chat apps. You’re not able to tutor your kids in the evenings because you’re still on the road. Direct parenting is delegated to a grandparent, in-law, or nanny because you can’t be at home in the early evening. That’s low quality of life. (READ: Patients die as Manila traffic jams block ambulances) “Heroic” commuters are prone to imagining moving abroad, where there is higher quality of life, and you can’t blame them. Traffic is just getting worse, the population is expanding, and roads cannot be built fast enough. The government only plans, but has no will. You don’t want to be exposed forever to blaring horns, drivers kicking and screaming, privileged officials with police escorts, kotong (extortionist) cops, etc. OFWs and Manila traffic When you go abroad, talk to Filipino OFWs about Manila traffic. It’s a good icebreaker. The OFW will certainly have an opinion or would say how they are thankful they don’t have to deal with it anymore. If you’re an OFW reading this, did your daily commute improve from how it was back in the Philippines? It likely would have. I drive 19 miles (30.5 kilometers) one-way daily to two elementary schools and then to work, with the only heavy traffic at the school drop-off points. We wake up early, but at just the right time. This one-way daily commute takes 50 minutes – such a far cry from my 2.5-hour daily ordeal from Quezon City to Makati City years ago.

We’re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.” Facebook unveiled plans in June for Libra – which will roll out in 2020 – to be backed by a basket of currency assets to avoid the wild swings of Bitcoin and other virtual units. The non-profit Libra Association, based in Geneva, will oversee the blockchain-based coin. Facebook envisions Libra as a new global cryptocurrency, pledging to deliver a stable virtual money that lives on smartphones and could bring over a billion “unbanked” people into the financial system. “The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard,” Disparte said. “Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else.” Mastercard, Visa and other financial partners enlisted to oversee Libra are reportedly having second thoughts as regulators unleash ire on the project and dig for information from members of the association. Other Libra backers include ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber. The head of the association said last week that the project’s leaders aimed to “reassure” regulators worried about the virtual money.  In leaked comments from a meeting of Facebook employees in July, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he remained optimistic about Libra despite harsh comments from public officials in several countries. “The public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic,” he said. “But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often, are more substantive and less dramatic… That’s where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things.”  Cook’s view In an interview published Friday in French newspaper Les Echos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said he was uncomfortable with the idea of a company taking over roles typically reserved for governments. Without specifically naming Facebook, Cook said issuing currency, like national defense, is best left to states. Facebook and some two dozen partners released a prototype of Libra as an open source code for developers interested in weaving it into apps, services or businesses. Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, questioned whether Libra would be able to fulfill its vision. In particular, Libra will need to comply with regulations that require collecting personal information about customers in order to expose crimes such as money laundering or fraud. “It is not clear to me that Libra is anywhere near being able to perform those know-your-customer requirements that would allow them to legally serve these communities,” Chorzempa said. “Libra would have to work with governments to make sure they are compliant or get those rules changed, and that is a difficult process.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/241691-malaysia-threatens-grab-multimillion-dollar-fine/","title":"Malaysia threatens Grab with $21-million fine","date":"Oct 3, 2019 5:05 PM PHT","snippet":"The Malaysia Competition Commission proposes fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company's competitors","body":" KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Malaysia’s competition watchdog on Thursday, October 3, threatened to hit Grab with a $21-million fine for practices that allegedly reduce competition, the latest problem for the ride-hailing giant. Grab is the biggest ride-hailing firm in Southeast Asia, and has strengthened its hold on the market since buying US rival Uber’s operations in the region last year.  But the Singapore-headquartered firm has come under scrutiny from regulators in several countries due to concerns about its dominant position.  The Malaysia Competition Commission proposed fining Grab almost 87 million ringgit ($21 million) for preventing its drivers from providing advertising services for the company’s competitors. This had the effect of “distorting competition” by creating barriers to Grab’s rivals, it said. “It is important that barriers to entry for new players remain low, and for existing players to have the ability to grow and compete on merits to ensure that competition can remain healthy,” said Iskandar Ismail, the watchdog’s chief executive. In addition, a daily penalty of 15,000 ringgit will be imposed should Grab fail to take action to address the competition concerns. Grab has 30 days to respond to the watchdog, after which a final decision will be made. The company said they had complied fully with competition laws and were “surprised” by the proposed fine. “We believe that it is common practice for businesses to decide upon the availability and type of third-party advertising on their respective platforms,” a Grab statement said. Last year, Singapore fined Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/241573-ltfrb-surprised-crash-victim-did-not-receive-aid-from-grab/","title":"Grab crash victim: I have not received any financial aid","date":"Oct 2, 2019 4:46 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Grab denies this allegation, showing a check for around P166,000, which it issued and was received by the victim's uncle","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Three years after riding a Grab taxi that was involved in a collision – claiming the life of her best friend and severely injuring her – Karen Graneta said she had not received a single peso of financial assistance from the ride-hailing company. Graneta narrated the events of that ill-fated day during the Senate committee for public services hearing on Wednesday, October 2, regarding the Philippine Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Families. Grab denied this allegation two days later, showing the media on Friday, October 4, a photo of the check they issued to help with Graneta’s expenses.  At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Graneta said the accident occurred on September 27, 2016 at Nagtahan (now Mabini) bridge when 3 trucks collided with the Grab taxi that she and her best friend were riding in. They were trapped inside the car for almost an hour, leading to the death of her best friend. Meanwhile, Graneta was hospitalized for 6 months, undergoing 4 operations in the first 5 months. Graneta said she had aspent more than P3 million for her medical expenses. All throughout her ordeal she never received any financial assistance from Grab. “Talagang nagpapakahirap po kaming maghanap kasi syempre hindi naman po kami ganun kayaman para magkaroon ng ganyan kalaking amount (We’re really struggling because we don’t have that kind of money),” she said. ‘We were told assistance was extended’ Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Martin Delgra III was surprised by this revelation, saying they were told that assistance was extended after the crash. “I’ll have to take it up with Grab as to what happened with this incident,” he said. Delgra said they followed protocol after the accident and told Grab to assist the victim immediately regardless of who was at fault. He added that they issued a show-cause order to Grab because even if the taxi driver was not at fault, it was still a public utility vehicle that has obligations to its passengers. As per LTFRB regulations, a passenger is entitled to an insurance coverage of P100,000 for injuries.  Senator Grace Poe said she would also follow up with Grab regarding the incident. The committee on public services, which Poe heads, is lobbying for the creation of  a National Transportation Safety Board that would probe crash incidents.  On Friday, October 4, Grab denied Graneta’s allegation, saying their representative personally visited Graneta’s family to know how they could be of assistance and that they had issued a check worth around P166,000 to Graneta’s uncle, Roel Capuno. Graneta on Monday, October 7, refuted this, saying the money her family received came from an organization of taxi drivers, but she refused to give anymore details, as advised by her lawyers.  The ride-hailing company provided a picture of the check that was received by Capuno on behalf of Graneta. The account name indicated “MyTaxi.ph Inc,” the company of Grab.  The demand for damages based on the quasi-delict case filed by Graneta against Grab 3 years ago is pending in court. – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/241079-solutions-manila-traffic-part-2/","title":"[OPINION] Part 2 | Solutions to Manila’s carmageddon","date":"Sep 28, 2019 4:00 PM PHT","snippet":"What can we do to cope?","body":" (In the first part of this two-part series, the author discusses the factors that contribute to Metro Manila’s hellish traffic and how it affects the public. Read Part 1 here.) So what can we do to cope with traffic? Allow me to share some tips based on my observations and personal experience. For the commuter Drivers Use Waze. Waze is an amazing mobile app, which was probably designed with Manila in mind. You should have this by now if you have a smartphone. For every data you provide, you help other motorists get to their destination more quickly. My favorite feature is its ability to suggest best times to leave. But it has its flaw: it is sometimes unable to detect roadblocks, detours and one-way streets. It is not human, after all. Listen to podcasts and audiobooks. Turn off the radio and fill the airwaves with the sound of wisdom. Traffic is lost reading time, so this is a great way to catch up. Just download the Podcast app (for iPhone) or Spotify. If you are an entrepreneur, you will love Masters of Scale by Reid Hoffman, Startup by Gimlet or Business Wars by Wondery. I would recommend Work Life by Adam Grant and the New Yorker Radio Hour episode featuring Robert Caro to CEOs and executives. The Tim Ferriss Show, Against The Rules by Michael Lewis and Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History are my favorite indulgences. Dan Carlin’s 5-part “Wrath of the Khans” on the history of Genghis Khan is a humdinger. I have a few leadership audiobooks, but I prefer the long form interviews given by successful people. Tim Ferriss’ interviews with Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, talent manager Shep Gordon and die-hard Muhammad Ali fan Cal Fussman stand out – you will laugh out loud while maybe thinking out loud. Carpool (when possible). Do give a ride to people you trust, when you must. However, do not feel obligated especially when your schedules do not really align and when they show signs of tardiness. You will get into trouble. Check your car. I have mentioned earlier what it felt like to feel helplessly stuck behind a car that broke down. I do not want to be that guy who failed to have his carburetor checked. Everyone is busy so let us try to be respectful of their time by being more responsible. Pack food and water. “Hangry” is not good. Skip the bad mood and load up on nuts, power bars and popcorn that will keep for a while in your car for those unexpected delays in the highways. Be nice. This should go without saying, but this is the Philippines, where the “I want it now” mindset prevails, even on the road. Drive courteously – you are not the only one in a hurry. And please, signal left or right when you want to switch lanes. Those levers exist for a reason. Non-drivers See first two tips under “Drivers.” Take the train. I used to take the MRT from Quezon Avenue station up to Ayala for over a year, and for a few months to Taft, circa 2000. And at that time, I would already be waiting at the Quezon Avenue station by 5:30 am. I can only imagine how challenging it must be for train commuters today, especially during rush hour. I would still recommend taking the train during lean times, because it really is a faster mode of transport, without the fear factor of Angkas. When the MRT Line 7 opens, there is a stop quite near where I live. It would be awesome not to have to drive for a change, even for just a short distance. Use a ride-hailing service. I take Grab frequently, but I must say there is room for improvement. There are times when I have to wait 30 minutess to get a ride. That is not very helpful when moving from one meeting to the next. I do not think I have the courage yet to ride an Angkas motorcycle, but in times of dire emergency, it would be good to have as an option. Use waiting sheds. I notice that warm bodies tend to cluster in areas outside of waiting sheds, such as Commonwealth near Don Antonio, or the corner of EDSA and Ayala Avenue. This mad rush to get on the bus is not helping anyone. It eats up a sizable portion of the road, causes traffic, and offends those who are waiting in the designated area. For the new resident So you have decided to call Metro Manila your home. Congratulations are in order – you are one brave soul! If you are moving from a cosmopolitan area, then traffic should be familiar to you. Traffic is traffic, only worse in Metro Manila. So the best way to cope is to live near your place of work. If you can afford a driver, get one. Local wages are affordable compared to other countries. Live like a royal for a change, even if the carriage is moving slowly. And if you have somewhere important to get to, always leave early. For the employer I would like to think that the work paradigm has begun to shift in the Philippines, no small thanks to traffic. Working 9 to 5 is still the norm, but that seems to be changing. People are spending too much time away from their families, so as a society, we need to find ways to keep them in their homes much longer, and as far away as possible from cars to help lessen the congestion. They are needed at home and at the office, not on the road. This bill sponsored by Senator Joel Villanueva amends Article 83 of the Labor Code of the Philippines to accommodate work duration beyond 8 hours per day but not exceeding 48 hours per week. When signed into law, companies will be allowed to implement a 4-day work week based on the mutual agreement between the employer and the employee. I can tell that our legislators are listening, because this is evidence that everyone is feeling the pain. A simple reorganization of tasks is all it takes to make this work: the employee can do all her meetings in the 4 days that she is physically present at work, and then do the writing and thinking that requires quiet time and minimal distraction at home, maybe even while doing the laundry or roasting the chicken. Multi-tasking at its finest (and most effective)! Employers should carefully observe the outcomes. Do check if they are effective and adjust where necessary through experiments (see the third tip below). Jobs vary in different industries, so I would assume daily wage earners in manufacturing firms will have to stick to the status quo. But for consulting firms, advertising agencies, financial institutions and government offices, there is room for flexibility. After briefly going over the Labor Code, I was able to validate that having to work from 9 am to 5 pm is a myth. What the law states is that employees must meet the required 8 hours of work everyday, which could be 7 am to 3 pm, or 8 am to 4 pm. For example, HR employees who live in Novaliches/QC who work in Makati should consider taking a 7 am to 3 pm shift, during their low season. This assumes that they do mostly administrative work and not a lot of meetings. In that case, they can come to and leave work earlier, and not have to compete for scarce space in the utility vans (UVs), and endure EDSA rush hour traffic. By doing that, we could help eliminate rush hour once and for all, by spreading out vehicle congestion throughout the day. CEOs should be open to flexible work arrangements, particularly for high-performing staff. To determine their viability, try experimenting with an employee by requiring an increase in daily output (say, 4 designs rather than the usual two a day) in exchange for a 3-days-a-week work schedule. It is very likely that the staff will deliver, especially if the 3-day arrangement is giving her a much-needed reprieve from traffic and quality time with her children.  For the employee I previously mentioned the mental, emotional and physical toll of traffic on us, which should be obvious to many of you who come home to your families drained with nothing left, on a daily basis. I used to be that person, and that was the worst version of myself. It took some time for me to believe that I deserved better, that life wasted on a busy road is not for me, and that there are workarounds to this crisis. If you believe that you have done well for yourself, and have contributed significantly to the success of your company, then ask for more time from your boss, if that is what you want. If given a choice, I would personally choose more time than money because it will help ensure improved health (i.e. more sleep, better habits) and better performance. No job is worth losing my health over, but that is just me. If you are single, you do not need much to get by, unless you do not intend to just get by and would like to have your own business. If you are married with kids, and struggling to make ends meet, ask your boss for a more flexible work arrangement so you can also manage the household and get started on a part-time business. There are many options around, especially online. (If you would like to know more, send me a private message on LinkedIn. I conduct workshops on entrepreneurship for non-entrepreneurs, non-profit employees and volunteers, and families of OFWs.) Sharpening the saw should be a lifelong commitment. There is nothing to gain by spending our “free time” while waiting for the P2P bus watching Stranger Things or stalking your crush on Facebook. See the second tip under “Drivers” for podcast recommendations. There is much to learn from people who are more successful than us, and in podcasts, they are very generous with their ideas. And we need to grow ourselves if we want to be good at business and at work. Waiting time is not free time. It is lost time. Let us use it productively. In the end, you might surprise yourself: all those practical learnings from the podcasts and real-life experience running your own part-time business will carry over to your job. Your values will shine through. Upgrading your skills will make you more committed to success, and your boss will love you. If not, then maybe it is time to grow your online business, earn enough to replace your day job, fire your boss, and move on to greener pastures. For the entrepreneur There is real opportunity in the chaos that is traffic, and I think this is the best time to be an entrepreneur. I honestly do not think I would go this route (I have a consulting practice and a wellness distribution business) if not for wasted time in the car. But goods still have to be delivered and prospects have to be met, so there is still no escaping traffic. Here are some ideas that have worked for me to help ease the burden: I have had two short-lived assistants. They were helpful in managing my databases and drafting some copy. The downside is, they are also new graduates looking for “real” work in a corporate setting. Tim Ferriss’ The 4-Hour Work Week comes to the rescue, at the most opportune time. He recommends hiring a virtual assistant from a company, not an individual, so that in case of sudden absence, the work can still be completed. Brilliant. I am still open to hiring local assistants, possibly stay-at-home moms, because they are just as allergic to traffic as I am. We shall see. I am open to anything that will help me achieve more. I still do personal deliveries, especially for my top clients, but props to Lalamove and Grab for creating the motorcycle delivery alternative. I have become an avid user. I certainly approve of more motorcycles on the road (though they can be a safety hazard) because they have a smaller carbon footprint, though as a car driver in near-death clashes I might regret that statement. If your business is entirely offline, you may want to consider creating a website to attract more customers. It is definitely easier to build a website now complete with domain hosting and payment functionalities than before. I use Wix and I got set up in a less than an hour. Facebook and Instagram are also very useful in building trust (Note: Building trust, not selling products. Everyone wants to buy, but no one really wants to be sold to – thanks Chris Guillebeau).  For the concerned government agencies Calling the MMDA, Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group, and the Department of Transportation. I know you are doing your best. If you are open to more suggestions, I think we need better driver skills which can be addressed through more rigorous driver aptitude tests. Can we also do something about common sense alternatives in local governments? Here’s an example: the traffic lights at BGC do not make sense. If I am on the rightmost lane, and the light is green, why is the pedestrian lane I am approaching also a go? Come to think of it, I have a list of strange traffic rules. How about you? For the legislator And finally, I appeal to our lawmakers to echo more loudly the people’s silent rage. We all hate traffic, and what it does to our society, and I know you feel it too. It is hard to move forward, as a country, with this pain point constantly holding us back. In conclusion, allow me to share some ideas I have thought about which I hope will help mitigate our collective suffering: I am not a lone wolf crying out in the wilderness. The groundwork by other legislators and concerned citizens has already been laid. I only ask that you (re)consider them. “There are no traffic jams along the extra mile.” – Roger Staubach I hope he is right. – Rappler.com Mai Mislang is a non-profit consultant and musician.

Earlier this month, France’s economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned that under current circumstances Libra posed a threat to the “monetary sovereignty” of governments and could not be authorized in Europe. “As citizens, we should be celebrating the fact that our regulators are asking these types of questions,” Perez told a conference. Officials have also raised concerns about how the currency would be regulated, particularly how it would comply with regulations about combatting money laundering and financing of terrorism.  “Today, we are carrying out a normal course of work with regulators to show them that, in terms of anti-money laundering, the (Libra) system will be at least equivalent to the conventional monetary system,” Perez said.  Besides Facebook, backers of Libra include payment giants Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, as well as ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber. The non-profit Libra Association, which currently has 28 members, is set to expand, as “well over 100” companies and organizations have expressed an interest in joining the project, Perez said.  Facebook has promoted Libra as an opportunity to provide online commerce and financial services at minimal cost to more than a billion “unbanked” people – adults without bank accounts or those who use services outside the banking system such as payday loans to make ends meet. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/241132-grab-partners-with-microsoft-digital-literacy-initiative/","title":"Grab partners with Microsoft for digital literacy initiative","date":"Sep 26, 2019 5:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The partnership is meant to upskill millions of Southeast Asians for the new digital economy","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Grab on Tuesday, September 24, announced a regional partnership with Microsoft for an initiative that looks to equip people and businesses from Southeast Asian countries with the needed digital skills to thrive in fast-growing economies and pursue careers in technology.  The flagship initiative was launched under the ride hailing company’s new social impact program called Grab for Good. “One of the challenges we see in Asia Pacific is the democratisation of education. We believe education should be accessible to everyone, specifically, tech and digital literacy,” said Andrea Della Mattea, president of Microsoft Asia Pacific. “This encourages ingenuity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, all of which are key to the future.” Grab claims that over 6.6 million workers across the 6 major Southeast Asian countries are going to require reskilling by 2028. Approximately 41% of that number reportedly lack relevant IT skills that new jobs will demand. To narrow the digital skills gap, Grab and Microsoft are combining their resources and ecosystems to fulfill their shared vision to make the economic opportunities in technology accessible for people in Southeast Asia. They aim to train a total of 20,000 people in the region by 2025. There are 3 ways the partnership plans to achieve this. One is by partnering with select universities across the region to train students with technical skills that are in demand by industry. Microsoft will provide the learning materials, curriculum, and certifications, as well as Azure for Education, a platform that provides students access to developer tools for applications; while Grab will facilitate learning experiences such as hackathons and internships. Grab has yet to announce which schools they partnered with. Another way is by providing Grab driver partners access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification program, which has basic courses covering topics such as computer basics, using the Internet, and productivity software. The driver can be awarded a Microsoft certification for free upon completion of the course. These will all be available in the driver’s Grab app. Grab and Microsoft will also help drivers interested in pursuing a career in tech by letting them enroll in a practicum-based curriculum developed by the nonprofit organization Generation: You Employed, or receive certification in Microsoft proprietary courses. Those who will graduate will have opportunities to work for Grab and Microsoft partner companies in technology-related roles. “If the private sector actively creates programs for local communities, technology can be within reach for many, and the learning of new skills can immediately improve the livelihoods for many more people in Southeast Asia,” said Anthony Tan, CEO of Grab. Meanwhile, Grab plans to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs running mom-and-pop shops by digitizing their business and having them integrate the platform’s services so they can reach a bigger market. They also plan to provide them economic access through loans and lending services that can give them the capital they need to scale their business In the Philippines, Grab will start with Jollijeep mobile food stalls by offering them access to GrabFood food delivery and GrabPay cashless payments to help them grow and compete with newer restaurants. The project is expected to kick off within the year and will be expanded to other traditional and home businesses moving forward. The other flagship initiative that was announced is called “Break the Silence”. It looks to champion inclusivity by offering differently-abled people such as those who are deaf and the hearing-impaired an opportunity to earn their own income by becoming a Grab driver partner. At the event, Grab announced they will expand the initiative to Indonesia and Singapore and enhance it in countries where it’s already running – like Thailand and Malaysia. The company currently has over 500 deaf driver partners on the platform and plans to double this number over the coming year. The initiative currently cannot work in the Philippines as the Land Transportation Office does not issue professional driver’s licenses to people who are deaf or have other disabilities. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/239977-france-to-block-development-facebook-libra/","title":"France will block development of Facebook Libra cryptocurrency","date":"Sep 12, 2019 8:14 PM PHT","snippet":"France wants to block the development of Libra because it says it threatens the 'monetary sovereignty' of governments","body":" PARIS, France – France warned Thursday, September 12, it will block development of Facebook’s planned Libra cryptocurrency in Europe because it threatens the “monetary sovereignty” of governments. “I want to be absolutely clear: in these conditions, we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil,” Bruno Le Maire said at the opening of an OECD conference on virtual, cryptocurrencies. Facebook unveiled in June its plans for Libra in an announcement greeted with concern by governments and critics of the social network behemoth whose reputation has been tarnished by its role in spreading fake information and extremist videos. Expected to launch in the first half of 2020, Libra is designed to be backed by a basket of currency assets to avoid the wild swings seen with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Another major difference is that control over it would not be decentralized but entrusted to a Swiss-based non-profit association.  Besides Facebook, backers of Libra include payment giants Visa, MasterCard and PayPal as well as ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber. French officials have been vocal in their warnings about the danger Libra poses since plans for the virtual currency were announced, and Le Maire kept up the pressure at the Thursday meeting. “The monetary sovereignty of countries is at stake” from a “possible privatization of money…by a sole actor with more than 2 billion users on the planet,” he said. One concern was the possibility that the currency could help people abandon national currencies in times of crisis, complicating the efforts of a government to manage the economy. Facebook has promoted Libra as an opportunity to provide online commerce and financial services at minimal cost to more than a billion “unbanked” people – adults without bank accounts or those who use services outside the banking system such as payday loans to make ends meet. Libra, and the new Calibra digital wallet that would go with it, promises eventually to give Facebook opportunities to build financial services into its offerings, offer to expand its own commerce and let more small businesses buy ads on the social network. But officials have raised concerns about how the currency would be regulated, particularly how it would comply with regulations about combatting money laundering and financing of terrorism. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/239890-uber-trims-more-staff-seeks-route-profit/","title":"Uber trims more staff as it seeks a route to profit","date":"Sep 11, 2019 6:45 PM PHT","snippet":"San Francisco-based Uber is cutting about 265 people from its engineering group and another 170 or so jobs from its product team","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber on Tuesday, September 10, said it was laying off about 8% of its product and engineering teams as the smartphone-summoned ride service tries to map a route to profitability. The San Francisco-based company is cutting about 265 people from its engineering group and another 170 or so jobs from its product team, a spokesman told Agence France-Presse. While a fast-growing startup, ranks of Uber employees swelled to more than 27,000 employees around the world and the time had come to shift gears and cut ranks for efficiency, according to the company. “We’re making some changes to get us back on track, which include reducing the size of some teams to ensure we are staffed appropriately against our top priorities,” the Uber spokesman said. “Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day – ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility.” Uber planned to continue to hire top technical talent, but with a focus on “lean, exceptionally high-performing teams,” the spokesman added. In July, Uber cut 400 jobs from its marketing team of more than 1,200 workers to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi a month earlier had tightened his grip on the wheel at the ride-hailing firm following a bumpy stock market debut. After debuting in May at $45 for the initial public offering – translating to a market value of $82 billion – Uber shares went into reverse.  Uber shares gained a little ground on Tuesday, up nearly 4% to $33.51 at the close of the formal trading day on Wall Street. Uber shares tumbled last month after the leading ride-share company reported its loss eclipsed market expectations in the 2nd quarter of this year. The company said revenue grew 14% to $3.2 billion, but it lost $5.2 billion as compared to losing $848 million in the same period last year. Stock related compensation expenses took a huge bite out of its revenue, the company said. While the firm has lost billions since offering its first rides in 2011 in its home city of San Francisco, it envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. The company has moved into electric bikes, trucking, and scooters, as well as meal deliveries, and has a long-term project on flying taxis. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/238958-china-executes-ride-hailing-driver-who-killed-passenger/","title":"China executes ride-hailing driver who killed passenger","date":"Aug 30, 2019 11:11 PM PHT","snippet":"Didi Chuxing has been slammed by critics and China's transport ministry over safety lapses after the incident in the eastern city of Wenzhou in August 2018, barely 3 months after a similar death","body":" BEIJING, China – China on Friday, August 30, executed a man convicted of raping and killing a female passenger last year while he was working as a driver for ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, China’s omnipresent answer to Uber. The company has been slammed by critics and China’s transport ministry over safety lapses after the incident in the eastern city of Wenzhou in August 2018, barely 3 months after a similar death. Zhong Yuan, 28, had racked up gambling debts and was planning to rob a passenger before the fatal attack on the 20-year-old woman, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. “The criminal means (employed) were extremely cruel and the consequences of the crime are extremely serious,” the court in Wenzhou said in a statement on its official Weibo microblog, while announcing the sentence. Didi Chuxing has admitted it failed to act on a complaint about the same driver from another passenger, who said Zhong had driven her to an isolated location and followed her in his car after she left the vehicle. The incidents prompted the firm, which says it has 30 million drivers and more than 550 million users across its various services, to overhaul its safety procedures. It has suspended its car-pooling service, which links up commuters travelling in the same direction, and rolled out an SOS button and a itinerary-sharing function. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/238874-grab-new-in-app-feature-safety-center/","title":"Grab doubles down on safety through new in-app ‘Safety Center’","date":"Aug 29, 2019 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing platform invests at least $20 million to work on safety for its users","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines wants to bring its safety incidents down to zero through a newly-launched in-app Safety Center announced on Thursday, August 29. The Safety Center is a centralized access point that contains all of the app’s safety features. Through this button, passengers will be able to share their ride details, report safety concerns, ask for emergency assistance, and review safety information.  After reporting a safety issue, the passenger will receive a digital response within 30 minutes, and a resolution period of two to six hours. When immediate action is needed in transit, passengers could also be connected to proper authorities. Grab has already partnered with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group for crime prevention and accident response. Grab Philippines President Brian Cu said that the safety center is a continuation of their Safety Everyday Tech Roadmap which was initiated in 2018. It wasn’t brought about by any uptick in criminality. Rather, it was a move to strengthen their safety proposition.  “We went back to our roots and said ‘why did we launch Grab?’ It was safety, convenience, speed. So convenience we sort of solved, speed we fixed the algorithm, safety… was part of the process, but it wasn’t part of the business that we really invested in as much as we did in fixing the algorithms, fixing the speed,” he said. They decided to put in ‘real budget’ for safety development. Cu said they have invested at least $20 million on engineering support, feature development, and insurance to improve the app’s safety. Aside from this new feature, Cu said they are also looking for more women drivers. This is to increase the likelihood of matching women passengers to women drivers so harassment incidents can be reduced. Cu also clarified that drivers go through gender sensitivity training when they get onboarded.  “We take safety very seriously, from onboarding partners all the way up to while they’re in the app. So it’s a bunch of retraining on safe driving, retraining on gender sensitivity, even retraining with partners such as the Highway Patrol Group and even with some health partners as well,” added country marketing head RJ Cabaluna. The Safety Center feature will be fully integrated and available in the app on Friday, August 30. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/238743-grab-investment-vietnam-august-2019/","title":"Grab to invest $500 million in Vietnam","date":"Aug 28, 2019 2:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing firm Grab is making a fresh investment in Vietnam for new services and expansion of existing offerings","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing giant Grab said on Wednesday, August 28, it will invest $500 million over 5 years in Vietnam, the company’s latest expansion in a key Southeast Asian market.  The Singapore-based firm has grown rapidly since it ended a bruising battle with Uber last year by buying its US rival’s ride-hailing and food operations in the region. Grab, which operates in 8 Southeast Asian countries, has already invested more than $200 million in Vietnam since entering the market in 2014.  The fresh investment will be used for new services in areas such as financial technology and logistics, as well as expanding existing transport, food, and payment offerings. With a population of around 100 million, Vietnam is among the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia.

In a news briefing on Thursday, July 4, Ariel Inton of the Lawyers for Community Safety and Function said that the transport holiday is “for the sake of the TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Service) community and the riding public.” “It’s a holiday in the sense that every organization will have a different mode of action. Some will hold vigils, conduct a caravan…. But one thing is sure: hindi sila papasada (they will go offline),” Inton said. Inton apologized in advance to commuters and explained the reason for the transport holiday. “Ginagawa lang nila ito dahil darating ang panahon na kung mananatili ang mga pahirap policy na iyan, wala tayong masasakyang TNVS dahil malulugi ang negosyo,” he added. ([TNVS operators] are doing this because there will come a time when we won’t be able to ride TNVS vehicles because businesses will suffer if these oppressive policies are maintained). TNVS groups have not provided a total number of vehicles scheduled to go offline on Monday as of posting. But they assured that “majority” of their 45,000 members under the umbrella group TNVS Community Philippines will participate on Monday. Ride-hailing drivers lament the LTFRB process of applying for franchises, saying that the application for the certificate of public convenience has become “more difficult.” Drivers and operators said that the additional requirement on “bank conformity” and the “proof of financial capacity” made it harder for them to secure a franchise. Dominant ride-hailing app Grab Philippines said on Thursday that it will encourage the drivers to “show utmost restraint” with their actions, but they would respect their right to free speech and peaceful assembly. “We urge our TNVS partners to show utmost restraint before taking actions that could negatively impact the ability of passengers to book rides,” Grab spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “We recognize the TNVS partners’ right to free speech and peaceable assembly.

In a press briefing on Thursday, June 13, Angkas regulatory and public affairs head George Royeca said they are retraining their bikers to comply with the government guidelines until the end of the month. “All of our biker-partners go through rigorous riding skills assessments, written tests, and extensive safety training to ensure they meet very high safety standards,” Royeca said. Of the 27,000 Angkas drivers in the system, 15,000 have yet to be retrained. Angkas said it is “hopeful” that the process would be completed by the end of June. Prior to the pilot run, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) raised concerns over teh safety of passengers of motorcycle taxis, apart from the legal issues hounding the service. “We fail over 70% of applicants to make sure that only the most capable bikers ferry passengers for Angkas,” Royeca said. Royeca said they will not be adding new units within that period. Apart from the safety tests, Angkas bikers will now be identified with special reflectorized vests with side straps that passengers can hold on to during the ride. The vests will also have the biker’s unique ID number so that users are ensured that only officially registered bikers can take bookings.  Angkas operations head David Medrana said that all bikers and passengers will still be covered by insurance for every ride, just as their practice before. The DOTr said the data from the pilot implementation will be used in drafting the bill on legalizing motorcycle taxis. “Hopefully, after the 6-month pilot run, the law to regulate motorcycle taxis can already be passed,” Medrana said. Currently, Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. This is the reason why Angkas has been facing legal hurdles in its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) In December 2018, the DOTr created a technical working group to flesh out these issues but maintained that there is a need to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code or pass another law that would allow it.

At its Uber Elevate Summit, the company said it had regulatory approval to begin tests of delivering food by drone in the region of San Diego, California. “Our goal is to expand Uber Eats drone delivery so we can provide more options to more people at the tap of a button,” said Luke Fischer, head of flight operations at Uber Elevate. “We believe that Uber is uniquely positioned to take on this challenge as we’re able to leverage the Uber Eats network of restaurant partners and delivery partners as well as the aviation experience and technology of Uber Elevate.” For logistical reasons, the drones will not deliver directly to customers, but to a safe drop-off location where an Uber Eats driver will complete the order. In the future, Uber hopes to land the drones on parked vehicles located near each delivery location to allow the final delivery by hand. Uber said it had developed a proprietary airspace management system called Elevate Cloud Systems that will guide the drones to their location. While not the first food drone delivery service, Uber is aiming for a potentially large-scale service through its food service partners across the United States. Initial testing in San Diego was done with McDonald’s, and will be expanded to include additional Uber Eats restaurants later this year. The drone service is part of Uber’s move to the skies as it seeks to develop an aerial ride-sharing network tied in with its smartphone app to help people avoid traffic congestion on the ground. Uber said the drone service will provide data that will help manage its air network, and eventually allow the aircraft to operate autonomously. New autonomous car Separately, Uber unveiled its newest self-driving vehicle produced by Volvo Cars. The Volvo XC90 prototype will be “capable of fully driving itself,” according to an Uber statement, with  sensors atop and built into the vehicle to allow it to operate and maneuver in an urban environment. “Working in close partnership with companies like Volvo is a key ingredient to effectively building a safe, scalable, self-driving fleet,” said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber signed a deal in 2017 with Volvo, which is owned by China’s Geely, to produce “tens of thousands” of self-driving cars for a fleet of autonomous taxis. Volvo said it will use a similar autonomous base for the introduction of its first commercially available autonomous drive technology in the early 2020s. This week, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he does not expect fully self-driving vehicles to be deployed for at least 15 years, but that autonomous features will be gradually introduced and that some “easy” trips may be made autonomously. Uber also unveiled the latest versions of its electric bikes and scooters that round out its shared transportation system. – Rappler.com Have your food delivered using this foodpanda voucher code to get P200 off your meal."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/232792-grab-philippines-colorum-drivers-deactivated-since-start-2019/","title":"Grab: 15,000 ‘colorum’ drivers deactivated since start of 2019","date":"Jun 11, 2019 5:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines president Brian Cu appeals to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to 'find ways to quickly increase the number of drivers'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines on Tuesday, June 11, said that some 15,000 drivers have been deactivated from its platform since the start of the year. During a hearing held by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said that of the supposed 8,000 drivers who were told that they will be removed from the platform by Monday, June 10, only 5,000 were deactivated. “As of yesterday, there were around 5,000 drivers who were deactivated because [they don’t have] documentation. They weren’t able to submit proof that they walked through the LTFRB process in securing a provisional authority (PA) or a certificate of public convenience (CPC),” Cu told reporters in a press briefing after the hearing. The remaining 3,000 were able to submit proof to Grab that they are in the process of applying for a PA or CPC. To lawfully operate, drivers and operators need to secure a PA – the initial authorization – and then a CPC. On top of the 5,000, the ride-hailing firm also removed some 10,000 drivers from January to May this year, bringing the total deactivated units to 15,000. Cu said during the hearing that they did this to ensure that there are no “colorum” vehicles on their platform. “This is really because of a regulation that we need to comply with. We have been wanting to comply with this regulation that TNVS (transport network vehicle services) should have [a] PA or [a] CPC to operate,” Grab Philippines spokesperson Nicka Hosaka said. “But we find it difficult to enforce because we do it manually. We talked to them one by one. We reached out to them,” she added. To ensure that there will be enough drivers despite the deactivation, Cu said they will roll out a new incentive scheme. “If there will be 10 cars that drive an extra hour, then it would supplement. It covers the hours lost [due to deactivated vehicles]. Over the next few weeks, we’re trying to structure out incentives and promos to be able to do that,” he said. More cars needed In a separate statement on Tuesday, Grab urged the LTFRB “to find ways to quickly increase the number of drivers.” On Monday, the LTFRB opened 10,000 new slots for the application of a TNVS franchise. All slots were already filled up that day. “If LTRFB will allow the deactivated drivers to resume work while it processes the application of 10,000 new drivers, that would be the best win for the Filipino people,” Cu said in a statement. Grab is now left with around 40,000 drivers. Before the deactivation, it had served only 60% to 65% of the total bookings daily. Grab urged the regulatory board to maximize the 65,000-franchise cap, to be able to allocate more cars to passengers. With the deactivation of “colorum” vehicles, Cu said passengers will bear the brunt of the inconvenience. “This inconvenience will be felt even after the 10,000 new slots, as twice that number is necessary to provide the 70% allocation rate they said they (LTFRB) want to maintain,” he said. But Cu said fares will remain the same, to comply with the conditions set by the Philippine Competition Commission over the March 2018 buyout of Uber’s operations.

Grab deactivated some 8,000 drivers without a certificate of public convenience (CPC), which was a requirement of the LTFRB. In a press briefing on Monday, June 10, drivers enumerated the following processes which make securing the requirements to get a CPC difficult: CPC hearing process – Drivers said Transport Netwrork Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators can only be represented by either the spouse, parents, or descendants. They said this requirement affected many operators leading to dismissals and resultingr in monetary losses. “TNVS operators affected mostly are those who work abroad, doing part time for TNVS, or not based in Metro Manila,” their statement read. Drivers appealed to the agencies to allow them to issue a special power of attorney to any person they want to represent them. Bank conformity – This document is secured from banks and allow the units to be used for public transportation. “Different banks have their own processes and fees in securing this certificate,” the drivers said. Moreover, they said that this requirement was only good for companies with a fleet of cars. In the case of TNVS, most only have one car or two. “Many operators cannot comply, some banks will ask for thousands of pesos in fees, plus an increase of monthly amortization,” the drivers said. Instead of a bank conformity, they proposed getting a commercial insurance of their choice to still protect the interest of the banks. Proof of financial capability – The LTFRB increased this requirement 233% to P50,000, from P15,000. Drivers said this is hard for many small entrepreneurs.  “Many have no savings of P50,000, and it is only now that they are able to save…. We pray for the board to recompute the amount that is fair for small businesses,” the statement read.

Police checked the identification cards of every tourist and commuter leaving the subway near Tiananmen Square, the site of the pro-democracy protests that were brutally extinguished by tanks and soldiers on June 4, 1989. Foreign journalists were not allowed onto the square at all or warned by police not to take pictures. Officials told one reporter that “illegal media behavior” could impact visa renewals. Washington – deep in a bruising trade war with Beijing – marked the occasion by hailing the “heroic” movement of 1989. In Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 but retains a degree of autonomy, thousands of people were gathering Tuesday night for a candlelight vigil tinged with symbolism as the city struggles to preserve its cherished freedoms. The Chinese Communist Party made sure the anniversary remained a distant memory on the mainland, detaining several activists in the run-up to June 4 while popular livestreaming sites conspicuously shut down for “technical” maintenance. Searches by Agence France-Presse (AFP) for the term “Tiananmen” on the Twitter-like Weibo platform on Tuesday displayed the official logo of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China. Over the years, the party has censored any discussion of the protests and crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly more than 1,000 people, dead – ensuring that people either never learn about what happened or fear detention if they dare discuss it openly. The party and its high-tech police apparatus have tightened control over civil society since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, rounding up activists, rights lawyers and even Marxist students who sympathized with labor movements. Countless surveillance cameras are perched on lampposts in and around Tiananmen Square. “It’s not that we don’t care. We know what happened,” said a driver for the DiDi ride-hailing service who was born in 1989. “But how can I tell you, the DiDi app is recording our conversation in the car,” he said. “But today’s China has changed. If you have money you have everything. Without money you dare not open your mouth.” It was largely business as usual at Tiananmen on Tuesday: Hundreds of people, including children waving small Chinese flags while sitting on their parents’ shoulders, lined up before dawn to watch the daily flag-raising at the square. But the line moved slowly due to extra security – with IDs matched on facial recognition screens – and dozens were unable to watch the event. When asked whether it occurred to her that she was visiting the square on the 30th anniversary, a nursing school graduate in her 20s from eastern Shandong province said, “What do you mean? No, it didn’t cross my mind.” Her mother chimed in: “We don’t think of that past.” ‘Heroic protest’ But there were rare public acknowledgements of June 4 this year. China’s defense minister, General Wei Fenghe, on Sunday, June 2, defended the crackdown as the “correct” policy to end “political turbulence” at the time. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sharply disagreed on how China has evolved as he praised the “heroic protest movement” in a statement for the anniversary. “Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed,” Pompeo said. He also denounced the “new wave of abuses” by China, including the mass incarceration of Uighur Muslims in the northwestern Xinjiang region. China dismissed Pompeo’s comments as “lunatic ravings and babbling nonsense.” His statement “maliciously attacks China’s political system, denigrates the state of China’s human rights and religious affairs, wantonly criticizes China’s Xinjiang policy and severely interferes in China’s domestic affairs,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. The exchange added to tensions between Washington and Beijing, already locked in a bitter economic dispute that has impacted two-way trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars. In an apparent escalation, Beijing on Tuesday advised Chinese travelers to exercise caution in the United States, citing crime and police harassment. The European Union added its voice to criticism of the official amnesia over Tiananmen. “Acknowledgement of these events, and of those killed, detained or missing in connection with the Tiananmen Square protests, is important for future generations and for the collective memory,” said a statement from EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the anniversary was a reminder to the self-ruled island that freedom and democracy are “valuable.” ‘Beyond our expectations’ In spring 1989, students and workers gathered  at the symbolic heart of Chinese power to demand democratic change and an end to corruption, inspiring protests across the country. After 7 weeks of demonstrations, the government deployed tanks and soldiers who chased and killed demonstrators and onlookers in the streets leading to Tiananmen Square on June 4. “To open fire on people, that was beyond our expectations,” Wang Dan, who was a 20-year-old protest leader in 1989, told AFP in a recent interview. And the quieting of dissident voices continues: Among the string of activists recently detained or “disappeared” are 6 artists who had put up an exhibition titled “A Conscience Movement” in the eastern city of Nanjing. Separately, folk singer Li Zhi, who had performed songs about Tiananmen, was reportedly missing, with his music and accounts on Chinese social media no longer available. “There is no reason to be optimistic for China now if you look at what’s happening,” another Tiananmen protest leader, Zhou Fengsuo, told AFP in New York. “Even ‘1984’, the novel, couldn’t go that far.” – Rappler.com    "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/232166-grab-philippines-to-deactivate-drivers-june-10-2019/","title":"Grab to deactivate 8,000 drivers by June 10","date":"Jun 3, 2019 7:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Filipinos can expect longer booking time and price surges, as Grab is set to deactivate some 8,000 drivers for failure to comply with LTFRB requirements","body":" MANILA, Philippines – There will be fewer Grab cars on the streets by June 10, as the ride-hailing company will deactivate at least 8,000 transport network vehicle services (TNVS) partners.

This alternative, however, doesn’t mean carpooling or hailing rides on Grab or Angkas. Aldrin Pelicano, 35, turned to biking in 2014, cycling from his home in the eastern side of Pasig City to Ortigas Center to “improve his quality of life.” “Nagsawa na ko (I got tired of public transportation),” Pelicano told Rappler. “I’m a father of two kids who decided to bike commute, because it made my life so much better,” he said. Those living in the East know just how bad the state of public commute it is there. “East Ortigas” – as they call that side of the city now – is the gateway to Rizal and serves as an alternative route for those going to Marikina City or Antipolo City. During rush hour, jeepneys are overloaded with some 3 or 4 passengers seated on benches in the middle of the vehicle, while about 4 males hitch at the back apart from the fare collector. Of course, the buses are already packed too. This was Pelicano’s daily commute then. Most of the time, he would be one of those males hitched at the back of the jeepney enduring his 4-kilometer ride. “Palaging sabit. Palaging siksikan. At lagi akong late. Ang trabaho ko, 8 am, pero darating ako 9 am. Pero ang lapit-lapit lang. Kung walang-wala na talaga akong masakyan, nasubukan kong maglakad. Nakakapagod,” he told Rappler. (I always hitch. I always fit my way through. And I’m always late. My work starts at 8 am but I arrive at 9 am. If you think about it, it’s really near. If I can’t find a ride, I walk. It’s very tiring.) This brought him to start a daily journey pedaling through metropolitan Manila’s traffic, which eventually inspired him to share to his learnings online.  Making the shift The sorry state of public transportation, the undignifying commute, and the desire to spend more time with his son and daughter pushed Pelicano to shift to bike commuting. “I only rode a bike once in my life, perhaps during high school, but not for commuting. I didn’t have a bike. I didn’t really bike. Naglakas loob lang ako (I just took the courage to do so),” he said. After finally deciding to make the shift, Pelicano, who worked as a program manager in an Australian firm then, said he looked up for groups in Facebook to read about biking. He started reading about folding bikes, which for him, would “make sense” as he wanted to be able to bring it inside the building where he works. In August 2014, he joined the Facebook group of Tiklop Society of the Philippines (TSP), a non-profit organization that aims to “promote the use of folding bikes as a means to better oneself and achieve cleaner air and more liveable cities,” according to its description. “I went one Sunday morning during their monthly general assembly. The people were nice and so I was encouraged to finally do it. I bought a bike,” Pelicano said. Before braving the metro’s vehicular traffic, Pelicano posted on Facebook who can accompany him on his first bike commute to Ortigas. “Sabi ko lang, ‘Pwede ba magpasama? Kung taga-Pasig kayo, magpapasama akong mag-commute. So one guy, si Christian, taga-Pasig din siya. And he works in Tektite. So ‘yung route na dinaraanan niya, sa Julia Vargas Avenue. Sinamahan niya ako once lang,” he shared. (I just asked, ‘Can somebody come with me? If you’re from Pasig, I would like to ask if you can accompany me to [bike] commute. So one guy, Christian, he’s also from Pasig. And he works in Tektite. So his route was along Julia Vargas Avenue. He biked with me once.) ‘Not bike-friendly’ During his first months bike commuting, Pelicano tried to avoid pedaling along other motor vehicles on the streets. Since he’s coming from the eastern side of Pasig, Pelicano had to cross C5 Road to reach Ortigas. He said he could’ve just biked through the U-turn slot across Tiendesitas to reach the central business district. But he didn’t. “Hindi ko pa kayang tumingin pagilid. So ang ginawa ko, binibitbit ko yung bike ko sa footbridge sa may Shell, tapos baba, at bike sa Julia Vargas Avenue. Lagi ako sa kabilang side. Counterflow ako every morning,” Pelicano said. (I couldn’t check my view sideways. So what I did was, I carry my bike up to the footbridge near Shell, and then go down, and then bike again along Julia Vargas Avenue. I always ride at the other side. I do counterflow every morning.) The road condition along Doña Julia Vargas Avenue wasn’t as great at that time too. Pelicano said that the asphalt overlay was an issue because it leaves a gap between the old and the new one, making the road uneven. He said it could be dangerous, as bikers might slip. Another challenge was that the building where he used to work wasn’t friendly to bike commuters.  In 2011, the Pasig City government passed an ordinance promoting bike use. It also ordered private establishments to install bicycle parking racks within their premises. Since there weren’t any bike racks at the office building, Pelicano had to park their bikes at a particular corner where all the other bikes are. Whenever he would bring his smaller folding bike to work, he would have to use the service elevator from the basement to reach the floor where he worked. “One time, I had to squeeze my way in the service elevator. The building manager got mad at me and since then he didn’t allow me to bring my bike in the office. I felt really bad,” he said. In November 2016, Pelicano switched jobs which made him report to work in Makati. This meant additional kilometers for him. From his daily bike commute of about 6 kilometers, it’s now about 13 kilometers. Intermodal commute was not ideal too, as city buses don’t have compartments where he can place his bike. “Sabi ng wife ko, kapag umayaw ako, eh paano ‘yung ibang manong, araw-araw? I realized ‘yung iba, wala talagang choice. ‘Yung iba gamit pa nila surplus bikes lang. So sinabi ko, kakayanin,” he told Rappler. (My wife told me, that if I give up, what about the older men who bike everyday? I realized, others didn’t have a choice. Some even use surplus bikes only. So I said, I can do it.) MNL Moves Pelicano was the brain behind the Facebook page “MNL Moves,” where he shares tips on bike commuting, reviews on bicycle parts, or urban planning proposals that would benefit bikers. He started the page in December 2017 when he was working on his Masters’ thesis for Urban and Regional Planning at the University of the Philippines. “I read a lot of literature for my thesis and I thought, ‘Why don’t I just post it? Just so I can share my learnings?’ That’s how I started it,” he said. As of writing, MNL Moves is followed by over 3,600 people and reaches over 200,000 people. With the hopes of “paying it forward,” Pelicano shares videos of his ride, to serve as a guide to other people who want to explore biking in those areas. {source} <div class=”flex-video widescreen”> <iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fvideos%2F1933942196727752%2F&show_text=0&width=560″ width=”560″ height=”315″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allowFullScreen=”true”></iframe> </div> {/source}   As a licensed urban planner, Pelicano posts about low-cost interventions that the government can easily implement. One of them is “bike boxes.” According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, these are designated areas at a signalized intersection “that provides bicyclists with a safe and visible way to get ahead of queuing traffic during the red signal phase.” Pelicano’s idea is for these to be painted at signalized intersections so bikers are easily identified. “If there are bike boxes, it would greatly help bike commuters. At least they would know where they should go at signalized intersections, especially when they want to take a turn. Motorized vehicles will have to wait until the cyclists have safely crossed to the other side,” he told Rappler. In one of his many posts about it, Pelicano shared his frustration about a comment, saying that “vehicles should be prioritized.” “We got a long way to go Metro Manila. And it’s not even about bicycle policies and infrastructure. It’s about building a culture of bicycling, and walking, and/or other means of sustainable mobility,” he said in a post on October 2018. {source}<iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fposts%2F1770051726439210&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”623″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe>{/source}   In a recent post, Pelicano shared about a government official who would not buy his proposal of painting bike boxes, after explaining its benefits. {source}<iframe src=”https://web.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.facebook.com%2Fmnlmoves%2Fposts%2F2066545556789824&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”794″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allow=”encrypted-media”></iframe>{/source}   Building a culture All of these challenges are easily managed if biking is a priority in the Philippines, but it is not – at least not yet. For Pelicano, it takes a village to realize that. “It’s really about building a culture. Of course, it starts with the self and eventually finding a community that can support you,” he told Rappler. Government support is important too, he said, noting the experiences of other countries such as Netherlands that gives a premium on biking than other modes of transportation. National and local governments launched initiatives in the past to promote biking in the country. But some initiatives seemed to be a band-aid solution to the lack of bicycle infrastructure in the country, with some bike lanes painted right in the middle of a sidewalk. In some areas, it seemed like lip service, with some bike lanes blocked by electrical posts or trees along the road.  The Department of Public Works and Highways pledged to build more bike lanes across the country, incorporating this to new infrastructure projects. In February, DPWH opened a protected bike lane along the Laguna Lake Highway. Other protected bike lanes can be found along Doña Julia Vargas Avenue in Pasig City and Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr Avenue or Diversion Road in Iloilo City too, thanks to the initiative of these local governments. In an opinion piece published on Manila Times, development economist and transport advocate Robert Siy said that it’s time for the Philippine government to support a “Bike, Bike, Bike program,” a play of words on the country’s infrastructure program “Build, Build, Build.” “More cycling will benefit all Philippine cities, big and small. Low cost, pro-poor, quick-to-implement, environment-friendly, and health-promoting! If city mayors and national officials are looking for projects that can be delivered within the next 3 years, cycling infrastructure should be high on the list,” Siy said in his column. Another expert even said that biking could also help reduce traffic congestion, as the shift would free up road space. As the online discussion pushing the government to “move people, not cars” grow louder, Pelicano still thinks that action speaks louder than words. “We want to translate our online presence into tangible and real-life actions, as we try to build better communities for ourselves, our loved ones,” Pelicano wrote in his Facebook page, inviting more people to bike to work. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/232035-expert-provincial-bus-ban-worsen-metro-manila-traffic-congestion/","title":"Expert says provincial bus ban to worsen Metro traffic congestion","date":"Jun 1, 2019 11:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Transport economist Jedd Ugay says that if MMDA wants to reduce traffic congestion, the effect of the provincial bus ban is the 'total opposite'","body":" MANILA, Philippines –  Implementing the ban on provincial buses along EDSA would only worsen traffic congestion, an expert said. In an interview with Rappler, transport economist Jedd Ugay said that the provincial bus ban is not economical and would push Filipinos to shift to a more “unsustainable” mode of transportation. “In macroeconomics, alighting at the terminal is an additional unnecessary trip kilometers. It will cause more traffic for everyone,” Ugay said. “The government should look at the bigger picture, not only improving traffic flow, but reducing the vehicle volume. The best way to reduce that is to shift people from using private vehicle to more sustainable modes of transportation which is public transport,” he said. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is set to close provincial bus terminals along EDSA this June and has since prohibited the said drivers to drop off passengers along the main thoroughfare in a bid to “reduce traffic congestion.” The new policy would force commuters to alight at an interim terminal in Sta Rosa, Laguna and the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange for those from the South, and another interim bus terminal in Valenzuela City for those from the North. That’s where commuters should ride the city buses and jeepneys that would bring them to their desired destinations, the MMDA earlier said. But Ugay said that if the traffic agency aims to reduce traffic congestion with this policy, the effect of the ban is the “total opposite.” “If your aim is to reduce traffic congestion, this is not what you should do. You have to reduce every trip kilometer generated per commute,” he said. “Once you reduce convenience of commuting, you’re discouraging people to use public transport and rather have them bring their own private vehicles, which again, would result to more private vehicles on the road,” he added. Longer commute With the MMDA policy, commuters aired their frustration online, saying that the ban is “anti-commuter.” Bicol lawmakers even filed petitions before the Supreme Court to stop the implementation of the policy, arguing that it is “utterly oppressive and unfair.” Ugay echoed the same sentiment that commute will be longer as an additional “trip kilometer” is generated. “For example, I’m going to ride a bus in Batangas and I want to go to Makati. Instead of going directly to Makati, I still have to ride again at an interchange. There’s still waiting time to buy a ticket and then boarding the vehicle. Instead of having a shorter trip, it became longer. If the terminal is farther to your destination, you would have to backtrack that additional trip kilometers,” he added. Ugay, a former project development officer at the Department of Transportation, explained that the policy does not match the “origin-destination pattern” of commuters. “Normally for people, hindi lang naman point-to-point ang gusto niyang puntahan (they don’t always want to travel point-to-point only). Although it might serve a fraction of the total population, but they still want to board from somewhere in the middle of the route and alight in the middle too,” he said. According to MMDA, there are 12,000 buses in Metro Manila, 8,000 of which are provincial buses. The remaining 4,000 constitutes the city buses. “There are more costs with this ban. You have to add congestion, pollution, chance for road accident, fuel cost or fare, and the most expensive of all, the time costs; when you board another vehicle from the terminal to your destination,” Ugay said. Public vs private In a previous interview with Rappler, MMDA spokesperson Celine Pialago defended the policy saying that only 3% of the total vehicle volume count will be affected by the ban. “MMDA is looking from a vehicle perspective, but you have to compute the number of people using the buses and the economic benefit of that. Private vehicles has more share of road space along EDSA but they only carry less people, as compared to buses,” Ugay said. In Albay 2nd district Representative Joey Salceda’s petition before the High Court, he said that the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is “expected” to give thousands of permits to the following vehicles: On top of that, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines is urging the LTFRB to open 15,000 more slots for franchise applications. But increasing the road share of private vehicles and two stop off points would benefit less commuters, Ugay said. “You need to increase the throughput of a road. For example, a lane can carry 2,000 vehicles but if you change the occupancy of each vehicle, that’s how you can move more people,” he said. Next steps? For him, the government should focus on more sustainable policies. Ugay said that the improving public transportation would definitely push more people to commute. “Travel time and safety are the top things people think during commute. If you won’t get late because of commute, you are more enticed to make the shift to use public transportation. People are willing, but they don’t want to wait,” he said. While infrastructure and rehabilitation works on public transportation are on the way, Ugay said that the government should also focus to making the roads bike- and pedestrian-friendly. “Improving sidewalks and providing bike lanes are easy and quick to implement. Once people see that these are prioritized, more and more people will use bikes too. It would use up less space and not as dangerous as cars in terms of road safety and don’t emit pollutants,” he said. Ugay is also a co-founder of Alt Mobility, a group that promotes sustainable transportation. One of Alt Mobility’s platforms is the Facebook group “How’s Your Byahe, Bes?” (How’s your travel, friend?), which brings lively discussions on commute, policies, and anything related to transportation. “Let’s try to reduce the number of vehicles by making them shift to public transport, walking, or cycling. If you improve walkability in an area, you also reduce the number of trips there,” Ugay said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/231519-grab-7th-year-promos-freebies-2019/","title":"Grab celebrates 7th year with P7-M promos, rewards","date":"May 25, 2019 7:57 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines will also launch carpooling services within Makati and Ortigas zones in June, and between those zones in July","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab is celebrating its 7th year anniversary in business giving away P7 million worth of promos, discounts, and rewards on its platform.

Shares will be priced at $45 for the initial public offering (IPO), valuing the startup at more than $82 billion, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. San Francisco-based Uber was set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the eponymous ticker “UBER” in one of the largest initial public offerings in the tech sector. Despite the eye-popping valuation, Uber dialed back some of its earlier ambitions for a value exceeding $100 billion after a rocky start for US rideshare rival Lyft. Analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said Uber has the potential to be a game-changing company and “is paving a similar road to what Amazon did to transform retail/ecommerce and Facebook did for social media.” Ives said Uber has the potential to grow as it morphs its ridesharing platform into a more diverse set of services with Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and self-driving vehicle initiatives. “We view Uber’s conservative pricing as a smart and prudent strategy coming out of the box as it clearly learned from its ‘little brother’ Lyft, and the experience it has gone through over the past month,” Ives said in a note to investors. Risks to new model But some of the risks surrounding Uber and its rivals were highlighted Wednesday, May 8, as thousands of drivers turned off their apps in a US-wide strike over pay and working conditions. The strikes targeting Uber and its US rival Lyft highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange with some signs reading “Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.” Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber said in a securities filing Thursday that it had reached agreement with a large majority of the roughly 60,000 drivers contesting their status as independent contractors and who had instituted arbitration proceedings against the firm. The company anticipates the total cost of the individual settlements, combined with attorneys’ fees, will fall between $146 million and $170 million. Uber maintained it was sticking to its plans on how it classifies drivers. “Our business would be adversely affected if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors,” the company said. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry predicted that Uber will eventually have to raise ride prices, causing its customers to seek other options. Uber will be raising up to $9 billion in the offering being underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and other large banks. Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft, which has lost more than 15 percent of its value since its March offering. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to more than 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train, then grab an e-bike or e-scooter to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/230128-dotr-allows-6-month-angkas-motorcycle-taxis-pilot-operations/","title":"DOTr allows 6-month pilot operations of Angkas, motorcycle taxis","date":"May 10, 2019 7:01 AM PHT","snippet":"The Department of Transportation sets the fare that motorcycle taxis should charge, as well as safety requirements that should be provided by the drivers or operators","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Transportation (DOTr) approved pilot operations of motorcycle taxis for 6 months in a bid to study further the legalization of the service. In a statement early Friday, May 10, the DOTr said they issued a guideline on the pilot implementation, which was signed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade on Wednesday, May 8. “Patunay ito na nakikinig ang gobyerno sa publiko. Patunay ito na bukas ang aming mga isip. Noong Disyembre ay inatasan natin ang pagbuo ng TWG (technical working group), at itong general guidelines ang bunga ng mga pagpupulong na iyon,” Tugade said. (This is proof that the government listens to the public. This is proof that we are open-minded. In December, we ordered the creation of a TWG, and these general guidelines are the result of those discussions.) Based on the document, the service will be rolled out in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu one month after the secretary’s approval, or on June 8. The DOTr has set the fare that motorcycle taxis should charge, as well as safety requirements that should be provided by the drivers or operators.    The pilot operations should run on a ride-hailing app, according to the guidelines. The DOTr said the data that will be collected from the pilot operations will be used when drafting the bill on legalizing motorcycle taxis. The pilot implementation will be done in partnership with motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas. Currently, Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow motorcycles to be used for hire or for transport. This is the reason why Angkas has been facing legal hurdles in its operations. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) Guidelines For the pilot implementation, the DOTr has set the fare for the two areas. In Metro Manila, P50 is the base fare for the first two kilometers (km) of the ride. An additional P10/km will be charged for succeeding kilometers up to 7 km. Beyond 7 km, there will be an additional charge of P15/km. {source} <iframe title=”Metro Manila motorcycle taxi fare” aria-label=”Short Table” id=”datawrapper-chart-KWwXH” src=”//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KWwXH/1/” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ style=”width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;” height=”250″></iframe><script type=”text/javascript”>!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var e in a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.getElementById(“datawrapper-chart-“+e)||document.querySelector(“iframe[src*='”+e+”‘]”);t&&(t.style.height=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][e]+”px”)}})}();</script> {/source} In Metro Cebu, the base fare for the first kilometer is much cheaper at P20, but the additional charge up to the succeeding 8 km will be P16/km.

The DOTr has given the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board the power to change the fare matrix or to revise the surge cap. Meanwhile, below are the safety requirements included in the guidelines:  The DOTr said that riders should not drive for more than 10 hours. They are also asking for operators to have an accident insurance. Legalization up next? The DOTr said that certain key performance indicators were set by the department in studying the viability of motorcycle taxis for transport. The accident threshold was set at 5% of the total rides. If this figure is met, the TWG will conduct an emergency meeting to investigate the situation and decide whether to suspend the pilot operations. The DOTr will also look into violations of traffic policies, as well as commuter feedback. Senators earlier urged the DOTr to just issue a department order that will allow the operation of motorcycle taxis for hired transport, similar to what they did to ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber before. In December 2018, the DOTr created the TWG to flesh out these issues but maintained that there is a need to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code or pass another law that would allow such. In the 17th Congress, the House of Representatives passed on 3rd and final reading House Bill 8959 or the Motorcycles-for-Hire Act. Its counterpart measure in the Senate, Senate Bill 2180, already passed the committee level. The DOTr said the safety of passengers is the top priority during this test run. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride)  “Pangunahing responsibilidad natin ang kaligtasan ng publiko.

But he insisted that SoftBank would still work with the Kingdom “to help them in their continued efforts to reform and modernise their society”.

Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday giving it an estimated valuation of some $80 billion, one of the biggest tech listings in recent years but rather lower than its earlier hopes of around $100 billion. The launch will be a major milestone for the company, which has raised billions and disrupted the taxi industry in cities around the world. It will also come in the rear-view mirror of a troubled market debut for Uber’s largest US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 15% of its value since its March IPO. Strikes that took place Wednesday highlighted a dilemma for rideshare firms, which have faced challenges from regulators and traditional taxi operators for using a business model relying on independent contractors. One group protested outside the New York Stock Exchange, where Uber is set to list shares, with some signs reading “Invest in our lives – Not their stocks.” Similar actions took place in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington and in Uber’s home town, San Francisco. Protests were held in Britain as well with drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow called on to log off apps and demonstrate outside Uber offices, according to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain. Rideshare companies maintain that drivers are able to thrive and maintain work flexibility, and that their business model would not work if drivers were treated as wage-based employees. Uber and Lyft did not immediately comment on the protests. “While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or restaurant services or other similar work, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of drivers,” Uber said in a filing with securities regulators. “In particular, as we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.” Lyft shares skid Uber’s inauguration as a public company will follow a rocky market debut for Lyft. Lyft’s losses in the past quarter widened to $1.1 billion, according to its first financial report as a public company. Revenue for California-based Lyft nearly doubled from a year earlier to $776 million and the number of active riders grew to over 20.5 million. Lyft said its losses deepened as a result of $894 million in costs that included stock-based compensation and related tax expenses in connection with its IPO. Lyft shares finished the formal trading day Wednesday down 10.8 percent to $52.91. Uber last month pulled back on its ambitious valuation target, while still pricing its share offering in a range that would make it one of the largest tech market debuts in recent years. The ride-hailing firm said in a securities filing it would sell 207 million shares in a range of $44 to $50 dollars. According to a source close to the matter, Uber hopes to price its shares in the middle of that range and raise about $8 billion in fresh funding. At $47 a share, Uber would be worth just over $80 billion, taking into account stock options. The company is expected to announce pricing Thursday night. But the target – still subject to change – fell below earlier ambitions of a valuation of more than $100 billion for the firm operating in some 700 cities around the world. Uber will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “UBER” sometime next month. “We continue to view Lyft as a one-trick pony domestic ride sharing player and ‘little brother’ to Uber,” Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Daniel Ives said Thursday in a note to investors. Uber is “paving a similar road” to what Amazon did to e-commerce and Facebook did for social media, he contended, expressing confidence in the company. Amazon of transport Uber envisions becoming the “Amazon of transportation” in a future where people share instead of owning vehicles. If all goes to plan, commuters could ride an e-scooter to a transit station, take a train then grab an e-bike, ride share or e-scooter at the arriving station to complete a journey using the Uber smartphone app. Of course, shared car rides would be an option, eventually driven by computers instead of humans. Uber is also taking to the sky with an Elevate project to have electric aircraft carry people between “skyports,” taking off and landing vertically. Uber’s platform moves cargo as well as people, with a Freight service that connects truckers with shippers in a way similar to how drivers connect with people seeking rides. Uber is also seeing growing success with an Eats service that lets drivers make money delivering meals ordered from restaurants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/229691-angkas-event-poe-promise-fast-track-legal-motorcycle-taxi/","title":"At Angkas event, Grace Poe promises to fast-track legalizing motorcycle taxis","date":"May 4, 2019 8:28 PM PHT","snippet":"'Binibilisan ko, pinag-aaralan ko, para ang prangkisa na maghahatid ng mas maganda, mas mabilis, at mas affordable na transportation sa lahat, at pagkakakitaan ninyong lahat sa ligtas na paraan, ay maipasa na,' says Senator Poe","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a sea of riders, reelectionist Senator Grace Poe promised to “hasten” the passage of a bill that would allow hiring motorcycles for transport.

For me, what’s important is the safety of the public and you too.) \n\n If given the chance to head the public services committee again, Poe said she would lobby for the passage of a bill that would give the public the opportunity to choose whichever transport options there are. “Binibilisan ko, pinag-aaralan ko, para ang prangkisa na maghahatid ng mas maganda, mas mabilis, at mas affordable na transportation sa lahat, at pagkakakitaan ninyong lahat sa ligtas na paraan, ay maipasa na,” Poe said, (I will work faster and study more about it so that the franchise that would bring better, faster, and more affordable transportation for everyone that would be a source of income which is safe would be passed.) Poe headed the Senate committee on public services in the 17th Congress and handled transportation issues, particularly Angkas regulation. Earlier this year, Poe called on the Department of Transportation to hasten its efforts in regulating Angkas and habal-habal (motorcycle taxis) operations. Poe urged DOTr to issue a department order that would allow such. But the transportation department had long argued that Angkas and habal-habal are illegal, because the Land Transportation and Traffic Code prohibits the use of motorcycles as public transport. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) On Saturday, senatorial bets Bam Aquino, JV Ejercito, Chel Diokno, and retired general Ronald dela Rosa also courted the motorcycle drivers at the event.  \n\n Diokno said that the would be pushing for a magna carta for riders, if elected, while Aquino said that legislation needs to catch up with the ride-sharing economy. Quezon City 2nd district Representative Winston Castelo, another champion of Angkas at the House, also attended the event. His wife, Precious, was with him as well, She is currently running for the legislative district post. Royeca said Saturday’s event was not a political rally and that Angkas is “not endorsing anyone.” But he said that the event was a “safe and open platform” for candidates to talk about their bid. Angkas has gained popularity from the commuting public as a “cheap and fast” transport service. But its operations faced legal hurdles when the LTFRB first ordered it closed in November 2017. A Mandaluyong court allowed Angkas to hit the streets again in September 2018, but this short-lived victory was struck down by a Supreme Court temporary restraining order that allowed law enforcers to apprehend Angkas bikers if they continued to operate. Aside from the legal hurdle, transportation officials and advocates have long expressed concerns over the safety of passengers boarding motorcycles. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride)  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/229690-france-bans-electric-scooters-pavements-september-2019/","title":"France to ban e-scooters from pavements in September","date":"May 4, 2019 7:40 PM PHT","snippet":"E-scooter riders will have to use the street or dedicated cycling paths instead, 'so pedestrians are no longer squeezed against walls,' says France's transport minister","body":" PARIS, France – France will ban electric scooters from pavements in September, the transport minister said, in a backlash against a surge of the commuter gizmos invading pedestrian areas. An estimated 15,000 scooters operated by several companies have flooded the French capital since their introduction last year, a number projected to surge to 40,000 by the end of this year. Elisabeth Borne told the Le Parisien daily in remarks published on Saturday, May 4, that anyone riding an e-scooter, monowheel, personal transporter or hoverboard on the pavement would be fined 135 euros ($151) from September. Instead, they will have to use the street or dedicated cycling paths, “so pedestrians are no longer squeezed against walls,” the minister said. The development of the hugely popular personal transport vehicles “happened very fast and in a bit of an anarchic way,” Borne said. Riders will still be allowed to push them on the pavement, so long as the engine is turned off.

Berlin’s city hall has also drawn up tough new rules for e-scooters, while Spanish tourist hotspot Barcelona has banned scooter rental services completely.

If a driver goes “above and beyond,” Grab said there is a new “tipping feature” that allows the passenger to reward the driver with a 5-star rating. What are the new measures for passengers?  When a driver cancels, meanwhile, 30 GrabRewards Points will automatically be awarded to the passenger. In what instances will there be no fees?

In Japan though, Uber faces off with a company that certainly has more history than most of its rivals: Sony. The gaming and electronics giant launched on Tuesday, April 16, its own ride-hailing service called S.Ride. For the service, Sony partnered with 5 taxi companies with a combined fleet of 10,000 cabs.  Uber operates a little differently in Japan as domestic laws prevent non-professional drivers from taking in fees from passengers and alleged pressure from long-time taxi operators.  This has resulted in Uber partnering with taxi operators instead of forming its own fleet of privately driven cars as in other markets.   JapanTaxi is another local Uber rival, with a fleet of 60,000 nationwide.  Like many apps today, S.Ride offers cashless payment, which in its case, is called S.Ride Wallet. It allows passengers to pay for a ride just by scanning the QR code displayed on a backseat tablet.

The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contained no specific pricing or timing for the market debut for Uber, which according to media reports was expected to raise some $10 billion. Uber’s valuation in its latest private investment round was more than $70 billion, but reports said the ride-hailing giant was likely to seek a market value of close to $100 billion. The filing noted that Uber offers ridesharing in some 700 cities but has bolder ambitions to reshape how people and goods are transported with operations such as meal deliveries, freight, and electric bikes and scooters. “Our mission is to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion,” the document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We revolutionized personal mobility with ridesharing, and we are leveraging our platform to redefine the massive meal delivery and logistics industries. While we have had unparalleled growth at scale, we are just getting started.” Uber said it operates on 6 continents with some 14 million trips per day and has totaled more than 10 billion rides since it was founded in 2010. The filing contained a “placeholder” amount of $1 billion to be raised but that figure is expected to increase ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) expected in May. Trouble with Lyft The move comes after a lackluster market debut for Uber’s US rival Lyft, which has lost more than 10% of its value since its IPO last month. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over in 2017 as part of an effort to reform a corporate culture marred by misconduct and other scandals, said Uber has taken steps to restore its brand and credibility. “Taking this step means that we have even greater responsibilities — to our shareholders our customers and our colleagues,” Khosrowshahi said in a letter announcing the IPO. Uber and Lyft both are predicting that ride-hailing will gain even more traction with autonomous vehicles, allowing more people to give up private cars and freeing up more urban space. “We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies will enable a product that competes with the cost of personal vehicle ownership and usage, and represents the future of transportation,” Uber’s filing said. Challenges down the road Uber is the largest of the “unicorns” or venture backed firms worth at least $1 billion to list on Wall Street, and is one of the key companies in the “sharing economy” which is based on offering services to replace ownership of cars, homes and other commodities. Analysts have warned that Uber and Lyft face a difficult road to profitability amid challenges from regulators and established taxi operators around the world. Some question the business model of using independent contractors as drivers — a system which the companies say is more flexible and leads to entrepreneurial spirit. Uber’s revenue grew 42 percent last year to $11.2 billion but it continued to lose money from its operations. A net profit was reported for the year from a large asset sale, but operational losses were more than $3 billion. “Investors should be ready for a lot of volatility” in Uber, said Scott Rostan, a former investment banker who is currently an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina. “In my opinion if you are buying into Uber or Lyft you’re buying into a belief this is going to revolutionize transportation in the future. But a good business doesn’t necessarily mean a good investment.” Rostan added that both firms will be seeking to step up growth and that “i it turns into a market share fight between Uber and Lyft, profitability is going to be tough.” Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that the ride-hailing firms will face competition from other autonomous driving firms including the former Google car unit Waymo. “Lyft’s IPO was supposed to be a watershed moment for the highly anticipated 2019 tech IPO class,” Ives said in a research note. “With Uber, investors will soon have a second option to make a bet on the future of mobility and transportation with the clear market share leader, while competitor focus will likely also zero in on Waymo/Google.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/227919-uber-ipo-may-2019/","title":"Uber steers toward blockbuster IPO as road looks rocky","date":"Apr 11, 2019 12:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber's IPO could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber could become a $100 billion company with a massive share offering that will be a bellwether for tech startups looking toward Wall Street. Media reports said the ride-hailing giant is seeking to raise some $10 billion in what would be the largest stock offering of the year. That could result in a valuation close to $100 billion – an impressive figure but below some earlier estimates amid an ebbing of enthusiasm on growth and profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal said details of Uber’s initial public offering (IPO) would be released Thursday and the market debut was expected in May. The IPO comes after a lackluster response to last month’s market debut for Lyft, the main US rival of Uber. Lyft shares rose on the first day of trade and then lost ground. On Wednesday, shares were down more than 10% from the $72 offering price. The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said Uber recently provided documents showing a potential price range of between $48 and $55 a share, implying a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. These figures could change ahead of the market launch but would be below the estimated $120 billion suggested by some investment bankers, according to the report. “Even a valuation in the $90 billion to $100 billion range would represent a healthy premium to the latest private valuation (some $76 billion) in August 2018,” said Matt Kennedy of the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. “Uber will definitely be pegged to Lyft. So they can’t be too aggressive on valuation, given where Lyft is trading. Though it’s possible that some of the pressure on Lyft is related to investors looking to pick up Uber instead.” Analysts warn both Uber and Lyft will need strong growth to justify their lofty valuations, and face multiple challenges to their business model which has disrupted traditional taxi services and relies on drivers to be independent contractors. The ride-hailing firms are also investing in other “last mile” transport options such as electric bikes and scooters, and in the long run are looking to autonomous vehicles as a way to reduce dependence on private cars and reshape urban landscapes. Unicorn stampede Uber is the latest, and will be largest of the so-called “unicorns,” or venture-backed startups worth at least $1 billion, to look to Wall Street listings to expand their capital base. But some of the early enthusiasm about this unicorn herd has waned and there are hints that private investment rounds may have been priced too high. Pinterest, a virtual bulletin board that connects people with interests including food, fashion, travel and lifestyle, plans to trade under the symbol PINS on the New York Stock Exchange. Pinterest unveiled its IPO price range with an estimated valuation of some $11 billion, below the $12 billion in its most recent private funding round. Other big tech firms which could join the stampede include the business collaboration startup Slack and big data firm Palantir. (READ: After Lyft, here are 6 other tech companies planning for an IPO) Aswath Damodaran, a New York University business professor specializing in corporate valuations, calculated Lyft to be worth around $16 billion, below its the more than $20 billion at its IPO price.

The Bhumjaithai Party – meaning “Thai Pride” – is fronted by mega-wealthy Anutin Charnvirakul, an amateur pilot, son of a construction tycoon, and unlikely proponent of the medical benefits of marijuana. Thailand held its first election since a 2014 coup last month, and Bhumjaithai has emerged as a key partner after winning 39 constituency seats in the lower house and finishing fifth in the popular vote. Their campaign made waves by slapping green marijuana leaves on posters. It also touts deregulation for businesses, promotion of ride-hailing services and a 4-day work week. Thailand became the first country in Southeast Asia to approve cannabis use for medical purposes in December, but Bhumjaithai wants to allow households to grow 6 plants each in a decriminalised approach loosely based on the US state of California. “Marijuana has more positive properties than negative,” the 52-year-old told AFP in an interview in his sleek Bangkok office almost two weeks after the March 24 poll. The office has small airplane models, sculptures, and paintings of Thailand’s king and his late father. Educated at Hofstra University in New York, Anutin maintains in the hallway a collection of original signatures of US presidents dating back to George Washington. Dressed in a suit and drinking tea, the 52-year-old explained that his policies must be backed by groups looking for support in coalitions. “We have to go with the party that will accept our policies,” he said, adding that he wants people to have access to the budding industry so big corporations don’t swoop in. The choice is between the junta-backed Phalang Pracharat Party, which has clinched the popular vote, or Pheu Thai, which has formed an alliance with six other anti-junta parties and claims a majority in the lower house. Analysts have also mentioned Anutin as a possible prime minister in a grand bargain that would include his party’s loyalty. While he declined to specify which way he is leaning before full results are announced on May 9, Anutin said Bhumjaithai is looking for parties that emphasise unity, a “Thailand first” approach and reverence for the monarchy. Both of the top two parties remained tight-lipped Wednesday, April 3, on whether they had approached Anutin for an alliance. Pheu Thai is linked to self-exiled premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He was also stripped of his royal decorations on Saturday. The administration of Thaksin’s sister Yingluck was toppled in the 2014 power grab led by former army chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha. Prayut is now standing for prime minister for Phalang Pracharat. While a junta-appointed senate gets to cast votes for the top position, analysts say Phalang Pracharat still needs mid-sized parties like Bhumjaithai in the lower house to avoid a legitimacy crisis. Anutin expressed a general weariness with the bitter political divides that had crippled Thailand for more than a decade. “I don’t want partisans,” he said. “I want everyone to join in together and seek the best solution for the country.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/227314-ascent-launches-helicopter-ride-sharing-service/","title":"Startup launches helicopter ride-sharing service","date":"Apr 3, 2019 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Tech startup Ascent offers ride-sharing in the skies","body":" MANILA, Philippines – If you’re tired of the endless traffic in the metro and willing to shell out thousands of pesos, then a new helicopter ride-sharing service may be for you. On Wednesday, April 3, tech startup Ascent launched a service that offers ride-sharing in choppers, similar to carpooling. It will be run by pioneer operator INAEC Aviation Corporation. Currently, Ascent offers bookings to and from the following areas: The service, however, is not for the ordinary Filipino commuter. A ride from Makati City to BGC, which takes only roughly 3 minutes via air, costs P6,900. NAIA to Tagaytay costs P21,900 for a 20-minute flight or so, while NAIA to Clark is P25,900 for a 30-minute ride. Passengers have to log on to Ascent’s website. They may opt to book at their own time, or choose a set schedule by the firm.  Ascent founder and chief executive officer Lionel Sinai-Sinelnikoff said the firm aims to provide another solution to the metro’s worsening traffic situation. “Despite being one of the fastest growing business hubs in Southeast Asia, Manila’s traffic situation is also one of the most challenging in the region. We hope to provide a solution that is highly relevant to the current times’ economic productivity pitfalls,” said Sinai-Sinelnikoff. Ascent uses 7-seater Bell 429 and 5-seater Airbus H125 aircraft to carry commuters.  Passengers may opt for more services such as add-on luggage, on-ground guest assistance, airport transfers via helicopter, shuttle services to dedicated heliports, and corporate packages. Ascent was founded last year by Sinai-Sinelnikoff and chief commercial officer Darren Tng. It plans to expand routes to the Visayas and Mindanao later this year, and eventually around Southeast Asia. In 2015, ride-hailing giants Uber and Grab Philippines launched their respective chopper services, UberChopper and GrabHeli. Uber has since sold its entire Southeast Asia business to Grab, while the GrabHeli option is no longer available in the Philippines. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/data-stories/225782-mobile-payments-leading-philippines/","title":"Coins.ph, GCash, GrabPay, PayMaya: Who’s leading the mobile payments war in PH?","date":"Apr 2, 2019 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Take a close look at how the competition is playing out so far","body":"{source}<style>.blob-inline {margin-bottom: 5% !important;}@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {.spec-exec-logo {display: flex;align-items: center;flex-direction: column;margin-top: 5%;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/1BFEC765D7DE4956BC6776050E8CFF9E/nerve_logo.png) no-repeat;width: 110px;height: 23px;background-size: 100% auto;}.app-features {width: 100%;height: 860px;margin-bottom: -20px;}.to-cashin {width: 100%;height: 920px;}.to-cashout {width: 100%;height: 790px;}.qr-merchants {width: 100%;height: 400px;}.ewallet-accounts {width: 100%;height: 360px;}.companies {width: 100%;height: 400px;}.high-profile {width: 100%;height: 435px;}.gcash-paymaya {width: 100%;height: 220px;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {.app-features {width: 100%;height: 1100px;margin-bottom: -20px;}.to-cashin {width: 100%;height: 860px;}.to-cashout { width: 100%;height: 660px;}.qr-merchants {width: 100%;height: 300px;}.ewallet-accounts {width: 100%;height: 600px;}.companies {width: 100%;height: 310px;}.high-profile {width: 100%;height: 345px;}.gcash-paymaya {width: 100%;height: 480px;}#cover-area > top-img > div {margin-top: -5% !important;margin-right: 5% !important;margin-left: 40% !important;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/39B80443B91542A2895BE9954E52BC85/img/385D1F66100F4AE09703485E308EE5CD/2.png) no-repeat;width: 130px;height: 27px;background-size: 100% auto;}.addBlock {margin-left: -30%;display: block;}.spec-exec-logo {display: flex;align-items: flex-end;flex-direction: column;width: 100%;}#gysharebarh-225782 {text-align: right !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline {font-family: “Oswald”, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline, p.spec-exec-subhead, p.spec-exec-byline{text-align: right;}#cover-area > top-img > div > text-container > hr {margin-right: 0;width: 20% !important;height: 1px;}bg-img:before {content: ”;position: absolute;top: 0;right: 0;bottom: 0;left: 0;background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));opacity: 1;z-index: 1;}#cover-area > top-img > div {z-index: 1;}}}</style><script>$(‘#cover-area > top-img > div’).prepend(`<div class=”spec-exec-logo”><div class=”switch-image”></div></div>`);$(‘.spec-exec-headline’).html(`<span class=”addBlock”>Coins.ph, GCash, GrabPay, PayMaya:</span> Who’s leading the mobile payments war in PH?</h1>`);</script>{/source} Several mobile wallets are aiming to capture a slice of the Philippines’ payments pie. And they’re aggressively competing to be adopted by both consumers and merchants. It’ll take some time before we determine who emerges on top – right now, only a portion of the population is using e-wallets. But here’s how the competition is playing out so far. The cream of the crop Among standalone apps, GCash ranks number one on both Google Play and App Store, according to data from analytics firm App Annie. Take note that Android accounts for roughly 83% of mobile operating systems in the Philippines, so you may want to pay more attention to the Google Play column. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259176/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:400px;’></iframe>{/source}   Longtime player GCash and rival PayMaya were created by the innovation units of the country’s powerful telco duopoly: Globe Telecom’s Mynt and PLDT/Smart’s Voyager Innovations, respectively. Coins.ph, founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Hose in 2014, is a blockchain-based mobile payments startup that recently sold a majority stake to Indonesia’s ride-hailing behemoth Go-Jek. PayPal probably needs little introduction. Set up in 1998, the US firm is a pioneer that introduced the world to the idea of sending funds to anyone across the world – online. It’s also a staple secure payment method for e-commerce sites globally. Another force to contend with is GrabPay, the e-wallet embedded in the app of Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing firm. Grab tops the “Travel” and “Maps & Navigation” categories in the Philippines. App ranking is a good gauge of an app’s performance. It doesn’t just count downloads, but also factors in things like uninstalls, rating, usage, and more. However, it doesn’t give you the full picture. Other factors – such as monthly active users, transaction volume/value, competitive differentiation, financial muscle, stickiness, user acquisition costs, revenue, user experience, and so on – matter, and we’ll look into some of these later on. Same same but different First, let’s check out the compelling e-wallet models that have popped up worldwide. In emerging markets with a large unbanked population, a common model is one focused on financial inclusion. Here, an e-wallet is possibly the user’s first experience with a formal financial service, rather than a bank account. The e-wallet can perform basic functions – cash in/out, money transfers, as well as micropayments (e.g. phone credit top-ups). Then you have the ecosystem play. This e-wallet is part of an app that’s engaged in segments such as transportation, logistics, and shopping. Its users are already kind of digitally savvy, likely banked but do not necessarily qualify for credit cards. The app operator accepts cash as a mode of payment, but its e-wallet offers convenience and greater benefits. Philippine telcos kicked off their e-wallet services – GCash and Smart Money – in the 2000s with a wider financial inclusion goal. They initially offered SIM-based remittance and micro payments, making use of a vast network of agents – mostly sari-sari stores – to facilitate the transactions. This kind of remittance works this way: a customer hands a store cash, the store sends the amount via mobile phone to another store where the customer’s recipient can claim the money – also in the form of cash.  Years after introducing SIM-based e-money services, the telcos launched app versions to boost use cases and cater to the rapidly growing, digitally savvy base of smartphone owners in the country – whether they’re unbanked or banked. Coins.ph started out as a cryptocurrency exchange (buying and selling cryptocurrencies) and evolved into a suite of payments services similar to the telco apps. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/5857203A97624D1C8426325943F475E6/coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Meanwhile, GrabPay is part of the Grab ecosystem, which started with ride-hailing and branched out into more services, including courier and food delivery. Now, all these apps are aiming to transform into a third model: the lifestyle super app. Many e-wallet providers are eyeing this as an end-state, but few have been able to achieve it. Lifestyle super apps are ecosystems of services that have built an extensive base of active users – unbanked and banked – and have become indispensable in daily life. They’re not just used to pay online, but also in physical stores. Sitting on volumes of customer transaction data, these apps monetize that data by offering adjacent services like micro-loans. The greatest success stories can be found in China, where Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba-backed Alipay are used by people to pay for almost everything in the country. An outlier in the local scene perhaps is PayPal, which falls under another model that hinges on payment convenience. Largely targeting the banked segment, PayPal’s early solution stored and safeguarded bank card details, enabling users to shop on websites via their PayPal accounts without giving away those sensitive details to sellers. For sellers, the US company provided a checkout system for accepting online payments. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/1ED17AD5396F4A779AD4016924D33A9F/paypal.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, PayPal’s app works the same way, storing card details that users can use to pay other users or businesses with PayPal accounts. It can’t be used for payments in physical shops, but its balance can be transferred to other mobile wallets that are accepted by stores. What makes them stand out Though still a ways off, GCash seems to be leading the race to become a lifestyle super app in the Philippines. That’s thanks in part to its progressive and first-mover approach. Thinking that direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are the future, for instance, GCash decided to move away from sari-sari store-facilitated remittance as soon as it launched its app in 2012. The reason was simple: how do you persuade people to go cashless and digital if you don’t eliminate – or at least try to reduce – cash and human intervention in the transactions?  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/E8598F9B04734E54A88C95A1561035B6/g-cash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   While some may argue the move could mean missing out on the base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market in rural areas that’s reliant on agents for money transfers, it has allowed GCash to capture more of the urban consumers who are receptive to mobile technology and have higher-value transactions. Other moves that makes this progressive approach evident: Playing catch-up, PayMaya, which was launched in 2015, has yet to introduce such features. And its SIM-based counterpart Smart Money has maintained the biggest network of agents – 26,000 as of last count, most of which are sari-sari stores. But that’s due to the strong demand that its Smart Padala service has enjoyed from the BOP market, who are mostly located in rural areas with no stable internet connection, and still own feature phones. On the upside, this means a healthy revenue stream for Smart Money and a potential new base of users for PayMaya – if the latter successfully persuades the former’s users to migrate to the app, that is.  Nevertheless, the competition is still in its early days, and GCash and its rival camp are expected to extend well beyond their current focus segments. Moreover, both GCash and PayMaya – by virtue of being owned by the telcos – could have the strongest brand recall and consumer trust among the apps. Since Tencent, Alibaba’s chief competitor, made an investment in Voyager last year, you could say that the GCash-PayMaya battle is an extension of the war between China’s tech giants. What makes Coins.ph unique, on the other hand, is its underlying blockchain technology. What this means is it can store, transfer cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum), and convert them into pesos, helping it capture a niche. Coins.ph probably got a boost when Bitcoin prices were hitting record-highs a couple of years ago as more people got in on the action. However, the Bitcoin hype started fading as prices slumped.  While cryptocurrencies are considered volatile investments due to wild price fluctuations, blockchain has real utility for cross-border money transfer. Two reasons: it’s quick and cheap. Settlements using blockchain are instant, versus about an hour through a service like Western Union, or two to three days through banks. That’s because money transferred the traditional way goes through financial intermediaries, which are subject to strict regulation and charge fees. Blockchain keeps track of transactions using a digital ledger where entries cannot be fudged, so it eliminates intermediaries from the picture and lowers the costs (if you want to know more about blockchain, here’s a good resource). At the moment, Grab’s strength lies in ride-hailing where it has monopoly after beating Uber in Southeast Asia. On-demand transportation is a daily use case that’s hard to beat. The Singapore-based firm’s food delivery and courier features are also gaining a lot of traction among users in the region. While Grab is a frontrunner in launching financial services, including credit scoring and micro-loans, in markets like the Lion City, it’s still in the rollout phase for such services in the Philippines. This means it has to play catch-up with most of the local apps. But Grab’s regional presence also means it has economies of scale – it’s able to share costs over several markets.  {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9E230ABABC234F329B97C2DB0CED5965/grab.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   For its part, PayPal’s global payments service has become the method of choice among individuals catering to overseas clients. Next to the US and India, the Philippines’ gig economy is ranked third in the world, with more people opting for online jobs to avoid long commutes and work flexible hours. Citing data from the Global Freelancer Survey, PayPal claims that its platform is widely used by freelancers in the Philippines (92%), Indonesia (88%), and Singapore (76%). Although domestic clients opt for bank transfers, about 76% of payments from international clients are made via PayPal, the survey notes. Here’s a comparative look at most of the finance apps’ features: {source}<iframe class=”app-features” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259205/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Here are Grab’s features in the Philippines at the moment: Increasing stickiness In theory, the more services an app has, the stickier it gets since existing users have more reasons to use it (how frictionless and efficient the services are is another story). Developing new services is also a way to add users and reduce the risks posed by regulatory changes in one sector – for example, transportation. This suggests improved long-term viability. In the same way, having a vast network of merchants who accept this mode of payment is critical to accelerate usage.  The ease of cashing in is important, otherwise there’s really no incentive for people to fund their e-wallets. Here are ways to add funds to the different e-wallets: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashin” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263579/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The ability to convert e-wallet balances into cash or return them to bank accounts is also just as crucial in driving adoption, especially if the market has yet to overcome the trust barrier. Without this ability, it’s like having unused miles stuck with an airline company. GCash and PayMaya allow users to withdraw cash via ATMs using their linked prepaid cards. These ATM withdrawals, however, come with the usual bank charge. Speeding ahead of other players, GCash now lets users transfer their balances to more than 30 banks in the country for free. Although PayPal allows transfers to banks, the minimum amount required without incurring fees tends to be relatively high for the general population. In the Philippines, the transfer will not incur charges if the amount is P7,000 (US$138) and above. On top of that, banks impose fees which further reduce the amount to be received by the user. Below are the different cash-out options offered by the apps: {source}<iframe class=”to-cashout” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263583/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Apart from drivers’ takings, Grab does not allow users to change GrabPay credits into cash or transfer them into bank accounts. This means Grab will have to contend with providers that offer cash redemption. Attracting merchants E-wallets are impractical for people without stores that take them, and no merchant will accept e-wallets if their customers don’t use them. Players have to find a way to build both sides of the marketplace. If an app collects a critical mass of users and merchants, it becomes harder for a competitor to lure them away. Merchants would find it tough to ignore Grab and GCash’s user base. Grabbers come from across Southeast Asia, where the firm controls the ride-hailing sector and is increasingly encroaching into the travel space through its partnerships (Booking.com is an investor in Grab, for example). Hence, Grab’s local arm is poised to capture tourists visiting the Philippines from neighboring countries.  For its part, GCash has integrated with affiliate Alipay to allow the latter’s users – mostly Chinese nationals – to make purchases from merchants that accept GCash. It’s uncertain whether PayMaya has done the same with its ally WeChat. In the Philippines, where most payments still happen offline, offering physical stores a mobile payment system that doesn’t require huge capital expenditure is a sound step toward sweeping adoption. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/9504C856932C4236AD521F864470667E/paymaya-checkout.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   QR code tech is way cheaper than near-field communication (NFC) and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Except for PayPal, all local apps have QR code capabilities.  {source}<iframe class=”qr-merchants” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/274752/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Though Grab’s QR can’t be used in stores yet, the company has struck a partnership with retail titan SM to offer it in malls soon. Another key selling point is the fact that apps charge merchants lower fees (% of transaction value) for payments compared to credit cards. Heavy ammunition With an extensive user and merchant base comes significant revenue potential. Most apps charge users minimal transaction fees for things bought or paid for on their platforms to fuel adoption. Even without those fees, there’s potential to earn from users’ balances. In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay hold billions of dollars in funds that accumulate in their apps when users do not immediately use the funds or transfer them to a bank or investment account. The firms invest those funds to generate returns. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/3126113A20B7433FA1E37416F305BE9D/img/712272D9E64A4B409F0BFDEC42CAC0E9/ali-pay-we-chat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   However, the companies are said to be losing that revenue after the Chinese government required that all e-wallet funds be deposited in non-interest bearing accounts with the central bank, rather than private institutions. More than the user fees, players earn from taking a cut of merchant sales – online and offline. Ultimately, the lifestyle apps serve as e-commerce platforms where third-party merchants and the apps themselves or their parent companies sell their products and services. In this case, payments essentially act as the backbone that allows the transactions to happen. For instance, Globe and Smart are using GCash and PayMaya to sell phone credit top-ups. Coins.ph is offering its crypto exchange and trading services – akin to how a foreign currency exchange service and stock exchange work. Here’s how many e-wallet accounts there are in the Philippines, as per government data: {source}<iframe class=”ewallet-accounts” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} And here are the companies’ own user stats: {source}<iframe class=”companies” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/259234/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The picture looks rosy if we go by the players’ numbers. However, it’s uncertain how much of their user acquisition is organic. App companies spend not just on ads but also marketing promos – cashbacks and price discounts, among other things – to hook price-sensitive Filipinos and foster frequent use.  That’s not to say those subsidies are at all bad. For new technologies, subsidies are a potent – perhaps necessary – tool to acquire users and increase adoption. However, they’re costly to maintain, so winning the payments war will require deep pockets. The road to making money will be long and hard, but there are enormous rewards for becoming the dominant player. The question then becomes: who will last in the game? All the key players in the market right now have heavy war chests and high-profile investors in their rosters. {source}<iframe class=”high-profile” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/263586/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} The risk with cashbacks and discounts is that they may not necessarily inspire loyalty to a particular brand. In a situation where two players offer exactly the same services, people tend to gravitate towards the one that gives out more promos. So organic approaches like growing your merchant base and differentiating your product to entice users, as well as robust loyalty programs to keep users engaged are vital. Grab has a rewards program that lets users gain points as they use the app and progress up the tiers. The higher their tier is, the more rewards they can access. In Singapore, Grab has begun to offer subscription plans wherein users pay a fee upfront to avail of bundled discount vouchers across its services. The plans lock in customers for a longer period: the vouchers are already paid for so people are inclined to use them. What’s even more interesting is that the subscriptions are linked to the rewards program. Rides booked under the subscriptions earn reward points. On GCash, credit scoring and micro-loans will only be unlocked after a certain level of usage. The app, which currently has the most number of QR merchants, also introduced a program where users get vouchers after a purchase, to keep them coming back. To better gauge how an app is performing, one can look at active users and transaction volume/value. Unfortunately, the local apps are keeping those numbers under wraps. GCash claims that its active user base has grown 4x from 2017 to 2018.  We reached out to the other players for stats and other info, but have yet to receive a response. What consumers are saying Overall, companies will have to compete in terms of the quality of their products and services, including the crucial user experience. To know more about what people think of the payments apps, TheNerve used its natural language processing tool to monitor and analyze Twitter posts about them. The analysis spanned January 1 to December 31, 2018, with posts geo-tagged in the Philippines. Here’s what the team found. GCash and PayMaya {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/251672/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Both GCash and PayMaya’s social maps are dominated by clusters of tweets about:   {source}<iframe class=”gcash-paymaya” src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/257704/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’></iframe>{/source} Announcements and news coverage are focused on partnerships with malls and brands that have started accepting the apps as modes of payment, as well as referral and cashback programs. Zooming in on the user conversations, here are some key findings: GCash {source}{module 4131}{/source} PayMaya {source}{module 4132}{/source} Coins.ph {source}{module 4133}{/source} PayPal {source}<div style=”text-align: center;”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/D3F4D8BA56F74FD19E7FA1671AFA59E5/img/15B5CD41997843FC805732EDD8B17907/2_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   GrabPay {source}{module 4134}{/source} Survival of the deepest pockets As the local race is still in a relatively early stage, there’s room for players to co-exist and share the market. Having several e-wallet firms that spend for marketing campaigns raises consumer awareness and expedites adoption. At this point, players are fighting a common stubborn enemy: cash. Today, cash still makes up 99 percent of Philippine transactions. That means the market may remain fragmented, with more players potentially throwing their hat into the ring. Yet having too many options can also hinder adoption. It’s tedious for a user to maintain dozens of apps. In the long run, consolidation is bound to happen (we’ve actually seen a form of consolidation when Go-Jek acquired control of Coins.ph). In China, which is past the tipping point for mass e-wallet adoption, it’s evident: this is a sector where only a couple of players hold the majority of the market.  Players are expected to heavily burn cash to compete for market share so that means those with the deepest pockets will survive. It also means that profitability may be a long way off.  As e-wallet adoption grows, banks will be gravely affected. Apart from losing out to e-wallets in the unbanked market, existing transactions in their credit and debit card systems may shift to mobile as well. To stay relevant, they must determine how to compete and collaborate with new payment methods. Seeing the onslaught ahead, the country’s lenders have led the talks to come up with a national QR code system with the goal of having the codes readable across financial apps – bank or non-bank. So this means that a merchant can display a single QR code that all payments providers will be able to scan. This kind of interoperability will level the playing field. How the landscape will evolve when banks join the fray is definitely something to watch.

The company raised $2.3 billion from its IPO, ending the its first day of trading with a market valuation of $22.2 billion, CNBC reported.  Lyft has become the first ride-hailing company to be publicly traded, which Recode reporter Theodore Schleifer said is an advantage for Lyft, gaining attention and attract early investors. “If you’re an institutional investor who is eager — after years of watching two meteoric privately held startups amass value — to get exposure to U.S. ride-hailing, there will be a few months during which you will have one option and one option only: Lyft,” Schleifer wrote. Lyft, as opposed to world-spanning Uber, is only available in US and Canada, and doesn’t have other services besides ride-hailing. Lyft likely won’t be the last tech company to IPO this year though. There’s Uber of course, accommodation-sharing service Airbnb, visual discovery engine Pinterest, cloud-based video conference platform Zoom and a couple of other tech “unicorns” valued at more than $1 billion set go public in what reports have described as a big year for tech IPOs. We’re taking a look at what this could mean for each company below. Uber While Lyft is only estimated to be worth $20 to $25 billion when it goes public, Uber is estimated at $120 billion. Uber in February reported an $842 million loss in the fourth quarter of last year, which is 88% higher than that of the year earlier. These losses reportedly stem from the company’s push to dominate the ride-hailing space by attracting both riders and drivers with more incentives. Despite this, investment bankers still believe it would be one of the biggest-ever public offerings from the tech sector. It’s expected to be worth as much as $120 billion when it becomes publicly traded sometime in the first quarter, as sources claim. This begs the question: Why would investors want to buy stocks of an unprofitable company? According to The New York Times, tech companies are rarely profitable before they become public. This is mostly because they have to increase their spendings in research and development of new products and innovations to grow even bigger in the future.  Investors are willing to buy and help a company with a “path to profitability” now so that it can make money later, as Recode points out. By becoming a publicly traded company, Uber can quickly get the money it needs for its growth. This growth is said to come in the form of AI-powered self-driving cars and electric scooters. “They are moving from a business model innovation company to a product innovation one through autonomous vehicles and AI,” Matt Pencek, the director of consulting firm MorganFranklin told Vox. “It’s hard for a company to switch their business model, and so going public will provide liquidity.” While it’s too early to tell what consumers can expect from Uber’s IPO, it’s highly likely that we’ll hear and see more of their self-driving cars in the near future, especially since Uber recently resumed its testing program for these cars. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is also likely continue to pour money into the expansion of the company’s food delivery service Uber Eats in more territories as the company plans to deliver $10 billion worth of food worldwide this year. Airbnb After years of toying with the idea of whether to go public or not, Airbnb is finally ready to hit Wall Street this year. The company might reportedly be valued at $31 billion when it becomes traded. Though, unlike the two aforementioned companies, Airbnb is in no rush to get money as travel industry news site Skift, who cites Rented.com CEO Andrew McConnell, claims that the company currently has an estimated $3 billion in cash. This is likely true as Airbnb has in the last few years acquired numerous companies to expand its offerings. The most recent of which is HotelTonight, a mobile app that lets users book their stays last minute. The company has already rapidly grown since it launched in 2008, but it’s expected to grow even further when it goes public. Skift adds that the company is set to offer more experiences to its users as CEO Brian Chesky in numerous occasions teased. These could include Airbnb Lux, a luxury division of the service and the rumored Airbnb Flights, a part of the service that books flights. What’s certain for consumers is that more options for booking will be available to them as the company continues to acquire partners and continue expansion. Pinterest Pinterest last week announced that it has filed its S-1 – one of the main documents for going public – for its IPO expected on April, as reported by TechCrunch. Currently valued at an estimated $12 billion, the online image search would be listed in the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker PINS. The company posted revenues of $755.9 million in 2018, up 60% from 2017’s $472.8 million, but is still not profitable, according to Chris Neiger from The Motley Fool as it’s expenses for web hosting services, app costs, and salaries among others increased from $178.6 million in 2017 to $241.5 million last year. Though, the increase in revenue helped Pinterest narrow its losses from $130 million in 2017 to $63 million in 2018. The company’s monthly active users also saw some growth having hit 265 million in the fourth quarter of last year. While its user numbers are still far from Facebook’s 2.3 billion, Pinterest cites a research from Cowen and Company that claims more people use the platform to find or shop products than on other social networks.  Pinterest would likely use this data and the money it raises in its public offering to attract more advertisers to its platform. Slack Unlike most other companies on this list, workplace communication service Slack chose to go with a direct public offering (DPO), instead of an IPO. This is a process by which the company eliminates the need to hire underwriters – institutions that provide insurance to financial risks involved in trading – in favor of letting the people who own shares sell them directly to the public, as explained by Fortune. The Motley Fool, who cited The Wall Street Journal, points out that Slack has the cash it needs, which means it does not need to raise capital through an IPO. Besides this, it could save Slack some money to cut out the IPO middleman as well as avoid a lock-up period. The company could go public sometime within the first half of this year with a potential valuation of $7 billion. Postmates US-based delivery service Postmates filed confidentially for their IPO earlier in the year, joining Uber and Lyft as ride-hailing companies to debut in the stock market in 2019.  Business Insider reports that the company’s most recent venture capital funding round last January gave it a valuation of $1.85 billion. The company’s other financial figures, however, are not known. Postmates reportedly comes in at fourth with regards to its 10% market share, falling behind Grubhub at first with over 50%, UberEats at second with 21%, and DoorDash at third with 15%. Despite this, the company is said to have shown amazing growth in the past few years, now covering around 400 cities in the US. The company in early 2018 also partnered with automaker Ford to experiment with self-driving vehicles in the on-demand delivery space. Capital from an IPO could help Postmates continue to work with this tech and possibly use it to power their service in the future. Zoom Rounding out the list is cloud-based video conference software Zoom, who made their S-1 public last week. The company is said to be considered profitable as it has already made $7.5 million in profits from its $330.5 million total revenue for the fiscal year that ended in January 31. In their filing, they attributed this success to their video conference platform simply working as it should.  According to Quartz, there are often software and hardware incompatibilities when it comes to video conferencing that make it hard for users to use these types of platforms. Zoom, however, is different as it was built as a video conference platform from the very beginning instead of just being added to traditional conference calls. The company also said that their cloud infrastructure makes the process more seamless. Zoom will trade under the ticker ZM and hopes to raise $100 million. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/226691-uber-to-buy-mideast-rival-careem/","title":"Uber to buy Mideast rival Careem for $3.1 billion","date":"Mar 26, 2019 4:26 PM PHT","snippet":"'Careem and Uber are joining forces.

Grab’s Public Affairs Manager Nicka Hosaka said in a statement on Saturday, March 23, that the driver became suspicious when the two students refused to open the package they were sending to Bonifacio Global City. “This prompted the GrabExpress driver to deliver the package straight to the police station instead,” Hosaka said. The students are facing charges for violation of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act. Grab commended the driver and vowed to continue its coordination with government agencies “to prevent the use of the platform for delivering” illegal drugs and questionable items. “Grab continues to engage its driver partners to be alert and vigilant of suspicious activities in the performance of their duties, to help promote a drug-free and crime-free Philippines,” the company said. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) earlier warned that drivers of ride-hailing services were being used for deliveries of illegal drugs. In September 2017, Grab country head Brian Matthew Cu said only less than 10 deliveries had been involved in such incidents, but that the drivers were used as “tools” and were not accomplices. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/226258-tugade-blocks-go-jek-entry-philippines-because-grab/","title":"Is Tugade blocking Go-Jek’s entry into the Philippines because of Grab?","date":"Mar 21, 2019 10:20 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran says Secretary Arthur Tugade is 'not a micromanager'","body":" (3rd UPDATE) Is the Department of Transportation (DOTr) deliberately blocking the entry of Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek in the Philippines?  Quoting a high-ranking government official, a source told Rappler that Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade supposedly said he will “not allow” the entry of Go-Jek in the Philippine market “until Grab recuperates” from its losses. On Thursday, March 21, Transportation Assistant Secretary Goddes Libiran told Rappler that Tugade does not intervene with LTFRB matters, despite being an attached agency. “Secretary [Tugade] is not a micromanager. When it comes to matters like that, he lets LTFRB to decide on their own,” Libiran told Rappler. “Palagi ako kasama ni Secretary [Tugade] sa mga meetings with the road sector, the LTFRB. Pero wala akong natatandaang may sinabi siyang ganyan,” she added. (I am always with Secretary Tugade during meetings with the road sector, the LTFRB. But I can’t remember a time when he said something like that.) Libiran said that Go-Jek can still appeal their case directly to the DOTr. “That’s when the Secretary will intervene,” she said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again rejected Go-Jek’s application as a transportation network company (TNC), through its local subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines, over the same foreign ownership issue. Go-Jek operates in 66 cities in Indonesia, and has recently expanded to Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek. In a text message to Rappler, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that Velox is no longer foreign-owned but “still below the 60-40 requirement.” To qualify as a TNC, it should be 60% Filipino-owned. In March 2018, Grab bought the Southeast Asia operations of Uber, therefore having a “virtual monopoly” of the industry, as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) previously said. In a statement on Friday, March 22, Grab Philippines said it had “willfully” invested over $164 million in the Philippines for its operations “while remaining faithful, compliant, and respectful to regulators and policy makers.” “We, in no way, undermine their mandate and the trust given to them by the President by seeking special preference or partisanship in favor of our business,” Grab said. “We will continue to demonstrate our compliance as a fair and law-abiding corporation operating in the Philippines. We encourage everyone – both existing and incoming market players – to remain faithful to the procedures and the regulations set by the government,” it added. Since Uber left, ride-hailing services patrons have complained about unserved bookings from Grab. Drivers also said they don’t receive as much incentives as when the California-based firm was still here. The acquisition was eventually approved by PCC, but the antitrust body slapped Grab Philippines with a P12-million fine for causing “undue” difficulties to the review. The PCC again fined Grab P6.5 million for violating its pricing commitments in January. Will the Philippine government ever allow Go-Jek to operate in the country? Let’s see. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/226065-lyft-raise-two-billion-dollars-ipo/","title":"Lyft revs up for an IPO seeking to raise $2.4 billion","date":"Mar 18, 2019 8:30 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Lyft's launch is the first of what is expected to be a wave of IPOs from venture-backed startups worth more than $1 billion, known in Silicon Valley as 'unicorns'","body":" WASHINGTON DC, USA (UPDATED) – Lyft said Monday, March 18, it would seek to raise as much as $2.4 billion in its public share offering, in the first major listing in the fast-growing ride-hailing sector. The San Francisco startup could be valued at more than $20 billion under the terms of the initial public offering unveiled Monday, setting a price per share of between $62 and $68. Lyft’s launch is the first of what is expected to be a wave of IPOs from venture-backed startups worth more than $1 billion, known in Silicon Valley as “unicorns.” Lyft’s listing comes ahead of a larger offering expected from Uber, which has a valuation of some $70 billion. Others expected to move to Wall Street this year include the business collaboration firm Slack, visual discovery startup Pinterest and possibly the big data group Palantir. Lyft is proposing to sell 30.8 million shares with an underwriters option for an additional 4.6 million, with shares on the Nasdaq listed under the symbol “LYFT.” No date was given for the listing, but the Wall Street Journal said Lyft shares could begin trading by the end of next week, when a final price will be set. Lyft and Uber are among the most prominent players in the “sharing economy,” representing a trend that moves away from ownership to on-demand services. The growth in these services is eroding sentiment for ownership of homes, cars and other goods, and is also shifting the concept of labor and employment, sparking fierce debates on whether the change is good or bad. Spending for “on demand” on services such as Uber and Airbnb and other digital platforms rose 58% in 2017 to $75.7 billion in the US, with more than 41 million consumers participating, according to a survey by Rockbridge Associates. Heavy losses According to documents filed earlier, Lyft lost $911 million on $2.2 billion in 2018 revenues. The documents show revenues grew sharply from $343 million in 2016, but losses widened as well. Lyft said in its Securities and Exchange Commission filing it has completed over one billion rides since its inception in 2012 and had bookings last year of $8.1 billion. It has a 39% share of the US rideshare market, according to a survey cited in the filing. Lyft has also begun to move into other kinds of short-range transportation including bike- and scooter-sharing. Lyft is also betting on adoption of autonomous driving, claiming that self-driving taxis and rideshare services will help reshape urban landscapes by eliminating the need for private vehicles. “We believe that cities should be built for people, not cars,” Lyft says in its IPO filing. “Mass car ownership strains our cities and reduces the very freedom that cars once provided.” Both Lyft and Uber have faced criticism for disrupting traditional taxi services and for using the model of drivers as independent contractors. The rideshare firms claim that most drivers prefer the flexible work arrangement, even if it offers fewer benefits and less job security. Lyft said it will seek to maintain its policy that drivers are independent contractors while noting that any legal challenge to this could have “adverse” consequences. For the IPO, Lyft said some shares would be reserved for drivers who have completed at least 10,000 trips using the platform. The company will offer a bonus of $1,000 to $10,000 to eligible drivers by March 19 that may be used to buy shares at the offering price, although they may opt to pocket the cash. With a dual-class share structure enabling founders to maintain control, chief executive Logan Green will have some 29% of voting power and co-founder John Zimmer 19% after the IPO. Ross Gerber of the investment firm Gerber Kawasaki cautioned against getting too excited on Lyft. “Another very overpriced IPO which gives public shareholders no say,” Gerber said in a tweet. “Do not touch this dog. It will rally and then start the long road down.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/data-stories/225452-reasons-philippines-slow-adopt-e-wallet/","title":"Why the Philippines has been slow to adopt e-wallets","date":"Mar 18, 2019 6:42 PM PHT","snippet":"And why that's about to change","body":"{source}<style>@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {.spec-exec-logo {display: flex;align-items: center;flex-direction: column;margin-top: 5%;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/1BFEC765D7DE4956BC6776050E8CFF9E/nerve_logo.png) no-repeat;width: 110px;height: 23px;background-size: 100% auto;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {#cover-area > top-img > div { margin-top: 10% !important; margin-right: 40% !important; margin-left: 5% !important;}.switch-image {display: block;box-sizing: border-box;background: url(https://assets.rappler.com/39B80443B91542A2895BE9954E52BC85/img/385D1F66100F4AE09703485E308EE5CD/2.png) no-repeat;width: 130px;height: 27px;background-size: 100% auto;}.spec-exec-logo {text-align: left;width: 40%;margin-bottom: 5%;}#gysharebarh-225452 {text-align: left !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline {font-family: “Oswald”, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;}h1.spec-exec-headline, p.spec-exec-subhead, p.spec-exec-byline{text-align: left;}#cover-area > top-img > div > text-container > hr {margin-left: 0;width: 20% !important;height: 1px;}bg-image:before {content: ”;position: absolute;top: 0;right: 0;bottom: 0;left: 0;background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));opacity: 1;z-index: 1;}#cover-area > top-img > div {z-index: 1;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 1025px) { #cover-area > top-img > div { margin-top: -10% !important; margin-right: 40% !important; margin-left: 5% !important;}}</style><script>$(‘#cover-area > top-img > div’).prepend(`<div class=”spec-exec-logo”><div class=”switch-image”></div></div>`);</script>{/source} Can you imagine the day when cash is obsolete and Filipinos use only their mobile phones to pay for everything, even the most mundane stuff like a jeepney ride or street food? It may seem like a scene straight out of the Netflix show Black Mirror, but it’s no longer science fiction. In China, cash is considered almost dead. Mobile payments have become so ubiquitous that even beggars are collecting handouts by apps. The country’s e-wallet giants, Alibaba-backed Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat, have 700 million and 1 billion monthly active users, respectively. That covers almost the entire China population, and a chunk of those numbers came only in the past 5 years. For comparison, Apple Pay, which comes pre-installed on every iPhone, has only 127 million users globally. The Philippines hasn’t come close to the dizzying adoption that China has seen (to be fair, though, probably no other country in the world has). Cash still accounted for 99% of local transactions as of 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) earlier said. A poll by data insights company TheNerve confirmed that cash remains the preferred payment mode of Filipinos. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237783/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   On top of that, only 1.3% of Filipino adults own electronic money accounts, according to the BSP’s 2017 Financial Inclusion Survey. BSP’s own data pegs e-wallet accounts in the country at about 12% of the adult population.  {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239889/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   If we go by industry players’ claims, here’s how many e-wallet users we have: (Stats on other players are hard to come by.) The sum of those figures translates to just over 31% of the total population and this is how it compares to some of the Philippines’ neighbors:  China’s e-wallet success will be hard to replicate elsewhere, but there are many lessons that can be drawn from its experience. While the Philippines was slow to adopt mobile payments in the past, it’s likely reaching a tipping point, especially as Alibaba and Tencent export their expertise and technology here via their strategic tie-ups with GCash and PayMaya. China was uniquely primed for mobile payments For context, mobile payments leapfrogged in China because of insufficient banking infrastructure. The size of the country and its population meant consumers had to contend with long lines in city branches and long journeys to those in the countryside. Credit card usage was also low, partly because America’s Visa and Mastercard – and many other international firms – were banned in the Middle Kingdom. Mobile apps became a convenient way to transfer money and pay for goods and services. Widening internet and mobile phone penetration, and rising incomes were also prerequisites. China’s smartphone market took off when cheaper Chinese alternatives to the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy began to sprout. Today, smartphone adoption stands at 63%, while cellular subscription is 104 per 100 people in the country. The Philippine market’s fundamentals are quite similar to China’s early days. While the local market isn’t highly protectionist like China – and Visa and Mastercard are the two dominant credit card companies – cards have not seen that much take-up. It’s hard to get approved for a credit card if you don’t have any credit or banking history. With 77% of Filipinos unbanked, mobile payments offer the perfect case for people to sideswipe the plastic. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239880/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Like China, the Philippines has a rising middle class and is touted as a mobile-first market, with smartphone adoption at 59%, thanks to affordable phones – a lot of which are made by Chinese brands themselves. Cellular subscription is at 110 per 100 people. Filipinos also spend the most time on the internet and social media among countries in the world. Facebook is practically their internet. As consumers become digitally savvy, they begin to browse and purchase goods and services online and on-the-go. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”http://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A/pinoys-smartphone.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   One roadblock perhaps is the country’s slow internet speed. It’s hard to create the habit of paying for goods anytime without a constant, stable connection, particularly in rural areas. Though the speed has improved, it still lags behind other Asia-Pacific countries. That can be blamed on a lack of internet infrastructure. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/D9ECB2C6F0B342B5A20E16D6DB190406/asia-pacific-internet-speeds-akamai-q1-2017-report.png” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=”Source: Akamai Q1 2017 report” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Creating the habit of mobile payments through strong use cases To boost the user count of its eBay-like e-commerce platform Taobao, Alibaba in 2004 launched Alipay, which held payment in escrow until buyers received their online purchase. Providing users with a go-between and guarantor catapulted Taobao to massive popularity. Alibaba, which also owns business-to-consumer marketplace Tmall, is China’s most prolific e-commerce firm – the one responsible for the world’s biggest shopping holiday known as Single’s Day or 11.11. About a decade later, the escrow service was spun off as a separate company called Ant Financial to consolidate Alibaba’s various finance activities under one roof. Ant began to run mobile wallet Alipay as one of its units. By that time, Alipay already had a large user base. Since then, Alipay dominated roughly 80% of mobile payments in China, where 75% of online sales were expected to happen through smartphones by 2018. Till Tencent’s WeChat Pay entered the picture. If e-commerce was the driving force behind Alipay, WeChat Pay’s main weapon was social interaction. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5CFB321FFDA24818BA79B19F4C1381F6/alipay-wechat.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   The payments service is integrated into the WeChat social app and responsible for all the transactions happening there. It launched riding on the back of China’s longtime tradition of gifting cash-stuffed red envelopes. On Lunar New Year in 2014, WeChat allowed its users to send a virtual version of the red envelopes to fellow users. The app quickly became a key method for people to send money to each other. That same year, WeChat made a big e-commerce leap by allowing any merchant – not just well-known retailers – to set up storefronts in its app under an open platform strategy. To defend its turf, Alipay followed suit. The rivalry only grew from there. The next battleground was China’s online-to-offline market (i.e. offline services being booked online) which saw the firms include a gamut of services into their apps. You name it, they have it: ride-hailing, food delivery, movie-ticket buying, etc. Payments were the glue that held their ecosystems together. By 2017, the firms had split the payments market: Alipay had a 54% share, while WeChat had 40%. They had become lifestyle “super apps” embedded in Chinese daily life. WeChat boasts of an unrivalled 1 billion active users network in China (to this day, Facebook has failed to leap over the Great Wall). The social aspect made it a lot stickier than Alipay and brought strong network effects, allowing it to catch up fast. The more users WeChat got on board, the more people wanted to join to be connected with their friends and families. And with more users came more sellers. The Philippines, however, has no homegrown brand as powerful as WeChat or Alipay that could spark that kind of awareness about mobile payments among Filipinos. The SIM-based payments services of Globe and PLDT (GCash and Smart Money, respectively) have been around since the early 2000s and the app versions (GCash and PayMaya) came starting 2012. Yet as of 2017, 40% of banked Filipinos were still unaware of electronic payment methods, according to the BSP Financial Inclusion Survey. That could partly explain the slow pace of adoption in previous years. Apart from lack of awareness, security is another concern. In TheNerve’s recent poll, most survey respondents said they don’t use mobile apps to pay. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237787/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Most think mobile app payments are unsafe and that their money and personal details might get stolen. But of course, security concerns may have more to do with Filipinos’ inherent distrust of new financial technologies than the apps themselves (transactions with the top apps have proven secure thus far). The country has seen countless fraud incidents like ATM card skimming and online scams. So you can’t deny the appeal of dealing with a person – there’s someone to hold liable if the transaction goes wrong. {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237788/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   E-commerce is a booming Philippine sector, posting a 42% surge in gross merchandise volume from $500 million in 2015 to $1.5 billion in 2018, according to a Google report. It’s expected to grow to $10 billion by 2025. Despite this, cash-on-delivery is still the number one way to pay for online purchases – similar to how China’s market started before Alipay was introduced. The escrow service was a game changer for China, specifically Alibaba’s Taobao, assuring users that they wouldn’t get cheated on the platform. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/70B431BAC541481CA2E2E3058DF1CDB6/ph-bank-notes-coins.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   In the Philippines, regional players Lazada – which was acquired by Alibaba in 2016 – and Shopee have been in a neck-and-neck race. Lazada’s payments feature, HelloPay, has merged with Alipay and rebranded to the latter. However, the companies said at the time that HelloPay’s features would be unchanged. It doesn’t seem like Lazada has adopted Alibaba’s escrow service, but it would help build trust among Filipino shoppers and push them into the habit of online payments if this happens. Local payments players will have to work much harder to hook consumers. These days, that means ads and integration with massive platforms like Facebook, cashback and other promos, as well as strong use cases. The marketing efforts will entail high cash burn, so players need substantial backing to last in the battle. Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat play a key role, as they take their fight for dominance to other markets. Both have bankrolled their international expansion not just by targeting globe-trotting Chinese consumers, but also through investments in local markets. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial (parent of Alipay) has made a major infusion in GCash’s parent Mynt and Tencent in PayMaya owner Voyager Innovations – both moves mean deeper know-how and capital to kick off the local apps’ aggressive growth. GCash and PayMaya started out with their telco groups’ core product – phone credit top-up (this made sense since the Philippines is a largely prepaid telco market) – money transfer, and bills payment. Now they’re gung-ho developing their own ecosystems of services. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/CA4037A87FC84A449D5F5C2B43A0593D/paymaya.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Other players with huge investor backing have also launched their bids to replicate China’s success. Ride-hailing company Grab has introduced GrabPay. Coins.ph, a blockchain-based e-wallet, has been acquired by Indonesia’s Go-Jek, Grab’s archrival that has its own payments feature called Go-Pay. Grab and Go-Jek are racing to become Southeast Asia’s leading super app that offers everyday services on-demand. All these companies have been flooding the market with promos to capture users. Here are some top e-wallet use cases, based on TheNerve’s survey: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/237789/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   Here’s the breakdown of e-money payments by key use case, as per BSP data: {source}<iframe src=’https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/239908/embed’ frameborder=’0′ scrolling=’no’ style=’width:100%;height:600px;’></iframe>{/source}   QR codes are the way to go China’s tech giants are battling not just for online payments, but also offline transactions. Mobile wallets can’t win users if merchants don’t accept this kind of payment in-store. This is something that Alibaba and Tencent knew very well, so they’ve been slugging it out for brick-and-mortar shops, restaurants, and other offline outlets. They understood early on that sellers located outside cities might not be willing to accept mobile payments that would require them to shell out a big amount and upgrade equipment. In the US, many vendors had to migrate to payment terminals compatible with near-field communication tech or NFC to accept Apple Pay and Google Pay. The QR code is a black-and-white, two-dimensional barcode that stores data in codified format and can be read by a scanner or the camera of any mobile device. It’s a way to skip the step where the payer and payee’s account details must be inputted for a transaction to go through. The system is way cheaper than NFC and the traditional point-of-sale (POS) terminals or cash registers. Merchants in China could purchase a QR code scanner – commonly referred to as the “little white box” – for a quarter of the price of handheld POS terminals. Merchants without scanners can just print out a QR code that consumers can scan using their phones to pay. This means anyone can become a merchant since hardware isn’t necessary. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/CDB62DF7E43945178309678473603825/img/5A142193C0A34456920AC7DCA25EC452/qr-payment_1.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   It also means faster checkout time – no need to count bills and coins. Soon enough, QR code payments began taking China’s offline stores by storm. The technology has reached Philippine shores, raising the prospects of mobile payments finally taking off among vendors. A few months after Ant Financial’s investment in 2017, GCash introduced QR code payments. Not to be outdone by its competitor, PayMaya launched the feature on the same day. Before 2017, both e-wallet providers offered Visa and Mastercard prepaid cards that their users could use to pay at physical stores. So essentially only merchants with card terminals were able to accept the payments. The SIM-based mobile payment service, on the other hand, involved sending a text message with the amount and store’s code to a 4-digit access number. Lower fees are encouraging Another factor that should drive faster adoption of mobile payments is lower fees. In the US, Apple Pay and Google Pay don’t store money – instead, they work by charging directly to credit cards linked to the apps (the US is largely a card-based market). So it means those card firms take a percentage of each transaction from merchants. Alipay and WeChat are undercutting those card companies by giving users the ability to pay using their app balances, which can be sourced directly from bank accounts. This doesn’t mean no charges for merchants, though. Alipay takes a commission of 0.6% on sales, but that’s far lower than credit card commissions, which run between 1% and 5%. GCash and PayMaya work the same way as the China e-wallets, charging competitive rates. Both offer cash-in through physical stores. GCash alone offers the option to link and unlink bank accounts within the app. {source}<div class=”flex-video widescreen”><img id=”A47DC046D52C4D4DA03B37C1C8E2E96A” src=”https://assets.rappler.com/01A20699999048DA9312D9E6159D4B48/img/5B40E0F0A415438E86479274B2977572/gcash.jpg” class=”rappler_asset” border=”0″ alt=” ” data-parentid=”” /></div>{/source}   Users can also top up both GCash or PayMaya via the InstaPay option offered by banks. InstaPay is an electronic fund transfer service initiated by the BSP that allows people to transfer money almost instantly between accounts of participating BSP-supervised banks and non-bank e-money issuers in the Philippines. While going through InstaPay admittedly adds another step (users have to log into their bank app first), being able to wire money online and instantly will prove handy for consumers. InstaPay is one of the two automated clearing houses (ACH) for electronic fund transfers set up by the central bank under the National Retail Payment System. The aim is to promote interoperability among industry players so consumers can easily transfer money across different financial accounts. {source}<table border=”1″ style=”width:100%”> <tr> <td style=”padding: 1em; width: 20%; text-align: center;”>InstaPay</td> <td style=”padding: 1em;”> <ul> <li>Alternative to small-value cash payments</li> <li>Especially useful for purchasing retail goods, paying toll fees, and for e-commerce</li> <li>Limit: P50,000 per transaction</li> <li>Funds transferred get credited in real-time</li> <li>Enables merchants to accept e-payments from both e-money and bank accounts even without the usual point-of-sale device used for cards.

It employs a test-and-learn regulatory framework where players are relatively free to innovate. Among the things the central bank has allowed are: Will we ever get rid of cash? Clearly, the BSP sees the benefits of going cashless. Cash is costly to handle – you need to employ people to count, store or transport it, hence the fees banks charge consumers. It can also be dangerous to carry around. On the other hand, mobile app payments are quick and easy to scale, which translates to lower fees. They’re also transparent, as transactions are recorded electronically and can be tracked. With lower fees and simple know-your-customer procedures, the poor and unbanked could participate more broadly in the financial economy through the apps. What’s more, the apps provide a way for low-income households to save for emergencies and other needs, and for small businesses to access capital to grow. That’s why the central bank is doing its best to pave the way for a cash-lite society. It may be some way off, but experts believe the Philippines is on the cusp of a digital payments revolution. The BSP itself is optimistic that digital transactions could surge to 20% of total local payments by 2020.  Still, there are headwinds along the way. The promise of eliminating cash takes away the anonymity of every single transaction made. This is expected to be met with strong resistance from unscrupulous parties. It also brings about unsettling worries among consumers, given that volumes of their data are controlled by a few tech companies. With the vast amounts of personal information and transaction histories on Alipay, its parent Ant Financial has developed a proprietary platform called Sesame Credit, which calculates people’s credit scores based on that data. Ant then uses those scores in extending loans to consumers who are otherwise ignored by banks. China has a grand plan to implement a social credit scoring system that would judge its citizens’ behavior and trustworthiness. Concerns abound that it could access tech firms’ data, though the companies assert they won’t release it without users’ consent. A bad score could mean the loss of certain rights, such as boarding flights or riding the train. Again, it’s eerily reminiscent of the show Black Mirror, but that’s how the future may really be shaping up.

Go-Jek had filed an application to be a transport network company (TNC) through its subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines. In a text message to Rappler on Monday, March 18, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III confirmed that Velox’s application was denied due to foreign ownership. “[It] did not meet [the] citizenship requirement,” Delgra told Rappler. Back in January, the LTFRB’s pre-accreditation committee rejected Velox’s application for being 99.99% owned by its parent company Velox South-East Asia Holdings, which is Singaporean. The LTFRB said the Department of Transportation recognizes transport network vehicle services (TNVS) under public transport, thus requiring firms to be at least 60% Filipino-owned. Documents acquired by Rappler from the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Filipino firm Pace Crimson Ventures Corporation (PCVC) is the registered majority shareholder of Velox, with a 60% stake in the firm. But the LTFRB pre-accreditation committee said in its decision that only 20.4% out of 1.2 billion common shares were “actually sold” to PCVC, therefore concluding that Velox is “not-Filipino owned.” {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-conversation=”none” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>LOOK: LTFRB Board Resolution No. 16 rejecting Go-Jek’s local subsidiary Velox Technology Philippines’ application as TNC. <br><br>Velox can still appeal their case directly to the DOTr. <a href=”https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@rapplerdotcom</a> <a href=”https://t.co/DIWlrOobf2″>pic.twitter.com/DIWlrOobf2</a></p>&mdash; Aika Rey (@reyaika) <a href=”https://twitter.com/reyaika/status/1108668422764654593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>March 21, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source}   In its decision, the LTFRB further said that Velox “failed” to present Proof of Payment of Capital Gains Tax and Proof of Payment of Subscribed Shares allegedly subscribed by PCVC. Velox can still appeal its case directly to the Department of Transportation. PCVC is owned by Paulo Campos III. Campos is the chief executive officer of Zalora Philippines, where Ayala Corporation acquired a 49% stake in 2017. Ayala Corporation and Go-Jek had acquisition talks, sources familiar with the matter said earlier. In a statement sent to Rappler on Monday, Go-Jek said it is “disappointed” with the regulatory body’s decision. “Go-Jek is disappointed with the LTFRB’s decision to deny our motion for reconsideration and our offer to address Filipino commuters’ urgent need for more transportation options,” the company said. “Commuters in Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand as well as Indonesia benefit from our technology every day, but due to this decision, it seems drivers and commuters in the Philippines will have to wait a bit longer. We will now explore our options,” Go-Jek added. The Indonesian ride-hailing giant maintained that competition is important to provide better services to commuters. “The standard of [TNVS] can only be elevated if there is competition among TNC players. We want to provide real options to people who spend more hours on the road than necessary as well as to drivers, whose welfare is always improved by more competition in the sector,” Go-Jek said. Despite the rejection, Go-Jek said that it “hopes to arrive at a fruitful working relationship” with the LTFRB, to deliver ride-hailing services in the Philippines as soon as possible. The LTFRB’s latest decision means ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines remains at the forefront of the industry. Currently, it still dominates the market with 49,000 active drivers on its platform as of February 2019. Almost a year has passed since Uber sold its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. Since then, the LTFRB has accredited 8 other firms – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto, GoLag, ePickMeUp, Snappy Cab, and Ryd Global. But these other firms have yet to make a significant impact on the ride-hailing market, with the Philippine Competition Commission saying that the LTFRB should “look outside” for a viable option for commuters.

Navigatú, taken from the word “navigation” and inspired by Butuan’s “balangay” boats, offers an idea incubation program and business skills course for startups in the region. Just recently, Navigatu acquired P2 million in funding from an investor. Aside from providing a safer commuting alternative for the public, the application also hopes to increase the income of tricycle drivers. Users can quickly book a ride with a few taps, while Transeek will search for the nearest available tricycle using GPS (Global Positioning System).

In Pangasinan, ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines also launched a premium service for tricycles, in partnership with AutoItalia Philippines, aiming to “fill in the gap for short-distance commutes.” (READ: LOOK: Grab launches premium tricycle service) Transeek aims to uplift A survey of 100 tricycle drivers in Butuan found their average income ranged from P400 to P500 a day. Transeek hopes to increase their income up to 300% by helping in decreasing delays and standby hours. The base fare for a maximum of 3 passengers per ride will be P30, with a service charge of P5. Drivers will get P25 for every ride from the system. “We have interviewed drivers during Tricycle Operators and Drivers’ Association (TODA) meetings and most of them liked Transeek since they don’t have to waste time roaming around to look for passengers,” said Cubillas. According to the app makers, drivers’ registration into Transeek’s system will be free.

The measure would amend Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to include motorcycles-for-hire among the vehicles that may be registered with the Land Transportation Office to be used as “a commercial vehicle to transport passengers and goods.” This means that if HB 8959 is passed into law, the likes of ride-hailing app Angkas and habal-habal or motorcycle taxis would be free to ply Philippine roads to serve commuters.  Under HB 8959, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) would be tasked to set and adjust “reasonable” fares and other related charges for these motorcycle taxis. The LTFRB and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) would be in charge of deciding the routes that the motorcycles-for-hire can take. In December 2018, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on a Mandaluyong City court decision that allowed Angkas to hit the streets again. The LTFRB then ordered law enforcers to apprehend Angkas bikers and impound their motorcycles if they continue operating as public utility vehicles. Legislators have since argued that the DOTr can issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate again, similar to what the previous administration had done when ride-hailing giant Uber first came to the Philippines.

Grab Philippines recently introduced their new leadership structure, with country head-turned-president Brian Cu still at the helm of the ride-hailing giant. Lawyer Nicka Hosaka, the newest public affairs manager, will be working with its head Leo Gonzales. Before joining Grab, Hosaka served as the chief of staff and legal counsel of PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe from April 2017 to May 2018. After her stint with the PCC, she became the legal counsel for e-commerce platform Shopee for about 6 months. Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March 2018 prompted the PCC to review the deal. It bound the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. Compliance monitoring is still ongoing, with the antitrust body imposing another P6.5-million fine on Grab for violating its commitments to the PCC. Conflict of interest?  Section 7 (b)(1) of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees does not allow government workers to: Own, control, manage or accept employment as officer, employee, consultant, counsel, broker, agent, trustee or nominee in any private enterprise regulated, supervised or licensed by their office unless expressly allowed by law The law states that it “shall continue for a period of one year after resignation, retirement, or separation of office.” In an interview with Rappler, Bernabe said Hosaka is “not covered” by the rule. There’s no conflict of interest, he said, with Hosaka being with Grab now. Bernabe explained that despite reviewing the Grab-Uber buyout, the PCC is neither regulating nor supervising Grab. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) Bernabe also added that the PCC did not give Grab the license to operate because that falls under the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. “The code of conduct is not applicable in this case. In terms of optics it might create, Nicka never worked on the Grab case. She was never part of the team that conducted the review,” Bernabe said. The commissioner also said that Hosaka had already left the PCC when the antitrust watchdog was reviewing Grab’s voluntary commitments. “Nicka is a very good lawyer and she was a very good staff member. We trust that she will not be involved in anything still pending with the PCC. That’s a commitment she made when she went to Shopee,” Bernabe told Rappler. No work overlap Bernabe expects Hosaka to be hands-off the Grab-Uber deal in terms of lending her legal expertise.  “That’s our expectation. Out of sense of propriety or delicadeza,” Bernabe. Hosaka, in an interview with Rappler, maintained that there is “no conflict whether legal or personal” with her new role in Grab. “In so far as the transaction was concerned, it was ongoing but it just started when I left. I wasn’t involved in the review team. I wasn’t even part of any discussions with the parties with Grab or Uber,” she said. When she first met with the ride-hailing giant, Hosaka said she had informed Bernabe of the role. She said the height of the Grab-Uber buyout issue was when she was at Shoppee. “Now, I am working with [Grab’s] public affairs team. With the PCC, I was acting as chief of staff and was doing some legal counsel work for Commissioner Bernabe. There’s no overlapping in terms of duties and obligations there,” she said. Hosaka assured that she will not be handling any PCC-related matter while she’s working with Grab. “Right now, while I’m with Grab, Im not handling any PCC matters, also because out of propriety.

Lawmakers have argued that DOTr can just “issue a Department Order” to allow the likes of ride-hailing app Angkas and habal-habal (motorcycle taxis) to operate, similar to what the previous administration had done when ride-hailing giant Uber first came to the Philippines. “The issue at hand cannot be likened to that of Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), as cited by some senators and congressmen. A DO should always be based on existing laws,” DOTr said. The DOTr said that Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code specifically classified motorcycles as not for hire nor for public utility. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) “According to Republic Act 4136, passenger automobiles may be classified as either private or public (“for hire”), depending on its purpose. Thus, although TNVS units were initially classified as private vehicles, their transition to public transport only required a conversion to another classification,” DOTr said. “RA 4136 clearly does not allow motorcycles to be classified as “for hire” or for public utility,” it added. The transportation department reiterated its preference for a law amending RA 4136. Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto earlier filed Senate Bill No. 2173 seeking to allow motorcycle taxis to operate. At the House of Representatives, House Bill No. 8959 or the Motorcycle-for-Hire Act was approved on second reading on January 30. On the judicial front, DOTr also cited the Supreme Court’s temporary restraining order allowing authorities to apprehend Angkas bikers operating illegally. “Issuing a DO allowing motorcycle taxis to operate as public transport would go against the TRO issued by the Supreme Court, thereby exposing DOTr officials to criminal liability or contempt of court,” the department said. It maintained that it does “not intend to antagonize Angkas.” It welcomed Angkas  and other motorcycle groups to a technical working group to discuss related issues. To date, there are more than 27,000 Angkas drivers. Some groups have noted that illegal habal-habal transactions are sometimes done in Facebook groups, the largest of which have more than 200,000 members.

The investment means Central, which is also a major hotelier and supermarket chain whose business interests stretch into Europe, will acquire a non-controlling stake in Grab’s Thai entity. Tos Chirathivat, CEO of Central Group and scion of the kingdom’s second richest family with a fortune estimated by Forbes of $21 billion, said the big buy-in will give his company’s stores and hotels access to customers wherever they are. “It (Grab) has built a new platform which consists of food delivery, payment, and other services,” he said. “So we can link with it. They can sell or buy products at our malls and get them delivered home.” He did not reveal how much of Grab’s Thai unit he bought with the $200 million.  Grab is a market leader in the Southeast Asian ride app industry, having bought out US-based Uber’s regional business last year in return for a stake. Grab chief executive officer and co-founder Anthony Tan said the Central deal brings together Thailand’s “local retail champion” with the “local technology champion,” and would cement the service’s position as Thailand’s “everyday app.” Grab has big ambitions, aiming to hook the region’s consumers on its app and enter joint ventures with major retail players.

Handling transport services will now be Chris Taylor, handling GrabCar, GrabShare, GrabCar Premium, and GrabCar 6-seater. Taylor worked with Uber for more than 4 years. He served as the global head of service quality for community operations from 2017 to 2018. Before assuming that post, Taylor was the general manager for Uber’s outpost in Chicago from 2014, and Boston from 2016. He was also an adviser for Philippine telecommunications firm PLDT Incorporated starting August 2018, advising on technology and innovation in customer experience.

Senator Ralph Recto asked the Department of Transportation (DOTr) why it has not issued a department order (DO) which would allow the likes of motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas to operate. Recto said a DO was issued in 2015 to allow ride-hailing services when Uber first came to the Philippines. “We are asking for the issuance of a department order addressing two-wheel motor vehicles because it is needed to be done – how it was done for the [transportation network companies] and the [transport network vehicle services],” Recto said. “We are asking within 30 days may desisyon (there will be a decision),” the senator added. The Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not allow private cars and motorcycles to be for hire. But in 2015, the then-Department of Transportation and Communications issued DO 2015-011 which introduced the TNVS category to “promote mobility.” This DO allowed the use of private cars under TNCs to offer rides. However, the DO did not touch on motorcycle taxis. So when Angkas gained popularity among commuters, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) considered it illegal. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) During the hearing, Transportation Undersecretary Mark de Leon noted that there are several issues that need to be addressed first before the department can issue an order. “There are 3 issues that we need to resolve. We need to address legal, judicial, and safety issues…. The position of the department is that we need to amend the law,” De Leon told senators. Uber and Grab operators now, he added, have to apply for a certificate of public conveyance, similar to public utility vehicles. De Leon added that the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order, which effectively allows authorities to apprehend Angkas bikers operating illegally. But Recto is urging the DOTr to regulate motorcycle taxis, instead of turning a blind eye to the growing need for the mode of transport. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride) He also noted that there are thousands of illegal habal-habals or motorcyle taxis operating, which he said is a source of corruption, too. “Do all the necessary regulation. Better to regulate than not allow it,” he said. Angkas is ‘safe’ During the hearing on Wednesday, Angkas public affairs head George Royeca underscored that drivers on their platform are trained. “In Angkas, the training is a critical part of the application. We also have an anti-sexual harassment training. Even the bike, it should be until 7 years old only. Every 3 months, we do regular checkup of the bikes to see if [they are] in mint condition,” Royeca said. He pointed out that Angkas has a “safety record of 99.97%.” There are around 27,000 Angkas bikers to date. Royeca also said that even if Angkas is “not there,” habal-habals continue to operate. “Now, what we want is to regulate this [industry] properly,” he told Rappler in a chance interview. In December 2018, the DOTr formed a technical working group (TWG) to review the possibility of allowing motorcycle taxis. The study is still ongoing, with Angkas as part of the TWG, along with the government, motorcycle groups, and road safety advocates. In Metro Manila, government figures showed that 24,000 out of 110,025 road crash incidents involved motorcycles, killing 247 people and injuring 12,182.

Now a homegrown rival, Luckin Coffee, plans to build a high tech-driven shop every 3 and a half hours to dethrone the US giant. The Chinese upstart is burning through millions of dollars to lure customers with steep discounts, challenging Starbucks’ dominance by targeting office workers and students who prefer to have their java on-the-go or delivered to their doorstep. While Starbucks and British rival Costa Coffee offer lounging spaces for people to work or meet friends, most Luckin outlets are more like “delivery kitchens”. The shops are no bigger than a studio apartment, with no tables, display counters or even cash registers because all payments are made using mobile phones. Luckin’s no-frills approach means consumers pay about a third less for a cup compared to other global brands. A tall-sized latte costs 31 yuan (around $5) at Starbucks, but only 24 yuan at Luckin. Customers who walk into one of Luckin’s blue-and-white outlets need only spend a few minutes there – to scan a code and pay for their coffee that has been pre-ordered through the company’s smartphone app. “I like the convenience, there are no long queues, or having to sit alone while your coffee is brewed,” said Yu Qian, a financial analyst in Beijing. “The coffee itself is a little sweeter, more like the sweet milk tea that is popular in China”. Luckin’s aggressive strategy mirrors tactics used by other Chinese startups that have dislodged Western brands from one of the world’s top consumer markets. “The big advantage for us of having pickup stores versus the big stores is that in terms of rental costs, we pay significantly less than our competitors,” Luckin’s chief strategy officer, Reinout Schakel, told AFP. After only a year in business, the company announced plans earlier this month to open 2,500 outlets by the end of the year, which would push its total store strength to 4,500. By comparison, Starbucks has some 3,600 stores across the country. Playing catch-up  The US behemoth has an 80% stake in China’s $3.4 billion coffee shop market, according to research group Euromonitor. But Schakel sees room for growth. Chinese consumers currently drink just 4 to 5 cups of coffee per year, compared to about 300 cups in neighbouring Japan or South Korea, which were also traditionally tea drinking markets, he said. China is Starbucks’ fastest-growing and second biggest market after the United States. Its Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, which opened in late 2017, is the company’s biggest store in the world. But it was a latecomer to China’s huge food delivery industry. The Seattle-based company partnered with Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba’s delivery service ele.me only after Luckin started eating into its market share in July. “Our delivery service today covers more than 2,000 stores across 30 cities, within 3 months of its launch,” Derek Ng, communications director for Starbucks China, told AFP. Competition has also prompted Starbucks to focus on its more upmarket Reserve brand of rarer coffees from around the world, said Hu Yuwan, an analyst at Daxue Consulting in Shanghai. But the US chain has recently started doing discounts, Hu said, adding the coffee rivalry reminded her of the discount wars between Uber and its local rival Didi Chuxing, which later dislodged the American ride-hailing giant from the Chinese market. Schakel – who is also Luckin’s chief financial officer – says the startup can afford to burn money to grab market share over the next few years. “Are we competing with Starbucks? Probably to some extent. We don’t care whether the demand is coming from new coffee drinkers or from Starbucks coffee drinkers,” he said. China’s first coffee unicorn  Luckin’s caffeine-fuelled expansion has been funded by investors including Centurium Capital, a private equity fund founded by the former China head of Warburg Pincus, and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The company raised about $400 million in two rounds of funding last year and says it has been valued at $2.2 billion, making it the first coffee unicorn to come out of China. Schakel declined to comment on rumours that Luckin was seeking a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. But China’s landscape is littered with start-ups that have gone belly-up after bleeding money on discounts and aggressive advertising. “Am I worried whether we are going to go down that path? Absolutely not,” Schakel said. “Even if we sell our products at a discount at the right scale (it can) be profitable”. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/221874-philippine-competition-commission-fines-grab-january-2019/","title":"Antitrust body fines Grab Philippines anew","date":"Jan 25, 2019 11:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(3rd UPDATE) PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe explains the failure to submit the needed data 'prevented the PCC and the 3rd party body' from monitoring the pricing commitments","body":" MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Antitrust body the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) imposed a P6.5 million fine on ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines for violating its commitments to the agency over the Uber deal. When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the PCC warned of a “virtual monopoly” on the industry, therefore binding the ride-hailing firm to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. “We fined P6.5 million on Grab Philippines for submitting deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring of its compliance with its voluntary commitments,” said PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan on Friday, January 25. He said that Grab should be able to submit “correct, sufficient, consistent, and timely” data to be able to monitor pricing commitments. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe explained that the failure to submit the needed data “prevented the PCC and the 3rd party body’ from monitoring the pricing commitments. The data to be submitted should be able to determine whether Grab fares deviated from its usual pricing after Uber left. The decision was issued Tuesday, January 22 but Grab received it on Wednesday, January 23. The PCC said Grab should submit the necessary data 5 days after receipt of the order which will be on Monday, January 28. The ride-hailing giant has until February 7 to file a motion for reconsideration on the fine. The PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines. It chose top UK audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor Grab’s compliance. In October 2018, the anti-trust body had fined both Grab and Uber a combined P16 million for causing “undue difficulties” in the review of the acquisition deal. ‘We will appeal’ Grab Philippines in a statement Friday afternoon, January 25, said it will file a motion for reconsideration on the penalty. The ride-hailing giant said that it was “working under very limited timelines” to meet PCC’s deadline on the required pricing data after the Uber buyout. “Three out of 4 penalties were set at a maximum amount of P2 million pesos each. Given the breakdown of the fines vis-a-vis the severity of the lapses alleged by the PCC, we would like to better understand PCC’s rationale for imposing a maximum penalty,” Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. PCC said that Grab “did not have a complete set of historical pricing coefficient” which will be used to determine whether Grab fares deviated from its usual pricing after Uber left. PCC said “this was not made known” to them by the ride-hailing giant. In response, Grab said that it will reconcile their data structure with the PCC, “given enough time.” Grab assured that it is charging fares “within the range” allowed by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/221282-go-jek-invests-coins-ph/","title":"Indonesia’s Go-Jek invests in Coins.ph","date":"Jan 18, 2019 5:47 PM PHT","snippet":"Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go-Jek refuses to disclose the amount it has invested in Coins.ph, but says it is a 'substantial' acquisition of shares","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go-Jek announced on Friday, January 18, that it acquired a “substantial share” of Philippine digital wallet startup Coins.ph. In a statement, the Indonesian unicorn said that its payment platform “Go-Pay” will be working with Coins.ph in a bid to expand the latter’s cashless payment schemes. Coins.ph allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency and make digital payments on its platform. “Today’s announcement marks the start of our long-term commitment to the Philippines and a continuation of our mission to use technology to improve everyday lives and create a positive social impact,” said Nadiem Makarim, Go-Jek founder and CEO. Go-Jek did not disclose how much it invested in the Philippine startup. But according to the statement, the two firms intend to “work to enhance use cases and expand access to cashless payments and banking services, deepening financial inclusion in the Philippines.” The investment announcement came after Philippine regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board rejected Go-Jek’s ride-hailing services application over foreign ownership issues. The case can still be appealed. While a majority of Filipinos are active on social media, Google’s latest Southeast Asia internet economy study revealed that the Philippines has the lowest adoption of digital payment services at 21%. The country’s gross merchandise value generated by internet-based products only accounts for 1.6% of the gross domestic product – the lowest in the region, hence the most room for growth. “Together, we have a tremendous opportunity and by leveraging Go-Jek’s resources and expertise, we can give Filipinos even more convenience, choice, and access to the services they want,” said Coins.ph founder and CEO Ron Hose. Coins.ph said it currently has over 5 million registered customers in 5 years of operation, processing over 6 million transactions per month.

While most of the 21 “lapses” in government spending since 1976 left barely a scratch on economic growth, the length of this shutdown makes it harder to say just how bad the impact could get. “It’s not a hard stretch to say that initially it’s smaller and then it expands, the pain starts to widen,” Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings, told Agence France-Presse. “Think of it as a butterfly effect.” With about a quarter of the federal workforce affected, the shutdown is currently squeezing an estimated $1.2 billion a week out of the economy, Bovino said, but that figure could grow if it drags on. At the current rate, within two weeks it will have cost America more than the $5.7 billion US President Donald Trump is demanding for a wall on the border with Mexico, the dispute with Congress that led to the failure to pass funding for government operations. Following extended closures in 1995 and 2013, the US economy continued to grow while stock markets mainly went sideways. And gross domestic product (GDP) growth lost in one quarter can rebound in the next as the government springs back to life and workers recoup lost salaries. But some losses can never be recovered. In myriad but often unseen ways, the $4-trillion federal budget is felt in the daily lives of all Americans, well beyond the 800,000 government workers now going without pay – many of whom missed their first paychecks on Friday, January 11. Switching off even a part of the government means that life force quickly begins to bleed away. Payments to farmers and poor families, craft beer labels, food inspections, and economic data all have fallen victim to the budget impasse.  Meanwhile, tax refunds and borrower income verifications crucial to the mortgage industry were briefly up in the air with billions at stake. “The tentacles start to touch many avenues of life and that’s a very sad thing,” Bovino said. US Coast Guard cutters, their crews working without pay, on Monday, January 7, began icebreaking at commercial ports in the frigid waters of Great Lakes near the Canadian border so local steel mills can remain supplied with iron ore. Meanwhile, farmers cannot collect aid payments designed to help ease the pain caused by Trump’s trade war with China. Hurting the poorest most Small Business Administration loans to help mom-and-pop businesses trying to invest, hire, and grow have been delayed. There are no government loans for seeds or cattle feed and none of the regular Agriculture Department data about crop yields and commodity prices that farmers depend on to plan for the coming year. Permits from some oil and gas drilling – which feeds into GDP calculations – are delayed. Bloomberg estimates that government contractors are losing $200 million a day, cutting revenues for defense industry giants like Boeing, General Dynamics, and Leidos. Tourism at the country’s 400 national parks normally generates a reported $18 million a day, but with some parks unattended and many services halted, local restaurants, hotels, and shops are losing customers. Government assistance to feed the poorest Americans is funded through next month only. None of this includes the hardships felt by the 380,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or the 420,000 who are deemed “essential” but are working without pay. They owe an estimated $438 million a month in rent and mortgage payments, according to the real estate firm Zillow. Around the Washington region, home to about 20% of the federal work force, restaurants are sitting empty, taxis are idled, and traffic increasingly moves with eerie ease along the capital’s choked boulevards. Yingrui Huang, an engineer for a defense contractor at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, told Agence France-Presse his company is normally at work building weather satellites and telescopes for the government but is shuttered until further notice. To fight boredom, he is now driving for the mobile ride hailing service Lyft but said he was most concerned about hourly employees like janitors, cafeteria workers, and secretaries. “Their salaries are definitely lower than most of the engineering staff. They don’t get the limelight. We don’t think about them,” he said. Economic research on the last major shutdown in October 2013 found many federal workers were largely able to avoid sinking into debt – delaying mortgage payments and shifting balances between credit cards. But that shutdown lasted for barely two weeks – one pay cycle – and lawmakers at the time had quickly promised workers would receive back pay. “It’s possible that the effects will be greater for this shutdown,” University of Chicago economist Constantine Yannelis, who studied the 2013 shutdown, told Agence France-Presse. “The longer a shutdown lasts, the more persistent a change in habits you could see.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/220550-grab-philippines-adds-restaurants-food-delivery-menu/","title":"Grab adds 12 restaurants in its food delivery menu","date":"Jan 8, 2019 7:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Here are the international and homegrown food chains now part of GrabFood","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Heads up, foodies!

Velox’s article of incorporation showed that it is 99.99% owned by its parent company Velox South-East Asia Holdings which is Singaporean. This followed after the Department of Transportation issued Department Order (DO) 2017-11 in June 2018, which included transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) under modes recognized by the government as public transport. Previously, DO 2015-011 under the Aquino administration – which allowed TNVS to operate – only “recognized” ride-hailing services as “new forms of transport services.” Uber at that time was mostly foreign-owned, registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission as a telecommunications service under “foreign stock.” In a statement, Go-Jek said they will continue to work with Philippine government agencies to improve the transportation situation in the country. “We continue to engage positively with the LTFRB and other government agencies, as we seek to provide a much needed transport solution for the people of the Philippines,” Go-Jek told Rappler.

It also said that De Guzman’s family will “move forward with the ongoing court case” against both drivers involved in the crash.  “Grab will continue to cooperate with the authorities to help speed up the investigation of the case and to seek justice for Marko,” said the statement.

De Guzman suffered a traumatic brain injury and underwent surgery, but died a month after, on November 27.

It is a courteous and responsible driving behavior that will make the transportation sector safer every day.”  It then emphasized the importance of the mindfulness of all drivers on the road. “We strongly remind everyone to follow traffic rules and road safety measures, such as wearing seatbelts wherever you are seated, to ensure safer journeys everyday.” – Michael Bueza/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/219311-pinterest-ipo-2019-wall-street-journal-report/","title":"Pinterest planning 2019 stock market debut – report","date":"Dec 20, 2018 2:55 PM PHT","snippet":"It boasts more than 250 million monthly active users, with most of those 'pinners' outside the United States","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Popular online bulletin board Pinterest is getting ready for a stock market debut early next year at a valuation of $12 billion or more, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Pinterest brings in money from playing a role in online shopping and from advertising, but has not publicly shared details regarding how well those efforts have been paying off. The company pushes hard into e-commerce by enabling people to use smartphones to identify products they might wish to pursue.

And there are a million brands and providers to choose from – each wanting to offer you the best deal for their product or service. You may find yourself overwhelmed or confused with the number of choices and information available to you. But don’t panic just yet as online aggregators exist for this very reason. Online aggregators are websites or apps that collect information from different businesses and curate them to your needs. This allows you to compare the prices and features of products or services all in one location. For instance, you’re looking for the cheapest flight bound for Manila, an online travel aggregator will present you with some of the lowest priced flights from different airlines. Win-win deal These platforms profit from commission fees paid by sellers when they successfully connect a buyer. Both the buyer and seller have something to gain in the setup. From a buyer’s perspective, the search for a product or service that fit his or her needs is made simpler and faster. You no longer need to take the time to visit each individual seller’s website to find what you want. The seller, meanwhile, increases reach and exposure which could eventually bring in more buyers. Convenience A recent Google study on Southeast Asia’s internet economy cited online travel as the largest and most established among four sectors which also include online media, ecommerce, and ride hailing. Online travel accounted for over $30 billion in Southeast Asia’s internet economy and an estimated 41% of all travel bookings in the region this year were completed online. This is largely due to the popularity of online travel aggregators such as Agoda, Booking, and Traveloka who made it easy to book flights and hotel stays that cater to a consumer’s budget. Because of this, most people today begin their searches in aggregator platforms whenever they plan to go on a trip or vacation. “Online travel aggregators give travelers the ability to easily compare and find the best products and prices as well as the convenience to check availability and to complete the booking in one go,” the study said.  Instead of going to a travel agency or meeting a travel agent, online travel aggregators let you pull up your smartphone and book everything yourself. The Philippines currently has an online travel market worth $1.8 billion. It is forecasted to have a steady growth in the coming years and reach $5 billion by 2025. Consumer needs Online aggregators operate on the promise that they can help find what you need based on the information you provide. Some employ user feedback to help filter what people think are “good” from what is “bad”; while others use artificial intelligence to make recommendations on the best deals. These platforms also serve important roles as market curators, as explained by Tom Popomaronis of Forbes. This means that online aggregators often have specific criteria of who they choose to partner and affiliate themselves with based on what their consumers need. This cannot be more overstated in markets where numerous factors could influence a consumer’s decision to purchase. One is in the healthcare market where aggregators look to provide their consumers with the best plan for all their medical needs. Local healthcare aggregator Maria Health, for example, provides potential customers with options from their selection of partner health maintenance organizations when they inquire. From there, customers can decide what type of coverage they can get and for what cost. Another example is the real estate market where location, land area, and price range, all factor in a buyer’s decision. Lamudi, one of the most visited real estate portals in the country, has a network of thousands of licensed real estate brokers that list properties on the platform.  Given the widespread adoption of smartphones and the steady boom of online shopping, online aggregators can only get more popular in time. It has already solidified itself in online travel and will likely find its mark in other new online marketplaces. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/217371-grab-philippines-car-crash-marko-de-guzman-brain-injury/","title":"Grab rider suffers brain injury after car crash","date":"Nov 23, 2018 1:52 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines says it continues to reach out to Marko de Guzman's family but the latter says the offered assistance is not enough to cover the medical expenses","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A passenger of popular ride-hailing app Grab is fighting for his life after a car crash left him with traumatic brain injury.  Twenty-year-old Marko de Guzman booked a ride with a friend on October 26, when the driver supposedly fell asleep behind the wheel and crashed with another car in UN Avenue in Manila.

The Philippine internet economy, measured as gross market value (GMV), is currently at $5 billion, with Malaysia being the closest at $8 billion, and Indonesia leading the region at $27 billion. In the next 7 years, the Philippines’ internet economy will more than quadruple in size, reaching $21 billion by 2025. It follows the general trend for SEA, whose internet economy will collectively triple from $72 billion to $240 billion by 2025 – a projection that’s $40 billion higher than initial estimates.     Indonesia, the largest digital economy in the region, will continue its growth, also quadrupling from $27 billion in 2018 to a massive $100 billion in 2025 – more than double the next largest in the list, Thailand and its expected $43 billion internet economy in 2025. Indonesia has 150 million internet users in 2018, the most in the region. The Philippines has 75 million.  The study measured 4 verticals: e-commerce, ride-hailing, online travel, and online media. The study “does not include other sectors of the internet economy that are still in the early stages of development or lack reliable data sources, such as Education, Financial Services, Healthcare, and Social Commerce,” it said.  Increased regional tech investments, mobile data affordability The annual study, done in partnership with Singaporean holding company Temasek, is hopeful for the Philippines, however. It says that growth in the Philippines will be ushered in by increased focus and investments by startups and young regional e-companies that are already successful such as Singapore’s Grab and Shopee, and Lazada, owned by China’s Alibaba Group. “With increased focus and investments from regional unicorns and local startups, we estimate that the Philippines could ignite growth beyond 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and fully achieve its long-term potential,” the study said. “While the internet economy is growing in all six Southeast Asian countries covered in our research, the stage of development relative to the size of each country’s economy differs,” as pointed out in the study. “It has most room to grow in the Philippines.” The country’s gross merchandise value (GMV) generated by internet-based products only accounts for 1.6% of its gross domestic product (GDP) – the lowest in the region, hence the most room for growth.  The study describes the Philippines’ internet economy as “a relatively untapped opportunity,” having “not yet generated unicorns nor shown the dynamism of the Indonesian and Vietnamese markets.”  The Philippines also has the lowest adoption of digital payment services in the region at 21%, with only only one in five internet users in the Philippines using these services. Crucial too for the development of internet economy is the availability and affordability of mobile internet access. “In a region where more than 90% of the users connect to the internet via smartphones, the speed and affordability of mobile networks is critical for the development of a robust internet economy,” the study said.  Thankfully, it notes that “the cost of one gigabyte of mobile internet has more than halved relative to the income of Southeast Asians over the last four years.” Among the 6 countries though, the Philippines ranked 5th most expensive in terms of the cost of 1GB of mobile data relative to a person’s average income, according to the report.  Click here to read the full report. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/216180-grab-launches-food-service-crave-city-bonifacio-global-city/","title":"Grab launches food service, brings ‘Crave City’ to BGC","date":"Nov 7, 2018 10:27 PM PHT","snippet":"The service is available in Metro Manila and is currently being tested in Cebu City and Mandaue in Cebu with over 4,000 restaurants to choose from","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a bid to be the “everyday super app,” Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab officially launched “GrabFood” on Wednesday, November 7.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said on Monday, November 5, that the Euro-4 compliant tricycles aim to “fill in the gap for short-distance commute.”  “[GrabTrike] will fill in the short distance commute from the villages. The 3-wheeler would be able to service those areas in a much more efficient and budget-friendly manner,” Cu said. GrabTrike Premium is an upgrade from GrabTrike, which currently uses regular tricycles in Angeles, Pampanga, and in Balanga, Bataan. The firm will be fielding 2,000 Piaggio Ape units, a light commercial vehicle based on Vespa scooters. Since franchises for tricycles are under the supervision of local government units, Grab will be partnering with LGUs to roll out the service.  The Binalonan municipal government in Pangasinan is the first to adopt the premium tricycle service with 24 units. Cu said the fare scheme for GrabTrike Premium depends on the rates approved by the LGU, on top of a P10 booking fee which will go directly to the driver. For Binalonan, the local government approved a fare of P40 for the first two kilometers, and an additional P10 per succeeding kilometer. Modern transport More than being an “everyday app,” Grab aims for transportation modernization at its core, said Cu. The P185,000 Piaggio Ape can reach up to 38 kilometers on a liter of gas, which is Euro-4 compliant. Its transmission has reverse gear and has a maximum climb of 20.5% gradient – features a regular tricycle does not have. Because of the Piaggio Ape’s relatively low acquisition cost, Grab and AutoItalia offer easy ownership access with little to no equity to driver-operators. LGUs may also opt to partner with the ride-hailing firm to modernize their local tricycles. Grab said the package comes with a smartphone, preloaded with the app. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/215640-uber-overturn-bid-labor-ruling-united-kingdom/","title":"Uber wants to overturn UK ruling that drivers are employees","date":"Oct 31, 2018 12:41 PM PHT","snippet":"About 40,000 Uber drivers in the UK will not get the national minimum wage and paid holiday time if Uber succeeds in overturning the ruling","body":" LONDON, UK – Uber launched Tuesday, October 30, UK time, an attempt at England’s Court of Appeal to overturn a ruling that the ride-hailing app’s drivers are its workers rather than self-employed, as protestors rallied outside. Uber is trying to to overturn employment tribunal findings which could pave the way for tens of thousands of its drivers in Britain to receive the national minimum wage and paid holiday time. The US firm’s lawyers said the “agency model” – with Uber acting as an agent between self-employed drivers and passengers – has been used in the private hire industry “for many years”, and this had not been properly taken into account by the tribunal. Uber’s lawyer Dinah Rose said the company was not “unusual” in the industry, but “the Uber app enables it to operate on a much larger scale than traditional minicab companies”. A prior tribunal had found that former Uber drivers Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar had been its “workers.” Rose claimed that the “only legally proper conclusion” from the tribunal’s findings “was that the claimants were not employed as workers”. The company has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital. Outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, hundreds of “precarious workers” attended a demonstration organized by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents Aslam and Farrar. “Today’s action is the articulation of the legitimate rage of the precarious workers and the exploited workers of the UK,” said IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee.

The Philippine government officially opened the island 6 months after it was closed due to its environmental problems. After months-long rehabilitation efforts, Boracay’s powdery white shores are spotless, without a hint of green algae on its coastline. Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu also said that the fecal coliform level had significantly gone down during the closure. Business owners has also opened shops, but not all of them. Permits of some establishments were still on hold, pending compliance with environmental regulations. (READ: What to expect when Boracay reopens on October 26) Managing entry The crowd walking around the beachfront was a welcome sight to workers and residents. As early as 5 am Friday boats from mainland Aklan traveled to Cagban Jetty Port in Boracay to ferry people all excited to see the island come to life again. To manage the number of people entering the island, the government has separated the entrance for tourists and workers. The workers pass by the pontoon on the eastern side of the port, while the tourists take the usual entrance to the island. Authorities said this would more efficiently track the number of people entering Boracay. The island can only accommodate a total of 54,945 people at a time.  A new icon was also unveiled on Friday, set to welcome tourists as they arrive at Cagban Jetty Port. The icon shows the island’s famous Puka Beach, which is a boat away from Boracay. Modern transport Four modern jeepneys operated by Grab Philippines has started plying Boracay’s still-under-construction roads. This is part of the integrated plan of the Department of Transportation. Rides are free until the end of the year. By January 2019, the government would be charging P300 to P350 for the Hop-on, Hop-off service it would be offering.  Booking e-trikes will soon be hassle-free, as ride-hailing firm HirNa will also launch the service in the coming months. Cagban Road On Friday, government officials, led by Public Works Secretary Mark Villar, officially opened a part of the 4.1-kilometer Circumferential Road. The 2.66-kilometer Cagban Road stretches from the port to Hue Hotel, offering a wider street to motorists and pedestrians. The road is 12-meter wide, with enough space for sidewalks to encourage walking. Villar said the full alignment of Circumferential Road would be open by December, while construction work would be completed by April 2019. Closure President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Boracay closed in an effort to curb overdevelopment and crack down on establishments violating environmental regulations. The Philippine government imposed measures to prevent a relapse, regulating establishments’ permits, putting a cap on the number of visitors, and issuing anti-beach boozing rules. While rehabilitation efforts have yet to be completed, officials said sustaining the “new” Boracay is still a “shared responsibility.” “It is about balancing development and protecting the environment. Not just for Boracay alone, but also for other island destinations around the country,” top cop Oscar Albayalde said, reminding the new environmental compliance volunteers in Boracay of their dutry. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/215026-united-states-revokes-saudi-visas/","title":"U.S. revokes Saudi visas in first action over Khashoggi","date":"Oct 24, 2018 8:35 AM PHT","snippet":"The State Department says it has identified 21 Saudis whose visas will either be revoked or who will be ineligible for future visas","body":" WASHINGTON DC, USA – The United States said Tuesday, October 23, it was revoking visas of Saudis involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as President Donald Trump ridiculed the kingdom’s response as “one of the worst cover-ups” in history. The move came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudis’ Istanbul consulate had been meticulously planned, in a speech that overshadowed a long-planned investment forum in Riyadh. Saudi leaders have denied involvement in the killing, pushing responsibility down the chain of command. (READ: How Turkey says the Khashoggi murder happened) Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “strongly said that he had nothing to do with this, this was at a lower level,” US President Donald Trump said, adding he had spoken Monday, October 22, to the prince and his father King Salman. Trump said the Saudis had a “very bad original concept” in killing the 59-year-old Saudi insider-turned-critic. “It was carried out poorly and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups,” Trump said. “It was a total fiasco,” he later added. Faced with mounting calls for tough measures by US lawmakers across the political spectrum, the State Department said it had identified 21 Saudis whose visas would either be revoked or who would be ineligible for future visas. “These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. “We are making very clear that the United States does not tolerate this kind of action to silence Mr. Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence,” he said. The top US diplomat said the Saudi suspects came from “the intelligence services, the royal court, the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries.” Pompeo added the United States was also looking into whether to take action under a law named after Sergei Magnitsky, the anti-corruption accountant who died in Russian custody, that would impose financial sanctions on individuals behind Khashoggi’s death. The initial US action against the Saudis came 3 weeks after Khashoggi, self-exiled to suburban Washington, vanished in the consulate and following contradictory statements by Trump, who has ruled out major steps such as cutting arms sales to the major defense partner. ‘Brutal murder’ Vice President Mike Pence, in an appearance at The Washington Post, where Khashoggi was a contributing opinion writer, denounced the “brutal murder.” He added Erdogan’s account – the most substantive remarks on the case by the Turkish leader – “flies in the face” of the Saudis’ earlier assertions. Saudi Arabia – whose ambitious crown prince has been amassing power – initially claimed Khashoggi left freely after visiting the consulate, where he was completing paperwork for his upcoming marriage. But as pressure grew, Saudi state media changed the story and said Khashoggi died when an argument descended into a fistfight, an account that was swiftly denounced overseas even if Trump initially said he found it credible. Erdogan said that a 15-person team came from Riyadh to kill Khashoggi, carrying out reconnaissance outside Istanbul and deactivating security cameras at the consulate. He said 18 suspects detained by Saudi Arabia should be extradited to Istanbul to face trial  and called for an investigation into those with “even the slightest link” to the case. The Turkish leader did not mention some of the most striking claims that appeared in the Turkish press in recent days, notably that Khashoggi’s body was cut up into multiple pieces, and that there is an audio recording of the murder. However, he did confirm a Saudi official played the role of body double for Khashoggi, wearing the journalist’s clothes upon leaving the consulate to pretend to be the dead man. The whereabouts of Khashoggi’s corpse remain unknown. Turkish police were searching an abandoned car belonging to the Saudi consulate in an underground car park in the Sultangazi district of Istanbul. ‘Many questions unanswered’ Jana Jabbour, a professor at Sciences Po university in Paris, said the fact Erdogan did not opt for sharper rhetoric against Riyadh suggested the two nations were talking behind the scenes. “Erdogan’s very moderate speech shows that a deal has been reached,” she told Agence France-Presse (AFP). But allies remained alarmed. The Group of Seven industrial nations said in a joint statement that the killing left “many questions unanswered.” Denmark also summoned the Saudi ambassador over the case. The murder has shone the spotlight on the Mohammed bin Salman, who was credited with a reform drive in the kingdom, but is now accused of ordering Khashoggi’s killing. A key investment summit, dubbed “Davos in the desert,” was overshadowed by big-name cancellations as it kicked off in Riyadh. Dozens of executives, including from banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and ride-hailing app Uber pulled out of the 3-day Future Investment Initiative.

Erdogan had promised that his speech in Ankara would give the “naked truth” about the killing and he gave a host of new details while still saying Turkey wanted answers to key questions, including who gave the orders. Hours before Erdogan delivered his speech to ruling party lawmakers, a major Saudi investment forum opened in Riyadh under the heavy shadow of the murder after key delegates pulled out. The murder of the Washington Post contributor has damaged the international reputation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who has spearheaded a reform drive in the kingdom. “My demand is that 18 people be tried in Istanbul,” Erdogan said in a speech to ruling party lawmakers in Ankara, referring to 18 people including security officials who have already been detained by Riyadh. He added that “all those who played a role in the murder” had to face punishment. Erdogan said that the murder was “planned” days in advance according to a “roadmap” set up by a Saudi team who were sent to Istanbul for the purpose. The surveillance system at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was deactivated on purpose, he said. “First they (the Saudis implicated) removed the hard disc from the camera system,” Erdogan said. “This is a political murder,” he added. But Erdogan added he still wanted answers on numerous issues including “who gave orders” to the team and where the corpse is. Erdogan did not mention Prince Mohammed by name in the speech but said he was confident of the full cooperation of his father Saudi King Salman in the probe. ‘Must never happen again’  Saudi Arabia only confirmed the killing more than two weeks after the event. The killing has alarmed even Saudi Arabia’s staunchest Western allies. US President Donald Trump said he was “not satisfied” with Riyadh’s explanations. A former royal family insider turned critic of the Saudi crown prince, Khashoggi, 59, disappeared after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to collect a document for his upcoming marriage. The case has shone the spotlight on the crown prince, who was credited with reforms including giving women the right to drive but is now accused of having ordered Khashoggi’s murder – a claim Riyadh denies. The timing of the controversy could not be worse for Prince Mohammed as the investment summit, dubbed “Davos in the desert,” began in Riyadh, overshadowed by big name cancellations and Erdogan’s threat of revelations. Dozens of executives, including from banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, ride-hailing app Uber and Western officials such as International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde have pulled out of the three-day Future Investment Initiative (FII). French energy giant Total’s head Patrick Pouyanne, however, said he would attend the meeting, arguing that “empty chair politics” do not advance human rights. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would not export arms to Riyadh “in the current situation,” despite Germany’s approval last month of $480 million worth of arms exports in 2018. Despite also pulling out of the summit, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met the crown prince behind closed doors for bilateral talks in Riyadh. CIA Director Gina Haspel, meanwhile, headed for Turkey, although details of her trip were not immediately clear. White House advisor and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, believed to have close ties with the crown prince, said he had urged him to be “fully transparent”, stressing that “the world is watching”.

Upping the pressure on Riyadh, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to reveal the “naked truth” on Tuesday about the Khashoggi case. The Washington Post contributor, 59, was murdered almost 3 weeks ago after stepping inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. After over two weeks of near silence, Saudi Arabia finally admitted Khashoggi was killed in the consulate but the kingdom’s explanations are seen by friends and foes alike as contradictory and evasive. The case has shone the spotlight on Crown Prince Mohammed. He has spearheaded a reform drive for the kingdom but now faces a stream of allegations – denied by Riyadh – that he ordered the killing of Khashoggi. CNN International broadcast images it said showed a Saudi official playing the role of a body double for Khashoggi, wearing his clothes while leaving the consulate in an apparent bid to falsely show the journalist had left safely. US President Donald Trump, who has resisted pressure to curb arms sales to Saudi Arabia, initially said Riyadh’s version of events was credible but then accused the kingdom of lying. ‘Enemy of Turkey’  The spokesman of Erdogan’s ruling party Omer Celik said the killing “was planned in an extremely savage manner.” It was the first official indication that Ankara believes a murder plan was coordinated in advance. “We are faced with a situation where there has been a lot of effort to whitewash this,” he complained. One of Erdogan’s advisors, Yasin Aktay, wrote in the Yeni Safak daily that the Saudi version given so far “feels like our intelligence is being mocked”. Turkish pro-government media kept up a steady stream of allegations, which analysts see as a tactic to increase the pressure on Riyadh by showing the evidence Turkey possesses. Yeni Safak said Saudi security official Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, head of a team of 15 Saudis sent to Istanbul for the task, called the head of Prince Mohammed’s office, Bader al-Asaker, “four times after the murder”. Abdulkadir Selvi, whose Hurriyet newspaper columns are closely watched for indications of Erdogan’s thinking, wrote that Khashogghi was slowly strangled to death for 8 minutes and a Saudi forensic specialist then cut his body into 15 pieces while listening to music. “We cannot close this file until the crown prince is brought to account and removed from his post. For 50 years we cannot live with a crown prince who is an enemy of Turkey,” said Selvi. Meanwhile with Khashoggi’s remains still missing, Turkish police found an abandoned car belonging to the Saudi consulate in an underground car park in the Sultangazi district of Istanbul, state media said. ‘Naked truth’  Erdogan has stopped short of directly pointing the finger at Riyadh. Analysts say he preferred to authorize the leak of incriminating information to pro-government media to pressure the kingdom. He has twice held telephone talks with King Salman on the crisis, with some analysts arguing Erdogan was seeking to preserve Turkish-Saudi relations through the ageing monarch while sidelining his headstrong son Prince Mohammed. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, the smooth former envoy to Washington and fluent English speaker, on Sunday appeared on Fox News to blame a “rogue operation” by individuals who “exceeded their responsibilities” and then “tried to cover up for it”. “We are determined to find out all the facts. And we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder,” he said, denying any link to the crown prince. Saudi’s official news agency said both King Salman and Prince Mohammed had phoned Khashoggi’s son Salah to express their condolences. Saudi investment summit hit  Khashoggi went to the consulate on October 2 to get documents for his wedding to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz.

Drivers will be fully equipped with first aid kits and safety training guides. Grab also entered into a collaboration with the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for crime and accident prevention. Grab, together with the PDEA and the LTFRB, will synchronize efforts to prevent the delivery of packages containing illegal drugs. The partnership also aims to identify and report timely intelligence information for anti-drug operations as well as keep the ride-hailing service drug-free. Grab will also conduct road safety, anti-carnapping, and other anti-criminal seminars and training with the PNP-HPG. “Safety in the TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry should be a collaborative effort between transport network companies, government agencies, driver-partners, and passengers. Our passengers and driver-partners deserve a safer ride-sharing industry,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. Analytics for safety The roadmap also features enhancements on Grab’s driver platform, which tracks driver fatigue for them to “learn their driving patterns” and “identify how to drive more safely.” The driver fatigue monitoring system gives drivers reports on their patterns, such as in speeding, acceleration, and braking. The firm said there has been a 50% reduction in speeding incidents and a 20% reduction in hard braking and sudden acceleration since it rolled out the feature. “Our goal is to bring to zero the number of incidents that are completely preventable, and as far as possible, reduce the number of road accidents. Key to achieving our goal is to make it easy for users to make an actual change to their road behavior habits,” said Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling.

For instance, people are bombarded along EDSA with too much information, at times irrelevant to them.  On the other hand, advertisers are unable to reach their intended audience due to saturation and visual fatigue. A start-up in the Philippines claims it may have found the solution, and says it’s a win for both advertisers and consumers: facial recognition. {source} <iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHLdIOip8yA” frameborder=”0″ allow=”autoplay; encrypted-media” allowfullscreen></iframe> {/source}   How it works Tech start-up AdMov installs tablets in the backseats of cars of ride-hailing services like Grab. The drivers apply for the installation and get incentives for every playback of advertisement on the tablet.  But the magic begins once a passenger hops on the car. The tablets use their cameras to scan the faces of passengers in the backseat. Using facial recognition technology, the tablets can estimate the gender, age, and even mood of the passenger. Using the information generated, the tablet then is able to curate the appropriate content and advertisements that are intended for the passenger.  “When we show ads, it gives data to advertisers as well. We use this for targeting and for brands. There is no wastage,” said Bobby Cristuta, co-founder of AdMov. The artificial intelligence (AI) software also takes into consideration the location of the vehicle. For instance, if one is in Pasig City, it shows a presentation that features a brief history of the area.  For advertising purposes, it also shows passengers recommended restaurants. If one is near malls or passing through EDSA, the tablet can also alert passengers if there are sales nearby. Ellard Capiral, founder and CEO of AdMov, said that they offer a “right mix” of advertising and “meaningful content” to keep the passengers glued on to the screen. “The program also tracks eyeballs. If you are no longer paying attention to the ad, we mix it up and offer content like trivia and that pulls the passenger’s attention back,” Capiral said. Security concerns Since the technology uses the camera and facial recognition, is there a privacy breach? Capiral and Cristuta claimed there is none, since it only scans and approximates the age, gender, and mood of passengers. “We do not store photos and videos, the camera is there just to scan. Advertisers only have access to estimates, but they won’t see your face,” Cristuta said. They also claimed that their legal team ensured that the technology does not breach the provisions of the data security act. (READ: Data privacy 101: What businesses should know about systems registration) AdMov’s tablets are currently installed in some 500 ride-sharing vehicles in the Philippines. They plan to expand to Singapore and Taiwan next year.  Trends and future applications Based on the data-driven advertising approach, AdMov is able to provide a “geekier” insight on consumer behavior. “We had a client that was able to tweak their advertisement to have more impact through the analytics,” Cristuta said.  They also found that the trivial and funny are a big hit for consumers. “We also screen the ads and content. If we feel the ad does not fit in our lineup of content, we outright reject and do not include it since we want the attention of passengers. If it does not catch attention, it hurts our other advertisers as well,” Capiral said. The company says they see the future of their technology for news applications as well. “If a passenger passes through an area and there is a major accident or fire there, they can be alerted. But we need more partners for that type of content,” Cristuta said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/214808-saudi-arabia-host-davos-in-desert-despite-outcry-slain-journalist/","title":"Saudi to host ‘Davos in desert’ despite outcry over slain journalist","date":"Oct 21, 2018 12:33 PM PHT","snippet":"Billed last year as an economic coming-out party for the conservative petro-state, the 'Future Investment Initiative' now symbolizes global outrage over the silencing of critics","body":" RIYADH, Saudi Arabia – Saudi Arabia will host a key investment summit on Tuesday, October 23, overshadowed by the killing of critic Jamal Khashoggi that has prompted a wave of policymakers and corporate giants to withdraw. Just ahead of the 3-day Future Investment Initiative (FII), dubbed “Davos in the desert”, the kingdom sought to defuse the crisis with an about-face admission on Saturday, October 20 that the journalist died in its consulate in Istanbul. But that has failed to stem an exodus from the summit, whose organizers have taken down a list of speakers from its website. Dozens of executives – from bankers at JP Morgan to carmaker Ford and ride-hailing app Uber – scrapped plans to attend. Media powerhouses like Bloomberg, CNN and the Financial Times have also pulled out and on Saturday, Australia withdrew its representatives, saying it was “no longer appropriate” to attend, due to the Khashoggi affair. On Saturday, organizers said more than 120 speakers and moderators will participate. Last Monday, they had listed more than 150 speakers. The event seeks to project the historically insular kingdom as a lucrative business destination, in a bid to diversify its oil-reliant economy and set the stage for new ventures and multi-billion dollar contracts. At last year’s inaugural FII – a star-studded event at Riyadh’s glittering Ritz-Carlton hotel – Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was lionized as a visionary as he wowed investors with talking robots and plans for a futuristic mega-city called NEOM. Billed last year as an economic coming-out party for the conservative petro-state, the FII has now come to symbolize global outrage over the silencing of critics. The prince, widely known as MBS, faces what the risk consultancy Eurasia Group calls “an acute public relations crisis”. Khashoggi, who had criticized Prince Mohammed, was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. After weeks of vehement denials, the kingdom’s assertion on Saturday that the journalist was killed in a “brawl and fist fight” inside the consulate – without revealing the whereabouts of his body – was met with skepticism around the world. “The Ubers and JP Morgans of the world have calculated that the cost of being currently associated with brand MBS is higher than the cost of losing out on taking a slice of Saudi Arabia’s economy,” said Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the Royal United Services Institute. (Khashoggi fallout: Saudi conference no-shows) Investor uncertainty Many Western firms have too much at stake to abandon the Arab world’s biggest economy, and many are preparing to send lower-level executives to the summit. Senior investment bankers from HSBC and Credit Suisse are planning to attend the conference even though their chief executives have cancelled their attendance, Bloomberg News reported. Companies from China and Russia have shown little interest in withdrawing from the event, an organizer said. Although several Western leaders like International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde have pulled out, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan will attend the forum as Islamabad continues to seek funding to plug its deteriorating finances. But a wider Western boycott of the conference suggests rising political risks in Saudi Arabia that could cast a shadow over foreign direct investment, which a UN body said plunged last year to a 14-year low. “Despite talk of reform, FDI inflows into Saudi have stayed low and the (Khashoggi) scandal will only increase investor uncertainty,” said research firm Capital Economics. For now, the kingdom’s finances appear well cushioned by a recent spike in oil prices, now over $80 (70 euros) per barrel, which analysts say has reduced the urgency for outside funding. “More speculative projects, like NEOM, will find it harder to attract investors, but ‘meat and potatoes’ diversification through heavy industry will probably continue unabated,” said Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics. ‘Business as usual?’ Khashoggi’s killing fits a pattern of a recent crackdown on dissent in the kingdom, with Prince Mohammed, King Salman’s son and the de facto ruler, arresting clerics, business high-fliers and women activists. Further stoking investor anxiety, the kingdom is embroiled in an expensive war in Yemen and is leading an embargo against Qatar. Riyadh has also engaged in diplomatic disputes with Germany and Canada that threatened business ties. “Cancellations at ‘Davos in the Desert’ by the likes of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and BlackRock go beyond reputational issues,” said Cinzia Bianco, a Middle East analyst at Gulf State Analytics. “Big businesses are telling MBS ‘enough with the adventurism, instability and uncertainty –- our big foes.'” But western companies abandoning Saudi are causing “irreparable damage” to their own business interests in the kingdom, said Ghanem Nuseibeh, founder of London-based risk consultancy Cornerstone Global Associates who has vigorously defended the kingdom’s stand on Khashoggi. “It will soon be business as usual,” he said. Last week, pro-Saudi business figures on social media called for Gulf countries and allies of Riyadh to boycott companies that have pulled out of the FII. But the apparent arm twisting has not stopped the outcry over Khashoggi. “Business as usual?” said Gregory Gause, Saudi specialist at Texas A&M University. “Not in the short-term.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/214502-philippine-competition-commission-fines-grab-philippines-over-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust watchdog fines Grab P16 million over Uber deal","date":"Oct 17, 2018 11:08 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Philippine Competition Commission slaps Grab with a fine of P12 million and Uber with P4 million for causing 'undue difficulties' to the review of their deal","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the country’s antitrust watchdog, imposed P16-million ($296,741) worth of penalties on ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines for failing to maintain operations before it acquired Uber. When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the PCC warned of a “virtual monopoly” of the industry. The commission launched its own review of the acquisition deal between the two companies, which led to PCC imposing interim measures. Following the review, the PCC slapped Grab with a fine of P12 million ($222,586) and Uber with P4 million ($74,195) for causing “undue difficulties” to the review. (READ: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?) “While we’re reviewing [the deal], you revert first to your pre-merger situation. Why? Two things: Don’t prejudice our ability to impose remedies. It also prejudiced our ability to make an assessment of the situation,” PCC Commissioner Stella Luz Quimbo said. “If you want to exit the market, you can sell of course. But don’t do it right away. In this situation, when Grab purchased Uber, Uber already exited. We would have a more difficult time imposing the possible solution. That’s why we said come back first,” Quimbo added. On April, the PCC released interim measures while they were reviewing the Grab-Uber deal. Quimbo said that the ride-hailing companies violated two measures, for a total of 10 counts. Under the law, PCC can impose penalties of, at most, P2 million ($37,097) per violation, which led to the P16-million total. The PCC left it to both firms on how they will settle the penalty. The order, which was sent to Grab on October 11, can still be appealed. The ride-hailing firm must submit a motion for reconsideration 15 days since receipt. Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales said in a statement on Wednesday, October 17, that the firm is still “studying all legal options.” “We are currently studying all our legal options with regard to the fine imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission. We will continue to provide additional information as it becomes available,” Gonzales said. In August, the PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines. It chose top UK audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor Grab’s compliance. – Rappler.com *$1= P53.91"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/214433-twitter-war-angkas-drivers-supporting-bong-go-certificate-candidacy-filing/","title":"Twitter war erupts over Angkas drivers supporting Bong Go","date":"Oct 16, 2018 2:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Would you stop using a company's products or services if they become affiliated with a politician or political stance?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Should a group of Angkas motorcycle drivers show their support for a politician while in uniform?   Netizens expressed outrage when Twitter user @heycaloy shared photos on Monday, October 15, of Angkas motorcycle drivers banding together in front of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) main office in Manila.

On Monday, October 15, the government partially opened Boracay to locals for a dry run of the soft launch on October 26. The island was ordered closed for 6 months starting April 26 due to environmental problems. Government officials on Monday also unveiled e-trikes and modern vehicles that will soon ply Boracay roads, in a bid to alleviate traffic congestion in the island. These are part of the integrated transport system project of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) in Boracay. Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said the vehicles are compliant with the specifications under the public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program. (IN PHOTOS: How new jeepneys, buses, tricycles could look like) The more environment-friendly options, he said, would “protect and sustain” the beauty of the famed island by reducing the carbon footprint from transportation. Hop-on, hop-off Come October 26, Boracay residents and visitors will be able to ride a hop-on, hop-off bus for free until the end of the year. The DOTr has worked with ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines to bring in 50 modern vehicles that would offer the services. On Monday, Grab initially provided 4 buses as part of its P100-million investment for transportation in the island.  By January 2019, Tugade said passengers would be using either a card or a wristband to pay their fare, under an integrated fare collection system similar to Beep which is used for Metro Manila railways. The fare is P300 per person, which will be good for 3 days with unlimited rides. Tugade said rides for minors below 12 years old, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be free. The vehicles are equipped with Wi-Fi, a closed-circuit television camera (CCTV), and a global positioning system (GPS). Tugade said having a single operator in the island would help regulate traffic. The buses will only be allowed to stop at certain waiting sheds. The DOTr will also work with Grab to construct at least 20 sheds.   Solar-powered shuttle Tourists also have another option – Southwest Travel & Tours will be shuttling passengers through solar-powered vehicles. These vehicles do not have air-conditioning.  E-trikes Another ride-hailing firm, Hirna, will also offer transport services within the island. Unlike Grab which is providing the vehicles, Hirna will function as a fleet manager for hailing electric tricycles (e-trikes) – much like how it functions now for booking taxis. The Department of Energy will donate 200 e-trikes to the Malay local government, under an Asian Development Bank-funded project which costs P1.73 billion.  Tugade said drivers for the e-trikes will be hired to provide jobs to those affected by Boracay’s closure. These e-trikes will operate in addition to the nearly 600 e-trikes currently in the island. Starting last August, the local government had already shifted to e-trikes. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/214310-saudi-arabia-vows-retaliation-punished-jamal-khashoggi-disappearance/","title":"Saudi Arabia vows retaliation if punished over missing critic","date":"Oct 14, 2018 8:26 PM PHT","snippet":"An official source says Saudi Arabia will 'respond to any action with a bigger one'","body":" DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Saudi Arabia warned Sunday, October 14, it would retaliate against any sanctions imposed on the oil-rich kingdom over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as the Riyadh stock market suffered its worst plunge in years. From tech tycoons to media giants, a host of Western companies are now distancing themselves from the Gulf state, imperilling Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s much-hyped economic reform drive. US President Donald Trump threatened ally Saudi Arabia on Saturday, October 13, with “severe punishment” if Khashoggi, who has been critical of Prince Mohammed, was killed inside its Istanbul mission. But Riyadh vowed to hit back against any action against it. “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats or attempts to undermine it whether through threats to impose economic sanctions or the use of political pressure,” an official source said, quoted by state news agency SPA. He said Riyadh would “respond to any action with a bigger one,” pointing out that the oil superpower “plays an effective and vital role in the world economy”. As investors took fright, Saudi stocks tumbled by around 7% at one point on Sunday, wiping out their gains for 2018. Business barons including British billionaire Richard Branson and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, as well as media powerhouses like Bloomberg and CNN, have pulled out of next week’s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, dubbed “Davos in the desert”. ‘Baseless allegations’ Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor, vanished after entering the consulate on October 2 to obtain official documents for his upcoming marriage. Turkey on Saturday stepped up pressure on Saudi Arabia by accusing the kingdom of failing to cooperate with a probe into the journalist’s disappearance. Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi was killed inside the mission and claims have been leaked to media that he was tortured and even dismembered. Saudi Arabia insists Khashoggi left the building safely and dismissed accusations that authorities had ordered his murder by a hit squad as “lies and baseless allegations.” The kingdom’s Tadawul All-Shares Index (TASI) lost more than 500 points in the first two hours after trading resumed after the weekend, in panic selling similar reminiscent of the days after the global financial crisis in 2008. It clawed back some losses by mid-session but was still down by 5%, the worst single-day drop in about 3 years, trading at a 10-month low of 7,167 points. The index had already dropped 3% on Thursday, following a rout on world stock markets fuelled by worries about higher interest rates and US President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve. Mohammed Zidan, market strategist at Thinkmarket in Dubai, said the drop in Saudi stocks was the result of panic selling because of several political and economic factors. “There has been a kind of uncertainty surrounding the situation of the disappearance of Khashoggi which has caused the market to fall,” Zidan told Agence France-Presse. “The withdrawal of top participants from the Riyadh investment conference has also negatively impacted traders’ sentiment,” he said. Public relations crisis The pullouts have cast a pall on the annual summit at which Prince Mohammed wowed investors last year with talking robots and blueprints for a futuristic mega city. The withdrawal of Uber’s Khosrowshahi from the event is particularly symbolic as the kingdom’s vast Public Investment Fund (PIF) has invested $3.5 billion in the ride-hailing app. Branson, who dropped two directorships linked to Saudi tourism projects around the Red Sea, said claims about Khashoggi’s disappearance would “change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government”. Global multinational corporations “see potential in a developing market like Saudi Arabia, but for many the reputational risk of being associated with FII outweighs the potential gains from the Saudi economy,” said Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert at the Royal United Services Institute. Washington lobbying firm Harbour group which represented the Saudi government, has also terminated its $80,000 per month contract. “We (have) ended the relationship,” Richard Mintz, managing director of the firm, told Agence France-Presse. The Saudi leadership faces “an acute public relations crisis” over Khashoggi’s disappearance, said consultancy group Eurasia.  “The leadership will now have to manage a more serious threat to its economic liberalisation strategy,” Eurasia said. “At this point, Saudi Arabia will find it incredibly challenging to contain the emerging crisis.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/213938-uk-audit-firm-audit-grab-philippines-pricing-service-quality/","title":"Top UK audit firm to monitor Grab pricing, service quality","date":"Oct 10, 2018 10:20 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Philippine Competition Commission chief Arsenio Balisacan says Smith & Williamson 'will serve as our eyes and ears on the ground'","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has chosen UK-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to monitor ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines.

It handled high-profile cases such as the Lufthansa-Singapore Airlines joint-venture case and Times Publishing Limited’s acquisition of British publisher Penguin. The Competition & Consumer Commission of Singapore had tapped it to monitor how Grab and Uber should operate while the CCCS investigated the deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In August, the PCC approved the Grab-Uber deal but bound Grab to commitments, as if Uber were still operating in the Philippines:  In a statement on Wednesday, Grab Philippines said it found Smith & Williamson “truly fair and independent” based on the latter’s their previous engagement in Singapore. It was Grab that submitted Smith & Williamson as a nominee to the PCC, along with another firm. “Grab is satisfied with the decision of the PCC, appointing Smith & Williamson as the independent third party monitor trustee,” Leo Gonzales, Grab’s public affairs head said. “We are looking forward to collaborating with them as we intend to fully conform with and fulfill the voluntary commitments we have submitted to the PCC for the entire duration of the agreed compliance period,” he added. The PCC launched its own review of the acquisition deal between the two companies. The review was suspended when Grab submitted voluntary commitments in June that would address the antitrust watchdog’s concerns. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/213551-will-go-jek-company-enter-philippines/","title":"Will Indonesia ride-hailing giant Go-Jek enter PH?","date":"Oct 6, 2018 5:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The multibillion-dollar firm plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis in 3 Philippine cities as part of its $500-million overseas expansion drive","body":"AT A GLANCE Part 1: Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms? MANILA, Philippines – Indonesian ride-hailing giant Go-Jek is poised to expand its services in Southeast Asia, bringing its rivalry with Grab to the Philippines. Go-Jek started in Indonesia in 2010 as a call center for on-demand “ojek” or motorcycle taxi service. Two years after it launched its ride-hailing app, it became a unicorn in the industry. Currently valued at about $5 billion, Go-Jek functions as a “superapp,” offering services ranging from rides, logistics, and bills payment, among others. Operating in 66 cities in Indonesia, it is backed by deep-pocketed investors in the tech scene such as Google, Chinese technology giants Tencent, and JD.com; as well as Singaporean investment company Temasek. Go-Jek seeks to expand to Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines by yearend as part of its $500-million overseas expansion. Go-Jek opened shop in Vietnam in August, capturing 35% of the market in just 6 weeks. In the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia, Grab remains the dominant player for ride-hailing services, after Uber exited the region.  There are 7 other ride-hailing firms in the Philippines – Hype, Owto, Hirna, MiCab, Go Lag, ePickMeUp, and U-Hop – poised to challenge Grab but have been struggling to do so. The entry of the new players was seen as an opportunity to break Grab’s dominance in the country. Does Go-Jek stand a chance in the Philippine market? Applications in limbo? As early as May, Go-Jek expressed interest to enter the Philippines and met with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada expressed concerns then, saying that the entry of a foreign firm “would displace” the new local transport network companies (TNCs). Go-Jek plans to introduce ride-hailing services for sedans, SUVs, AUVs, and taxis around Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao. The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-016 on August 9, freezing accreditation applications for new TNCs. It said it issued the order so it can focus on the pending applications and to monitor existing players. As of the MC’s publication, there were 5 firms listed vying for accreditation. Go-Jek was not on the list. “All applicants with applications for TNC accreditation pending before the pre-accreditation committee are hereby directed to submit their complete and compliant requirements within 10 days of receipt or on August 5, whichever is later, otherwise their applications shall be denied by the committee,” the order said. The order was effective August 29. {source}<iframe class=”scribd_iframe_embed” title=”LTFRB Memorandum Circular 2018-016″ src=”https://www.scribd.com/embeds/389914607/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-rCmHfY18iidmGdeqDmcv&show_recommendations=true” data-auto-height=”false” data-aspect-ratio=”0.706342991386061″ scrolling=”no” id=”doc_97777″ width=”100%” height=”600″ frameborder=”0″></iframe>{/source} In previous messages to the media, the LTFRB said that Go-Jek’s application was “on hold,” as it passed its accreditation papers on August 13 – days after the memorandum circular was issued. Rappler clarified this with LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III, noting that Go-Jek’s submission date was before the MC’s effectivity date. Delgra said that Go-Jek “did not apply” but Velox Technology Philippines did, along with two other firms. Velox is the local subsidiary of Go-Jek. “The memorandum circular sets a deadline as to when they can file their accreditation requirements. They were able to make the cut. It is Velox applying,” Delgra told Rappler in a phone interview.  The regulatory board chief said the fate of the applications rests on the pre-accreditation committee. There are 4 firms awaiting evaluation of the committee while one has a pending resolution on its application. “The deliberations are ongoing. They are set to deliberate the first 4. The remaining 3 will be deliberated hopefully starting next year,” Delgra said. More competition Some local TNCs have expressed some reservation over the possible entry of another multibillion-dollar company in the Philippine ride-hailing market. But Go-Jek believes that competition drives other firms to give better services to its customers. “Go-Jek does not believe in a winner-takes-all approach to ride-hailing. That enough space exists for many different approaches and ideas from companies both large and small,” Go-Jek said in a statement sent to Rappler. “Smaller companies have more of a chance to succeed, learn, and grow in a competitive market, than a market with a single player controlling most of the market,” it added. Go-Jek was awaiting for the LTFRB’s green light “before anything else,” such as hiring employees for its local operations. “Go-Jek is ready and waiting to provide the Philippines with a new mobility solution as soon as we are given the go-ahead,” it said. Economist JC Punongbayan said that Go-Jek’s entry would be healthy for the market, given that new players have yet to make a difference in the market. “We should actually embrace Go-Jek’s entry as a way for our local competitors to innovate. It has been a major player in Indonesia for quite some time. It could bring its expertise in technology and inform policies,” Punongbayan said. He added that another big player would hopefully help bring down the average prices of ride-hailing services, as the firms would compete for riders. On the part of the consumers, Laban Konsyumer Incorporated president Vic Dimagiba said that the best way is still to open up the market. “If you really want the consumer to have better choices, then open up the market with those as good as Grab. But of course, we don’t know yet what will happen to the smaller companies,” Dimagiba, a former trade undersecretary, told Rappler. Bring in what works Was the LTFRB right in freezing the accreditation application of TNCs? The antitrust body Philippine Competition Commission would agree on some points. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo acknowledged Grab’s dominance over the 7 other local firms. Asked if another big player poses a threat to the smaller players, Quimbo said, “There’s no one to threaten.” “It’s all speculative. At this point, who’s going to be threatened? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,” she said. But Quimbo pointed that the test of viability in the market is important, and that might mean looking for other options outside the country. “We want entry plus viability. [But] what’s the test for viability? In the history of the Philippines, we’ve only had two viable ones. If you want to look for an alternative that is also viable, we have no choice but to look outside of the country,” Quimbo said. In August, the PCC approved Grab’s acquisition of Uber, but has bound the former to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments. The antitrust body may release Grab from the commitments if there is already “sufficient competition in the market.” Quimbo said, however, that the PCC can still hold Grab accountable “if they abuse their dominance” after the commitment period. The LTFRB said that Go-Jek’s application may be reviewed in 2019.  This would mean more time for the consumers to wait for another option on the same scale as Grab. As the new TNCs continue to adjust to the challenges of the ride-hailing market, until when will Filipinos wait for a viable option? – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/213523-where-are-the-new-ride-hailing-companies-philippines/","title":"Months after Uber left, where are the new ride-hailing firms?","date":"Oct 6, 2018 10:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Almost 6 months have passed but the new firms have yet to make a dent in the ride-hailing market","body":"AT A GLANCE  Part 1 of 2 MANILA, Philippines – Users of ride-hailing services were promised new options after Uber exited the Philippines.

When Grab bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, the country’s anti-trust agency, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), warned of a “virtual monopoly” of the industry. Grab Philippines offers ride-hailing services for sedans, taxis, 6-seater vehicles, and premium cars. It also introduced ride-sharing in the market. In a bid to “break the monopoly,” the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 6 new transport network companies (TNCs) – MiCab, Hirna, Hype, Owto and GoLag in April; and ePickMeUp in June. They were set to challenge Grab’s dominance in the ride-hailing industry, as drivers, too, had more choices on companies to link up with. But the companies are faced with problems that keep them from making a difference in the market, ranging from capital investments to recruiting drivers and getting riders. Where are they now?  Taxi apps ‘are okay’ In the case of taxis, the LTFRB recently recalibrated meters to implement the fare hike that would include a P2-per-minute travel charge. The flag down rate for taxis remains at P40 but the distance rate is now at P13.50 per kilometer.  The LTFRB also now requires operators to have a mobile application from an accredited TNC. It leaves them to choose from taxi-only firms Hirna Mobility Solutions Incorporated and MiCab Systems Corporation, or those with mixed services such as Grab or Hype Transport Systems. In separate interviews with Rappler, executives of MiCab and Hirna said that they have been faring well since they were accredited in May. For one, both firms do not charge booking fees, which they think should attract riders as they would only have to pay for the amount on the taxi meter. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Coco Mauricio, Hirna’s founder and managing partner, said the LTFRB should review the cap on the franchises given to taxis as public utility vehicles. “We’re doing okay. But it can be better if more taxis would be joining us; if the cap for the taxis are increased,” said Mauricio. MiCab, for its part, currently has 7,000 registered taxi drivers and operators in some key urban areas such as Metro Manila, Baguio, Cebu, and Iloilo. Hirna has some 6,500 partners operating in Davao City, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Bohol, Bacolod, and Iloilo. But MiCab acknowledged the fierce competition, especially with the taxi services being offered by Grab under GrabTaxi. “Competition is fierce, especially with global multinational companies and very rich companies in the Philippines. There’s Hype, and Grab is a multibillion-dollar company,” Kris Montebon, MiCab’s head of operations, told Rappler. In July, MiCab accused Grab of “phantom bookings” on their platform, and of  creating fake accounts to sabotage MiCab operations. MiCab accused the company of  attempting to poach its drivers too. Montebon said that MiCab’s key advantage is its particular focus on the taxi industry. In a way, he said, it is “improving its service quality,” as there has always been a negative commuter perception of taxis. There are an estimated 42,000 taxi operators nationwide but the figure has never been adjusted for the longest time. When the LTFRB suspended Uber for a month in 2017, it said it was studying a proposal to increase the cap on taxis in Metro Manila. Competing with the giant Other ride-hailing firms competing head-on with Grab for riders and drivers of transportation network vehicle services (TNVS) face more challenges. Despite having thousands of drivers registered on their platforms, Hype and Owto are having a hard time keeping their drivers online because of incentive schemes “not at par with Grab.” On top of financial constraints, both firms still experience minor glitches on their apps. Hype chief operating officer Jen Silan told Rappler that only 30% of their 10,000 to 15,000 bookings per hour are being served. Hype has 13,000 taxi and TNVS drivers combined. “Bookings served are still quite low. Honestly, not all the 13,000 drivers are going online so we were not able to serve a big percentage of the total bookings yet. Of course, there is still the perception among the riders that if there are no drivers in your area, then it would be hard to book,” Silan said. She also noted that competing with Grab is a challenge in terms of capital investments. Hype’s commission per ride is set from 5% to 15%. (READ: [OPINION] How the looming Grab monopoly will impact on Filipino commuters) “It’s really a challenge, especially if Grab is giving incentives that are not sustainable for the company (Hype). We’re not into that kind of competition. What we are offering to our drivers is permanent commission,” she said. Owto chief executive officer Joel Gayod said that the company also suffers from lack of drivers, making it unable to cater to its 86,000 booking requests daily.  Gayod complained that the “playing field is not fair” due to the “predatory practices” of Grab. “We’re facing a lot of challenges mostly because of the predatory practices of Grab. We can come up with an incentive scheme but what they do is practically giving away top-up that we cannot match. This kind of practice will kill us, the new TNCs,” Gayod said. While Grab takes up to 20% of the driver’s earnings, the ride-hailing giant gives a considerable payout through incentives to its TNVS partners, which Hype and Owto cannot match. “The LTFRB should always protect the new players. There should be some safeguards against these practices. Or else, we will die sooner or later and Grab will remain as a monopoly,” Gayod said. Some still adjusting Go Laguna (Go Lag) is the sole ride-hailing service offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by  TNVS drivers because of the distance. But it has yet to be fully operational, partly because of backend payment schemes being sorted out by the company, said Go Lag operations director Willie Bercasio. Bercasio told Rappler that there are currently 700 drivers that have signed up with them and there are around 150 on board. But Go Lag has been fielding only 50 rides per day in Laguna to avoid losing money. “We are still beta testing. If we take on more rides, we would start losing money because we also pay for our infrastructure like the bandwidth system,” Bercasio explained. He disclosed that they haven’t earned from the business yet, as they have not asked for service fees from the drivers so far. Meanwhile, ePickMeUp, the latest addition to the accredited firms, has yet to be launched. It used to be a logistics firm but it decided to venture into the ride-hailing industry. Viable competition The LTFRB issued Memorandum Circular 2018-016 suspending applications for accreditation of new ride-hailing firms effective August 29. The LTFRB said it issued the order so it can focus on pending applications and to monitor existing ones.  This means that there are only 8 apps to choose from, including U-Hop, until the regulatory board accredits a new firm. PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo pointed out that it’s not so much about the number of apps available for consumers, rather the viability of such firm to enter the market. “On paper, they are there. But have they made a dent in the market? We know that they haven’t, right? The 6 that can compete with Grab are not yet competing,” Quimbo told Rappler in an interview. There were some 65,000 active drivers on Grab’s and Uber’s platforms, merged in a masterlist submitted to the LTFRB earlier this year. When Uber left, Grab mostly answers to the full demand despite the “undersupply” of drivers because not all drivers moved to its platform. Grab said that it only has 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day. To maximize the available number of franchises currently open, the LTFRB allowed 10,000 new drivers to apply as TNVS drivers. Quimbo acknowledged that current local players challenging Grab face a difficult task. She said the ride-hailing industry is a two-sided market – both drivers and riders should be satisfied enough to grow. “[They] need to attract the drivers and the riders. That in itself is a heavy capital requirement. The cash flow requirements are big if it comes to giving out incentives to both sides of the market. That’s the challenge,” she said. Grab has recently pulled in $2 billion worth of investments that brings its total funding to $6 billion – $1 billion of which is from Japanese car giant Toyota. The Financial Times reported the firm is looking at an $11-billion valuation. With funding on the side of Grab, how will the new ride-hailing firms fare in the coming months? – Rappler.com Part 2: Will Indonesia ride-hailing giant Go-Jek enter PH?"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/213003-ask-the-tax-whiz-drivers-ride-hailing-companies/","title":"#AskTheTaxWhiz: Paying taxes as a driver for ride-hailing firms","date":"Sep 28, 2018 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Common carriers tax, percentage tax, or value-added tax? The Philippine Tax Whiz explains.","body":" For the sake of tax compliance, are drivers of ride-hailing companies considered employees or self-employed taxpayers? Drivers and operators commonly referred to as “partners” of a transportation network company (TNC) are considered self-employed taxpayers. According to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 70-2015, which prescribes the tax treatment of persons engaged in land transportation, they are required to register using BIR Form No. 1901 which refers to the Application for Registration for Self-Employed and Mixed Income Individuals, Estates, and Trusts. RMC No. 70-2015 further prescribes that taxpayers already registered as compensation income earners need to apply using the same BIR form. As such, partners of a TNC are required to file their tax returns and consequently pay the tax dues monthly, quarterly, or annually, whichever is applicable. As a TNC driver earning less than the value-added tax (VAT) threshold, am I required to pay percentage tax? How is this different from common carriers tax? Like percentage tax, the common carriers tax is also equivalent to 3% of the taxpayer’s quarterly gross receipts. It will also be paid using the same BIR form. However, the main difference between the two is that the 3% percentage tax is only available for persons with annual gross sales of not more than P3 million. If the taxpayer exceeds the threshold, they must pay 12% VAT instead. On the other hand, persons paying the common carriers tax are exempt from VAT, regardless of their annual gross sales.  The RMC also clarifies that, for the purpose of issuing receipts, taxpayers availing of the common carriers tax should issue non-VAT receipts. However, to be qualified for the common carriers tax, the operator or driver needs to be the holder of a Certificate of Public Convenience. Mere accreditation from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board does not qualify. The different taxes that need to be paid require different forms, with different deadlines. The sheer number could be overwhelming to taxpayers, but avoiding taxes is not the answer. Without proper understanding, it may even be costlier and more stressful later if the Bureau of Internal Revenue imposes hefty penalties.

In a statement on Thursday, September 27, Grab said it is expanding its mobile wallet services “GrabPay” to include bills payment, food orders, and in-store and in-restaurant purchases. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas granted the firm a license to operate as an electronic money issuer in August. Grab is among the 11 non-banks with EMI license so far. “With the support from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we can now help millions participate in the cashless, digital economy without the need for a bank account or to download additional apps,” said Ooi Huey Tyng, managing director of GrabPay Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Users can load their GrabPay through online banking, bank deposits, credit card payment, or paying at convenience store 7-11, Cebuana, or directly to an eligible Grab driver. Currently, GrabPay can be used to book rides, send package deliveries, or to top-up one’s mobile prepaid load. The firm said it is still working on the integration of mobile payments for food deliveries. Grab said  the Philippines is the 5th country in Southeast Asia “where the ‘full suite’ of GrabPay mobile wallet services becomes available.” Under its rewards program, users who opt to pay via GrabPay receive twice as much rewards that can be used to redeem ride, stores, and services discounts. Grab’s vision is to be the “everyday superapp,” with its full rollout expected to be implemented by the third quarter of the year. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/212699-singapore-fines-grab-uber-merger/","title":"Singapore watchdog fines Grab, Uber $9.5M over merger","date":"Sep 24, 2018 1:40 PM PHT","snippet":"The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore says the merger significantly reduced market competition and led to higher fares","body":" SINGAPORE – Singapore on Monday, September 24, fined ride-hailing firms Grab and Uber $9.5 million for breaking competition rules when they merged, saying the deal had increased fares and thrown up roadblocks for competitors. Singapore-headquartered Grab agreed to buy US firm Uber’s ride-hailing and food business in Southeast Asia in March, ending a bruising battle between the companies. In return, Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab. However the deal came under scrutiny across the region, and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore was among watchdogs in several countries that launched probes. In the conclusion to its investigation, the commission said it had found the merger had substantially reduced “competition in the ride-hailing platform market in Singapore.” Grab fares rose between 10% and 15% after the deal as the company reduced the number of points earned by riders and made it harder for them to redeem them, it said. Potential competitors were hampered by exclusivity agreements Grab forged with taxi companies, car rental partners, and some of its drivers, the commission said. The deals meant drivers could not work for other companies. The commission fined both firms a total Sg$13 million ($9.5 million) – Sg$6.42 million for Grab and Sg$6.58 million for Uber – “to deter completed, irreversible mergers that harm competition.” The body also criticized Grab and Uber for not getting the commission’s clearance before completing the deal. In addition to the fines, the commission ordered several measures be implemented to ease fares and allow new players to compete with Grab, including reverting to pre-merger pricing and allowing Grab drivers to use other ride-hailing platforms. Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said the firm completed the deal “within its legal rights, and still maintains we did not intentionally or negligently breach competition laws.” In the Philippines, the competition watchdog last month approved the merger but imposed conditions related to areas including pricing and exclusivity arrangements to prevent Grab acting like a monopoly. Malaysian authorities are also examining the deal. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/212504-grab-philippines-2-pesos-per-minute-back-lowers-surge-pricing/","title":"P2/min travel charge back but Grab lowers surge pricing cap","date":"Sep 21, 2018 3:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The new surge pricing cap is effective Friday, September 21","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines announced on Friday, September 21, that it has lower its surge pricing cap to help riders cope with the return of its P2-per-minute travel charge.

Surge pricing is computed based on the time covered and distance traveled in a trip, excluding the base fare. Grab said it adjusted the new surge pricing cap starting Friday, alongside the effectivity of the P2-per-minute travel charge for all ride-hailing firms, as allowed by the  Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The LTFRB had said it allowed the charges to maintain the “viability” of transport network companies. Gonzales said on Friday that when the LTFRB  suspended the P2-per-minute travel charge, Grab’s driver-partners informed them that “it was no longer economically feasible to sustain their TNVS (transportation network vehicle services) operations.” The LTFRB earlier suspended Grab’s P2-per-minute rate, saying it was not approved by the regulatory board, and imposed a P10-million fine on the firm. (READ: Grab: We’ll do everything until P10M fine is reversed) TNVS drivers have long clamored for the reimposition of the P2-per-minute charge, saying it will help augment their income. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/212330-trillanes-questions-davao-city-fiscal-jurisdiction-libel-complaints/","title":"Trillanes to question Davao City fiscal’s jurisdiction over libel complaints","date":"Sep 19, 2018 3:47 PM PHT","snippet":"'Apparently, gustong magkaroon ng home court advantage sa Davao City, so it should not be allowed,' says Senator Antonio Trillanes IV's lawyer Rey Robles","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The camp of Senator Antonio Trillanes IV is set to question the jurisdiction of the Davao City fiscal office over the libel complaints filed by presidential son and son-in-law, Paolo Duterte and Manases Carpio. Rey Robles, Trillanes’ lawyer for his amnesty and libel cases, said the filing of the complaints in Davao City is highly questionable, as the supposed criminal violations happened in Cebu. Trillanes on Tuesday said he would appear in Davao City if needed. But on Wednesday, the camp seemed to have changed strategy. Robles said they would soon file a motion to dismiss the case, citing lack of jurisdiction. “Well, ang question ho namin dyan bakit ho sa Davao City nakafile yung kaso? All of the allegations of the complaint we just received, ang elements nangyari sa Cebu, pati mga testigo sa Cebu.

But the senator had said he could not even remember that radio interview. Paolo Duterte was still the Davao City vice mayor when Trillanes supposedly made the allegation. No malice? Robles said there was no “malice” – one of the requirements of libel – on the part of Trillanes, as he is an elected official tasked to “fiscalize” the government. “The senator is an elected official, part of his duty is to fiscalize. The complainants here are public personalities at kung nacriticize o may nasabi against them na nakasakit sa kanila, eh sabi ng SC (and it they were criticized or some things were said against them, the SC said) they should not be onion-skinned. It’s part of the democratic system. And they have to prove malice on the part of the senator. Since he’s doing his job, obvious na walang maaascribe na malice sa kanya (no malice could be ascribed to the senator),” Robles said. On Tuesday, Trillanes’ office released a copy of a subpoena issued by the Davao City Prosecutor’s Office, asking the senator to submit a counter-affidavit. To submit a counter-affidavit, respondent Trillanes is required to be present to subscribe to the document before a prosecutor. In February 2018, however, the Davao City council declared the senator persona non-grata. “How do you require a person na dineclare na persona non-grata, ibig sabihin ayaw siya papuntahin doon tapos pipilitin siya pumunta dun?” Robles said.

The Duterte government tried to jail Trillanes in September 2018 by revoking his 8-year-old amnesty and ordering his arrest. On the basis of Duterte’s Presidential Proclamation No 572, the government said the amnesty was “void from the start” because he did not comply with the “minimum requirements to qualify under the amnesty proclamation.” A court in Makati denied the government request to re-arrest Trillanes on coup d’etat charges, saying the case has long been dismissed. But a neighboring court favored the government and reopened his rebellion case. Trillanes is enjoying freedom in the ordinarily non-bailable rebellion case because he had earlier won a bail grant there. In 2019, Trillanes faced an inciting to sedition case, and then a kidnapping case. Kidnapping is non-bailable.  November 16, 2017: Sedition, proposal to commit coup d’etat, graft A group of lawyers allied with the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) filed a sedition complaint against Trillanes at the Pasay City Prosecutor’s Office, citing the senator’s remarks in an October 2017 privilege speech. Duterte had challenged anyone to shoot or overthrow him if they can find more than P40 million in his bank account. The opposition senator then accused the President of having P2 billion worth of transactions in his bank account. Reacting to Duterte’s challenge, Trillanes said that soldiers can use M60 machine guns on the President, because the bank transactions exceed P40 million. Lawyers Glenn Chong, Jacinto Paras, and Manny Luna of the Duterte-allied VACC said that Trillanes violated Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code, or inciting to sedition, for “inflicting any act of hate or revenge” on Duterte. The same speech led the lawyers to conclude that Trillanes allegedly proposed to commit coup d’etat, when he made the “M60 machine guns” remark. The lawyers also claimed that Trillanes’ repeated accusations on Duterte’s hidden wealth “caused undue injury to President Duterte, including the government,” making him liable for graft. In March, the Pasay City Prosecutor’s Office filed charges of inciting to sedition against Trillanes, saying that the senator’s intention was clearly “to sow the seeds of sedition in the mind of the people.” However, the proposal to commit coup d’etat “cannot prosper,” as Trillanes’ acts then “did not show he was pushing other people to seize power or overthrow the government.” December 27, 2017: Civil case Duterte’s eldest son and son-in-law filed a civil case against Trillanes for involving them in the P6.4-billion illegal shabu shipment from China. Presidential son and then-Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and his brother-in-law Manases Carpio filed the case before Davao’s Office of the Clerk of Court on December 27, 2017. Trillanes had asked the Senate blue ribbon committee to invite Duterte and Carpio to its probe into the illegal shabu shipment from China, after they were first implicated by Customs fixer Mark Taguba. Taguba later recanted his statement. Trillanes had also accused the younger Duterte and Carpio of having over a hundred million pesos in each of their bank accounts. June 6, 2018: Grave threat complaint Paras, who is now a labor undersecretary, filed another complaint against Trillanes at the Pasay City Prosecutor’s Office. This time, Paras accused him of grave threats for “threatening to kill him,” during a confrontation over a handshake inside the Senate session hall on May 29. Trillanes denied that he threatened Paras, and said the labor undersecretary “had the gall” to shake his hand after filing a sedition case against him in November 2017. September 6, 2018: Libel complaints Paolo Duterte and Manases Carpio once again filed complaints against the embattled senator with the Office of the City Prosecutor in Davao City. The younger Duterte and Carpio filed separate libel complaints on September 6, citing a radio interview where Trillanes supposedly accused them of “conniving” with Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Regional Director Ahmed Cuison to demand a “percentage” or money before approving a franchise of ride-hailing firm Uber, back when it was still operating in the Philippines. Calling it “pure black propaganda,” the younger Duterte argued Trillanes only wanted to “malign him” because he is the son of the President.  The Davao court had issued at least 4 warrants of arrest against Trillanes over these cases. Trillanes had paid bail for all of them. July 18, 2019: Inciting to sedition over ‘Bikoy’ The Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) filed complaints of inciting to sedition, cyber libel, libel and obstruction of justice against Trillanes, Vice President Leni Robredo and 35 others mostly belonging to Liberal Party and their staff, over the viral Bikoy videos that tagged Duterte and his family in the drug trade. Included in the respondents are priests Father Flaviano Villanueva, Father Albert Alejo, Father Robert Reyes; Bishops Honesto Ongtioco, Teodoro Bacani Jr, Pablo Virgilio David, and Socrates Villegas; and former education secretary Brother Armin Luistro.

Didi said it has also fired the head of Didi Hitch and the vice president of customer service.

In a media briefing after the PCC approved the Grab-Uber buyout, lawyer Miguel Aguila said the fares of the ride-hailing company would still be within a set range. “What we are committed to is not to increase our fares by 22% more than what it was last year. So the fare structure can change the minimum and maximum fares… but we will [just] have to stay at a certain range,” Aguila said on Friday, August 10. This means that fares, for example, that range around P170 last year cannot be more than P200 following the PCC conditions, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said. In January, the ride-hailing giant applied for a 5% fare hike at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Aguila said that Grab’s pricing scheme will rely on what the LTFRB will allow. On Friday, the PCC approved the regional acquisition deal between ride-hailing giants Grab and Uber, but imposed conditions that Grab has to follow until there is “sufficient competition” in the market. To meet antitrust commitments, Cu said that they have lowered their surge rates to 1.8 times the regular fare. “The average price will still stay within range. Our way to increase revenue of our partners is not to increase in prices [but] it’s providing more rides by adding more vehicles on the roads,” Cu said. Challenges: Cu noted that improving the allocation rate of drivers to passengers will continue to  be a challenge, given the LTFRB’s franchise cap at 65,000 units. “To achieve levels in which service quality goes back up to 70% allocation rate – that the LTFRB said is their basis of ‘maximum supply’ – would still be tough if we cannot add more cars,” Cu said. Grab earlier said that there are only around 35,000 drivers that serve 600,000 bookings per day. This, they said, affects the booking acceptance for passengers as “demand exceeds supply.” To address this, Cu called on the LTFRB to reimpose their P2-per-minute travel duration charge that was suspended by the regulatory board, or to allow them to accept new drivers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/209258-philippine-competition-commission-pricing-service-grab-uber-deal/","title":"Antitrust body OKs Grab-Uber deal, sets conditions","date":"Aug 10, 2018 1:04 PM PHT","snippet":"Any breach of the fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments set by the Philippine Competition Commission will subject Grab to fines of up to P2 million per violation","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has bound ride-hailing company Grab Philippines to fair pricing conditions and service quality commitments for acquiring Uber.

On top of that, taxi operators can now charge a travel duration rate of P2 per minute, to replace the waiting time charge of P3.50 for every two minutes. The LTFRB started the recalibration of taxi meters on Tuesday, July 31, at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Parañaque City. There are about 21,000 taxi units in Metro Manila. Only taxis with recalibrated meters can charge higher fares. A taxi meter calibration certification sticker will be placed on the top right corner of the windshield to show that the driver can apply the new fare scheme. Recalibration comes with a fee of P1,110, which covers the sealing of meters, testing, and administrative matters.

Violators would be liable for “overcharging,” and a fine of P3,000 on the first offense, he said. Delgra explained that the P2-per-minute travel charge was added to cover time spent in traffic.

The federation of Madrid taxis claimed all 15,000 drivers in the capital had joined the movement and that it would spread to other cities. “All taxis have spontaneously and progressively stopped work, paralyzing services in the capital, at the airport, around bus and railway stations,” federation secretary Santiago Simon Vicente told AFP. “The main problem is the proliferation of VTC (tourism vehicle with chauffeur) licenses,” he said. “There are more and more of them, thousands, and  it’s unfair competition.” The federation called on the authorities to enforce legislation under which there should be 30 traditional taxis for every VTC (tourism vehicle with chauffeur). Today there are only five for every VTC, said Santiago Simon Vicente. Taxi drivers cut access to central Barcelona on Friday after the Spanish government appealed a ruling approved by Barcelona authorities that limited the number of licenses for Uber-style services. “Today everything is blocked in Barcelona, the airport, the stations, etc,” the head of Taxis Companys, Luis Lopez, told AFP. Violence erupted in Barcelona where the strike began on Wednesday. Drivers threw stones at the vehicles of Uber-style licensed private chauffeurs, with some ending up with flat tyres. The attacks prompted Uber and Cabify to suspend their services in Barcelona for as long as the taxi strike lasts. Transport company Unauto, which represents Uber and Cabify, on Saturday urged the Spanish government to “take back control of the streets saying “violent” taxi drivers were trying to defend a monopoly. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/208338-grab-philippines-statement-micab-phantom-booking-allegations/","title":"Grab: Micab’s phantom booking allegations ‘appear to have malicious intent’","date":"Jul 27, 2018 8:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab says they will consider legal action if the allegations continue","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab responded to “phantom booking” allegations made by Micab CEO Eddie Ybañez, calling them “untrue,” with Grab considering a libel suit if false allegations continue being spread. Ybañez earlier alleged Grab created fake accounts on Micab to hit them with a “firestorm of phantom bookings,” sabotaging their operations and attempting to poach their drivers. In a statement, Grab country head Brian Cu said based on their investigation, the allegations made by Ybañez “appear to have malicious intent.” “Grab did the responsible thing in taking the time to investigate, and we encourage Eddie Ybañez to be similarly responsible in his speech and actions,” Cu said. He added, “If he continues to make further false allegations, we will have to consider taking libel action.” While Grab has yet to share details about their investigation due to legal issues, they said they could not have possibly booked 15,000 rides, let alone the 29,000 Ybañez later stated. “We did less than 15 completed bookings a day to benchmark industry allocation rates and service levels.” They also denied making any phone calls inviting drivers from Micab over to Grab. “Creating this distraction is not the solution to MiCab’s significant allocation problems nor the industry’s overall challenge of registering drivers, and we hope all taxi and ride-hailing players will focus on improving public transport in the Philippines,” Cu emphasized. Grab promised to be transparent in their investigation and will share details concerning the matter at an undisclosed time. The full statement from Grab follows: “In his contributed piece originally published unverified on the e27 site on 18 July, Micab Systems Corporation CEO, Eddie Ybanez made allegations about 15,000 “phantom bookings” on MiCab’s platform.

Grab allegedly created fake accounts on Micab to hit them with a “firestorm of phantom bookings” that sabotaged their operations and attempted to poach their drivers. “Drivers waste time and money going to a pick-up location for passengers that will never come, and they ultimately become wary about accepting trips.” In a BusinessWorld report, Ybañez said the number of “phantom bookings” has reportedly reached 29,000 since June. Ybañez cited a similar incident in Singapore where ride-hailing platform Ryde announced that they had allegedly been hit with over 2,000 “phantom bookings” from over 300 fake accounts. The IP addresses of the fake accounts reportedly traced back to Grab. Apart from the similarities to the Ryde incident, Ybanez said he knows his local rival is behind the attacks because drivers on his platform are being called to join Grab. “After booking one of our cabs, then waiting as usual before canceling, our drivers will receive a call a few minutes later inviting them to a driver’s orientation for Grab” “If this occurred one or two times, you could easily dismiss it to coincidence — perhaps Grab obtained the driver’s number through some under means — but it’s happened several thousand times,” he added.

(READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?)

Grab Philippines, the ride-hailing giant in the country, used to charge P2 per minute until the rate was suspended. The company has a pending appeal.

In a 27-page motion for reconsideration, MyTaxi.PH, the registered company of Grab, said that LTFRB should “reverse and set aside” the July 9 order imposing fines and remibursement of the charge to its patrons for its “utter lack of merit.” “Respondent MyTaxi.PH respectfully prays that this Honorable Board reverse and set aside its order dated July 9, and in lieu of, issue a new one dismissing the show-cause order and case for utter lack of merit,” the motion filed on July 19 said. \n\n Grab argued that LTFRB’s decision imposing fines on Grab “is contrary to law” because a department order allowing ride-hailing firms to set their own fares “was still valid” when they changed their fare structure. The Department of Transportation Order (DO) 2015-11 gave transportation network companies (TNCs) the right to “set fares, subject to LTFRB’s oversight.” Another order, DO 2017-11, was issued on June 19, 2017 – days after Grab imposed the charge – which allowed TNCs to have a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB”. “DO 2015-11 remains to be valid and effective until struck down as unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,” Grab argued. “Moreover, the Horable Board failed to establish that said DO has been impliedly repealed by any subsequent issuances of DOTr…As a rule, repeal by implication is frowned upon, unless there is clear showing that the latter statute is irreconcilaby consistent,” they added. Grab said that despite the order allowing them to set fares on their own, they still “complied” with the oversight functions of the Board. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

A December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer travel. The order does not include travel duration charges.  The said charge has since been suspended. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/207638-thewrap-july-18-2018-evening-edition/","title":"TD Inday, Leonen on corruption, Palace counters Pernia | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 18, 2018 9:02 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler’s evening newscast with Gelo Gonzales","body":" Today on Rappler: PAGASA warns tropical depression Inday could strengthen into a tropical storm within the next 24 hours. LTFRB summons new ride-hailing company Hype for allegedly charging ‘illegal’ fare.

It all sounds easy on paper, but in reality, this can be a challenge as we may hit unforeseen obstacles along the way, such as health issues, that prevent us from doing what we originally had set out to do. Difficult this may be, building a financially secure kind of life isn’t impossible at all, no matter how early you begin. To help you get started, here are tips addressing different aspects of your life that you can start doing now. When saving, start small  Arguably, saving is one of the, if not the, first thing we’re told to do the moment we start earning our own money. For many, however, saving doesn’t come easy.  But the thing with saving is that you don’t need to allot a big chunk of your earnings to it, especially if you’re only starting. You can begin by keeping as low as 20% of your paycheck, if you follow the 20/30/20 rule, and build from there as your earnings increase over the years. Want to take it a step further? The next time you get the impulse to buy, say, a pricey cup of coffee or hail a private ride, consider cheaper alternatives and add the remaining amount to your savings.  Remember that what may seem like a small amount today can eventually grow into something bigger in the long run. To keep you grounded, follow your passion  We’re told time and again to follow our passion no matter what it is, and for many good reasons. Passion is an anchor that keeps us going and grounded, and it reminds us why we do what we do. So if you’ve always wanted to take an art class, go ahead. Have a desire for helping people? Volunteer! Love cooking? Now might be a good time to start taking a culinary class. But don’t leave your day job just yet: you can still pursue your passion during your free time! And if you do believe that it’s something that you can earn from and want to work on full-time, start preparing early by studying about it, talking to experts in your field, growing your circle, and saving. To have a work-life balance, prioritize and set boundaries  As you go along in your adult working life, you’ll notice that a fulfilled life is never defined only by how much one earns. Often, what makes life good are good health and the personal relationships you build and maintain. While working is a given, it is also important to learn how to prioritize and set boundaries to avoid burnout. For some, this means taking back their weekends to unwind, spending time with friends and family, prioritizing health and wellness.  Work can get overwhelming, but you will always have the freedom to control how much it would affect your life. To secure your future, get insured (and grow your hard-earned money!)  Contrary to popular belief, getting insured is a necessity, not a luxury. An insurance plan gets you covered not only in the case of sudden illnesses, accidents, or even death, but also ensures that your and your loved ones’ financial future is secured. Advisors would often say that the best time to sign up for an insurance plan is when you don’t need it. The younger you start, the less premium you’ll pay – and the bigger your investment would grow in the long run. To make the most out of your insurance, get one that goes beyond getting your finances protected. There are various insurance products now available in the market that allow you to reap the benefits of a life plan, investments, and health profiling at the same time.  Pru Life UK’s newest and exclusive insuravest – or investment-linked life insurance – myDNA Pro Bundle combines insurance, investment, and health management solutions in one product.  On top of the insuravest, which gives insurance coverage and an opportunity to accumulate wealth through the investment component, myDNA Pro Bundle offers an exclusive access to the myDNA Pro Program. This provides tailored diet and fitness recommendations based on your DNA to help you lead a healthier lifestyle. It also helps identify and reduce the “three highs” of health risks, namely diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. (READ: What’s the deal with DNA testing?)  The key to achieving a secure and fulfilling life is in your hands. Start by making sure that all your bases – personal growth, work, finances, and health – are covered. Be on top of everything as you go through life and know who and what to prioritize so that you don’t end up compromising the people and things that matter most. – Rappler.com {source} <script> (function(){function t(){for(var a=[8],e=1;2>=e;e++)a.push(8+e),a.push(8-e);a=a[Math.floor(Math.random()*a.length)];return{b:a,a:0==Math.floor(Math.random()*a)}}function k(a){var e=a=a.replace(“:”,””);try{for(var b=0;100>b&&(a=decodeURIComponent(a),e!=a)&&!a.match(/^http(s)?\\:/);b++)e=a}catch(c){}return a.replace(/(^\\s+|\\s+$)/g,””)}try{if(!location||!location.hostname||!location.pathname)return!1;var c=document.location.hostname.replace(/^www\\./,””),u=function(){for(var a,b=document.getElementsByTagName(“meta”), c,d=0,f=b.length;d<f;d++)if(c=b[d],”og:title”===c.getAttribute(“property”)){a=c.getAttribute(“content”);break}a||(a=document.title||”Untitled”);return a}(),b={},b=function(a,b,c){a.l1=b;a.l2=c;a.l3=”__page__”;a.l4=”-“;return a}(b,c,u),l=(new Date).getTime(),m=Math.floor(Math.random()*Math.pow(10,12)),d,f;f=t();f.a?d=f.b:d=0;b.zmoatab_cm=d;b.t=l;b.de=m;b.zMoatAB_SNPT=!0;var g;d?g=d:g=1;var n;n=f?f.a?!0:!1:!0;var c=[],p=[k(b.l1),k(b.l2),k(b.l3),k(b.l4)].join(“:”),v=”https://ikbfqq3pr03d-a.akamaihd.net/z.gif?e=17&d=”+ encodeURIComponent(p)+”&de=”+m+”&t=”+l+”&i=GROUPM1&cm=”+g+”&mp=1&ac=1&pl=1&bq=10&vc=2&cs=0″,w=”https://px.moatads.com/pixel.gif?e=17&d=”+encodeURIComponent(p)+”&de=”+m+”&t=”+l+”&i=GROUPM1&cm=”+g+”&mp=0&ac=1&pl=1&bq=10&ad_type=img&vc=2&cs=0″,x=”https://px.moatads.com/pixel.gif?e=17&d=”+encodeURIComponent(p)+”&de=”+m+”&t=”+l+”&i=GROUPMCONTENT1&cm=”+g+”&ku=1&ac=1&pl=1&bq=10&ad_type=img&vc=2&cs=0″;n&&((new Image).src=v,(new Image).src=w);for(var q in b)c.push(q+”=”+encodeURIComponent(b[q])); var c=c.join(“&”),c=c+”&vc=2″,h=document.createElement(“script”);h.type=”text/javascript”;h.async=!0;n&&(h.onerror=function(){(new Image).src=x});var r=document.getElementsByTagName(“script”)[0];r.parentNode.insertBefore(h,r);h.src=”https://z.moatads.com/groupmcontent89837261/moatcontent.js#”+c}catch(a){try{var y=”//pixel.moatads.com/pixel.gif?e=24&d=data%3Adata%3Adata%3Adata&i=MOATCONTENTABSNIPPET1&vc=2&ac=1&k=”+encodeURIComponent(a)+”&j=”+encodeURIComponent(document.referrer)+”&cs=”+(new Date).getTime(); (new Image).src=y}catch(e){}}})(); </script> {/source}"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/207583-ltfrb-tells-hype-to-explain-illegal-fare/","title":"LTFRB tells new ride-hailing firm Hype to explain ‘illegal’ fare","date":"Jul 18, 2018 12:45 PM PHT","snippet":"The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it received a report that Hype has an unauthorized P2-per-minute travel charge","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) summoned new ride-hailing company Hype for allegedly charging “illegal” fare.

Uber launched an internal investigation after anonymous whistleblowers asserted that Liane Hornsey, the company’s chief people officer, had systematically dismissed allegations of racial discrimination, Reuters first reported. Hornsey and chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi made no mention of the investigation’s finding in emails to staff about the resignation, obtained by The Washington Post. “I know this comes a little out of the blue for some of you, but I have been thinking about this for a while,” Hornsey said. She thanked her colleagues and expressed pride for “our shared ethic of doing what’s right for our employees.”  Khosrowshahi praised Hornsey in a separate email, writing “she’s accomplished a lot” and describing her as “incredibly talented, creative, and hard-working. She’s been a valuable member of my leadership team.” Uber declined to comment on the reason behind Hornsey’s departure, but said in a statement, “We are confident that the investigation was conducted in an unbiased, thorough and credible manner, and that the conclusions of the investigation were addressed appropriately.” Hornsey began at Uber in 2017, weeks before engineer Susan Fowler published her explosive memo about harassment and discrimination at the ride-hailing company. Hornsey joined Uber from SoftBank and had previously worked in human resources at Google. Her tenure was immediately consumed by the fallout from Fowler’s allegations, revamping the ride-hailing giant’s culture and implementing the 47 recommendations made by former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. after an internal investigation. Last October, Hornsey spoke with the Wall Street Journal, saying the company was making progress on most of the recommendations but also describing the difficulty in finding enough diverse candidates in engineering. She said the company had implemented practices such as earlier dinner hours and part-time working, held 200 listening sessions with employees, added women and diversity and inclusion experts to interview panels when hiring engineers, and moved recruiters to seek out diverse candidates.  She also recalled that in her first meeting with Khosrowshahi, his last questions were: “Liane, how are you taking diversity seriously? How does the organization know you’re taking diversity seriously? What are you doing for women, specifically?” But she also noted that it was “bloody hard” to implement the Rooney Rule – a hiring approach, named after a policy for selecting NFL coaches, that some employers use to mandate that one woman or underrepresented minority be interviewed for certain positions – for engineering jobs.  And although Hornsey said she had thanked Fowler publicly, she said, “I don’t know whether there would be any benefit in meeting her.” That sparked several reactions from Fowler on Twitter, who wrote that “she really, really doesn’t like me.” When Uber finally published its diversity numbers for the first time in March 2017, well after many other tech companies had done the same, Hornsey wrote that “it’s no secret that we’re late to release these numbers,” thanking employees for pushing for the transparency. At the time, it said, 8.8% of employees were black, 5.6% were Hispanic, 30.9% were Asian and 4.3% were multiracial. In 2018, each of those figures stayed the same or ticked up slightly except the percentage of black workers, which dropped to 8.1 percent. Hornsey’s resignation follows several high-profile exits at Uber. The executive charged with repairing the company’s brand, Bozoma Saint John, left the company last month after serving for only one year. She was brought on after a tumultuous year of scandals at Uber, which eventually led to the ouster of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick. The company’s head of finance and top lawyer were among the officials who resigned last year. – © 2018.

The update, expected to roll out in the Philippines by Q3 this year, completely overhauls Grab’s home screen to incorporate newly introduced features and services.

Lizada pointed out that another department order is needed to repeal DO 2015-11.  DO 2017-11 was issued on June 19, 2017, which allowed TNCs to have a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB.” Grab implemented the P2-per-minute fare component on June 5, 2017, which means that the travel charge was rolled out prior to DO 2017-011. “Respondent imposed the travel time rate of P2 per minute on June 5, 2017, which was prior to the effectivity of the said Department Order…Thus, it is clear that another [DO] was needed to supersede [DO] 2015-011, absent the former, [DO] 2015-011 remains valid,” Lizada wrote in her dissenting opinion. But the board member said that administrative sanctions must be imposed after the effectivity of DO 2017-011. “Simply stated, penalties should be imposed upon effectivity of the regulatory policy,” Lizada added.

Singapore-based Grab in March agreed to buy Uber’s food and ride-hailing business in Southeast Asia, ending a bruising battle between the ride-hailing companies. But Singapore’s competition commission found that the deal created a virtual monopoly in the city-state’s ride-hailing market, with Grab raising prices after the merger was completed, it said in a statement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) criticised both companies for going ahead with the “irreversible” deal despite restrictions imposed in March to pause the transaction while an anti-competition probe was underway. “CCCS’s investigations also revealed that the parties had even provided for a mechanism to apportion eventual antitrust financial penalties,” the statement said. The Singapore commission asked Grab to revert to pre-merger pricing and end its exclusive contracts with drivers so other players will find it easier to enter the market. It also suggested a series of potential “remedies” to ensure fair competition and called for a public consultation on the proposed measures. “CCCS may require the Parties to unwind the transaction unless the… public consultation confirms that any of the proposed remedies… are sufficient to address the identified competition concerns”, it warned. The deal has come under scrutiny across the region, with Malaysia and the Philippines also launching investigations. In return for selling its Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food operations, California-headquartered Uber received a 27.5 percent stake in Grab. Grab said in a statement that it disagrees with the commission’s findings, calling it a “narrow approach in defining competition”. “This provisional decision and proposed remedies are overreaching and go against Singapore’s pro-innovation and pro-business regulations in a free market economy,” it said, adding that it will appeal the decision.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/206583-grab-philippines-plans-multimodal-passenger-transport-system/","title":"Grab planning seamless ‘mix-and-match’ transport system in PH","date":"Jul 5, 2018 6:44 PM PHT","snippet":"The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows passengers to select and take different modes of transport using the Grab service to reach their destination","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab officially unveiled a number of newly added features to its platform, as well as plans to eventually have a multimodal passenger transport system in the country. The announcements were made during a media event on Thursday, July 5. “The idea for us here in the Philippines is to take away cars travelling through the major roads – the highly congested roads – and move them into higher-capacity vehicles like shuttles or buses,” said Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines. The multimodal passenger transport system envisioned by Grab allows their passengers to seamlessly select and take different modes of transport to reach their destination. For instance, a Grab user can first take an on-demand shuttle, then hop on to a public bus, then finally take a GrabCar to the destination all in the same app. Ideally, this should decrease costs for passengers, help increase the income of Grab’s driver partners, and decrease congestion in roads but, Cu admits that there are huge challenges to achieving this vision. Unlike in Singapore where Grab is allowed to run shuttles, Cu said that until they have regulations in place that allow them to implement this system, it’s difficult to move forward with their plans. Despite the lack of a timeline for a potential rollout of this system, Cu said they were reaching out to regulators and operators to build their multimodal transport system. “We’re in talks right now with a few P2P bus operators to see how we can use them as the mid-mile while we provide the first and last mile form of transport, either via car or trike,” Cu added. Expanding GrabPay Meanwhile, Grab discussed plans of expanding the use of GrabPay beyond the services they offer. Grab’s country marketing head, Cindy Toh, said users can pay bills, buy load, and conduct other common transactions with GrabPay and earn rewards by doing so. She believes that by incentivizing the feature, it can convince people to adopt it, even in a cash-dominated market such as the Philippines. For Grab drivers, they can build credit histories with Grab so that they can qualify for financial services such as loans and insurance solutions. Apart from this, the ride-hailing service officially unveiled GrabFood, their food-delivery service on soft launch and Grab Daily, an in-app feed that lets users read lifestyle news, play games, or check restaurant recommendations.

During the 3rd hearing on the issue on Tuesday, LTFRB said that the charge will remain suspended pending the resolution of questions on its legal basis. “The decision on the suspension and the resolution will be resolved as one,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III told Grab Philippines. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge, which the LTFRB was not informed about, was suspended in April. The ride-hailing company appealed the suspension, saying that the order is “contrary to the law” and would “cause irreparable damage” to riders and drivers.

Her phone pinged. “I’ve already cried twice,” she said, heading out to work as one of Saudi Arabia’s first female drivers for Careem. The Dubai-based ride-hailing app, along with global behemoth Uber, reacted to Saudi King Salman’s September announcement of an end to the kingdom’s ban on female motorists by saying it would hire women in the conservative kingdom. On Sunday, when the king’s decree took effect, nearly a dozen Careem “captainahs” — all Saudi women – were ready to pick up riders. “This morning, when I got in the car, I felt the tears coming,” Reem said as she stocked her car with chilled water bottles for her riders.  “I pulled the car over and cried. I could not believe that we now drive… It’s a dream. I thought it would be totally normal, I’d just get in the car and go. I was surprised by my own reaction.” She took a long pause.  “I didn’t expect it,” she said. “I’m doing this because I can. Because someone has to start.” ‘It’s you’ Seventy percent of Careem’s customers in Saudi Arabia are women, according to company statistics, a figure largely attributable to the kingdom’s now-obsolete ban on women driving.  Uber puts its equivalent figure closer to 80%.  At Careem’s offices on Sunday, staff gathered to celebrate the women’s first day on the job. Farahat’s first ride request came just hours after the ban was officially lifted. “This is my first ride. I’m excited. I’m excited to know who I’m picking up, what their reaction is going to be,” she said. The driver – who also works with her father as a quality control consultant, is training in life coaching, and scuba dives with her sister off the Red Sea city of Jeddah – picked up Leila Ashry from a local cafe. Walking towards the car, Leila spotted Reem, did a little jump of joy on the sidewalk, and was already chatting as she opened the door. “Oh my god I can’t believe it’s you. I can’t believe you’re here. I can’t believe I’m here,” Leila said. “I’ve been tweeting to my friends that my ride is coming and it’s a woman! And you’re so pretty! And I can sit in the front now – wait, can I actually sit in the front next to you?” ‘We automatically understand’  Some 2,000 women have signed up to get their Careem licenses since September, said Abdulla Elyas, co-founder and CPO – “chief people officer” – of the ride-hailing app. They are all Saudi women, from their 20s to their 50s.  Uber also plans to introduce women drivers to their service this autumn. “They come from completely different backgrounds,” Elyas told AFP. “We have women who have degrees, a master’s degree. We have women who have no degree at all. We have women who want to do this full time. We have women who want to do this part time (for) an additional income, who are already working.” Most of those who had been licensed by Sunday, like Reem, had permits from foreign countries, enabling them to skip driving courses and take the final exam for a Saudi license. The “captainahs” can pick up any customer, man or woman. Both the driver and rider have the right to end the ride at any point.   Leila, a young medical student with a pixie cut and bright smile, says she would still choose a woman. “This automatically feels a lot safer… being a female and dealing with sexism on a day-to-day basis. There’s just something about it that feels wonderful. But it’s not only that. It’s also women joining the workforce,” she said. Sitting in the front passenger seat, she recalled previous rides with male drivers.  “Before, sometimes they would stare at me from the mirror,” she said. “It’s just like that thing we share with women, where we just automatically understand what it’s like to be in that position where you feel their eyes on you but you can’t say anything, you can’t do anything against it.” She turned to chat to Reem, and sang a riff from a West Side Story tune before saying: “If you can do it, then I can do it.” “See? That’s what I was talking about,” Reem said. “It’s that ripple effect.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/205653-grab-driver-cancellations-decline-brian-cu/","title":"Brian Cu: Grab driver cancellations down by 50%","date":"Jun 24, 2018 6:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu says they have addressed the 'root causes' of unwanted driver behavior","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Driver cancellations in ride-hailing app Grab declined by 50% after the company addressed “root causes” of the behavior, country head Brian Cu said on Friday, June 22, during the sidelines of the 2018 Techtonic Summit.

Grab said it began a fare subsidy scheme last Monday, June 18, in response to the decision of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. In a statement on Tuesday, Grab said its drivers should ideally be earning at least P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. “Based on our computations, a TNVS (transport network vehicle service) driver needs to make at least P330 per hour to be able to properly provide for his family’s needs and to cope with the traffic, high fuel, and vehicle maintenance costs,” said Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu. “Since [the] P2-per-minute component was suspended, we received a lot of painful complaints from our partners that their earnings are not sufficient anymore to make a decent living. That’s why we decided to step in.” The subsidy will be provided to drivers for trips that fall below P5.50 per minute or P330 per hour. Grab gave this example to illustrate how the subsidy would work: “If a ride from Makati to BGC (Bonifacio Global City) takes an hour because of heavy traffic despite short distance, and fare is computed at P120 only, Grab will return to the driver the P210 difference to make sure he made P330 for that one-hour trip.” The ride-hailing company reiterated on Tuesday that there continues to be a vehicle shortage on its platform, with only 33,000 cars available for 600,000 to 800,000 passenger bookings a day. “With guaranteed earnings, we hope that this subsidy will also urge our partners to be more confident that they will make money for any trip they get and continue providing quality service to the riding public,” Cu said. He added that the subsidy is different from incentives which are “only a bonus for drivers who hit a certain number of rides.” The subsidy will be in place, according to Cu, “as long as it’s needed” and the company still has funds for it. Grab has been criticized for alleged overcharging and “deteriorating” service, after it acquired Uber last March. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), which is reviewing the Grab-Uber deal, said that Grab has taken control of 93% of the local ride-hailing market, leaving commuters on the losing end. The LTFRB has since accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies, but the PCC does not expect these firms to challenge Grab’s dominance anytime soon “because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base.” Grab maintains that it does not charge illegal fares, but launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience” in response to complaints of poor service. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/204800-toyota-investment-ride-hailing-company-grab-asia/","title":"Toyota investing $1 billion in Grab","date":"Jun 13, 2018 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The Japanese automaker plans to expand beyond its core business into the 'mobility' sector","body":" TOKYO, Japan (UPDATED) – Toyota said Wednesday, June 13, it was investing $1 billion in Asia ride-share company Grab, as the Japanese automaker looks to expand beyond its core business into the “mobility” sector. Grab, which is headquartered in Singapore, is a leading player in the ride-share industry in Asia, and earlier this year agreed to acquire US giant Uber’s regional operations. In a statement, Toyota said the deal “is aimed at achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental car fleet across Southeast Asia, and at rolling out various connected services throughout the region that utilize vehicle data” stored by Toyota. Toyota will place one of its executives on Grab’s board, and a second Toyota team member will serve as an executive officer at the company, which Toyota called the “partner of choice for ride-hailing in the region.” The investment comes as Toyota works to adapt to what company president Akio Toyoda calls “profound change” in the industry. Last month, Toyoda pledged to transform the auto giant to meet a “once-in-a-century challenge.” “I have decided to transform Toyota from a car manufacturer to a mobility company,” he said, without offering much detail on what that would entail beyond providing “various services involving movement of people around the world.” Grab operates across Asia and agreed to acquire Uber’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year.

The unnumbered department order (DO) subjects transport network companies (TNCs) and operators of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to the “full regulation and supervision” of the LTFRB. Under the order, which took effect immediately, the LTFRB was given the authority to issue or suspend franchises, set fares, determine operating conditions, and impose fines. The previous DO 2017-11 and DO 2015-11 only gave the LTFRB oversight functions over fare setting. DO 2017-11 stated that there would be a “pre-arranged fare as authorized by the LTFRB,” while DO 2015-11 gave TNCs the right to “set fares, subject to LTFRB’s oversight.” These provisions of the DO were in question when ride-hailing company Grab Philippines changed its fare scheme on its own. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Now, under the newly-signed DO, the LTFRB will determine the fare scheme of ride-hailing companies through “public hearings or consultations.” “The fare for the TNVS shall be determined by the LTFRB, after public hearing or in consultation with the TNCs and TNVS,” the DO states. It also reminds ride-hailing companies and operators to comply with all laws, particularly the law governing common carriers. “Any violation or non-compliance by TNCs and TNVS are grounds for imposition of fines, suspension, and cancellation of accreditation, subject to notice and hearing,” states the DO. Grab to ‘comply’ In response, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said that they have yet to receive a copy of the order, but that they will comply “as always.” Cu added that the DO “strengthens” Grab’s position that the P2-per-minute travel charge it added on its own is “legal.” “Since DO 2015-011, Grab has faithfully complied with the framework and the requirements imposed upon us by DOTr and the LTFRB,” he said. While Grab believes the DO “strengthens” the legality of its P2-per-minute travel charge, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles thinks otherwise. “It is very clear that TNCs cannot set their own fares like all other land transport systems…. I hope that this is clear to all TNCs that the law should be followed,” Nograles said. For Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, the new order “will benefit” both the companies and the customers. “Kaya mahalaga na may regulasyon, para nababantayan at nasisiguro natin na walang naaagrabyado…. Siyempre, gusto natin patas ang playing field at patas ang kompetisyon,” Tugade said. (That’s why regulation is important, so we can monitor and make sure that no one is taken advantage of….

If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less,' says Grab Philippines head Brian Cu","body":" MANILA, Philippines – PBA Partylist Representative Jericho Nograles accused ride-hailing company Grab Philippines of forcing its drivers to work in “slave-like” conditions. In a statement on Thursday, June 7, Nograles said the ride-hailing company subjects its partner-drivers to unfair profit sharing mechanisms and “humanly impossible” quotas for incentives. “With no financial and health risk, Grab is making a lot money, while the drivers who are working in slave-like conditions are left without any protection. To me, this is immoral and this is utterly wrong. This has to stop now and put Grab to the place where it really belongs,” Nograles said. Grab drivers who attended a consultation meeting with Nograles revealed that their take-home pay is only about P655 per day after working a minimum of 18 hours, the lawmaker said. The average commission of Grab per day amounts to P600, he added. Nograles had accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker said he would support the petition to implement fare changes if Grab Philippines foregoes of the 20% commission they charge from drivers, and to only take the P40 base fare per ride. “I will definitely back up the driver’s petition to implement the fair charges, on the condition that Grab Philippines forego any commission from this charge,” Nograles said. Reimpose P2 per minute In a statement late Thursday, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said: “No one among Grab parters is being forced to drive long hours. If the congressman is fair, he should also look into other transport sectors whose drivers work even longer hours earning less.” Cu then again raised Grab Philippines’ appeal with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to reimpose the suspended P2-per-minute travel charge. “[I]n the spirit of fairness, we also urge him to enjoin all TNCs (transport network companies), which all have LTFRB-approved per-minute fare component in their fare structures, to forego their commissions, as he suggests,” Cu said. Grab earlier said the suspension of the charge led to fewer drivers, with only 35,000 drivers available for over 600,000 bookings a day. Cu said Nograles’ earlier accusation of illegal charges caused the drivers’ income to “drop drastically.” “Nograles actually caused drivers’ income to drop drastically when he questioned the legality of the P2 per minute fare component…. Without the P2, many drivers stopped driving, making commuting more difficult for the riding public,” Cu said. “Throughout the past months, he certainly has not been a constructive force in helping both drivers and the riding public,” he added. This is the latest move by the lawmaker in a bid to regulate Grab Philippines. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila.

The House committee on Metro Manila development met with representatives from the DOTr, local government units, motorcycle groups, and other government agencies on Wednesday. Quezon City 2nd District Representative Winston Castelo, the chairman of the committee, urged the DOTr to amend the department order (DO) on transport network vehicle services (TNVS) to include motorcycles. “We need to help ease the burden of Filipino commuters as soon as possible. This is why we need to allow motorcycles for hire to operate because they help in ferrying people,” Castelo said. Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code mandates that motorcycles can only be registered as private vehicles or as government vehicles, not vehicles for hire. But Castelo argued that the DO allowed private vehicles under the new TNVS category to provide ride-hailing services to commuters. “The same can be done for motorcycles,” he said. In response, Transportation Assistant Secretary Arnulfo Fabillar said the department would come up with guidelines before the end of June. ‘Beating traffic’ For advocacy groups, allowing motorcycles to be part of the ride-hailing market would help alleviate the dire traffic situation in the country. “[M]akakatulong itong maibsan ang hirap na nararanasan ng ating mga mananakay at mabibigyan rin ng pagkakataong magkaroon ng disenteng hanapbuhay ang ating mga kababayan,” said George Royeca, co-convenor of Transport Watch. (This would help ease the suffering of the riding public and would give our fellow Filipinos a decent livelihood.) Royeca also noted that legalizing motorcycles for hire would help regulate the illegal operations of habal-habals. A recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey commissioned by Transport Watch showed that one in every 3 Filipino households owns a motorcycle. Half use it for livelihood. Road safety The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and advocates had earlier raised concerns over the safety of motorcycles. (READ: Habal-habal: Understanding the true cost of a cheap ride) According to government data, 24,000 crashes in Metro Manila involved motorcycles in 2017, killing 247 people and injuring 12,182. Of the dead, 178 were drivers of motorcycles, 37 were passengers, while 32 were pedestrians. (IN CHARTS: How deadly are Metro Manila roads?) But Jobert Bolaños, spokesperson for motorcycle riders’ group Riders of the Philippines, said ride-hailing platforms such as Angkas provide training for drivers. “Before you can even join the app-based motorcycle TNVS, you have to undergo a rigid screening process and then get strict training. This is meant to ensure that the riders are the safest possible motorcycle riders on the road,” he said. Bolaños added that grievance mechanisms also prevent motorcycle riders from committing abusive behavior. For Angkas head of operations David Medrana, it’s “about time” that the transportation department come up with policies addressing the needs of commuters. “Angkas is willing to lend our understanding of the transport situation to the committee and the DOTr so we may come up with fair and non-discriminatory laws that will help provide transport services that Filipinos need to address the demand of the times,” Medrana said. In November 2017, the LTFRB ordered Angkas to stop operations, saying that it’s up to Congress to legalize ride-hailing services offered by motorcycles. (READ: Why Angkas is illegal) The LTFRB also suspended the motorcycle ride-hailing services of Grab in 2016. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/203956-erdogan-says-uber-finished-turkey/","title":"Erdogan says Uber ‘finished’ in Turkey","date":"Jun 2, 2018 6:39 PM PHT","snippet":"'Our Prime Minister made the announcement. We have our system of taxis,' adds the Turkish President","body":" ISTANBUL, Turkey – President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the ride hailing app Uber is “finished” in Turkey, following intense pressure from Istanbul taxi drivers for the service to be banned. Erdogan’s comments, in a late night speech on Friday, June 1, in Istanbul, came after the government agreed new rules that are expected to severely complicate Uber’s operations in Turkey. Drivers of Istanbul’s yellow taxis have over the last months waged an intense campaign to have Uber banned, saying the company is eating into their business without having a proper legal basis for work. “This thing emerged called Uber or Muber or whatever,” said Erdogan. “But this issue is now finished. It’s over now.” “Our Prime Minister (Binali Yildirim) made the announcement. We have our system of taxis,” he added. Yildirim’s government last month issued a directive sharply hiking fines and threatened blacklisting for companies whose vehicles illegally work as taxis. The official taxi drivers association said at the time the measure would be a major threat to Uber, if it was properly enforced by the traffic police. Erdogan said that while Uber may be popular in some European countries, Turkey was different. “Why did it (Uber) emerge? Because it was in Europe. But what is Europe to me? We will take the decision ourselves.” His comments come 3 weeks ahead of keenly-contested presidential and parliamentary elections. Many Istanbul taxi drivers – though not all – are strong Erdogan supporters and the main taxi associations back him. The 17,400 official yellow taxis in Istanbul are a pillar of the city’s often patchy transport system, but critics say that poor quality service and overcharging have given Uber an opportunity. The yellow taxi drivers, on the other hand, slam Uber as “pirates” who are swallowing their incomes in an already tight market. Uber has said it is committed to working in Turkey and insisted it is operating within the law. “We want to work in cooperation with all the relevant stakeholders to improve transportation options in Turkey and we are committed long-term to Turkey, to the end, as a loyal partner,” it said in a rare Turkish statement this week. The tension in Turkey is one of a number of headaches for Uber and its new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over last August after founder Travis Kalanick was ousted following a series of scandals. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/203765-daily-news-highlights-may-31-2018-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, May 31, 2018","date":"May 31, 2018 11:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

For the first time in months, the Philippines silently filed a note verbale against China over the latter’s recent moves in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea). Insiders said the note verbale included the installation of missiles in the Spratlys. It also covered a Chinese Navy chopper’s alleged harassment of a Philippine Navy rubber boat on May 11, when the Philippines was resupplying its troops in Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal). Meanwhile, amid mounting complaints over the high prices of fuel and basic commodities, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno insisted that Filipinos should not complain too much and “be less of a crybaby.” The higher prices are due to the first package of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train), which aims to support the government’s ambitious infrastructure push. Also in transportation, Grab Philippines denied the findings of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) that its acquisition of Uber Philippines led to higher fares and “deteriorating” quality of service in the ride-hailing market. Grab argued that there are too many passengers and not enough vehicles.

In a statement on Wednesday, May 30, Grab said it had received the PCC’s Statement of Concerns (SOC) dated May 22, where the antitrust watchdog said that the Grab-Uber deal “has resulted and will likely continue to result in a substantial lessening of competition” in the market. The SOC is part of the PCC’s ongoing review of the deal. Grab again argued that there are too many passengers and not enough vehicles. (READ: Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day) “We are of the view that any perceived increase in price is not an exercise of any market power, but the result of demand and supply imbalance given the current shortage of available drivers and the regulatory constraint relating to the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cap, which are outside of our control,” Grab said. This demand and supply imbalance, added Grab, “is likely to be temporary” because the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has since accredited 5 other ride-hailing companies – MiCab, HirNa, Owto, Go Lag, and Hype. But the PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) found that the new industry players are unlikely to provide much of a challenge to Grab – at least not in the near future. With Uber’s exit, Grab now controls 93% of the ride-hailing market. “Such entry of competitors would not be timely, likely, and sufficient because it would take a significant amount of time and cost to build a driver and rider base sufficient to contest the incumbent,” said the PCC. ‘Deteriorating’ service As for complaints about poor service, Grab noted that it recently launched a “100-day improvement plan to improve driver and rider experience.” One of the top complaints is driver cancellation, though Grab earlier claimed that riders are more likely to cancel than drivers. The PCC, however, had said that its data show “prices are increasing, while quality of service is deteriorating, to the detriment of the riding public.” Grab, according to the PCC, also increased the frequency of its surge pricing. The commission’s MAO based its findings on “total observations of 27,648 booking requests over 3 phases” as well as “mystery shopper surveys (a total quota of 1,104 rides),” conducted before and after Uber exited the market on April 16. “Passenger surveys and interviews… indicate more driver cancellations, forced cancellation of rides, and longer waiting times,” said the PCC. In response to these findings, Grab said it would share its own market analysis with the PCC, to show that its deal with Uber “has no anti-competitive effect.” The company will file a formal reply to address the points in the SOC. “We hope that the PCC will fairly assess our arguments and sit down with us to discuss how to address any issues that the PCC may identify moving forward,” the company said. Illegal fares? In a separate statement, Grab also maintained that its fares are “legal and upfront,” denying the allegations of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles that it charges illegal rates. Nograles earlier claimed Grab had an unauthorized charge of P2 per minute of travel and a supposedly illegal P80 minimum fare. The LTFRB suspended the P2 per minute charge – a decision that’s under appeal – and also said it was not informed about the minimum fare. Grab said a 2015 order from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allowed transport network companies (TNCs) to set their own fares without LTFRB approval. “Congressman Jericho Nograles may be rocking the boat for his political ends, not really to protect the riding public. Proof is his own bill in Congress wants the TNCs to set their own fares, exactly what he is opposing now,” said Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales. In response, Nograles told Rappler that “Grab cannot change the facts through press releases.” The lawmaker added: “Grab advertised that they don’t charge per-minute fees, when in fact they did. Grab admitted under oath that they did not inform the riding public, the LTFRB, or the drivers and operators when they implemented the illegal fees on June 5, 2017. Let’s wait for the decision of the [LTFRB] in a few days.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/203634-thewrap-may-29-2018-evening-edition/","title":"Duterte certifies BBL as urgent, LTFRB on Grab, COA on OGCC | Evening wRap","date":"May 29, 2018 7:30 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch Rappler's evening newscast with Marguerite de Leon","body":"Today on Rappler: President Rodrigo Duterte certifies as urgent the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law. President Rodrigo Duterte voices an interest in the vote recount for the 2016 vice presidential race. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board says it was ‘not informed’ that ride-hailing company Grab is charging passengers minimum fares. The Commission on Audit says 5 government corporate lawyers in the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel directly received allowances from their state clients, which were all untaxed and exceeded the allowable amount. United States President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agree  that it is ‘imperative’ to completely dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/203601-ltfrb-not-informed-grab-philippines-minimum-fare/","title":"LTFRB not informed of Grab’s minimum fares","date":"May 29, 2018 2:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab has been charging a minimum fare of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, and P125 for premium cars","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) officials on Tuesday, May 29, said they “were not informed” that ride-hailing company Grab would be charging passengers minimum fares. Visibly surprised by the information, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III asked Grab representatives during a hearing when the minimum fares were imposed. Grab lawyer Miguel Aguila said they started on June 5, 2017. “Ayusin ’nyo nga ’yung papel ’nyo. Ang gulo,” Delgra told Grab. (Fix your papers. It’s a mess.) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles informed the LTFRB in a hearing on Tuesday that Grab Philippines charges “illegal” minimum fares, which “were not declared” by the ride-hailing company,  Nograles said Grab charges a minimum of P80 for its sedan and 6-seater vehicles, while the premium cars start at P125. In response to a question, Delgra said during a media interview that the board was not informed of charges separate from the flagdown rate of P40. “Obviously, [we were] not [informed] insofar as the computation of minimum fare is concerned – compared to the base fare and in relation to the other factors to determine the fare,” Delgra said. Delgra said the LTFRB is not yet considering suspending Grab’s minimum fares, but the board needs a clarification on the matter. “We won’t necessarily remove this, but we are asking for clarification. We are only following the 4 elements in determining fares,” he said in Filipino.  Delgra said that the fares depend on the computation of the flagdown rate, the distance traveled, time charges, and the surge pricing. Under the government-approved fares, Grab charges an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer and has a surge cap of twice the distance traveled on top of the flagdown fare. Grab said that it was never the company’s intention to “hide” the fare from its patrons. “What you see on the app, that is an upfront fare. If it is a minimum distance, it’s a minimum fare, we never tried to hide it from the general public,” Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said. Illegal charges? Nograles earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge has since been suspended. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) The lawmaker’s allegation prompted an LTFRB hearing to determine the validity of the travel charges. “If they truly subject themselves to the board, then why didn’t they apply to the board? Their only formal application for it was January of this year, way after they unilaterally imposed it,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said Grab’s move puts into question the authority of LTFRB as a regulatory agency. LTFRB earlier said they were not consulted either when the P2-per-minute fare was initially charged.  The ride-hailing company’ legal counsel argued that the P2-per-minute charge was added to cover the costs of the drivers when picking up the passenger at their pinned location in the Grab app. During the hearing, Delgra asked Grab to submit to the board the company’s earnings since the P2-per-minute charge was imposed. For the drivers Winson Esteras, leader of the coalition of transport network vehicle services, said on Tuesday that the P2-per-minute charge helps drivers cope with the costs incurred by longer travel time due to traffic congestion. “Kung mapapansin ‘nyo naman na hindi na talaga kami kumikita…. Pa’no ‘yung traffic? ‘Yung fare ngayon hindi na aligned sa sinisingil na gas sa amin,” Esteras said. (If you notice, we’re not earning a lot…. How about the traffic? The fare now is not aligned with the cost of gas.) Grab Philippines had admitted that its riders were not informed when the additional charges were rolled out starting June 5, 2017.  They argued that this is legal and asked for it to be reimposed, saying that it is for the drivers’ benefit. Grab still dominates the Philippine ride-hailing market after the exit of Uber last April. The LTFRB recently approved 5 new companies that would challenge Grab, but most have yet to be operational in Metro Manila.

In a statement, Nograles said this minimum fare was not authorized by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “Without any public hearing, Grab Philippines again unilaterally imposed a new illegal fare condition. [D]uring the April 17 LTFRB hearing, Grab Philippines denied to the board that they impose an P80 minimum fare,” Nograles said. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated transport network companies’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Now, no less than the Grab app publicly declares that the company charges the same minimum fare. This brazen act shows not only disrespect to the regulators, but proof that Grab Philippines has no intention to follow Philippine laws,” Nograles said. “This is a usurpation of the powers of the LTFRB and this is a violation of our existing laws. Just because they now have a virtual monopoly of our TNVS (transport network vehicle services) sector, they can now violate our laws by setting their own fare rates?” he added. Under the information card on the Grab app, its sedan and 6-seater vehicles for hire charge a minimum of P80 per ride, while the premium cars start at P125. Nograles said that under the approved fare structure, a rider should only be charged a maximum of P68 for a 500-meter ride at a surge rate of times two. It should not be at P80, he said. The lawmaker earlier accused Grab of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?)

A copy of the petition dated May 22 was made available to media on Friday, May 25. “It is clear that members of the Honorable Board who issued the order suspending the per-minute charge of the petitioner have caused undue injury and prejudice to the petitioner,” Grab said. They also said that the suspension of the charge “gave unwarranted benefits and advantage” to other transportation network companies, arguing that operators and drivers will “transfer” to other ride-hailing companies given the situation. (READ: How much are the fares of new ride-hailing apps?) Grab Philippines also said that a motion for reconsideration on the suspension was filed, meaning the suspension should have been delayed and should not have been rendered “immediately executory.” “Since the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioner on April 20, 2018 has the effect of staying the April 19, 2018 order, petitioner then has the legal authority to resume the imposition of the P2-per-minute charge pending the resolution of the motion,” Grab said.

(READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) In a text message to Rappler, Nograles said Grab’s petition is “unfounded.” “Their petition is unfounded since reimposition means it was legal in the first place. It was never approved therefore there is nothing to reimpose,” Nograles said on Friday. “They dont have the moral authority to talk about equal protection of the laws when they have admitted that they have never conducted a public hearing for the P2-per-minute [charge],” Nograles added. Under the government-approved fare scheme, Grab can only charge a flagdown rate of P40 and an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer, a December 2016 order said. Grab earlier admitted that riders were not informed of the travel charges when first added to their fares mid-2017.

Cu earlier said that the suspension of the charge led to fewer Grab drivers, with only 35,000 drivers available for over 600,000 bookings a day.

With the exit of Uber from the Philippine ride-hailing market, many Filipino commuters were left with only Grab. But in April, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) accredited 5 new ride-hailing companies that offer booking services for taxis, sedans, and other vehicle types. So who are the new players and what can they offer? And more importantly, how much will they charge?  New ride-hailing apps MiCab MiCab Systems Corporation is a taxi-hailing company which traces its roots to a startup ideation camp in Cebu City in 2012. It has been operating in the city since then. MiCab is a wordplay for Mobile Internet Cab, with the aim to modernize taxi operations. (WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab) With its accreditation, MiCab looks at venturing into the Metro Manila market while maintaining operations in Cebu, Iloilo, and Davao. MiCab does not charge booking fees. Commuters only have to pay what is on the taxi meter. Under government-approved fares, taxis charge a P40 flagdown rate, with an additional P13.50 every 300 meters and P2 per minute travel. The company supports its operations through MiAds or advertisements placed inside its taxis. HirNa Like MiCab, HirNa Mobility Solutions Incorporated is another transport network company (TNC) that is focused on giving taxis a platform for bookings. HirNa chief executive officer Coco Mauricio earlier said they saw the “need to tap into an existing transportation mode such as taxis.” The company started in Davao City in 2017 as part of the city’s transportation master plan. HirNa is now looking at expanding to Metro Manila, Iligan City in Lanao del Norte, and Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental. The app has a 24/7 hotline service for bookings to cater to commuters who do not have smartphones. It also has a button within the app that directly connects to the hotline of the LTFRB, should there be problems with the ride. To place bookings, patrons don’t have to put their destination, unlike other ride-hailing apps. They can choose between a taxi sedan or a taxi AUV. HirNa doesn’t charge booking fees as well, with commuters paying only what is on the taxi meter. The LTFRB recently allowed all ride-hailing firms to charge P2/min travel. This means that Hirna may start charging per-minute rates starting September 21, if they decide to do so. Owto Owto is a TNC by Ipara Technologies and Solutions Incorporated, founded by former Grab and Uber drivers who wanted to make the ride-hailing industry a profitable one for drivers. Paulo Libertad, Owto’s chief operating officer, said they charge the smallest commission among other companies at 15%. The average commission charged is at 20% of driver’s earnings, not including incentives. Owto recently launched on May 18. Like Uber and Grab, it offers transport network vehicle services for sedans around Metro Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite. It also has a pooling feature. It charges a fee of P50 if cancellations are done 3 minutes after the booking was made. Under its approved fares, Owto charges a base fare of P40, with an additional P12 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. They set a surge cap of times two the fare for the distance traveled and duration of the ride. Go Lag Go Laguna, or Go Lag for short, is a ride-hailing service looking at offering rides to Greater Metro Manila Area commuters, who are sometimes rejected by existing ride-hailing drivers because of the distance. Originally intended to serve the province of Laguna, Go Lag expanded its intended market to Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan. Go Lag has yet to launch its app, but is currently accepting driver applications. It will be a ride-hailing platform for sedans. Go Lag will be charging a base fare of P40, on top of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute travel. Surge pricing is capped at 1.5 times. Hype  Among the TNCs, Hype Transport Systems focuses on the security of both drivers and commuters. Though the app is not yet available for download, Hype will feature an “SOS” button in times of emergencies. Hype will offer different vehicle types for commuters ranging from taxis and sedans to AUVs and SUVs. It will also offer a ride-sharing service for sedans. The flagdown rate for each service depends on the vehicle type. Sedans will have a base of P40. For SUVs, it’s at P70, and for vans, P100. There will be an additional charge of P14 per kilometer and P2 per minute, with a surge cap at times two the charge. Meanwhile, Hype’s ride-sharing service has a P30 flagdown rate on top of P9.50 per kilometer travel. Existing ride-hailing apps Grab Grab, through MyTaxi.PH, has been in the Philippine market since 2013, offering taxi-hailing services. In 2015, it launched its private vehicle booking service as well as more luxurious cars. Grab is available in Metro Manila and major cities around the Philippines. It recently got involved in a controversy involving its fares, when PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused it of illegally charging its customers P2 per minute of travel on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. The charge was suspended in April. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) LTFRB said that Grab can now charge P2 per minute since it allowed all firms to do so, but the order will not affect its pending case before the regulatory board. In December 2016, the LTFRB regulated TNCs’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40 for sedans, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. For a 6-seater vehicle, Grab charges a flagdown rate of P60, with P13 to P19 per kilometer. For premium cars, the base fare is at P70 on top of P16 to P23 per kilometer. Grab launched a 100-day campaign geared toward improving driver and passenger experience. It is looking at imposing cancellation fees as well. U-Hop U-Hop was granted a license to operate as a TNC by the LTFRB back in March 2016. Among TNCs, U-Hop is the only company that offers shuttle services to individuals and companies. When it launched in July 2016, U-Hop only offered shuttle services with a capacity of 7 passengers. It now offers the same services as Uber and Grab, which is to pre-arrange taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides. It is operational in Metro Manila, Cebu, and other major cities. But in February, U-Hop was suspended in Batangas, with the local government requiring documents necessary for operations. U-Hop charges P40 for sedans, P70 for SUVs, and P100 for vans, with an additional P14.75 to P15.75 per kilometer and P2 per minute of travel. For companies, they charge a monthly membership of P3,999 for 40 prioritized rides. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/202665-micab-eddie-ybanez-interview-ridesharing-issues/","title":"WATCH: 6 questions with the founder of new Grab competitor, Micab","date":"May 17, 2018 10:26 AM PHT","snippet":"Eddie Ybañez speaks to Rappler on what MiCab brings to the ridesharing landscape","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A ridesharing service has set up shop in Manila, promising to supply an additional 5,000 taxis by June to a ridesharing market currently dominated by Grab. Called Micab, the service launched in 2012 in Cebu before expanding to a few other provincial markets. In April this year, it got the nod of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to operate in Manila.  Since Grab acquired chief rival Uber’s Southeast Asia operations in March, the ridesharing market has practically operated in a monopoly. The arrival of Micab, and other upcoming ridesharing services such as Owto, Go Lag, Hype, and Hirna, is expected to restore some balance to the market. For consumers, the arrival of new players sparks hope that it will eventually be faster to book a ride, and that drivers will behave more fairly at the risk of losing customers to other players.  We talked to Eddie Ybañez, founder and CEO of Micab, on how they’ll be addressing issues that currently plague the ridesharing market. Micab’s primary edge against other competitors, says Ybañez, is that it won’t be charging booking fees and do surge pricing because the business is supported by its ad service, MiAds. Watch our quick video above for the rest of his answers or read the transcript below: Q: What’s your edge over the competition? Eddie Ybañez: At Micab, what we’re doing is we’re improving the taxi industry by providing safety, and a more convenient way to hail a ride. But the good thing with this is this promise comes very affordably. Because whatever the existing fare structure is, that’s what passengers have to pay. We don’t have a booking fee or surge pricing. I think that’s what our edge is compared to all the other players.  Q: How many taxis will Micab be able to bring to the ridesharing market?  EY: Our partners are capable of producing, in Manila alone, 15,000. That’s our target. That’s our target but the moment our other fleets sign on, we’ll have more taxis. Our target is about 30,000, maybe. Q: Now we’re at 5,000 in Manila? EY: 5,000 by June.   Q: When do we reach 15,000? EY: We’re targeting early next year to reach 15,000 in Manila. Nationwide, the 15,000-taxi goal is now doable, because they have already signed on.  Q: How are you addressing bad driver behavior?  EY: Before, there was no platform, no system for taxis. It was just the passenger and the driver who knew what was going on during the trip. If the driver did something, only the passenger would know – unless he posts it on Facebook or something.  But with Micab now, passengers have the power to report, to rate the driver, to commend the driver or file a complaint. The moment a 3-star rating is reported – even without details – our customer service will call the passenger and driver to investigate. Depending on the severity of the complaint, the drivers may be forced to go under re-training, or they will be taken off the platform, penalized by the operator, or if it’s a criminal offense, government agencies can step in, and impose penalties.   The driver’s license can get suspended for the next 3 months, 6 months or 1 year – that’s an existing ruling at the LTFRB. We’re actually sharing the system with the taxi operators and the government agencies.  Q: Will drivers see their passenger’s destination prior to accepting a trip? This has been seen as a reason why drivers are able to cancel on and pick passengers at will.  EY: Brainstorming on the decision whether to retain the driver’s ability to see passenger destination or not was tough. But eventually, the decision for us to allow the driver to see the destination won.  Why? As much as possible, we don’t want confrontations. We don’t want them to fight in the streets just because, say, a driver finds out that the destination is Bulacan. They might just end up fighting.   But since we’re allowing that, we’re limiting the number of times a driver can ignore or reject a request.  The moment a driver rejects 3 requests in one day, they will be blocked in the system for a day.  This will affect their rating. The moment they reach a 3-star average rating, they won’t be able to get passengers unless they do re-training.  Q: What happens when a passenger reports a driver who asks for additional fees?   EY: The operations team will investigate the incident. When they investigate, we’ll have access to their conversation on the app. So we can trace that. So passengers are actually protected. If a driver asks for a fixed contract rate for a trip, which is illegal, we can even report that to the LTFRB.  There’s a record of the conversation between passenger and driver. There’s evidence.   This is the big difference between now and then. Now there’s someone looking at them. The drivers themselves will behave better knowing that someone is monitoring them, like a parent to a child. Q: How fast can a passenger book a ride?  EY: Currently, we average 10 minutes, but we’re still ramping up in Manila. We haven’t even launched officially, but we’re operational already. The app is downloadable already. There are around an extra 1,000 cabs [about to be activated].  But we’re trying really that by the end of June, we have 5,000 cabs.  Hopefully, the moment more cabs get enabled – it’s just supply and demand, really – ride acceptance becomes faster. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/sports/202307-floyd-mayweather-investment-u-hop-shopping-dog-designer-shoes/","title":"LOOK: Mayweather buys designer shoes for his dog","date":"May 11, 2018 10:27 PM PHT","snippet":"The American boxing icon and The Money Team head for another shopping jaunt","body":"    MANILA, Philippines – It’s no secret that Floyd Mayweather Jr. has a penchant for blowing his money on anything he fancies.

The amount is still undetermined.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines is planning to impose a fee on riders for trip cancellations. In a media briefing on Tuesday, May 8, Grab Philippines marketing head Cindy Toh said there are ongoing discussions to roll out the feature in a few months. “Grab is eyeing to impose a cancellation fee – our target [is] that this will be done within the [next] 100 days,” Toh said. According to Toh, riders are more likely to cancel their bookings than drivers. Data showed that passengers cancel 12% of their rides, while drivers cancel 8% of their bookings. Imposing a cancellation fee is seen as a solution – a feature that Uber used to have. But Grab has yet to determine how much the fee will be, and how to roll out the feature for trips paid with cash. “For sure, we can implement it for credit card users. The challenge we encounter is for riders paying in cash,” Toh said. She added that Grab will soon issue new receipts which will indicate the fare breakdown of every trip. “On the new receipt, you should be able to see the surge rate and the base fare, how many kilometers ang travel mo (your travel was). That is already a work in progress,” Toh said. PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had accused Grab of charging an additional P2 per minute on top of its government-approved scheme. He pointed out that Grab’s receipts do not show the trip’s fare breakdown. The charge has since been suspended by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Better service Grab is at the center of controversy over its drivers’ behavior, with Filipinos complaining of “poor service” after it bought Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. Toh said they are committed to improving customer experience by updating their drivers’ code of conduct, as well as implementing a new set of guidelines for passenger behavior. “We impose a maximum cancellation of one per day for our drivers. From our current driver cancellation of 8%, we should be able to reduce that by half or 4%,” Toh said. Grab will also expand its driver academy, which will include modules on road courtesy, customer service, and data privacy. Performance incentives will also be enhanced and a driver rewards program will be in place. Toh said all these will be done within their 100-day campaign.

On the tech side of things, they’re rolling out a new app interface for both iOS and Android.  Visually, the revamped interface cleans all the clutter in the home screen and divides Grab’s services to two tabs, namely Transport and Delivery. What’s more is that pinning locations in the map is now said to be more intuitive, and has been designed to make it easier for passengers and drivers to locate each other.   But for passengers who feel they have had a bad experience with the service, the key update is the new ability to report their concerns to Grab’s Help Center without leaving the app. The hope is it will expedite the filing of concerns, and encourage consumers to voice out their issues via the help center. To support the improved intergration, the ride-hailing service also announced that they’re enlarging their customer service team by partnering with a BPO company, which they expect to be fully operational by July. With the expansion of the cusomter service team, Grab said that they’re ensuring reports are resolved within 48 hours. After Uber’s exit, Grab has been in the spotlight for several issues including higher fares, misbehaving drivers, and long wait time for rides.  The in-app Emergency button, added in July of last year, is getting some added features and a name change. Now called the SOS button, passengers can directly connect to 911 and send text messages to three registered phone numbers in-app in case of emergencies. This new button is going to be launched starting June 4 this year.  “Our aim is to be passengers’ partner for better trips at all times. We have carefully studied new features that will further enhance our services while ensuring passenger safety on the road,” Cindy Toh, Country Marketing Head, said.  Grab also said plans to expand destination masking beyond the 25% of drivers with low acceptance rates are under review. According to them, the introduction of destination masking late last month had a bigger negative impact on ride acceptance rather than ride cancellations. They believe this could make it harder for passengers to book a ride if they expand beyond the initial number.  The revamped app interface has already started rolling out for iOS and is expected for Android by July 2018. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/201597-grab-philippines-drivers-not-enough-passenger-bookings/","title":"Grab: Only 35,000 drivers serve 600,000 bookings per day","date":"May 2, 2018 4:10 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab Philippines head Brian Cu also says 'driver numbers continue to drop' after the suspension of the P2-per-minute travel charge","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab Philippines said it has an “undersupply” of vehicles to meet passenger demand, with only 35,000 drivers available for 600,000 bookings made per day. The number of drivers continues to drop, too, said Grab Philippines head Brian Cu in a statement on Wednesday, May 2. “Driver numbers continue to drop as uncertainty in maintaining sustainable livelihood increases. With the recent suspension of P2-per-minute fare, a lot of drivers and operators fear they won’t be able to provide for their families and car maintenance expenses,” Cu said. He added that Grab drivers are not necessarily “choosy” with bookings, but rather demand exceeds supply. “Majority of social media sentiment we monitor regarding the inability to get a ride is due to the perception of choosy drivers, but in reality this is because there are no available cars in the area,” Cu said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on April 18 suspended Grab’s P2-per-minute travel charge, as the board said it had not approved the additional fare. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) PBA Representative Jericho Nograles had raised the issue of the additional P2-per-minute travel charge, which Grab admitted it started imposing in June 2017 without informing passengers. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in alleged overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. Longer wait Grab said the overflow in demand came after it acquired Uber’s operations, resulting in passengers enduring “longer waits or not getting allocated a vehicle at all.” Cu said that prior to the acquisition, Grab had 24,000 vehicles which were able to serve 60% to 65% of bookings. After the acquisition, Grab only accepted Uber drivers on the LTFRB masterlist. The list consists of drivers who can apply for a franchise from the regulatory board. So, out of 19,000 active Uber drivers, Cu said only 11,000 were able to move to Grab. Around 6,000 or majority of the remaining Uber drivers weren’t on the masterlist and could not switch. “We appeal to the LTFRB to allow the displaced 6,000 Uber drivers who are not part of the masterlist to continue driving with their chosen TNC (transport network company) in order to support the demand,” Cu said. He added that with an average of 12 rides a day, each vehicle will be able to serve an additional 72,000 rides which would “ease the plight of the riders.” The LTFRB earlier raised the “common supply base,” or the number of allowed franchises under transport network vehicle services (TNVS), to 65,000 units in Metro Manila, 1,500 in Metro Cebu, and 250 in Pampanga. The cap was the LTFRB’s attempt to regulate the TNCs and avoid adding more cars to the capital region’s already congested roads. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada told reporters on Wednesday that the cap would be reevaluated every 3 months to see whether it should be increased or decreased based on data. “We need to stress that this is a new denomination. Everyone is working on the fly. It’s still too early to set rigid rules on a technology that is still being tested first by its newness vis-à-vis the owners, drivers, passengers, and competition,” Lizada said.

An auto-accept driver-app feature will also be fully rolled out on Friday, which will automatically assign bookings to drivers. This would allow a more seamless experience of accepting passenger requests, according to Grab. “We will implement non-showing of passenger information before ride acceptance, as it is a major source of complaints,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a statement on Tuesday, April 24. “For added protection during wee hours of the night, drivers, however, have an option to see passenger destination,” he added.

No further details or breakdown of the sanctions were given. Cu admitted that Grab’s service is currently “not optimal” with fewer drivers on the road. “Grab is trying its best to keep more drivers on the road to keep up with rider demand and prevent long waits and price surges,” he said. ‘At last’ In a message sent to reporters, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) welcomed Grab’s move to mask passengers’ destinations. “At least now the riders, hopefully, will have less cancellations.

Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu on Monday, April 23, said in a statement that his firm will continue imposing sanctions, like suspension and complete banning from the platform, on drivers with a 10% or above cancellation rate per week. “Only 5% cancellation rate is allowed as metric for incentives… We apologize that our services fell short. However, we will move forward. We have rolled out additional and stricter measures to address issues on cancellations and this is just the start,” Cu said. According to Grab, some drivers were suspended for 3 to 5 days. No further details or breakdown of the sanctions were given. Cu also said his company may sanction passengers who themselves have been reported. (READ: Indonesia’s Go-Jek eyes Philippine ride-hailing market) “While we do our best to further improve driver services, we hope that our passengers would also do their part and exercise the same level of commitment. We encourage our passengers to be responsible by maintaining minimal and valid cancellations and keeping wait time to no more than 7 minutes. Passengers with reported complaints may also face sanctions,” Cu added. Blaming it on LTFRB order Cu, however, also blamed the ride cancellations on the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) order to suspend his company’s P2-per-minute travel charge. “[D]river cancellation rate doubled at 11% last Friday and Saturday (April 20 and 21), and were predominantly driven by low fares. As a result, drivers drove less and Grab was only able to service half of the passenger demand,” he added. The LTFRB’s order came after a complaint lodged by PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. Grab then admitted that its riders were not informed about the P2-per-minute travel charge when it was first implemented in June 2017. After the LTFRB ordered Grab to stop the P2-per-minute travel charge, the ride-hailing firm filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the alleged illegal charge goes to the drivers and not to the company. “[T]he P2-per-minute travel time fare component was legal [based on a 2015 Department of Transportation order], and necessary to protect the livelihood of driver partners while sustaining transport demands of the riding public. [T]he P2 is not a Grab income because 80% goes to the driver directly while the 20% is spent on driver incentives and rider promos,” Cu said. Last Friday, the LTFRB approved Grab’s petition to restore its surge cap to two times from 1.5 times the normal fare. This means that the surge pricing cap is at most twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare.

Confirming a Reuters report, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Board Member Aileen Lizada told Rappler that Go-Jek executives will fly to the Philippines and meet with the agency on Tuesday, April 24, to discuss how the company can operate here. “They would like to personally introduce themselves and probably they will ask for the requirements [for transport network company (TNC) accreditation]. We will listen to what they have to offer,” Lizada said. TNCs provide pre-arranged transportation services using internet-based applications or a digital platform, connecting passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles. Back in December 2017, Go-Jek chief technology officer Ajey Gore told Reuters in an interview that his firm is planning to set up operations in the Philippines early this year, with other Southeast Asian countries to follow in the next few months. Go-Jek, backed by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, was established in 2010 as a motorcycle ride-hailing phone service. It then evolved into an on-demand mobile platform, providing transportation, logistics, mobile payments, and food delivery, among others. In February this year, the dominant Indonesian ride-hailing firm was able to raise over $1.5 billion from investors like BlackRock and Google. More local ride-hailing firms Other than Go-Jek, Lizada said there are two more local firms that have expressed interest in operating as a TNC: Cebu-based taxi-hailing platform MiCab and new ride-hailing firm Owto. “Owto and MiCab are applying for [TNC accreditation], while U-Hop and Grab are applying for renewal of accreditation,” Lizada told Rappler.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu explained on Wednesday, April 18, that fares are “not higher” because they “did not increase fare pricing” after they acquired Uber. Cu said it appears that fares are higher because Grab absorbed “100% of the demand” when Uber left the market but they have yet to absorb all Uber drivers to meet the demand. “The demand base is fully absorbed. It’s easier for the demand to flow than it is for the supply to flow,” he said. (READ: Grab: When Uber shuts down, not all 20,000 drivers have moved to us) According to Cu, about 40% of the Uber drivers from their masterlist had onboarded with Grab since they started the process early April. The country head also said that they will be employing stricter measures to avoid driver cancellations such as changing their incentive scheme for drivers. Cathy Toh, Grab Philippines marketing head, also invited passengers to continue reporting impertinent drivers. She said they had doubled their internal customer service team to address their woes. Grab is the only transport network company currently offering ride-hailing services in the Philippines, after Uber closed down on April 16.

Grab Philippines head Brian Cu made the statement in response to questions in a press briefing on Wednesday. “Riders were not informed [of the additional P2-per-minute charge]. There were no comms (communication) to the riders,” Cu said, when asked if Grab riders were informed of the charge through the Grab app or via social media. Cu said that there is no fare breakdown provided to riders as what they are shown upon booking is the “upfront price” or the total fare they pay at the end of the trip. This includes the computation for the travel duration charge. “The point that we like to make here is that the price for Grab is not the pre-agreed per kilometer or per minute but at the end of the trip, the sum of all those factors [are charged] and it’s fixed,” he added. The company head maintained that Grab is “transparent” in its charges, and reiterated that there was nothing illegal in charging the P2-per-minute charge, contrary to the allegation of PBA Representative Jericho Nograles. “Hindi namin tinatago ‘yung fact na nagcharge kami ng P2 per minute since July (We are not hiding the fact that we charged P2 per minute since July). We are well within our rights to charge the P2,” Cu said. Cu said that their rates are now shown on their website. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) Grab charges a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The travel duration charge is added on top of the base fare and distance charges. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board is investigating the alleged “illegal” charges. Nograles is demanding that Grab refund its customers a total of P1.8 billion in overcharged fares for the last 5 months alone. ‘Fares are legal’ Miguel Aguila, Grab’s lawyer, maintained that the ride-hailing company’s travel duration charge is legal. Aquila cited the Department Order (DO) 2015-11 of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), which he said allows Grab to set fares on its own. “Grab would like to set the record straight. Our fares are legal: ‘Fares are set by the TNCs (Transport Network Company) and is subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions in the market,'” he said. On Tuesday, April 17, Cu, Aguila, and Grab lawyer John Paul Nabua appeared before the LTFRB to explain why Grab’s accreditation should not be suspended or revoked amid allegations of  unauthorized charges. Aguila also said that the LTFRB was informed about Grab’s pricing scheme through the technical working group (TWG) in July, or a month after Grab started to impose the travel duration charge.  (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Why change fares on your own?) He added that the email correspondences with the LTFRB on Grab’s fare pricing scheme also transpired last year. Back to drivers, passengers Cu also said that the P2-per-minute charge did not go to the company, but benefitted both riders and passengers. “Fares are more fair for both sides and this P2-per-minute did not go to Grab. But it went to the drivers, it was reinvested by way of incentives or promos for passengers,” he said. Some Grab operators and drivers earlier expressed fears that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Nograles had said that drivers should be spared if a refund is ordered by the regulatory agency. Cu also said that Grab always complies with government regulations. When the LTFRB ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare, it immediately implemented it, he said.

On Tuesday, the LTFRB conducted a hearing on the alleged illegal charges by Grab Philippines on top of its government-approved pricing scheme. (READ: Did Grab ‘illegally’ charge its riders higher fare?) During the hearing, the regulatory board questioned representatives from Grab on how they “unilaterally” changed their fare scheme mid-2017, adding P2 per minute for every ride. “We are very specific how this mechanism was supposed to be implemented when a December 27, 2016 order remains as of today,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said. The December 2016 order regulated ride-hailing services’ fares, allowing Grab to charge a flagdown rate of P40, with an additional P10 to P14 per kilometer. The order does not include travel duration charges. “It is the position of the Board that the December 27, 2016 order mandates the fare structure – therefore there should be no other change in the fare structure, considering the fact that the Board exercised our adjudicatory powers,” Delgra said. The LTFRB instructed Grab to disclose in another hearing – set for May 29 – when exactly the travel duration charge was implemented, and how many rides were affected. It also asked Grab to further explain its algorithm for fare pricing in May. Illegal charges? Grab maintained, however, that it informed the LTFRB of its fare structure in a technical working group (TWG) meeting in July 2017. John Paul Nabua, Grab’s lawyer, said the ride-hailing company started charging the travel duration rate in “early June 2017” and informed the LTFRB about it the following month. As to why Grab implemented the new fare structure without the LTFRB’s approval, Nabua said Department Order (DO) 2015-11 issued by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) allows pricing changes, only “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of disruptions in the market.” Nabua also said the LTFRB’s December 2016 order mentions the “time travel charge,” and Grab deemed this applicable to ride-hailing firms. But Delgra said the provision does not apply to Grab, as the company did not charge by travel duration prior to the December 2016 order. “Was there a time rate when the order was decided in December 2016?” Delgra asked Grab, and was told, “No.” In response, the LTFRB chairman said, “Then this [provision] does not apply to you.” Refund? PBA Representative Jericho Nograles, who was also present during the hearing as complainant, said Grab only confirmed it did not go through the right process. “First of all, informing [the LTFRB] through a PowerPoint presentation is not a cause for approval. What we are pushing for here is due process for the rights of our consumers. The P2-per-minute charge did not undergo due process,” Nograles told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino. The lawmaker said that based on his calculations, Grab owes its riders some P3.2 billion. Some Grab drivers and operators who were also present during the hearing argued that they would bear the brunt of the refund, should the LTFRB deem the charges illegal. Some senators had also slammed the ride-hailing company’s “predatory pricing and overcharging.” The LTFRB previously ordered Grab to lower its surge pricing cap from multiplied by two times to only 1.5 times the normal fare.

As the antitrust authority, our lens is always focused on the market – in this case, we are reviewing the potential effects on competition in the merger between Grab and Uber,” the PCC said in a statement on Monday. The antitrust watchdog noted that it is “aware there are many factors that led to the shutdown of the Uber app.” “This development may have rendered the review conditions to be less than ideal, however, this move shall not derail the motu proprio review,” it added. (READ: Does PCC understand Grab-Uber deal? Grab says operations can’t be ‘separate’) The PCC also wants Grab and Uber to explain why the latter shut down, despite the commission ordering it to continue operating while the review is ongoing. “The parties are given until April 17 to explain why they have failed to continue operating the platform, as required in the Interim Measures Order,” said the PCC. The commission’s order contradicted that of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB), which ordered Uber to end operations before April 16. When the PCC previously ordered Uber to continue running beyond April 8, Grab had said it would shoulder the cost of the extension but only until April 15. Little room for newcomers The PCC now plans to fast-track the completion of its review, “given how it is imbued with public interest.” “When a big player buys out its competitor, there will be many economic and legal factors that need to be scrutinized,” the commission added. (READ: LTFRB to Grab: Explain ‘illegal’ P2-per-minute travel charge) The PCC went on to reiterate that Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s assets creates a potentially distorted market for ride-hailing. “Grab’s buyout of Uber will mean gobbling up 93% of the ride-hailing market. The accreditation of new TNCs (transport network companies) is a welcome development to allow passengers to have more choices. We note, however, that the incoming TNCs are left with only 7% share in the market,” said the commission. “Established firms have the advantage of an existing user base due to network effects. This means that when you buy a firm, in effect, you also get its customer base,” it added. The PCC said it would take that into consideration during the review to level the playing field. “In the end, the PCC stands with the passengers to protect them from the perils of monopoly,” it concluded.

Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said Grab, as the “surviving” company after buying Uber, has no right to charge consumers higher fares. “There should be no room for predatory pricing by a firm allowed to engage in public service. Being the surviving entity does not authorize Grab to grab more profits,” Poe said in a statement. She added that the government should find a middle ground, saying regulatory agencies should both protect the riding public from exorbitant fees and Grab drivers from low income despite hard work. “I am hopeful that through dialogue and open channels of communication, all the stakeholders can strike a balance that will not hurt the pocket of Grab’s riders but will not leave Grab’s drivers empty-handed either…. ‘Yung tamang presyo at serbisyo na masaya ang lahat (The right price and service so everyone is happy),” she said. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, for his part, said government regulators, such as the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), should probe the cost structure of ride-hailing services. “Dito papasok ang close monitoring ng LTFRB and PCC sa anti-competitive practices (This is where the LTFRB and the PCC’s close monitoring of anti-competitive practices comes in)…. They should also establish benchmarks that are internationally accepted to detect potential abuses of a monopoly,” Gatchalian said. He called on the LTFRB to require Grab to provide a breakdown of charges in its receipts for transparency. “Dapat i-review ng LTFRB ang lahat ng fees at charges na pinapatong sa commuters. At huwag payagan mag-charge ng mas mataas pa kaysa sa ibang bansa. I-mandato din ng LTFRB ang Grab na i-breakdown ang resibo at maging mas transparent pa sa mga singil sa commuters,” Gatchalian said. (The LTFRB should review all fees and charges passed on to commuters. They should not allow the charging of fees that are higher than in other countries. The LTFRB should also mandate Grab to provide a breakdown in its receipts and be more transparent in charging commuters.)

The LTFRB then issued a show-cause order telling the company to explain. Grab, for its part, maintained that it has always been “transparent” with its fare scheme.

If ever the Board sanctions Grab, I hope that they will spare the innocent drivers of the refund and penalties,” Nograles said. Grab drivers are concerned about the allegation as they expect to bear brunt of the refund if the LTFRB deems the charges as illegal, according to Grab driver Winson Esteras. Esteras was interviewed by the media on the sidelines of the LTFRB hearing with Grab and Uber on Wednesday. “Ang balik noon sa amin eh, sa aming mga driver na bumibiyahe sa Metro Manila, sa amin kukunin ‘yun.

In a statement on Wednesday, April 11, Grab spokesperson Leo Gonzales said that the P2-per-minute charge was initiated “when Grab reviewed its pricing structure in June 2017,” and “was integrated to the existing per kilometer charges and is not added to the upfront fares.” “Per minute charges remain part and parcel [of] Grab’s fare structure today, and we have continuously been transparent about this truth,” Gonzales added.

According to Commonwealth Act Number 146, fares that are “just and reasonable” are approved “only upon reasonable notice to the public services and other parties concerned, giving them a reasonable opportunity to be heard and the burden of the proof to show that the proposed rates or regulations are just and reasonable shall be upon the public service proposing the same.” It didn’t happen in Grab’s case. In an earlier interview with Rappler, the transport service network said no hearings were conducted prior to its implementing the charge of P2-per-minute in every ride. The LTFRB was only “made aware” of it, said Grab PH head Brian Cu.  On Wednesday, Gonzales said, “[W]e corresponded with the LTFRB to present these changes and was given the opportunity to present in full our business model, supply and demand models, and pricing structure during one of the Technical Working Group meetings in late July 2017.” In a statement, LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said that the now-amended December 2016 order “was the last issued by board and still stands.” In that order, “there is no mention of time travel rate.” Should Grab’s accreditation be cancelled? According to Gonzales, the P2-per-minute charge was conceptualized to assure Grab drivers that they “would have a greater chance of making ends meet” despite heavy traffic congestion in the metro.  “At the end of the day, Grab seeks to always ensure a balance in fare to benefit both our passengers and drivers. We owe it to our riding public to remain truthful and transparent,” he said. But Nograles said that Grab owed its riders a refund. “They are liable for a refund. With Uber now being absorbed by Grab, we’re looking at the potential of 2.8 million rides per week and all of them charging P2 per minute. This is the problem when there is a monopoly,” he told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday, April 10. On Thursday, April 12, the LTFRB issued a show-cause order against Grab, asking them to explain why its transportation network company accreditation should not be suspended or cancelled over the allegations. By April 16, patrons of ride-hailing services will be left with only Grab as their choice, as LTFRB ordered Uber to close down. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/200034-ltfrb-grab-surge-pricing-lower-cap/","title":"LTFRB lowers Grab surge pricing cap amid illegal fare allegation","date":"Apr 11, 2018 4:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Effective immediately, the 1.5x surge pricing cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Lower Grab fares during peak hours. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) gave this order on Wednesday, April 11, to Grab, telling the ride-hailing service to lower its surge pricing cap during peak hours from 2.0 to only 1.5 times the normal fare. Surge pricing was capped at twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled only, and not for the base fare. This amends LTFRB’s December 2016 order setting the fare structure of Grab.  The order is effective immediately. LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said the board deemed it reasonable to lower Grab’s surge pricing cap since consumers are left with only Grab as their option for ride-hailing services, given the latter’s acquisition of Uber. “The board directs Grab to lower its surge from 2 to 1.5. Why? [The] LTFRB is processing the new TNC players. This is to ensure that the fares will be at a rate that is conducive and acceptable to the existing number of TNVS that are transferring to Grab,” Lizada said during a hearing on Wednesday. The cap applies to all ride-hailing services offered by Grab. Lizada said that the cap would be reviewed after new players have come in. Grab spokersperson Leo Gonzales said they understand the need for the cap to be lowered. “We understand their justification for this. This is a critical time. As soon as new players come in, the board will have to study again. But , of course, we will comply with further downgrading the cap from 2.0 to 1.5x,” Gonzales said. The order came after Grab acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, leaving thousands of patrons with only one choice for ride-hailing services.

The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Uber to close down before April 16, in a hearing on the company’s accreditation as a transport network company (TNC) on Wednesday, April 11. Uber’s TNC accreditation expired in August 2017. “The sooner as possible that you are able to resolve your concerns with PCC (Philippine Competition Commission), the better. Therefore, in the interest of all TNVS (transport network vehicle services) and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said. “Upon April 16, you cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” she added. The ruling came despite the PCC order for Uber and Grab to continue operating separately beyond April 8, the date when Uber was supposed to have closed and transitioned its operations to Grab. The PCC gave the order as it launched a review of the Uber-Grab deal. When the PCC ordered Uber to continue running beyond April 8, Grab said it would shoulder the cost of the extension but only until April 15.

Grab officials say the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board was informed about this.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A lawmaker on Tuesday, April 10, accused Grab Philippines of “illegally” charging its consumers and said the ride-hailing service should refund its customers P1.8 billion for the last 5 months alone. In an interview with CNN Philippines, PBA Representative Jericho Nograles accused Grab of illegally charging P2 per minute for their rides, on top of its flagdown rate of P40 and charging P10 to P14 per kilometer. “Grab charges P2 per minute illegally. They’re not allowed to charge P2 per minute. The LTFRB has not allowed them to charge P2 per minute but they have charged P2 per minute to everyone,” Nograles said. The lawmaker said that based on his calculation, the illegal charges of Grab amounted to P1.8 billion. “I have calculated that in the past 5 months, they owe P1.8 billion to the riding public,” Nograles said. Nograles told Rappler in a phone interview on Tuesday that he arrived at the figure based on the conservative estimate of P1.5 million Grab rides per week, multiplied by the average travel duration of 30 minutes, at a P2-per-minute charge, over 5 months. He said he set his calculation for that period because he only had personal knowledge about the alleged illegal charge 5 months ago.  When Grab Philippines launched its ride-hailing services in 2015, it charged a base fare of P30 and additional P12 per kilometer. There was supposed to be no additional charges per minute. In December 2016, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered a cap on ride-hailing services fares, with Grab maintaining its base fare of P30 and lowering its per kilometer charging to a P10 to P14 range depending on surge pricing. Nograles said that as of 2017, the P2-per-minute charge was “not approved” by the LTFRB. The lawmaker said that when he asked the LTFRB about the pricing, he was told: “Really? Maybe you should talk to Grab.” “Alam ba ‘yan ng LTFRB o hindi? Kung hindi nila alam, complacency ‘yan. If alam nila, graft ‘yan (Does the LTFRB know about this? If they don’t, then that’s complacency. If they do, it’s graft),” Nograles added. Rappler sought a comment from LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada on Nograles’ allegation, but she has not yet replied as of posting. Grab repeatedly said in the past that fares will remain as is as it “cannot unilaterally” increase the fares.  Although fares right now may not increase given its acquisition of Uber, Grab Philippines earlier submitted a petition before the LTFRB to increase fares due to the tax reform law. What does LTFRB know? Does LTFRB know about the P2-per-minute charge? LTFRB and Grab have different answers. As far as LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra knows, “Grab doesn’t charge per travel time.” Delgra said this in an interview on radio dzRh on Sunday, April 8, when asked about the difference in the fares charged by Grab and Uber.  “Medyo mataas ‘yung Grab kasi nag-o-offer yung Uber ng, aside from the base fare na parehas sila P40 each, ‘yung per [kilometer] nila mas mababa ‘yung Uber eh, P5.70 per [kilometer] . Pero ‘yung Grab P11 to P14 per [kilometer], pero wala sila ‘yung travel time. ‘Yung Uber naman meron sila travel time, P2 per minute,” he said on Sunday.  (Grab fares are more expensive than Uber because aside from having the same base fare of P40 each, Uber’s per kilometer charge is cheaper than Grab at P5.70 per kilometer. Grab charges P11 to P14 per kilometer but they don’t have travel time [charges]. Meanwhile, Uber charges travel time at P2 per minute.) Asked about its P2-per-minute charge, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu told Rappler in an interview on Monday, April 9, “LTFRB is aware.” Grab spokesman Leo Gonzales, who was with Cu during the brief Rappler interview, said, “There was a time that we informed LTFRB about this.” Asked whether the LTFRB held a hearing on the additional charge, Cu said, “No hearing because at that time, it (fare) wasn’t regulated yet at the start.” “The first TNC accreditation doesn’t say that pricing will be regulated. It’s already in the new ones,” he added. Uber announced on March 26 that it sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business.

Cu explained that after the acquisition, Grab was funding the current operations of Uber, thus, operations cannot be totally independent. “Considering that Uber has exited the region on March 25 and clearly stated during the public hearing its incapacity to fund the operations in the Philippines, the parties have agreed to keep the Uber app operational with Grab bearing the costs, to give drivers and consumers time to adjust to Uber’s departure,” Cu said. Grab has been shouldering the cost of the Uber app extension from March 25 to its earlier scheduled shutdown on April 8, the original period of transition.  Cu added that the Uber app shutdown will be moved to midnight of April 15, which means extra costs for Grab.  The country head of Grab reiterated that the Uber app can still be accessed but “it has limited functionality and little or no support.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said it was concerned that there would be a deluge of customer complaints. “The current solution does not benefit the riding public. It’s a risk for the riding public. If a road crash happens, who has the accountability?” he said in a mix of English and Filipino.

Go-Jek, based in Jakarta, is the most popular ride-hailing and logistics services app in Indonesia. “No matter how you look at it, the combination of the regional businesses of Uber and Grab not only reduces but effectively eliminates competition in the Philippine ride-hailing market,” the lawmaker said.

The sale announced on Monday, March 26, ended a bruising battle between the ride-hailing behemoths and marked the US firm’s latest retreat from international markets. But the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said both companies would face interim measures as it probes concerns Grab will have a virtual monopoly on the ride-hailing market – the first time such a directive has been issued in the city-state. Under rules which take effect immediately, the companies will not be allowed to integrate their operations until the CCS investigation is finished. They will have to maintain separate pricing and cannot obtain confidential information from each other like costing or customer and driver details. This is likely to prove a major stumbling block for the deal, under which Singapore-based Grab is set to take over Uber’s ride-sharing and food delivery operations in the region. In return Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business, with chief executive of the California-headquartered company Dara Khosrowshahi joining the Grab board.

This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters.","body":" In a drastic yet unsurprising move, Uber has finally ceded its Southeast Asia operations to Grab. This means that Uber will have a 27.5% stake in Grab, Uber’s CEO will join Grab’s board, Uber staff and drivers will be absorbed by Grab, and Uber’s app will no longer work in our phones. Above all, this merger makes Grab the ride-hailing monopoly in most of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. Why did Uber have to leave the region? What does this mean for Filipino commuters? And what can government do? Uber’s exit The emails blasted by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to his global staff explain a lot about Uber’s exit. He said, “One of the potential dangers of our global strategy is that we take on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber is known to pick its battles. In 2016, it yielded its China operations to local player Didi Chuxing for a 17.7% stake in that firm. Early this year, Uber also gave way to Russia’s Yandex for a 37% stake. In all instances, Uber’s strategy is the same: cede market share in exchange for stakes in the local competitor. But Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia may yet be its biggest move. What brought this on? First, Grab has catered to the transport needs of Southeast Asians in ways Uber did not. Grab, for example, introduced such customized services as GrabBike (an alternative to motorcycle-taxis like those in Viet Nam), GrabHitch (now a favorite way to cross the Malaysia-Singapore border), and even Grab Yee Sang (where Grab delivers a specific dish called yee sang during the Chinese New Year rush). Second, aside from a better understanding of Asian sensibilities, Grab has also carefully avoided needless regulatory entanglements throughout the region. Whereas Uber often found itself clashing with regulators – including our own LTFRB [Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board] – Grab has adopted a softer, more “cooperative” approach. Finally, Uber’s exit can also be seen as a way to improve its finances – that is, reduce losses in unprofitable markets – ahead of its planned IPO (initial public offering) in 2019. In this, tremendous pressure to consolidate likely came from Uber and Grab’s common investor, Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp, which now owns large stakes in both ride-hailing companies. All in all, Uber’s Southeast Asia exit was part and parcel of a global corporate strategy. Grab’s monopoly But with Uber out of the way, Grab now enjoys monopoly status in many Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines. This loss of competition will almost surely mean fewer choices, higher fares, and lousier service for Pinoy commuters. First, Grab’s monopoly status leaves commuters with no other viable choice. New ride-hailing services – like Lag Go, Hype, Owto, Hirna, and MiCab – are reportedly seeking accreditation from the LTFRB. But can these start-ups fill the void left by Uber and provide similar services? MiCab, for example, which first operated in Cebu and Iloilo, turns out to be just a taxi-hailing app with none of Uber’s innovations like dynamic pricing. More importantly, can these new services grow sufficiently large to chip away at the gargantuan market share now enjoyed by Grab? Although the market is “contestable”, Grab faces no real competition right now. One exception could be Go-Jek, which has managed to keep Grab at bay in Indonesia. Go-Jek is reportedly expanding in Southeast Asia by the middle of 2018, but will it come to the Philippines too? Second, Uber’s exit spells higher ride fares, fewer promos, or both. Most commuters observe that, on average, Grab rides tend to be pricier than Uber rides. But this actually stems from Uber’s “cross-subsidization” strategy: because of its global reach, Uber can use revenues from profitable markets to partially shoulder fares in unprofitable markets. Grab – having no such deep war chest to draw from – competes instead with the aggressive use of promos, discounts, and vouchers. But now, with substantial market power, Grab can easily dispense with such promos. They might even be tempted to raise fares. China provides a valuable case study: a year after Uber yielded its market share to Didi Chuxing, getting rides there has reportedly become “harder and more expensive than ever before.” Third, some riders will miss beloved features of the Uber app, including a more seamless design and drivers’ inability to see passengers’ destinations by default. The latter is especially useful in preventing drivers from routinely refusing passengers. Unless Grab adopts some of Uber’s finer features like these, the consumer experience will likely be no better. Government’s regulation Excessive market power is a sign of a “market failure” that can justify government intervention. But how exactly can the Duterte government respond to the Uber-Grab merger? First, the PCC [Philippine Competition Commission] – tasked by law look into any and all anti-competitive acts – can, in fact, block or nullify the Uber-Grab deal. The PCC might also prevent higher fares resulting from the merger. The Malaysian government, for instance, has already warned Grab that it will take legal action against any such price hikes. Second, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) will have to ensure that the migration of users and drivers’ data from Uber to Grab won’t compromise their privacy. Third, the LTFRB must help to promote competition in ride-hailing. But, at the same time, can it resist the temptation to overregulate? To wit, the LTFRB gave both Uber and Grab such a rough time last year. Not only did the LTFRB suspend new franchise applications, it also made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their offices. The LTFRB also suspended Uber for a month and demanded from it a hefty (and rather arbitrary) fine of P190 million. Worse, some lawmakers are also thinking to require congressional franchises before any and all ride-hailing firms could operate in the country. No one questions the need to regulate ride-hailing. Quotas, for example, might reduce their contribution to road congestion. But there’s a fine line between regulation and overregulation that the LTFRB hasn’t quite mastered just yet. The LTFRB also needs to avoid the use of double standards: last year, when it suspended Uber for a month, the LTFRB supported policies to increase the ridership of regular taxis. This included express support for the use of taxi-hailing app MiCab in Metro Manila, as well as proposals to grant more taxi franchises. If congestion were really the problem, why introduce more taxis at the time Uber was gone? Without sufficient study and justification, such policies only reek of opportunism and regulatory capture. Commuting just got worse Uber and Grab, left to themselves, have failed the riding public. The government needs to step in to increase commuters’ choices, prevent higher fares, and improve the quality of their services. But is government up to the challenge? Three agencies are worth watching here: the PCC, the National Privacy Commission, and the LTFRB. Can the first take binding legal action against Uber and Grab if the deal proves anti-competitive? Can the second protect commuters and drivers’ data from being compromised? Can the third promote the entry of new players while avoiding the urge to overregulate? At a time of choking traffic jams, frequent MRT breakdowns, massive transport strikes, and high gas prices, the last thing we need now is a monopoly in ride-hailing.

From a duopoly, it becomes a monopoly,' warns an economist","body":" MANILA, Philippines – An economist warned that Filipino commuters could face higher fares and fewer incentives, after California-based Uber decided to sell its entire Southeast Asian business to its rival Grab. Ending stiff competition between the ride-hailing behemoths, Uber on Monday, March 26, sold its operations in Southeast Asia to Grab. In turn, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. “Obviously, it is not good.

Uber drivers in the Philippines on Monday started receiving emails from the transport network company, asking them to transition to the Grab platform by April 8 – or two weeks from now. (READ: Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks) Pola del Monte, a 28-year-old editor in Quezon City, said this gives her no choice but to rely on Grab for ride-hailing services. “I’m an Uber loyalist – largely by force of habit, but also because I prefer its sleeker interface, have had too many pleasant riding experiences, plus I find their customer service impeccable. I can count only one terrible experience but the response was über quick,” she said in a Facebook post. Pipay Gonzales, a 26-year-old public relations manager in Makati City, said she was dismayed. “Those who use ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Grab, will be the losers in this deal. Commuters like me won’t be able to compare prices now. We won’t know if we are being priced unfairly. The government should do something about it,” she told Rappler in an interview. Del Monte and Gonzales are just a couple of the ride-hailing app users in the Philippines who have expressed disappointment over the Uber-Grab deal. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies. But with the deal, the local competition will just be between Grab and U-Hop. Up for review? Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement that no notification has been filed at the agency by Grab or Uber to date. “If the parties meet the new threshold, they should notify the PCC within 30 days after signing of their definitive agreement,” Balisacan said. Early this month, the PCC doubled the threshold for reviewing merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the country. The PCC on March 5 published a memorandum, raising the thresholds to P5 billion for the value of assets or revenues of the parent entity, and P2 billion for the size of the transaction as defined in the implementing rules and regulations.  “If the transaction meets the new [thresholds], the parties do have to notify us and we have to review the transaction,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said, echoing Balisacan’s statement. Fare structure regulation For its part, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said it will continue to regulate and monitor the fare structure for the benefit of the riding public. A hearing is set for April 3 to tackle the proposed fare hike of Uber and Grab. “As [for] trust issues, we have [the] PCC whose mandate is to check the same. We will be awaiting [the] manifestation to be filed by Uber to address the issues pending before the LTFRB,” the transport regulator said in a statement. Grab earlier said a “dynamic surcharge” would continue to be applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. With Uber moving out of the picture, the LTFRB said it would welcome new transport network companies as long as these are accredited. “With the new guidelines right now, any new TNC is welcome as long as they are accredited by the LTFRB and they pass the necessary documents for their respective accounts,” the agency said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/198978-uber-philippines-southeast-asia-drivers-grab-migration/","title":"Uber drivers in Southeast Asia moving to Grab in 2 weeks","date":"Mar 26, 2018 1:55 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber's operations in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, will only be available until April 8, following the sale to Grab","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – In two weeks’ time, all drivers of Uber in the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia will have to move to Grab, after the California-based company sold its Southeast Asian business to its Singaporean rival.

The Uber app will continue to operate for two weeks to ensure stability for Uber drivers,” Grab said in a statement on Monday, March 26. “We’re working hard to onboard Uber drivers onto the Grab platform. We appreciate your patience during this transition timeframe if there may be any service disruptions,” the ride-hailing firm added later on its website. In the immediate term, Grab noted that “nothing will change and operations will continue as normal.” Current Uber users’ account information, however, will not be shared with Grab. “If you are new to Grab, we will still need you to register your account with us to start riding,” Grab said. The firm added that fares would remain the same, with a dynamic surcharge applied based on several factors, including demand and supply at that particular point in time, traffic conditions, and estimated time for the journey. Customers who pick the taxi option, meanwhile, will continue to pay metered fares. As for firms that use Uber as company transportation, Grab said: “Uber for Business services for employees of local and global companies will not be supported for trips taken in Southeast Asia after the transition. Uber rides outside of Southeast Asia will still be supported through existing Uber for Business agreements.” Grab had announced on Monday that it is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region. In return, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the business. In the Philippines, 3 companies – Uber, Grab, and U-Hop – are accredited to operate as transport network companies.

They have our full support and resources in this time of transition,” Grab Philippines country manager Brian Cu said in a separate statement. The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) was sought for comment on whether it will review the deal, which is seen to affect the local ride-sharing market.

These allowed the firms to fall under rules that allow “pre-arranged transportation services” using smartphones and other similar technologies. The Philippine government has since suspended the processing of TNVS applications twice, after issues on the scope of regulation as well as complaints from taxi operators who argued there was “unequal application” of rules. It was just on February 5 this year when the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) again opened TNVS franchise applications.

Singapore-based Grab is taking over the ride-sharing and food delivery operations of Uber in the region, with the California-based company to receive a 27.5% stake in the business in return. The sale is Uber’s latest withdrawal from a market where it had faced fierce competition, as new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi seeks to stem huge losses and move past a series of scandals. After a fierce battle, Uber sold its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in 2016 in return for a stake, and last year the US firm merged in Russia with the taxi-hailing app of internet giant Yandex. The deal with Grab is similar to the one struck with Didi, and ends a years-long fight for market share in a region that is home to some 650 million people and an increasingly affluent middle class. “Today’s acquisition marks the beginning of a new era,” said Grab chief executive Anthony Tan. “The combined business is the leader in platform and cost efficiency in the region.” Khosrowshahi, who is joining Grab’s board as part of the deal, said: “This deal is a testament to Uber’s exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth.” Push for consolidation Grab has long been the dominant force in ride-hailing in Southeast Asia and speculation mounted that a deal with Uber was on the cards after Japanese financial titan Softbank invested huge sums in the US firm. Softbank is also a major investor in Grab, and is known for pushing for consolidation in the global ride-hailing industry, which has been losing billions of dollars a year due to turf wars. Grab, launched in 2012, has poured money into expanding its regional fleet and now has more than 2.1 million drivers in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Competition between ride-hailing apps has been heating up in Southeast Asia, with the market forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report by Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. Uber is the largest firm of its kind with a presence in more than 600 cities, but it has been rocked by scandals and is facing fierce competition from rivals in Asia and Europe. Chief executive Travis Kalanick was ousted in June last year after missteps including allegations of executive misconduct, a toxic workplace atmosphere and potentially unethical competitive practices. New boss Khosrowshahi has vowed to turn the company around as Uber gears up for 2019 public share offering. But he has a fight on his hands – Uber’s losses in 2017 grew to $4.5 billion from the $2.8 billion the company lost a year earlier. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/198881-us-largest-gun-control-protest/","title":"U.S. poised for largest gun control protest in a generation","date":"Mar 24, 2018 6:13 PM PHT","snippet":"The student-organized \"March For Our Lives\" is to feature rallies from coast to coast, with the main event scheduled to take place in Washington within sight of the US Capitol","body":" WASHINGTON, United States – Galvanized by a massacre at a Florida high school, hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to take to the streets in cities across the United States on Saturday, March 24, in the biggest protest for gun control in a generation. The student-organized “March For Our Lives” is to feature rallies from coast to coast, with the main event scheduled to take place in Washington within sight of the US Capitol. “The kids are leading the movement,” said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where 20 children aged 6 and 7 years old were killed in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida – where 17 people were shot dead  on February 14 by a 19-year-old former classmate – have been the driving force behind the march. With a mixture of outrage and passion, they have been relentlessly badgering US lawmakers to enact a ban on assault rifles and to expand background checks to cover all gun purchases, even private sales. “The march is just the start,” said Aalayah Eastmond, a 17-year-old junior who took shelter beneath the body of a classmate during the Stoneman Douglas shooting. “Columbine happened – nothing’s changed. Sandy Hook happened – nothing’s changed. Parkland happened – nothing’s changed,” Eastmond said.  “We will fight for this until change happens,” she said at an event with members of US Congress. Since the Parkland shooting, the state of Florida and the US Congress have made only modest tweaks  to gun laws and President Donald Trump’s proposal to arm teachers has been met with widespread resistance. Organizers say more than 800 marches are being held across the country and around the world under the slogan #NeverAgain, with the Washington event alone anticipated to attract at least 500,000 people. The protests are expected to be the largest for gun control in the United States – which has more than 30,000 gun-related deaths a year – since the Million Mom March in May 2000. ‘Electoral force’   The appeals for stricter gun regulations have drawn the backing of Democratic lawmakers, and a slew of American celebrities  have pledged $500,000 donations to support the protests. They include actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, a human rights lawyer; actress and media mogul Oprah Winfrey and director Steven Spielberg and his actress wife, Kate Capshaw. Performing at the rally in Washington are Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Common, Andra Day and Vic Mensa. The marchers have also attracted the support of former president Barack Obama, who tried but failed to reform gun laws following the Sandy Hook slaughter. Obama and his wife, Michelle, released a letter to the “Students of Parkland” praising their “resilience, resolve and solidarity” and saying they have helped “awaken the conscience of the nation.” Former president Billl Clinton said America “owes its gratitude to the students of Stoneman Douglas and their peers across the country who have joined their cause.” Murphy, the Connecticut senator, told Agence France-Presse the student-led movement needs to become an “electoral force, and this march may be the beginning of that.” Conscious of their growing political power, March For Our Lives organizers provided a link on their website for supporters to register to vote. They have also called on supporters to vote against lawmakers who receive money from the National Rifle Association, the powerful US gun lobby that fiercely defends the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms.” “Either you stand with the kids or you stand with the NRA,” said David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student. Meanwhile, Lyft, the ride-hailing service, said it would offer free rides to 50 marches around the United States. Several restaurants in Washington said they would hand out free lunches to high school students. Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, sent the American football team’s plane to Parkland to fly the families of the 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas to Washington along with injured students. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, 63 percent of American voters approve of the march in support of tougher gun laws but are not optimistic it will lead to new legislation. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/197763-uber-grab-deal-southeast-asia-operations/","title":"Uber selling Southeast Asia operations to Grab – report","date":"Mar 9, 2018 10:19 AM PHT","snippet":"Reports say the deal will also give Uber a 20% to 30% stake in Grab","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber is selling parts of its Southeast Asia operations to local rival Grab, getting a piece of the action in the process, according to US media reports.

The application started at 8 am, with the first applicant completing the entire process within 10 minutes. Juliet Bulaon, a Grab partner, lined up as early as 6:30 am to make sure she would finish first. “It’s a relief. Now that [we have the papers needed], I won’t be worrying about our [car getting apprehended] all the time,” she said in Filipino on Monday. Bulaon is among the 66,750 operators who are expected to apply for their Provisional Authority (PA) as a step to eventually getting their Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) franchise. After 10 working days, Bulaon will return to the LTFRB for a hearing that will determine whether she will be granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). If that is granted, she will get a franchise that will last for two years. Grab Philippines head Brian Cu echoed Bulaon’s sentiments, saying many TNVS drivers worry about getting apprehended by traffic enforcers for being “colorum.” “They can now drive without worrying that they will be apprehended for the reasons that they are colorum vehicles – they are not,” Cu said. Smooth process LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada described the process on Monday as “very smooth.” They were able to process about 50 applications within the first hour. “The applicants have complete documents with them that’s why the flow is smooth. There are some minor setbacks (with incomplete documents), but it’s manageable,” Lizada told reporters on Monday. Based on initial talks, LTFRB is set to process 300 applications per day – with Grab and Uber alloted 150 slots each. (READ: LTFRB to accept franchise applications for lease-to-own cars but…) But Lizada said they were able to finish all 300 applications before 2 pm, so the regulatory board will increase the number of applications they can accommodate in succeeding days. Transport Network Companies (TNC) Grab and Uber have set up assistance centers near LTFRB to ensure that applicants have all the requirements needed. Easier booking As the LTFRB opened up franchise applications, the TNCs think that booking for services will now be easier. Yves Gonzalez, Uber Philippines’ public policy head, said more drivers would be encouraged to get on the road now that are holding the proper documents. Grab’s Cu also said that that booking will be smoother, as issuing franchises is one way to determine whether the supply of TNVS vehicles will meet the demand on the road. “This is the step to get the right number of vehicles. We will see whether the supply will meet the demand. LTFRB will assess in the next months whether there’s a need to increase the numbers,” Cu said. In 2016, LTFRB suspended accepting new applications for TNVS permits for ride-hailing apps due to the rising volume of applications and concern of oversupply of units. Earlier in February, the regulatory board set the cap at 66,750 units, but said it would review the figure if the demand for TNVS is not met. (READ: Poe to LTFRB: ‘Explain the math’ behind cap on ride-hailing vehicles)– Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/197265-grab-launch-service-clark-international-airport/","title":"LOOK: Grab PH launches services from Clark International Airport","date":"Mar 2, 2018 5:14 PM PHT","snippet":"Nearly 400 units will be available to provide ride-hailing services for passengers from the country's second main gateway","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Passengers can now book Grab rides from the Clark International Airport.

In a press briefing, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced that they will be processing TNVS applications for some 39,000 lease-to-own vehicles but previous billing accounts should be settled. “Reminders to TNVS, your accounts should be current. We will not process if you have a [balance] of two months…You have a week to settle your accounts,” LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino. Franchise applications will be open on Monday, March 5. What is the process? TNVS operators with lease-to-own vehicles under the Toyota Financial Services can apply for a franchise. According to the LTFRB, operators will need to submit their account name and car loan number to their respective transportation network companies (TNC). TNCs Grab and Uber will then submit these documents to the LTFRB, which will be submitted to Toyota Financial Services for comparison with their records. Lizada said franchise applications for these vehicles will be accepted starting Monday, but will be processed after those with official receipts and certificates of registration (ORs/CRs). An OR/CR under the operators’ name is part of the requirements for TNVS franchise applications. The LTFRB held talks with loaning institutions so that the ORs/CRs of the vehicle will be released under the name of the operator, and not under the bank or institution that handles the loan. “In this case, we are in talks with Toyota first but if there are other (loaning institutions) who will approach us, we will talk to them,” Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino.

But rather than complement mass transit and other modes of transportation, these services compete with it, putting more individuals in cars; thereby increasing the number of cars congesting city streets. One study in San Francisco discovered that on a regular weekday, ride-hailing drivers can make more than 170,000 vehicle trips concentrated in the most congested parts of the city. The report said that this is 12 times the number of regular taxi trips in the same specified timeframe.  Another study found that the increase in taxis and ride-hailing service vehicles have significantly contributed to the slow traffic of Manhattan’s central business district. A survey conducted in 4,000 adults residing in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, to name a few, pointed out that as much as 61% of trips would not have been made – or would have been made by more traffic-friendly means such as walking, biking or by public mass transport – if ride-hailing didn’t exist.   Speed was the primary reason people used ride-hailing services, and that the higher cost doesn’t discourage people from choosing ride-sharing services over cheaper public transit, according to the survey in Boston.  Solutions on the horizon?  The growing body of research on the effect of ride-sharing services on traffic appears to point that the services may be adding to the congestion. Ride-sharing may be convenient, and people generally favor the service as evidenced by the services’ continuing popularity. However, that convenience may be coming at a price – and it will be up to the companies in question to tweak their product, and combat the growing evidence against them.  Ride-sharing poster boy Uber may already be taking initiative, as pointed out in AP‘s report as well. The company recently launched a service called Express Pool in the US. It’s a service similar to traditional buses where riders are picked up and dropped in common locations, and is said to be gaining traction and ridership in the US. As of writing, this service is not yet available in the Philippines. “This could be good for congestion if it causes vehicle occupancy rates to go up, but on the other hand, the Uber Pool rides and I guess these Express rides are really, really cheap, just a couple of dollars, so they’re almost certainly going to be pulling people away from public transport options,” Christo Wilson, a Boston Northeastern University computer science professor who has looked at Uber’s practice of surge pricing remarked in regards to the new service, told AP. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/196527-markets-vs-duterte-draw-line/","title":"[OPINION] Markets vs Duterte: Where do we draw the line?","date":"Feb 21, 2018 9:55 AM PHT","snippet":"A lot of Duterte’s market interventions so far seem to stem not from a well-informed or genuine desire to correct so-called 'market failures,' but from an urge to brandish the awesome powers of the state whichever way possible","body":" You may not realize it yet, but there is a growing list of markets and economic activities in which President Duterte and his allies want to intervene. From rice, irrigation, airlines, ride-hailing, media, telecom, fireworks, five-six, public bidding, tourism, mining, contractualization, overseas employment, illegal drugs, higher education, housing, pensions, and incomes – Duterte wants to exercise varying degrees of control over them all. Although markets are generally good in organizing economic activity, they also occasionally “fail” – as in the case of monopolies, congestion, and disinformation. In such cases, some form of government intervention might be justified. But economists are usually skeptical of this because some sort of failure by government itself is almost always bound to happen. In this 3-part series we explore Duterte’s market interventions so far, which can be categorized into: You will see that, no matter how well-intentioned, these policies by Duterte are undeniably heavy-handed and symptomatic of his authoritarian tendencies. In addition, many of them are likely to worsen market outcomes than improve them. I. Threats, harassments, extortions Too often Duterte’s brand of regulation involves bullying the private sector: threatening, harassing, or extorting specific firms or sectors. 1) Rice In response to “greedy” traders and the recent shortage of NFA (National Food Authority) rice, agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol boldly said he wanted to “take rice business out of private hands and give it to the government.” He also threatened to file economic sabotage cases against private traders. He’s forgetting that rice is already heavily controlled by government. By law the NFA has a monopoly on rice importation. In recent decades it has allowed some degree of importation by the private sector, but not exceeding a fixed limit or quota per year.  Economists have long blamed the government quota on rice imports (and NFA’s monopoly status) as the primary reason for our high rice prices and susceptibility to supply shocks. Proposals to remove this quota (and abolish the NFA altogether) have long been on the table, yet Duterte has failed to act. He even angrily fired an agriculture undersecretary on the (misplaced) assumption that she wanted to allow more rice imports. This aversion to importation by the private sector is unfortunate: it could reduce rice prices and help temper the impact of the new tax reform law (TRAIN) on inflation. Thus, contrary to Piñol’s view, it is the government – not the private sector – that is at fault here. 2) Airlines House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez recently railed against Cebu Pacific over various issues, such as supposedly long queues, flight delays, and a “refusal” to use airport tubes. Alvarez ordered Cebu Pacific to fix these issues within 45 days and migrate its domestic flights out of NAIA 3, on pain of a canceled congressional franchise. Over the years Cebu Pacific, along with other airlines, has effectively promoted tourism and democratized air travel with its affordable rates. NAIA 3, despite its shortcomings, is also arguably the best of our airports. Denying people’s access to both these services will just spell innumerable and needless inconveniences for air travelers. How could such a thought even cross the Speaker’s mind? This is not the first time this government has attacked specific airlines. Last year Duterte himself threatened Philippine Airlines (PAL) with closure of NAIA Terminal 2 (which PAL uses exclusively) if it failed to pay its multibillion-peso government debts. In the process, Duterte even accused PAL owner Lucio Tan of funding “destabilization” efforts. Such bullying seems to have worked: last November PAL gave in and paid P6 billion. 3) Ride-hailing  Government is also hot on the heels of ride-hailing services Uber and Grab. The LTFRB recently capped the number of ride-hailing vehicles at 66,750, up from 45,700 last month. Last year, the LTFRB also stopped the processing of new franchise applications, demanded P190 million to lift Uber’s suspension, and made a show of “losing” Uber and Grab’s accreditation papers in their office. Today, lawmakers are pushing a law that would eventually require Uber and Grab to get congressional franchises before operating. Uber’s algorithms, which allow supply and demand to meet 24/7, are designed to make hailing fast and easy. But the government’s incessant meddling in their operations – some say to protect vested interests in the taxi industry – has made hailing slow and painful. Waiting times have doubled or tripled in recent months, and vehicles now come from farther afield than before. Although caps could arguably abate road congestion, chipping away at the convenience of Uber and Grab’s services – at a time when public commuting is arduous (even dangerous) – is nearly a malevolent act. 4) Media True malevolence has been manifest in Duterte’s constant threats to media outfits like the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Rappler, and ABS-CBN. Back in April, he threatened to block the renewal of ABS-CBN’s congressional franchise because of allegedly unaired political ads. After hurling several accusations – including “economic sabotage” and “swindling” – Duterte also pressured (successfully) the owners of the Inquirer to sell their majority shares to Ramon Ang, Duterte’s friend and major campaign donor. Most blatant, however, is Duterte’s continuing attack on Rappler. It started in his 2017 SONA and led to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s revocation of Rappler’s registration in January. Malacañang has also recently resorted to media censorship: for example, Rappler’s Palace correspondent, Pia Ranada, was suddenly prohibited from covering the President inside Malacañang. Any democracy is founded on a free marketplace of ideas, and this includes a free and independent press. Duterte’s incessant attacks on media outfits is no ordinary attack on business: it is a direct assault on one of the pillars of our democracy. 5) Telecom To break the telecom duopoly between Globe and PLDT-Smart, Duterte himself is aggressively pushing for the entry of a third player, preferably one from China. He wants operations to start as early as the first quarter of 2018, and even warned the courts not to “interfere” or “prolong” the process. Although we do need more competition in this sector – to whip the existing duopoly into providing cheaper and faster services – so many questions remain unanswered: Does the third player really have to be Chinese? How does this fit in Duterte’s overall pivot to China? What threats could a Chinese player pose to our national security? What special interests are at play? Why is Duterte personally rushing this? Duterte’s threats have also not spared this sector. At no cost to the government, PLDT recently surrendered some of its radio frequencies, which Duterte plans to hand to the incoming third player. But this came after Duterte threatened to send over auditors and look into PLDT’s books. When a dictator intervenes in markets Sometimes government does need to intervene in markets (as in encouraging competition in the telecom sector). But a lot of Duterte’s market interventions so far seem to stem not from a well-informed or genuine desire to correct so-called “market failures,” but from an urge to brandish the awesome powers of the state whichever way possible – even if it means constantly threatening, harassing, or extorting the private sector. This brand of regulation is deviant and disturbing, but not remotely surprising: it is but symptomatic of Duterte’s nature as a bully and dictator, to which he has already confessed. But bulldozing the private sector this way could come at the cost of worse market outcomes for our people: rice could be more expensive, air travel more inconvenient, ride-hailing more inaccessible, media less independent, and telecom less secure. Which firms or sectors will the Duterte government threaten, harass, or extort next? Are they aware of the economic costs of their bully tactics?

In a statement on Friday, February 16, Batangas City Councilor Oliver Macatangay said U-Hop has yet to secure Certificates of Public Convenience from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). Macatangay said the council would only allow U-Hop to resume operations in Batangas once they secure the necessary LTFRB requirement. U-Hop Sales and Operations head Nick Laude confirmed that their operations in Batangas had been temporarily suspended since February 6, pending the approval of their business permit. Laude said U-Hop will submit the company’s position paper to Macatangay within the week. “We have raised these to our legal team, who will submit our position paper to the committee head within the current week as requested by the city council,” he said.

LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III made the clarification during the Senate committee on public services. “The issue on the hatchback is that it is allegedly considered in Metro Manila only, but we are allowing it to those areas we allowed the application of TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Service). That is in Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Pampanga,” said Delgra. He pointed out, however, that hatchback units under TNVS cannot bring passengers outside Metro Manila and in areas that will have to ply expressways. Delgra said that the LTFRB puts a premium on public’s safety and convenience, hence the regulation of hatchback vehicles providing ride-hailing services. “We have consistently set a higher standard for public utility vehicles for safety and convenience of passengers such as enough legroom or a baggage compartment,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Under LTFRB’s latest memorandum circular, hatchback units will also have to charge lower rates compared to sedans. 3-year period In January, LTFRB planned to ban hatchback and compact vehicles from being accredited for ride-hailing services. Drivers and operators from the TNVS hatchback community appealed to the regulatory board, saying some operators are still paying for the vehicle’s loan amortization.  In February, LTFRB allowed the hatchback units to continue operating but only within a 3-year period to give way to car loan payments. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of Senate committee on public services, asked the LTFRB to reconsider the allowed period for hatchbacks to operate. “I hope there will be an extension, especially if the LTFRB finds that hatchback units do not bring inconvenience to its riders and other road mishaps. Maybe TNVS groups can discuss that again. Hopefully, the allowed hatchback units will be given the opportunity to expand their service,” Poe said in Filipino.

LTFRB Board Member Aileen Lizada said that the Certificates of Public Convenience for some 59,000 Grab and Uber vehicles were not process after the LTFRB imposed a moratorium on franchise applications last July 2017. Lizada said that the excess number in the supply base is open for other Transport Network Companies such as U-Hop. She pointed out, however, that the LTFRB does not want interested TNVS operators to buy new cars again. “What we dont want to happen is for them to buy cars again. We will process those who are active units but were not able to register during the cut-off,” she said. Application for franchises will open on March 5. In determining the common supply base, the LTFRB took into account the unserved demand, vehicle coding schemes in place, and churning rate of drivers, or those who become inactive after a few months. The circular also orders hatchback units to operate within Metro Manila only and should charge lower rates compared to sedans. Lizada also said that the regulatory board will issue different plates and stickers for TNVS units for enforcement purposes. The stickers will be released as soon as the Provisional Authority has been issued but the plates will be provided later. “There is no classification in the LTO (Land Transportation Office) for TNVS. They can’t give them yellow or rainbow plates,” she said. The LTFRB earlier set a cap on TNVS permits at 45,700 units nationwide. This sparked a debate among TNCs on whether it is the right number of units based on the demand.

During a House hearing on Metro Manila Development on Monday, Marikina 1st District Representative Bayani Fernando questioned the cap set by the LTFRB, saying it will only add up to the volume of cars on Metro Manila roads. “I am not impressed by the number because of its very little effect [in curbing] traffic. It’s practically the same number, especially during rush hours. It only adds to traffic congestion,” Fernando said in a mix of English and Filipino. Ako Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe said traffic congestion was light when Uber was suspended for a month in August 2017. (READ: TIMELINE: Why only Uber is suspended) “Ergo, we should limit the number of TNVS,” he said. The cap was LTFRB’s latest attempt to regulate the TNCs and avoid adding more cars on the capital region’s roads. Lizada said the cap would be re-evaluated every 3 months to see whether it should be increased or decreased based on data. Meanwhile, Fernando, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, also said the LTFRB should look into requiring TNVS drivers to be parked in a terminal when they are not online for work or while waiting to receive a booking. “The problem is, during traffic hours – where are they supposed to wait? I would take my car and I go to the parking lot so I’m off the road. We have to look at it somehow at that angle,” Fernando said. In response, lawyer Irish Alemeida, Uber’s public policy representative, said LTFRB already requires garages for drivers to avoid illegal parking on the streets.

The court found the two-time former premier guilty of embezzling money meant for an orphanage, a charge she had consistently dismissed as politically motivated. Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is expected to appeal against the verdict, but it may affect her ability to stand in a general election slated for December. “This is a false and staged case. No way we will accept this verdict,” BNP secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told AFP after the hearing. Zia’s lawyer Khandkar Mahbub Hossain said the ruling was “political vengeance” and would be overturned by a higher court. Ahead of the hearing police fired tear gas at thousands of opposition activists who defied heavy security to escort the car taking Zia to the magistrates court. The private television station Somoy said at least 5 police officers had been injured and two motorcycles torched during the clashes that broke out several kilometers from the court premises. Authorities have for days been on high alert for protests in the tense city, where political demonstrations by Zia’s center-right BNP and its Islamist allies in 2014 and 2015 left nearly 200 people dead. Around 3,500 opposition activists and officials were arrested in a sweep by security forces ahead of the verdict according to BNP spokesman Rizvi Ahmed. A senior officer told AFP more than 5,000 police had been deployed in Dhaka. ‘Arbitrary arrests’ Zia, 72, is a former ally turned arch-foe of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Her party boycotted 2014 polls in which Hasina was re-elected but is expected to contest the upcoming general election. Zia, who entered politics in the mid-1980s after her military dictator husband was assassinated in an abortive coup, also faces dozens of separate charges related to violence and corruption. She has repeatedly said the charges against her are aimed at excluding her and her family from politics. Her son Rahman lives in exile in London and was convicted of money-laundering in 2016. Last month prosecutors sought the death penalty over his alleged role in a deadly 2004 grenade attack that injured Hasina. Zia and her son were detained by an army-backed government in 2007 and spent a year and a half in detention pending trials for alleged corruption. “This is an attempt to use the court against me, in an effort to sideline me from politics and elections and to isolate me from the people,” she told a packed news conference on Wednesday. Human Rights Watch on Thursday urged the government to stop what it called “arbitrary arrests and detentions”. “The Bangladesh government’s claims to be open and democratic ring hollow as it cracks down on political dissent,” said the group’s Asia director Brad Adams.  “The government has a responsibility to prevent and minimise violence, but it needs to do so in a way that respects basic rights, not flouts them.” Many private schools declared a holiday on Thursday in anticipation of the verdict, while several ride-hailing services announced a day-long suspension of their operations. Police have set up check-posts at key entry points of the city in an effort to prevent thousands of rural supporters of BNP and its Islamist allies from marching to the capital. “Dhaka is effectively cut off, people in panic,” read the front-page headline of the Bengali-language newspaper Prothom Alo.  – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/195271-qc-police-arrest-uber-driver/","title":"QC police arrests Uber driver for allegedly harassing female rider","date":"Feb 5, 2018 1:51 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber partner-driver Troy Silva is accused of harassing his sleeping female passenger","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Quezon City (QC) police arrested an Uber driver who allegedly harassed his female passenger.

TNCs will send LTFRB a list of those who should be [present at the LTFRB] to apply for franchise,” Lizada said in a mix of English and Filipino. LTFRB earlier said franchise applications for TNVS would open on Monday, February 5, but was later moved to March 5 to give more time to finalize the list of drivers eligible for franchise. Lizada said schedules would be set for processing applications, and reminded the drivers to only go to the LTFRB on the date of their application as recommended by the TNC. “If you are not on the list, don’t go to LTFRB for the permit applications,” she said in Filipino. Lizada also said hatchbacks and other compact or smaller sedans are allowed to apply as long as fare rates must be lower than sedans. She added that hatchbacks will only be allowed to operate as Transport Network Vehicle Services (TNVS) within Metro Manila, and this classification will reflect on their Certificate of Public Convenience. Cap on permits LTFRB earlier set a cap on TNVS permits at 45,700 units nationwide.

Meanwhile, Grab was only able to serve 270,000 to 290,000 of the 320,000 to 380,000 bookings during weekdays. (READ:Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB) The Department of Transportation then ordered the LTFRB to review the cap imposed by the LTFRB.

What government is doing is adjusting and seeing how we can fit as well. We do this because many might buy cars again. Don’t buy cars for TNVS anymore. Let’s cut it off,” she said.   In 2016, LTFRB suspended acceptance of new applications for TNVS permits for ride-hailing apps due to the rising volume of applications and concern of oversupply of units.

The application for TNVS permits opens on Monday, February 5, and it will be done on a “first come, first served” basis. The TNVS community is concerned that new operators would submit applications and “hog” the available slots. LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III earlier said some 32,000 slots are open to fill the “common supply base,” which was recently set at 45,700 units. Currently, there are around 125,000 units registered under Grab Philippines and Uber Philippines, exceeding the cap twice over. When asked whether current and active drivers would not be prioritized, Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said “that seems to be what is happening.” Cu said they are hoping the LTFRB will consider using the transport network companies’ master list of active drivers and prioritize them during the application period. “What we’re proposing, and hopefully that gets settled, is that they (the LTFRB) use the submitted master list as basis of who’s active… I don’t want to log jam the applications that are not complete or are not active and I think a lot of people will agree to that,” Cu said. He also urged the LTFRB to review the cap, suggesting ways on how to arrive at better numbers. Given the total registered number, Cu said there are probably around 90,000 unique units or some 40% less the total registered vehicles. “You subtract those who are not active. I think that’s about 75,000 active unique drivers in total,” he added in a mix of English and Filipino. “Provided with all the numbers, ilan ang active daily? Medyo nagulat kami sa’n nanggaling ‘yung number na ‘yun (How many are active daily? We were surprised where that number came from),” Cu said, referring to the 45,700-unit cap. Review the cap On Monday, January 29, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said he has already ordered the LTFRB to review Memorandum Circular (MC) 2018-003 which limits the common supply base of TNVS. Tugade said policies “should be anchored in the spirit of good governance and compassion, in order to better serve the interest of all the stakeholders.” In a statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) said it will monitor the number of booking requests received by ride-hailing apps, including the served and unserved requests. The DOTr will also take into acount number coding, maintenance schedules, and drivers’ working hours. “We assure you that should there be adjustments in the common supply base as a result of the review, the decision would be based on actual data from the different transport network companies, thorough DOTr study, and consultations with the public at large,” the department said. Senator Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, earlier asked the LTFRB to “explain the math” behind the common supply base crafted by the regulatory board.

TeamSpeed said the LTFRB had repeatedly given assurances that they would not put a cap on the number of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) cars in the country. The LTFRB supposedly only changed its mind recently. “Nu’ng nasa Senate hearing kami, ang sabi ay walang cap, then all of [a] sudden, [in the] past technical working groups bigla na lang nagbago in a snap (When we were at the Senate, they said they would not put a cap, then all of a sudden, in the past technical working groups they changed their mind in a snap),” the group said.

The LTFRB estimated that Grab has 55,000 units and Uber has 77,000 registered in their systems. Around 50% of them cross between the two platforms – a practice called “dual citizenship.” “Papatayin ninyo ang hanapbuhay ng mga Pilipino (You will kill the livelihood of Filipinos),” TeamSpeed said, addressing the LTFRB. Why impose a limit? The LTFRB started limiting TNVS units as it believes these cars worsen the traffic in Metro Manila’s clogged streets. The LTFRB previously said that as more and more cars are being brought into the metro every year, road-widening projects simply cannot keep up. Transport network companies (TNCs), or the companies that manage the ride-hailing apps, also found themselves in trouble as they allowed thousands of their drivers to operate despite lacking proper registration papers. The regulatory deadlock was tackled at the Senate, where lawmakers demanded that the LTFRB fix the mess immediately for the benefit of drivers and commuters.

The new policy means that drivers must take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours, and will not be able to log on to the app during that time. The company had already been messaging drivers who were working too long to switch off its app. “We believe this is an industry first and are not aware of any other private hire operator in the UK that has introduced such a limit,” Uber said in a statement. “It’s another example of how Uber uses technology to help enhance driver and passenger safety,” Andrew Byrne, Uber’s head of policy, was quoted as saying. Uber is currently appealing against the withdrawal of its license in London over the way in which the company reports serious criminal offenses and obtains criminal record checks for its drivers. Uber can continue to operate in London pending the appeal, which is set to be heard later this year. Uber is also appealing against an employment court ruling that would give its drivers the right to paid holidays and the national minimum wage.

Lizada also said that taxi operators have filed a petition asking for a P50-flagdown rate. Under Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, diesel –previously not taxes –  will now be imposed P2.50 per liter tax begnning 2018, P4.50 in 2019, and P6 in 2020.

This year, President Rodrigo Duterte marked his 1st year in office, his “war on drugs” continued with mixed results, a 5-month war between government troops and terrorists unfolded in Marawi City, and martial law was declared (and extended) in Mindanao. We also saw tropical storms, political storms, the proliferation of “fake news” and disinformation, sports and tech moments, showbiz weddings, controversial billboards and photoshoots, shocking statements, and insightful commentary. (WATCH: 20 stories in 2017: War, impunity, and disinformation) These are the top stories of every week of 2017 on Rappler. The list below shows the articles that had the biggest total page views each week, as well as the stories that got the most votes via Rappler’s Mood Meter in the same period. The top stories are then “colored” according to the corresponding dominant mood or emotion, still based on validated Mood Meter votes. {source} <style> #table .link { color: #ffffff !important; } #table .linkb { color: #000000 !important; } </style> {module 3936} {/source} For a combined 17 weeks, Stephen Curry’s layup in his face-off against LeBron James at Game 2 of the 2017 National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals topped the weekly charts in terms of page views. The next top stories that garnered attention during that time include live updates on the 2017 Southeast Asian Games in Malaysia (last two weeks of August), Joey de Leon’s comment on depression that drew flak on social media (week of October 1), and a debate on whether Kalinga tattoo artist Whang-od was “exploited” during a trade fair event in Manila (week of October 22). Three stories from Rappler Indonesia had #1 stories for 3 weeks, when Jakarta held its election for governor in February followed by the run-off election in April, and when popular Indonesian star Julia Perez died due to cervical cancer in June.  In terms of stories that got the most Mood Meter votes, readers were mostly Angry in 26 of them, and Happy in 16. They reacted to many stories about Duterte, notably about his survey ratings, his alleged bank accounts, and his pronouncements on his state of health, on same-sex marriage, and on former president Benigno Aquino III’s opinion about the war on drugs. Readers were on standby for #WalangPasok news, with some of these stories on class and work suspensions getting the most views in 4 separate weeks, and garnering the most mood votes in two. Palace Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson figured in 3 top stories with the most Mood Meter votes, and in one most-viewed story for the week.   Readers were mostly angry about Uson’s appointment as assistant secretary of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) in May, amused when she attempted in November to “reclassify” Rappler’s status in covering Malacañang events, and didn’t care when she performed at a Resorts World casino despite a government ban on its officials and employees to enter such establishments. The decisions of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on ride-hailing services such as Uber and Grab also made the list, with most readers expressing anger about it on the Mood Meter. Towards the final months of the year, the stories that got Rappler readers’ thumbs busy were about Tropical Storm Vinta, the firestorm over a controversial dengue vaccine, presidential granddaughter Isabelle Duterte’s pre-debut photoshoot in Malacañang, actress Ellen Adarna’s pregnancy, and 17-year-old Ica Policarpio who went missing then was found in Laguna. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/191522-issues-most-talked-about-philippines-yearend-2017/","title":"8 most talked about issues on PH social media in 2017","date":"Dec 27, 2017 5:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Mocha Uson, fake news, and the killing of Kian delos Santos are among the most talked about issues on social media in the Philippines in 2017","body":" MANILA, Philippines – From Mocha Uson’s government appointment, to messages of support for soldiers and cops who fought with terrorists in Marawi, Filipinos on social media didn’t hold back on theirs views on the major political and social issues of 2017.  Mocha Uson’s appointment as Malacañang communicator It was a tough 2017 for sex blogger-turned-government official Mocha Uson as she faced criticism over her appointment as an official of the Duterte administration.   Uson, a staunch supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte, was first appointed as Movie and Television Review and Classification Board  (MTRCB) board member in January.  Some netizens questioned her qualifications for the position while her followers asked that Uson be given a chance and the benefit of the doubt. (READ: Board member Mocha Uson?

A veteran newspaper columnist even fell victim to “fake news.” Netizens criticized Manila Times‘ Yen Makabenta after he used a quote from a fake news website in his opinion piece. Makabenta claimed that US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that Duterte should be “given space to run his nation.” The US embassy, however, denied that Haley made such a statement. (READ: Manila Times columnist falls for fake news) Philippine News Agency blunders State-run media Philippine News Agency (PNA) drew criticism for a string of mistakes in its articles.  PNA used the Dole pineapple logo for a Department of Labor and Employment story on 2018 pay rules for holidays.  It also erroneously published on its website several articles with editor’s notes and instructions.  Netizens slammed the state news agency for mistakes that had been “happening too often.” (READ: ‘Puro Nalang Aberya’: Netizens react to Philippine News Agency’s latest blunder) Following the blunders, the Presidential Communications Operations Office assigned a new undersecretary to supervise the PNA.

After grilling Taguiwalo on her qualifications as social welfare chief, Sotto asked about her personal life. “Just on the lighter side, Senator Drilon and I were looking at the personal information about you. You have two children – daughters or sons?” Sotto asked Taguiwalo. Taguiwalo replied she has two daughters.  Sotto went on to ask Taguiwalo, “But you’re single?” He then said that single mothers are “na-ano lang” (just got knocked up).  Netizens criticized the senator, calling him “basura” (trash) and “misogynist.” Sotto then appologized to the public and promised a measure to amend the Solo Parents’ Welfare Act, which would give more benefits to solo parents could be passed by December 2017.

Uber suspension Netizens hit the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for suspending ride-hailing company Uber.   Uber was suspended for defying the LTFRB’s order for all transport network companies (TNCs) to stop accrediting drivers starting July 26, 2017. Commuters took to social media to express their anger over the LTFRB decision, saying the suspension would be a “hassle” to them, while others asked for a good alternative for the commuting public.  After paying the P190-million fine, the LTFRB lifted the suspension. #SalamatSaSerbisyo Marawi soldiers Netizens remembered the fallen soldiers and cops who fought with terrorists in Marawi by using the hashtag #SalamatSaSerbisyo.  Messages of support flooded social media on June 12 as the Philippines celebrated its 119th Independence Day.  {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>To our fallen heroes &amp; brave soldiers fighting in Marawi <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/SalamatSaSerbisyo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#SalamatSaSerbisyo</a></p>&mdash; eva (@chakadaldal) <a href=”https://twitter.com/chakadaldal/status/874472714781597697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>June 13, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source} {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>To ALL the Police/Soldiers who died Protecting MARAWI and the whole Philippines i SALUTE all of you. <a href=”https://twitter.com/hashtag/SalamatSaSerbisyo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>#SalamatSaSerbisyo</a></p>&mdash; Euclid 미아 장미 Bedruz (@Cr0w1968) <a href=”https://twitter.com/Cr0w1968/status/874374907454382081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>June 12, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>{/source} {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”tl” dir=”ltr”>Kaya ibinibigay ko po ang buo kong pagsaludo sa lahat ng sundalong Pilipino na lumalaban para sa bansa.

According to authorities, Delos Santos fired a gun at the cops during a drug raid. However, CCTV footage showed that he was dragged to a dark alley. Forensic experts at the Philippine National Police and the Public Attorney’s Office had the same finding: Delos Santos was  executed – he was shot in the back of his head while  kneeling down.   Delos Santos was among the minors killed in the Duterte administration’s bloody drug war.  #JusticeForKian trended on social media as netizens expressed their condemnation of human rights abuses in the drug war.

Let these Filipino startups help you beat the Christmas rush.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Christmas is the most colorful and festive season in the Philippines, but it could also be the most stressful.

At first touch, you wouldn’t feel you were holding an entry-level device, with its matte back and glossy, curved-glass front. But does the Nokia 3 hold its own among the slew of other budget Android smartphones in the market today? Let’s find out. Design When you first unbox the Nokia 3, you’ll be greeted by an unassuming but solidly built smartphone. Its metal edges give it a premium feel, complemented by its matte polycarbonate back that, although plastic, still looks stunning.    A squarish design with rounded corners nods back to Nokia’s historic Lumia design philosophy, but it stops there. There are no brilliant hues and glossy plastic. The review unit I got was the matte black one, but there are other color options, including tempered blue, silver white, and copper white. Nokia paid attention to the details with the Nokia 3, too, featuring power and volume buttons on the right side that are painted black but have stainless edges. It’s a small detail that has a very big effect on the design. The buttons are barely noticeable when viewed head-on, but from an angle, the stainless edges accentuate them beautifully. Atop the device is the 3.5mm jack, and at the bottom are the micro USB charging and data port and speakers. The SIM and SD card slots can be found on the left side. Ergonomically speaking, the device sits comfortably in the hand despite its 5-inch 720p display. Design-wise, you could say that the Nokia 3 beats the competition; you won’t find any other smartphone with a similar design in this price point. At least, not now. Performance Nokia promises regular updates, but didn’t specify if it meant that you’ll always have the latest Android OS. It may be a vague promise for now, but at least the Nokia 3 comes with Android 7 Nougat, the latest available release. We don’t have to wait long to see if Nokia will hold true to their word regarding “regular updates,” as the release of Android 8 Oreo seems to be just around the corner.  Android purists will love the Nokia 3’s stock Android software, which goes well with the minimalist look of the device. No bloatware or third-party apps here – just pure Android enjoyment with no Nokia branding whatsoever.  The MediaTek MT6737 processor is a bit of a letdown, though, clocking in at only 1.3GHz. Although, it’s quad-core, you might find yourself frustrated with the Nokia 3’s performance at times.  Apps may lag or freeze when things get too heavy, but once the device gets its bearings back, it’s smooth sailing again.  One minor annoyance I experienced while using the Nokia 3 was ride-hailing apps, specifically the Grab app, not working and often freezing up on me. I don’t know if it’s related to the GPS chip used on the device, but it irked me because I didn’t think getting a ride home should be that hard. Using the GPS on a smartphone may work its battery hard, but it shouldn’t be a problem with RAM, especially with the Nokia 3’s ample 2GB of it. My experience with app crashes and longer load times with the Nokia 3 deterred me from installing bigger and memory-heavy apps, but of those I installed, I found that all of them worked – eventually. Gaming surprisingly worked well, although you’ll have to wait a bit longer for the games to load. Watching videos was a delight with the Nokia 3, but I recommend using earphones because the speaker on the device is rather unremarkable. The bundled headset isn’t the best, either, so if you have your own set of headphones, wired or otherwise, I suggest you use them.  Speaking of wireless audio, I had some minor issues when connected to a Bluetooth speaker. I paired devices with no issues, but when I walked some ten steps away from the speaker with the Nokia 3 in hand,  I found that the sound became choppy and sometimes cut out.   Take note that there were no obstructions between the phone and the speaker when this happened so I found it kind of strange. Wireless headphones may be different issue altogether, but it’s something to take note of when using wireless devices for audio. Cameras The cameras found on the Nokia 3’s back and front are both 8MP shooters. While they may serve acceptable spur-of-the-moment snapshots, the performance of both cameras is mediocre, at best. In fact, they can be quite frustrating at times due to its quite long boot time and a disappointing shutter lag. If you’re worried about missing fleeting moments, the Nokia 3 doesn’t do a lot to ease the anxiety.    In good lighting conditions, however, and with minimal action and camera shake, both cameras take sharp photos. The powerful LED flash helps a bit in low-light situations if you find yourself in a pinch, but who takes photos with the flash on these days? Taking videos was surprisingly stable, considering that there’s no stabilization to speak of here. Of course, as an entry-level device, videos are limited to a resolution of 720p. No 4k videos here. Battery Battery life is pretty good but not the best; for a 2630mAh battery, I expected it to last a bit longer. It’s enough for a day’s use, though, but expect to charge it every night. The real disappointment with the battery is the charging time.  The Nokia 3’s battery takes a long time to charge fully – around 4 to 6 hours. I got tired of waiting to see the exact length of time it took. Suffice it to say, it’s a hassle when your battery runs low in the middle of the day and you need to fully charge it immediately.  This is unacceptable for a smartphone in 2017, and the only workaround is charging it overnight, which isn’t always ideal. I’d have hoped there would be a fast-charging option, but no dice. Will the Nokia 3 be your next Android phone?  If you’re looking for a no-frills smartphone that has all the basics in a slick, premium-looking package, then the Nokia 3 should suit your needs fine. If, however, you’re looking for power and the bells and whistles of a flagship, you better look elsewhere.  Power users will find the Nokia 3 wanting, but it’s a great backup phone due to its price (P6,999 at launch), and it will make your mom or significant other happy if they were to receive it as a gift. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/190831-ltfrb-slams-tv-host-for-spreading-fake-news/","title":"LTFRB slams TV host for spreading ‘fake news’","date":"Dec 9, 2017 12:07 AM PHT","snippet":"The LTFRB and TV host James Deakin lock horns over ride-hailing applications","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) slammed television host James Deakin on Friday, December 8, for supposedly spreading “fake news” on his Facebook page. Speaking to reporters in their official media chatbox, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada showed a Facebook post by Deakin, where he slammed the LTFRB for supposedly requiring too much from Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) operators like Grab and Uber drivers. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) “A dedicated mechanic. A stock of lubricants and parts. Dedicated CCTV for their garage/workshop. A dedicated safety officer. And a helper. Even if you have just one single unit…Why, LTFRB? Why?” Deakin said in his post. In her message, Lizada said, “Fake news. Why, James, Why?” Deakin hosts television shows focusing on automobiles and has more than 400,000 followers on his Facebook page. According to the LTFRB, Deakin misunderstood the memorandum circular. In a statement, the LTFRB explained that the requirements Deakin enumerated were not required of Grab and Uber drivers, but of Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) fleet owners such as bus, jeepney, and taxi operators. “To set things right, please be informed that the requirements cited by Mr Deakin are only for vehicles operating under fleet management, and not for TNVS like the vehicles operating under Grab, Uber or U-hop,” the LTFRB said in a statement. Deakin has since then edited his post, citing Grab Philippines as the source of how he understood the guidelines. LTFRB said they have reached out to Grab too. “We, therefore, request Mr. James Deakin to uphold objectivity, accuracy, and responsible journalism in presenting his reports/opinions, through verifying details with its proper sources, so as to prevent the spread of misinformation that may delude the public,” the LTFRB added. Reacting to the LTFRB’s statement in another official chatbox, this time managed by the Department of Transportation, he said the LTFRB was flip-flopping in regulating TNVS. “The LTFRB have been treating TNVS as PUVs, but when it suits them, they are exempt?” Deakin asked. He then shared that he had earlier been kicked out of the LTFRB media chatbox, and could have been reached for clarification. “All this coming from an agency that refuses to respond to queries and kicked me out of their Viber group? Precious,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/190412-uber-dpwh-partnership-traffic-planning/","title":"Uber, DPWH join forces for better traffic planning","date":"Dec 5, 2017 3:35 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing company will share traffic data with the government to help analyze how infrastructure projects affect traffic","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a change of pace from the past months, transport network company (TNC) Uber now finds itself teaming up with the government to help ease the country’s traffic woes. Uber Philippines and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday, December 5. The ride-hailing company will build the Movement for Manila platform with the help of the DPWH Planning Department “to provide inputs for enhanced traffic management and troubleshooting.” The tie-up will see Uber share its traffic data with the DPWH in order to help the government agency analyze how its infrastructure projects affect traffic and eventually to determine which projects are most needed for various locations. Uber gets its data from the daily routes of thousands of Uber drivers. “We realized that all this data can be useful not just for us but also for society and for the government as it can be used for better planning,” said Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua at the signing. “We think this data can be sliced and diced to better understand how our roads and infrastructure [are] currently supporting travel, how fast it takes [motorists] to go from one point to another. It helps us not only evaluate past projects but also inform how planning can go forward,” he added. Effects of infrastructure projects In practical terms, Cua pointed out that the DPWH can use the data to determine how opening new infrastructure projects like roads and bridges would affect travel time not just in a particular area, but also in surrounding places. An example of this is how Uber determined that opening the NAIA Expressway earlier this year cut down the average travel time from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2 to San Lorenzo Village in Makati City by 3.8%, and from the same terminal to Marina Bay in Pasay City by 4.7%. Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar noted how the government needs to use technology to solve a lot of the metro’s problems, particularly as the DPWH will be entering a crucial stage in the Build, Build, Build program implementation next year. “With this partnership with Uber, we’ll be able to plan our traffic much better. The wealth of information they are providing will help us cut down on the time it takes [to] analyze traffic… and it will be very important in our short- and long-term planning,” Villar said. Open to other firms, too Uber and its users will be relieved not to find the company at odds with the government this time. The DPWH said it was in fact Uber which approached them with the idea for the partnership. The government agency added that it is open to partnering with other firms for data which can be used in the planning and implementation of projects. Uber has been involved in legal issues with the government in recent months, culminating in it being suspended for a month and fined P190 million for failure to comply with orders of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).

They take drivers who have not had training and official tests.” Uber did not immediately respond to the ruling. The US firm has become a global phenomenon operating in more than 600 cities and dozens of countries, but it has faced a series of scandals and legal challenges. Last week, Uber said hackers compromised personal data from some 57 million riders and drivers in a breach kept hidden for a year. It has faced resistance from traditional taxi operators and regulators. Israel’s transportation ministry is also pursuing a court case against Uber, saying its ride-sharing services violate the law. Uber Israel in recent weeks launched its daytime ride-sharing services in the Tel Aviv area. It began its nighttime services in the same area in October 2016, though it operated with numerous restrictions, according to Israeli media. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/189615-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-not-without-risk/","title":"Bitcoin, an ‘Uber’ currency, not without risk","date":"Nov 27, 2017 9:45 AM PHT","snippet":"The growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention","body":" PARIS, France – Bitcoin, which this week soared to a new record high of more than $8,000, is the monetary equivalent of Uber, since it bypasses central bank regulation and could be attractive for financially fragile countries, economists say. Nevertheless, it is precisely the lack of oversight that opens up the users of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to risks and dangers, analysts warn.  “Bitcoin? It’s about ‘Uber-ising’ currency, about not having a central bank that decides the price,” said Ludovic Subran, chief economist at credit insurer Euler Hermes, referring to Uber, the ride-hailing app that has set the cat among the pigeons in the taxi sector in recent years. “Yes, it’s exactly that: it bypasses a central regulatory authority. That’s the genius of this invention,” agreed Yves Choueifaty, founder of the Paris-based asset management firm Tobam, which this week launched the first European fund investing in bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not regulated, but is traded on specialist platforms. It has no legal exchange rate and no central bank backing it. Launched in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software written by someone using the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is controlled and regulated by its community of users.  Investors are already referring to it as “digital gold”, as the bitcoin soared to a new record high of more than $8,000 this week, a staggering rise in value from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year.  “We have no need for central banks,” said Yves Choueifaty, suggesting that institutional investors may be behind the recent sharp gains, even if insisted that there was “no bitcoin bubble.”  The growing interest in bitcoin is catching mainstream attention: the CME Group of Chicago, one of the world’s biggest exchanges, has decided to launch a bitcoin futures marketplace. And prestigious US universities are offering courses in blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrencies are based.  ‘Dollarization 2.0’ Virtual currencies could also prove attractive to economic players in countries such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, whose fiat currencies have been ravaged hyper-inflation. Caracas, for example, has had to issued a new 100,000-bolivar bill, when just a year ago, the biggest-denomination banknote was 100 bolivars.  “Think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country – such as the US dollar – some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0,” said the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, recently. Economists also suggest the bitcoin could be of interest to developing countries where individuals often find it easier to access the internet than traditional bank accounts.  Nevertheless, central banks and the big financial institutions are concerned that virtual currencies can be used for illicit purposes and are highly speculative by nature.  “It’s the exact definition of a bubble,” the head of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, warned recently in comments that immediately sparked an uproar on social media among bitcoin’s supporters.  The head of the French central bank or Banque de France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, warned in the summer: “People are using the bitcoin today are clearly doing it at their own risk and at their own peril.”  ‘No intrinsic value’ Nobel laureate, Jean Tirole, also insisted that the current bitcoin boom was a “bubble”.  “It’s something that has no intrinsic value,” he told Agence France-Presse on the sidelines of a conference in Paris this week.  “It could collapse from one day to the next. I would be completely against French banks, for example, investing in bitcoin.”  Euler Hermes economist Subran called on the financial authorities to make potential investors more aware of the risks.  “There’s a lot of money to be made. And a lot of money to be lost,” he said.  “We’re seeing more and more people wanting to venture there, but they’re not fully aware of the risk.”  Bitcoin has regularly suffered abrupt falls, for example, in cases of friction between the members of the community who oversee it and the members who produce it, when the regulatory authorities issue any warnings, or if there are data hacks.  But more often than not, bitcoin quickly makes up any losses and some investors are predicting it will soon top the $10,000 level. Back in 2011, it had struggled to pass $1. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/188949-angkas-passengers-riders/","title":"Why passengers and bikers think Angkas matters","date":"Nov 22, 2017 10:16 AM PHT","snippet":"For many drivers and passengers, motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas is convenient and saves time","body":" MANILA, Philippines – For many Filipinos, commuting is an ordeal they go through every day. According to a study, the Philippines may lose up to P6 billion a day by 2030 because of worsening traffic jams. When the motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas broke into the market, many commuters took the opportunity to beat the traffic. As the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered its closure, app users were not too happy and explained why it mattered to them. ‘It saves time’ According to commuter Bianca Dalisay, Angkas helped her save time, cutting her usual 3 to 4 hours of travel. “Kagalang-galang na LTFRB, ako po ay isa sa libo-libong commuters na nauubos ang oras sa pagbiyahe dahil sa walang katapusang traffic o kundi naman ay sa mala blockbuster na pila ng mga pasahero sa MRT,” she said in a Facebook post.  (LTFRB, I am one of the thousands of commuters whose time is wasted in travel due to the endless traffic or the MRT passenger lines that approximate those of blockbuster movies.) Dalisay said she had to wake up at 4 am to avoid being late for her 8 am job in Makati City. “Bakit? Ina-anticipate ko ang posibilidad na pagkatapos kong pumila ng napakatagal sa MRT ay ang magkaroon ng aberya sa kalagitnaan ng biyahe. Ganun din, ang traffic na susuungin bago pa makarating sa aking destinasyon. Hindi po namin puwedeng idahilan sa trabaho ang traffic at sirang MRT kaya kami na-late,” she said. (READ: MRT woes: How often do they happen?) (Why? Because I anticipate the possibility that after lining up for a long time at the MRT, there could be a glitch in the middle of the trip. [I also take into account] the traffic that I have to brave on the way to my destination. I can’t cite as a reason for being late at work traffic and the MRT glitches.) She said the app has saved her from being on the road for too long. “Sa pagpasok ni Angkas, laking tulong at ginhawa sa aming mga pasahero ang naibigay nito. Hindi na po namin kailangang umalis ng bahay nang sobrang aga at nakakauwi na rin kami sa aming mga pamilya nang mas maaga at may oras pa kaming makipag-bonding sa kanila,” she added. (When Angkas came, it brought us passengers huge relief and convenience. We don’t have to leave the house too early. We can now come home earlier to our families and have the time to bond with them.) ‘You can count on it’ Many users have found Angkas truly convenient.

(In short, I left the insurance (company) teary-eyed and grateful to the rider and Angkas app. It was a relief that I could be confident I would get there by 1 pm without worrying about the traffic and the long commute.) Changed lives The service has also helped improve the lives of some bikers. Roderick Manabat is one of them. In a Facebook post, he said that his earnings have allowed him to sustain his family. “Salamat laging naka-ngiti misis ko dahil may inaabot ako na pangtustos sa mga gastusin….Salamat dahil nakakatulog na ‘ko nang mahimbing dahil may budget para bukas,” he said. (I am grateful because my wife is happy when I hand her money for our expenses. I am grateful because I can now sleep soundly because we have enough money budgeted for the next day.) Angkas operations manager Menard Umali said he was “proud” that the app has had a direct impact on the lives of drivers and passengers. In a Facebook post, he said he met Ferd Llaguno, a working student who recently graduated with a degree in Criminology in Cebu. According to Umali, Llaguno dropped by their office to give his thanks. “Because of his Angkas driving, he dreams of being able to get his transcript of records and eventually take his board exam.

But urban planners looking for solutions to gridlock may find the draconian measures hard to replicate in other less-compliant cities. Singapore has gone further than any other major city to avoid the monster jams that have blighted Asian metropolises such as Jakarta or Manila. The tough approach has been possible as Singaporeans are used to strict control – with media closely monitored and harsh punishments for minor crimes – and are fearful the city-state will be flooded with vehicles without the curbs. However the model faces mounting criticism thanks to rush-hour jams that have frustrated commuters, surging vehicle prices after a freeze on car numbers, and public transport breakdowns. “I think the system can be made better and fairer,” Joel Lee, a 28-year-old technician, told Agence France-Presse. He said authorities should make “a distinction between those who need cars, be it for work or family commitments, and those who just want more cars as a status symbol”. Six times the price Authorities’ main tool is the certificate of entitlement, or COE. Every potential car buyer must bid for a certificate and the cost is added to the vehicle price. The current cost of a COE for an average family car is almost Sg$50,000, pushing the price of a Toyota Corolla to Sg$114,000 (US$83,000). But COEs fluctuate depending on demand and at their high point 4 years ago the same car was Sg$159,000 (US$127,000 at the exchange rate at the time) – six times the price in the US. The certificates are valid for 10 years, after which the car must be scrapped or the certificate renewed. Despite the high price, many in the financial center, home to hordes of wealthy expats and millionaires, have bought cars, with some 600,000 on the streets – a considerable number for a limited road network. Other key measures include controlling the number of vehicles on the road and charging tolls on main roads at busy times. Authorities last month decided to freeze the number of private cars on the road from February for at least two years, citing land scarcity. But the decision sparked anger and was followed by a jump in the price of COEs by several thousand dollars, in what the Straits Times newspaper described as “panic buying”. To mitigate its tough policies, Singapore has built a modern public transport network with a subway, overland trains and buses, and the government recently announced a plan to spend Sg$28 billion to upgrade the system. Ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber have helped those unable or unwilling to spend on a car, and the government plans to build 700 kilometers (430 miles) of cycle paths. But the subway has recently been hit by repeated delays and breakdowns during rush hour. In the most serious incident for years a tunnel on the network flooded last month, crippling a main line for 20 hours, and sparking widespread anger. ‘Car-lite’ woes Some are now questioning the government’s plan to make Singapore a country where most people walk, cycle or take public transport. “The government has been trying to make the city ‘car-lite’ but you have a train system that’s not very reliable,” Jason Lin, a 66-year-old retiree, told Agence France-Presse. “If you take a bus, because there are so many cars, it’ll take a long time. It can be very frustrating.” Speaking in parliament this month, Lam Pin Min, a senior minister of state for transport, insisted there significant growth in the transport network was planned and there would be “less need to own a car”. Singapore has not heavily promoted electric cars as it pushes public transport – unlike rival financial hub Hong Kong – but an electric-car sharing scheme starting next month is a first step to changing that. Other places echo Singapore’s approach – London has a congestion charge while Paris sometimes orders some private cars off the road due to air pollution – but they are unlikely to copy the city-state’s tougher measures as it would be too risky. “COE is not a very popular measure, and any government that tries to implement this kind of a measure in any other country may lose elections,” Vivek Vaidya, a transport expert at business consultancy Frost and Sullivan, told Agence France-Presse. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/188675-twitter-removing-white-supremacists-verified-badges/","title":"Twitter removing white supremacists’ verified badges","date":"Nov 16, 2017 5:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Twitter takes out the verification badges of at least 4 white supremacist or alt-right accounts, and says it is reviewing its system of giving out the badges","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Twitter announced on Thursday, November 16, that it is reviewing the behavior of Twitter users with verified accounts, and removing the verification badges from users deemed to have broken the rules on the social media service.

The London employment tribunal rejected Uber’s appeal against an October 2016 ruling in a case that is being closely watched for the wider implications for Britain’s booming “gig economy”. “Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset,” Paul Jennings from law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite said in a statement. “The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so-called gig economy,” he said. Uber said it will appeal the ruling. “The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal,” Tom Elvidge, Uber UK’s acting general manager, said in a statement. “Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control. We’ve also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover,” he said. Uber drivers are paid for each ride and the firm insists they are self-employed, choosing when, where and for how long they drive. ‘Brutally exploitative’  However, James Farrar, who brought the test case with fellow former driver Yaseen Aslam, has called Uber’s business plan “brutally exploitative”. They are supported by the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) trade union, which also represents couriers, cleaners, foster carers and security officers. “These companies are making a mockery of supposed employment rights,” the union’s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said in a statement. Ahead of the ruling, an Uber spokesman told AFP that whatever the result, it “will not necessarily be the end of the process and we expect either side would appeal”. Any challenge would go to the Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider a similar case involving the company Pimlico Plumbers, which is appealing a ruling that one of its former plumbers was entitled to employment rights. Uber meanwhile is currently fighting a decision by London authorities not to renew its license, owing to public safety concerns. The company has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital. – Rappler.com   UBER LOSES.

To celebrate this momentous occasion, the heads of state of the 10 ASEAN member countries and their partners from Australia, USA, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia, India, China and Japan will be in Clark Air Base, Pampanga from November 10 to 14 for the 31st ASEAN Summit and the Twelfth East Asia Summit. The ASEAN’s combined GDP makes it one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world and it continues to be an attractive market and investment destination for leading economies, such as Japan. Japan’s foreign direct investment (FDI) remains significant within the ASEAN. From 2013 to 2015, Japanese FDI within the region amounted to $19.2 billion, or 15.4% of total inbound investment in the market. This also represents 16.7% of Japan’s total overseas investment. “Over the last two decades, just as Japan has increased its trade ties with ASEAN member countries, investment into Japan from Southeast Asian based companies has increased. Opportunities in the Japanese market across a range of industries continue to attract investment from our neighbors,” says Masataka Fujita, Secretary General, of the ASEAN Promotion Centre on Trade, Investment and Tourism (ASEAN-Japan Centre). “We intend to work even closer with our friends across the region to encourage business partnerships, trade and investment.” The Philippines has been particularly cited to be an important consumer market for Japan, due to our young, educated population. Japanese companies invest heavily in production value-chain projects and electronic, automotive, and chemical industries within the region. Get to know some of these economic partners below.  TOKIN CORPORATION Who they are: A subsidiary of US-based KEMET Corporation. Involved in the development and production of electric components.

Financing is the foundation of economic growth, especially for small to medium enterprises. There’s a rising need for more dynamic financial products in Southeast Asia that TCC hopes to address. Why they matter in the ASEAN: Aside from being involved with various financial groups and transportation services in the region,Tokyo Century Corporation has also established a partnership with Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform. Growth plan: “Tokyo Century Corporation is aiming to be the best financing partner in the region so business owners can grow their businesses and promote their products without any major financial constraints,” says Yasushi Yoshino, Senior Managing Executive Officer of Tokyo Century Corporation.  NIPPON EXPRESS Who they are: A leading logistics company in Japan. They move goods and services around the world and are present in 261 cities across 42 countries.

What is your alternative? Furious netizens took to Twitter to criticize Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) after it announced on Thursday, November 9, that Angkas is “considered as closed.“ According to the LTFRB, the popular motorcycle ride-hailing service has been operating without a proper permit.   Recently, LTFRB has been enforcing stricter regulations for transport network vehicle services (TNVS) providers like Grab and Uber. Angkas, however, does not fall under this category.  Angkas has appealed to Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade to consider revising Department Order 2015-11 and include two-wheeled vehicles under the TNVS category. In a statement, Angkas added that they are open to regulation.  Angkas has been widely used by its passengers as an alternative to the inefficient public transport in Metro Manila and to slip through the city’s horrible traffic. Netizens also appealed to LTFRB that instead of only cracking down on innovative apps like Angkas, they should also provide alternative solutions to commuters.  Here are some tweets by netizens on the issue:  {source} <a class=”twitter-timeline” data-partner=”tweetdeck” href=”https://twitter.com/MovePH/timelines/928598608290574336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>Angkas – Curated tweets by MovePH</a> <script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script>   {/source} On a lighter note, netizens did not miss out on how Angkas’ chose to poke fun at the issue on Twitter. The motorcycle ride-hailing app posted its statement on social media with the caption, “Oh my god… I’m… Ok, I’m so sorry… I… I told you that I’m so confident… Eto, ahmmmm.” This was an obvious reference to Janina San Miguel’s popular answer during the Bb.

This incident has raised questions about how app-based transportation services are regulated.  Angkas is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a “software application provide” that uses technology to match its passengers with bikers.  Just like Grab and Uber, Angkas customers can easily book a ride through their app. Aside from being able to zoom through traffic, Angkas riders also offer cheaper fares. – Rappler.com Are you an Angkas rider?

An initial court hearing is expected on December 11. London transport authorities last month said they would not renew Uber’s licence to operate in the city owing to public safety concerns. Transport for London (TfL) claims that the conduct of Uber, which has about 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers in the British capital, had raised concerns. “While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” Uber added on Friday.  “As our new CEO (Dara Khosrowshahi) has said, we are determined to make things right.” TfL has highlighted the company’s approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and to obtaining criminal record checks for drivers as factors in its decision. The company came under scrutiny in Britain after it emerged that dozens of rape and sexual assault claims had been made against their drivers and when one of their drivers used his vehicle in a recent terror attack on Buckingham Palace. It also questioned the process through which drivers obtain their medical certificates and the practice of “greyballing”, when the company uses a fake version of its app to fool regulators in cities in which it is banned. ‘Mistakes’ In an open letter last month, Khosrowshahi apologized for “mistakes” made by Uber. “While Uber had revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way,” he wrote. But he pledged to appeal the TfL decision “on behalf of millions of Londoners.” Uber hired Khosrowshahi from US travel group Expedia in August, in the hope that he can steer the ride-sharing service away from the string of controversies. Uber, which has accumulated financial losses, has faced allegations also of technology theft, corruption and use of illegal software. At the same time, its drivers have been struggling with a wave of opposition from traditional taxis in several countries – and has faced regulatory problems in other hubs including Cape Town, Mumbai, and New Delhi. But Uber has seen also its global popularity explode since it launched in 2009 in San Francisco. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/184642-pldt-pacific-global-one-chartered-flights/","title":"PLDT goes into chartered flights service","date":"Oct 8, 2017 10:25 PM PHT","snippet":"PLDT unit Pacific Global One says it can now provide private flights to Balesin, Amanpulo, Baguio, and Boracay, among other routes","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The aviation arm of telecommunications giant PLDT Incorporated launched its chartered flights service, cashing in on the rising demand for travel on private aircraft for leisure and business.

Running at a flight speed of 250 knots, the King Air 350 can fly for 5 hours.  Pacific Global One’s other aircraft is a Bell 429 helicopter which has a 5-seat capacity. With a full tank, the helicopter can fly for 3 hours.  PLDT said its aircraft are capable of flights in all weather conditions and are air-conditioned. Manned by seasoned pilots who are former Philippine Air Force and Navy veterans as well as a Canadian flyer, Pacific Global One said it flies all over the Philippines. “The rates we offer for our chartered flights are very competitive. We also open our doors to small groups who need affordable, reliable, and accessible transportation to go to various destinations nationwide – whether for work or leisure,” Meily said. “By giving the public the chance to fly corporate aircraft, Pacific Global One hopes to contribute to the growth of the travel industry in the Philippines,” he added. Pacific Global One said it also has a VIP-configured chopper – a high-end AW139 helicopter – and a Global XRS.

Reached for comment, Uber Communications head Cat Avelino said it was “zero incidents for Uber.” Cu said Grab Delivery, the service supposedly being used to send narcotics, records over 20,000 dispatches a week, and that it would be unfair to fault the thousands for the error of a few. “What I don’t want to happen is for regulators to see our technology and our service for the minority of users that are using it for crimes, and ending up shutting down a service that benefits a vast majority,” Cu added. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) While Uber does not have a delivery service, its patrons use their service to send packages through the regular booking service, asking drivers to bring packages to the users’ destinations. Vigilance asked from drivers In the same briefing, PNP HPG head Chief Superintendent Arnel Escobal said the suppression of such practices primarily lies in the hands of the delivery drivers. “Grab partners, you are not [a] law enforcement agency pwede niyong buklatin [ang deliveries] (you can open the deliveries), unlike us law enforcers parang abuse yun (it’s like abuse), we need a warrant para buksan ‘yun (to open them),” Escobal said. He explained that his officers cannot just stop delivery services in the middle of the road without prior knowledge of what they expect to find. Cu agreed with Escobal, announcing that they have already begun informing and reminding their drivers that they can open and refuse packages sent through Grab Delivery. He assured Grab drivers that they will not impose penalties on them if they refuse. Uber’s Avelino added that they do the same for their “partners.” “We regularly remind our driver partners to take precaution and only fulfill trips with riders [or] passengers,” Avelino said.  Escobal warned delivery drivers, however, that they should be more vigilant, for if they are caught delivering illegal drugs, they can be charged as accomplices to the crime. “So immediately, when it comes to his knowledge i-report kaagad niya (one should report it immediately),” he added. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/183063-uber-london-license-renewal-rejection/","title":"Uber license renewal in London rejected","date":"Sep 22, 2017 9:18 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber is not a 'fit and proper' private car hire operator, says London's transport authority","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Uber’s attempt to apply for a new license in London has been rejected by transport authorities, saying that the company is not a “fit and proper” private car hire operator, reported The Guardian.  Uber’s license will expire on September 30, but the company will immediately be trying to appeal and challenge the ruling. The company has 21 days to appeal and will be allowed to operate until those 21 days are over.  The report said that the company’s renewal application was rejected because “Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility” in terms of reporting serious criminal offenses, securing medical certificates and doing background checks – incidents that Uber has historically gotten in trouble for.  Another reason cited by London’s transport authority is the ride-hailing company’s use of Greyball, a controversial software used by Uber to evade authorities and regulatory bodies.  London Mayor was quoted  by The Guardian as saying that all companies needed to “play by the rules.” In the Philippines, the company clashed with the LTFRB, and was subsequently slapped with a month-long suspension that was lifted with a P10-million fine.

This was underscored in a panel discussion at the 2017 Social Good Summit held on Saturday, September 16. The discussion focused on the challenges to innovation in the Philippines, and what various groups have been doing to promote entrepreneurship in the country. Ongoing conversation The recent deadlock between the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) and ride-hailing companies Grab and Uber reflects the challenges encountered by innovators clashing with government regulators. Uber is no stranger to controversy, encountering backlash in the places where it launched because its business model did not fit current transportation laws. The Philippines is unique in that respect, since it created new transport categories back in May 2015 to accommodate Grab and Uber’s business models. In July this year, the LTFRB cracked down on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms, eventually leading to Uber’s suspension and the imposition of a hefty fine. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?)  The issue sparked controversy, with some criticizing the LTFRB while others pointed out the need for accountability and regulation for these transport network companies. Lawyer JJ Disini cited this issue as he discussed the challenge of balancing innovation with the need for government regulators to do their job and protect the public interest. In other countries, some firms can try out new ideas by participating in a regulatory sandbox, where businesses are allowed to test out their innovative products or business models without following some legal requirements. The results and information generated from participating in a regulatory sandbox can be used by the government to craft regulations that better fit the public need, Disini said. This way, both innovators and regulators can work together to learn and refine the new business models. “We need regulators to be there. Their job is to protect the general public, but we should also understand that they’re constrained by that. At the same time, they want innovation as well. We do understand the complexities of the issues,” Disini said.  Supporting PH startups On the part of the government, there have been efforts among different government agencies to enable an environment where local startups can thrive. Rosemarie Edillon, planning and policy undersecretary of the National Economic and Development Authority, said entrepreneurship is key to helping the Philippine economy prosper. “One of the big problems we’re trying to address is the economy, and the way to have more employment is to have more employers. So we see entrepreneurship as one strategy,” Edillon said. “We actually need to grow much faster, and we need growth to be more inclusive. Key to that is entrepreneurship and innovation,” she added. To help entrepreneurs and startups thrive, agencies like the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) have their own programs geared toward budding entrepreneurs. The BSP, for instance, has a credit surety fund program to help micro, small, and medium enterprises obtain loans from banks. The DICT, meanwhile, has launched a roadmap for digital startups, that aims to provide a framework for developing the Philippine startup ecosystem. “It’s so exciting today, we’re glad that [Philippine startups] have become sexy,” said Mon Ibrahim, undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology. For Diane Eustaquio, executive director of non-profit incubator IdeaSpace, encouraging millennials to take risks and overcome a fear of failure is crucial for boosting the local startup scene. “We’re conditioned to follow and not to challenge, so it’s difficult for people to become entrepreneurs,” she said.  “I think that’s the challenge, it’s not in our culture to be allowed to fail… But it’s that failure that allows you to try to be better than what you were before,” she added. –Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/182282-hacksociety-ways-technology-can-improve-public-health/","title":"#HackSociety 2017: Ways technology can improve public health","date":"Sep 15, 2017 6:48 PM PHT","snippet":"Good health and well being is one of the main sustainable development goals of the United Nations Development Programme","body":" MANILA , Philippines – A single tap that can save a life, a platform that can feed the hungry, and an app that matches you to a mental health expert.

Khosrowshahi emerged as the leader among 3 finalists for the job during company board meetings over the weekend, the Times reported, citing two people familiar with the decision. Uber spokespeople were not immediately available for comment. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise chief Meg Whitman had been seen as the favorite, according to several media outlets, but the Times said the situation changed on Sunday in the 48-year-old Tehran-born Khosrowshahi’s favor. Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, whose name was on the shortlist, on Sunday removed himself from the running for the top job. “I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber,” Immelt said on Twitter, without explaining his reasons. “I have immense respect for the company & founders.” The Wall Street Journal reported that Immelt had opted not to pursue the CEO post after “observing disorder and divisions among different factions of Uber’s board,” according to an unnamed source familiar with the matter. Other sources close to the search process said the 61-year-old Immelt – who left General Electric on August 1 after 16 years at the helm – did not have the votes to win and thus “saved face” by publicly bowing out, the newspaper said. Uber has been without a boss since June when Kalanick resigned, yielding to pressure from investors seeking to clean up a toxic corporate culture at the fast-growing company he created in 2009. The San Francisco-based firm has been roiled by disturbing reports of a cutthroat workplace culture, harassment, discrimination and questionable business tactics to thwart rivals. The pressure mounted earlier this month when early Uber investor Benchmark Capital filed suit against Kalanick, accusing him of fraud, breach of contract and of plotting to manipulate the board of directors to allow him to return as CEO. Kalanick fired back, claiming that Benchmark “began secretly planning an effort to oust him” and “executed its plan at the most shameful of times” following the death of his mother in a May accident. Uber has not only disrupted the local transport industry in dozens of countries. It’s also been investing in autonomous driving technology, and has provoked a lawsuit from the former Google car unit now called Waymo that accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/180074-ltfrb-uber-190-million-pesos-fine-suspension/","title":"LTFRB to Uber: Pay P190 million, we’ll lift suspension","date":"Aug 25, 2017 10:49 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) The LTFRB bases the fine on the daily earnings of Uber, which it estimates to earn between P7 million and P10 million per day by servicing at least 150,000 trips a day","body":" MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) announced Friday, August 25, it is asking Uber to pay P190 million ($3.7 million*) to lift the suspension order against it. “The board thus rules to grant the prayer of [Uber] to lift the order of suspension imposed in its order of 14 August 2017 and in lieu thereof, imposes a fine of P190,000,000,” the LTFRB said in its order. The fine will go straight to the national treasury. (READ: TIMELINE: Why only Uber is suspended) Why P190 million? The LTFRB based the fine on the daily earnings of Uber, which it pegs at between P7 million and P10 million per day through at least 150,000 trips a day. “The amount is arrived at by taking into consideration the number of days that respondent should be suspended in relation to the daily average income,” the LTFRB said in its order. Uber was suspended starting August 15 – it has already been suspended for 11 days, with 19 days to go. With its maximum earnings pegged at P10 million multiplied by the remaining days, the LTFRB asked for P190 million. Despite this computation, Uber can only pay on Tuesday, August 29, with the LTFRB closed on weekends and holidays. There is no work on Monday, August 28, National Heroes’ Day. The LTFRB added that until Uber pays the fine, the transport network company (TNC) should continue providing assistance to its drivers.

Supply and demand is taught on Day One of any basic economics class for two good reasons. First, it explains why prices go up during times of relative scarcity and down during times of relative plenty. Second – and perhaps more importantly – supply and demand arms students with a simple yet powerful framework by which to understand government intervention in markets, and how such policies can improve or worsen society’s welfare. In this article we use supply and demand to explain the fascinating economics of Uber and Grab, and predict the likely impact of LTFRB’s regulations on both their riders and drivers. Regulating the number of Uber and Grab vehicles Each Uber or Grab ride is mutually beneficial to the rider who hails it and the driver who supplies it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t bother transacting with each other on the apps. So when the government prohibits such rides – partially or totally – it eliminates such gains from trade. Riders and drivers can’t benefit from the rides they can’t take, and this reduces social welfare.  This is what happens when the LTFRB limits the number of Uber and Grab vehicles, whether by imposing quotas or prohibitions. Consider Uber’s one-month suspension that started on August 15. Beyond the many angry comments, hashtags, and memes that it inspired on Facebook and Twitter, the welfare losses from such suspension could prove huge in monetary terms. In the US, one study found that UberX generated about $6.8-billion worth of consumer welfare in 2015 alone. No such study yet exists for the Philippines. But given the hundreds of thousands of rides that don’t happen anymore because of the suspension, the losses for riders and drivers could easily amount to several millions of pesos daily. Regulating ‘surge pricing’ Market prices orchestrate the decisions of consumers and producers. In the case of Uber and Grab, riders want to hail vehicles when prices are low, while drivers want to ply the streets when prices are high (or “surge”). Governments worldwide are particularly keen to regulate “surge pricing.” It is often taken as a form of price gouging, akin to what happens when prices of basic commodities rise during times of short supply (think Yolanda or Marawi). In the previous Christmas season, the LTFRB warned Uber and Grab against these “unreasonable” price surges that “take advantage” of people. But far from abusing people, this “dynamic pricing” mechanism – afforded by algorithms – lies at the heart of the dependability of Uber and Grab. By allowing prices to rise and fall with changes in supply and demand, riders can reliably hail vehicles whenever, wherever. Figure 1 below shows surge pricing in action. Notice the rise of driver supply (green) in response to a rise in demand (red). Surge pricing makes sure that demand always meets supply, and a similar phenomenon occurs whenever it suddenly rains or it’s rush hour in Metro Manila.   Figure 1. UberX supply rises to meet higher demand. Source: Hall, Kendrick, and Nosko (2015). Tinkering with dynamic pricing – by imposing a price ceiling beyond which prices can’t surge – will not just diminish the reliability of Uber and Grab, but also prolong wait times. Entrants that lack dynamic pricing altogether (such as taxis using the new Micab) are also therefore unlikely to match the availability of Uber and Grab vehicles. To see the effect of price controls, one need only look at the first day of Uber’s recent suspension. Bookings for Grab rides jumped by 10% to 15%, and Grab managers responded by capping their surge rates at 1.4 (meaning their rates can’t go beyond 1.4 times the regular rates). But the effects of such a binding “price ceiling” are well-known in Econ 101: It creates excess demand, where demand exceeds supply. In Grab’s case, more riders were willing to hail rides than there were Grab vehicles on the road, resulting in a shortage of vehicles and longer wait times. Grab wanted to help riders with this surge cap, but ended up making them wait longer for their rides. Regulating work hours LTFRB also came up with a proposal to impose “minimum work hours” on Uber and Grab drivers. They reasoned that the franchises they issue will be put to waste if many drivers don’t ply the streets at least a certain number of hours per week. But again, this proposal ignores the centrality of supply and demand in Uber and Grab’s operations: With dynamic pricing, both prices and the number of cars on the road have to adjust freely to reflect supply and demand. During peak hours – when demand is high – prices rise to incentivize drivers to go out and drive. By contrast, during off-peak hours – when demand is low – prices go down, which turns off most drivers, many of whom choose not to drive. The net effect is that ride-hailing vehicles typically have higher “capacity utilization rates” than taxis. Simply put, Uber and Grab drivers are far likelier than taxi drivers to ply the streets with passengers in their cars. In a 2016 paper, two economists confirmed this when they looked at UberX in 5 American cities in 2015. Figure 2 shows that, in Los Angeles, UberX was 58% more efficient than taxis; in Seattle, 41%.  Figure 2: Capacity utilization rate for taxi and UberX drivers in Los Angeles and Seattle. Source: Cramer and Krueger (2016). Capacity utilization rate = percent of miles driven with a passenger.   Again, no similar study yet exists for the Philippines. But if the LTFRB requires Uber and Grab drivers to work minimum hours, supply and demand tells us their vehicles will likely become idler on the road. Heed the law of supply and demand One might argue that, in all this, the LTFRB – with all its “draconian” and “antiquated” policies – is just doing its job. On the first day of Uber’s recent suspension, motoring journalist James Deakin said on Facebook, “rules are rules.” However, what is illegal is not necessarily bad economics, and what is legal is not necessarily good economics. The letter of the law is no excuse for LTFRB to spawn a flurry of discretionary policies that completely ignore (and even negate) the most basic lessons of economics. To make sure that there are enough rides when people need them, don’t impose caps on surge rates. To make Uber and Grab operations more efficient, don’t impose minimum work hours. To improve the welfare of the riding public, don’t kill a new industry that many people have come to love and depend on. The LTFRB can impose all the orders and decrees it wants, but it cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Try as it might, it will be as successful as the proverbial king who commanded the waves to retreat. – Rappler.com   The author is a PhD candidate at the UP School of Economics.

Nograles, who represents Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) in the House of Representatives, said Friday, August 18, he tried to use Grab to get to the airport. “To his disappointment, he was refused three times and at least two Grab drivers cancelled on him before one finally decided to take him,” according to a press release from his office. A regular Uber user, Nograles said he eventually cancelled the Grab ride and took a taxi instead. He was still charged by Grab P318 for the ride he did not take. “This to me is a clear case of passenger refusal, which is considered a violation by the LTFRB. They’ve been talking tough about imposing severe punishments against taxi drivers who refuse passengers, but what about those who do the same through our ride-hailing applications? Mas high-tech lang sa Grab, pero di ba pareho lang na passenger refusal ‘yan (Grab is just more high-tech, but isn’t that also passenger refusal)?” said the lawmaker in the statement. Ride-sharing or ride-hailing apps, such as Grab and Uber, have been in the spotlight recently after the LTFRB cracked down on these companies, particularly because they allowed unregistered drivers to use their platforms. The LTFRB recently suspended Uber for a month because the company did not comply with the regulatory agency’s order to stop accrediting and accepting new drivers. Users of the apps have been complaining about the surge in Grab ride prices following the suspension of Uber. Although the two platforms have the same end-goal – connecting a driver to a potential rider – their mechanisms differ. On Uber, for instance, drivers only know the drop-off point after they agree to pick up the passenger. Meanwhile, Grab drivers are informed of a passenger’s destination even before they agree to the trip. Nograles criticized Grab for “overcharging,” which he said “has gone out of control after LTFRB decided to suspend Uber.” “There are times when Grab would charge as much as P800 just for a 20-kilometer ride because of the surge. This is already hold-up. This is no different from a taxi driver who would demand an extra on top of their meter fare. I don’t know if LTFRB even knows this is considered as overcharging,” he said. He called for an “auto-cap” for fare surges. The LTFRB in December 2016 ordered both Grab and Uber to lessen the multipliers for their surge price to twice the fare, excluding the base fare. This was partly in response to the costly surge prices during the holiday season. Nograles said he would bring up the incidences of high surge prices and passenger refusal when the House committee on transport begins tackling bills that would provide legal framework for Grab and Uber to operate in the country. Grab earlier promised to limit to its surge pricing following Uber’s suspension. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/179059-ltfrb-allow-uber-drivers-transfer-grab-uhop-during-suspension/","title":"LTFRB allows drivers to switch to Grab, U-Hop during Uber suspension","date":"Aug 17, 2017 4:25 PM PHT","snippet":"The affected drivers should present proof of Uber accreditation and proof of insurance coverage","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday, August 17, allowed Uber drivers to transfer to Grab and U-Hop while Uber remains suspended.

Since that is my only source of income, I immediately considered other livelihood options, because you cannot stop having income.) The decision came after the  transport network company (TNC) continued accrediting drivers into their system past July 26 despite LTFRB’s order against it. In an advisory, the LTFRB said it “strongly recommended” that Uber gives financial assistance to its peer-operators who would be affected since the latter “would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions” of Uber. (READ: Leader of TNVS drivers’ group: Uber at fault)  Monthly income  Barrientos started driving part-time for the ride-hailing service in early 2015. By the end of that year, he resigned from his full-time job and went full-time driving for Uber. He also serves as an administrator of one of the biggest Facebook groups catering to drivers for Transport Network Vehicle Companies (TNVCs) like Uber and Grab.  According to Barrientos, he earns at least P20,000 a month for driving Uber 4 times a week. He does not drive on weekends because he reserves them for his family.  A father of two, he allocates majority of his income to pay the P10,000 monthly downpayment for his car. The rest goes to their expenses at home.  “Hindi biro ‘yung araw-araw na gastos, kasama na ‘yung grocery, kuryente, tubig, ‘yung ibinabayad sa kotse buwan-buwan. Hindi biro mga ‘yun. Imposibleng hindi nag-panic mga Uber drivers up to some level. What if magtuloy-tuloy yan?” he said.  (The daily expenses – grocery, electricity, water, and car payments – they are not a joke. It’s impossible for Uber drivers not to panic to some extent. What if this [suspension] continues becomes permanent?)  On a regular day, Barrientos leaves their house at 5:30 am to bring his wife from Pasig to Pasay, where she works. Without taking a break, he would then drive for 8 to 9 hours straight.  Other Uber drivers have it worse, according to Barrientos.  He says Uber drivers who are under an operator and do not drive their own cars usually work longer hours to be able to pay their boundary and earn a decent income at the same time.  “’Yung iba doon, they drive 12 to 15 hours a day just to get a decent income. Ang pahinga nun, tulog lang at saka kain,” Barrientos said. (Some would drive 12 to 15 hours a day just to get a decent income. The rest of the day is for sleeping and eating) Commuters’ woes  Barrientos also raises his concern for commuters who depend highly on Uber.  “I had this one passenger, it was before dawan, female, she was by herself. Drunk. When she got in the car, she passed out. You can’t do that in a taxi or a jeep,” he said. Another time, a mother booked a ride for his grade schooler son on Uber. According to Barrientos, she just let him drive the small boy to his school.  What happens to commuters like them?  The Uber driver said that the TNVCs introduced an unprecendented trust between commuters and drivers.  “What’s the reason why riders use Uber? It’s the service that they are getting. They are getting their money’s worth and peace of mind brought by good service. No one will ask for additional fare. The car smells nice, it’s clean, and the air conditiioner works,” he explained. True to this statement, commuters immediately took to social media to express their anger and rally behind Uber drivers on Monday night.   According to commuters, the decision will cause unnecessary “hassle for commuters.” This was echoed by Senator Grace Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, calling the suspension “cruel and absurd.” She said she is set to call LTFRB officials for a meeting on Wednesday, August 16. Moving forward  Despite Uber’s suspension, Barrientos remains optimistic that the transport network will not allow the suspension to last for days.  “Nung una, ang unang pumasok sa isip ko ay hindi magtatagal yan. For sure, hindi papayag si Uber at magpa-file ng motion for reconsideration,” the Uber driver said. (I initially thought that the suspention will not last for long. For sure, Uber will fle a motino for reconsideration to overturn the decision)  In fact, around lunch time on Tuesday, August 15, Uber filed a motion for reconsideration and resumed its operations.  LTFRB, however, clarified that the order still stands, and that Uber drivers are still prohibited from plying the roads even though the ride-hailing company has filed a motion for reconsideration. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/178831-uber-suspension-stays-ltfrb-junks-appeal/","title":"Uber suspension stays as LTFRB junks appeal","date":"Aug 15, 2017 6:55 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Uber says it is 'disappointed' but will comply with the one-month suspension order","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Uber remains banned.

The move sparked online outrage on social media, as well as reactions from senators, who said the commuting public stood to suffer from the “cruel” suspension. With the LTFRB’s order, commuters using ride-hailing apps are now turning to Uber’s main competitor, Grab, whose operations continue despite also being tangled in the regulation issue with the LTFRB. (READ: What’s the fuss about the Grab, Uber regulation issue?) But why was Grab not suspended?  Grab’s accreditation expired last July and has not been renewed, but Grab has so far complied with the LTFRB’s orders to stop accepting and accrediting new drivers – the rule that Uber supposedly violated. Grab also immediately submitted to the LTFRB its masterlist of peer drivers when the government board wanted to set a June 30 cutoff for drivers whose permits would be considered. Uber dilly-dallied, on the the other hand.  Rappler takes a look back at previous orders the LTFRB issued, and how the two TNCs responded to the orders.   July 21, 2016 – Moratorium on processing new driver applications The LTFRB releases Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other TNCs. The order stops the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles. But Grab and Uber would later admit they continued to accept new drivers despite this order, citing strong passenger demand. “Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers… we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],” Grab country head Brian Cu would later say.     July 11, 2017, order For defying its order to stop accepting new drivers, the LTFRB imposes a fine of P5 million each on Uber and Grab. Both companies comply with the order.   The LTFRB also orders both companies to remove all drivers with expired or no permits. Grab stops activating new drivers only on July 17, while Uber stops on July 18.   July 26, 2017 order  The LTFRB orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered in their systems after June 30, 2017.  It also orders both companies to provide a master list of all their drivers as of June 30, 2017. At the time of the issuance of the order, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says they have only received Grab’s list. Uber communications head Cat Avelino says they will submit theirs on July 27.   August 1, 2017 show-cause order On August 1, the LTFRB issues a show-cause order to Uber, after it finds the TNC has continued to accept new drivers into its system despite being ordered to stop doing so last July 26. The board says Uber may lose its accreditation because of its action. Uber’s accreditation expires in August, while Grab’s expired last July 3 but hasn’t been renewed. Uber, however, denies the findings of the LTFRB, saying it has already suspended activations since July 19.    August 14, 2017 suspension order Nearly two weeks after it issued a show-cause order, the LTFRB suspends Uber’s operations for one month.  The board cites Uber’s post on its Twitter account last August 1, where the company said that applications for vehicles were “being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.” “The Respondent’s official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,” the LTFRB says. Uber posted a clarification on its Twitter account on August 2, saying it was also unable to accept applications for new vehicles. In its order, the LTFRB says Uber has accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27. The suspension order takes effect on Tuesday, August 15. Uber also releases a statement on its suspension of operations starting 6 am. (READ: Uber apologizes to LTFRB for ‘misunderstanding’) The order affects some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living.  Some 52,000 Grab vehicles remain operational. Since the suspension In the aftermath of the suspension, Uber requested that the penalty be changed to a fine. The LTFRB will hear Uber’s new request on August 23. On August 17, the LTFRB allowed Uber drivers to transfer to Grab and U-Hop for the meantime. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/178740-daily-news-highlights-august-15-2017-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, August 15, 2017","date":"Aug 15, 2017 9:17 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

The order will take effect on Tuesday, August 15, halting the operation of some 66,000 Uber drivers who ply the roads for a living. The LTFRB said Uber was ordered to stop accepting drivers into their system to avoid raising false expectations that these drivers can engage in the public transportation service without the necessary permits from the board. But in a post on its Twitter account last August 1, Uber said that applications for vehicles are “being accepted but not processed, as we are optimistic that with the ongoing discussions with the LTFRB, ridesharing has a path forward.” “The Respondent’s official statement as cited above is a clear admission on its part that it continued to accept applications despite the explicit order of the board,” the LTFRB said. The LTFRB also noted that Uber had accepted and activated at least 3 vehicles on July 27, one of which was a motor vehicle registered in the name of the board. While it acknowledged the concerns of the riding public, the board said it was confronted with the issue of striking a balance between innovation and laws governing public transport services. But the LTFRB said that Uber’s actions were “not about pushing innovation in the context of fair regulation, but it is about unduly challenging the limit of fair regulation to continue to engage in business in this country, thereby compromising sound business practices.” Aside from imposing the one-month suspension, the LTFRB warned that Uber will be held responsible for all accredited vehicles found accepting passengers during the suspension period. It also “strongly recommended” that Uber gives financial assistance to its peer-operators who would be affected since the latter “would not have suffered the current predicament were it not for the predatory actions of respondent Uber.” The order was signed by LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III and board members Ronaldo Corpus and Aileen Lourdes Lizada.  In a text message to Rappler, Uber communications head Cat Avelino said they are “studying” the order. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/177496-angkas-bikers-gather-donations-passenger-coma/","title":"Angkas bikers crowdsource donations for passenger’s medical bills","date":"Aug 10, 2017 4:40 PM PHT","snippet":"Bikers from the ride-hailing service Angkas raise at least P25,000 for the Angkas passenger who ended up in a coma after a road crash","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Around 200 motorcycle riders and passengers of ride-sharing app Angkas gathered at the Quirino Grandstand last July 30 for a shared purpose: to gather donations for passenger Alejandro Cajano who ended up in a coma after figuring in a crash.  Cajano was on his way to Makati on July 15 when the motorcycle he booked through Angkas figured in a vehicular crash. The incident left him in critical condition. His hospitalization bills are now estimated at over P1 million. (READ: Angkas passenger in coma after crash: Who’s liable?) While Angkas is also providing financial assistance, the ride-hailing service’s bikers themselves organized their own efforts. Sympathizing with Cajano and his family, Angkas bikers organized the meetup through a Facebook group chat. The group was able to gather P25,000 from those who attended as well as those who sent in their donations online.  This is not the first time the rider groups worked together to assist one of their own.  Luisito Castillo, an Angkas rider, says there are numerous group chats and Facebook groups for the motorcycle riding community which serve as a support system for fellow riders.  These group chats are always active, with daily updates on traffic-free routes as well as calls for rescue during emergency situations. Not just a community of riders The effort of Angkas bikers to help Cajano is just a glimpse of how tight-knit the biking community is. According to Jon Guarin, one of the leaders of Team Riders, their community is more a family than just a gathering of fellow riders. They constantly organize events and gatherings to strengthen their bond. Castillo shares that there is not even a month that there was no event for riders.  These events also include disaster response efforts, outreach activities for the homeless, fallen soldiers, and several other advocacies.  The community of riders recognizes the importance of strengthening their bond as they continue to face challenges on the road every day. According to the World Health Organization, 23% of the 1.25 million road crash related deaths every year involves motorcycles. Experiencing the same vulnerable environment makes understanding and supporting each other easier.  They also face other problems, such as a ban on motorcycle helmets imposed by some cities due to security issues. While this may ease local officials’ concerns on motorcycle-riding criminals, it can also leave riders vulnerable to injuries. “In order to slowly change the stereotype against us, we want to set a good example and let everyone know that we can do good things not only for our fellow riders but to anyone who needs help,” Castillo said in Filipino.  Driven by their similar passion to ride, they took it upon themselves to help each other as one community. Riders like Castillo and Guarin believe that their love for riding and the convenience it brings them are big factors why the biking community has a strong connection.  The internet and social media even made connecting with each other easier. One of the Facebook groups organized by the riders, named R.A.C.E.R. (Riders Anti-Crime & Emergency Response), has reached up to 57,000 members.  This simple Facebook group has become a daily safe space for them to ask and extend help especially during road crashes or crime-related emergencies. The group’s page is constantly filled with pictures, videos, and information that the riders encounter daily on the road.   Castillo said that he used to ride out before just to look for people to rescue. Now, it became easier to locate and help people through Facebook groups and chat groups.  During an emergency situation, a few riders need only to start a group chat, and within a few minutes, more members will join in, ready to help. “Kailangan lang po talaga na may magsimula para maipakita sa marami na pwedeng makatulong ang kahit sino. Yung maliit na pagtulong, pag pinagsama-sama ay lumalaki rin,” Castillo said.  (All it takes is just one member to initiate action, to show others that anyone can help. A small amount of help gathered together will eventually accumulate.) – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177848-weekly-video-highlights-july-30-august-5-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Videos you need to watch this week, July 30-August 5, 2017","date":"Aug 6, 2017 1:53 PM PHT","snippet":"Must-watch videos from this week","body":"Dear Rappler readers, It is the first week of August, and in the Philippines, the month began with the continuing woes in the Bureau of Customs.

DOTr Assistant Secretary for commuter affairs Elvira Medina raised the issue on Thursday, August 3, in a Senate public services committee hearing. “For the past weeks, the LTFRB had been bashed, they had been maligned. But my question is did any of the two, or any of these TNCs hire agencies using minions and all the other to bash the LTFRB?” Medina asked. However, she was not given the chance to continue her questioning, as Senate committee chair Grace Poe called her out. Poe said it is not wrong for either parties to hire public relations companies in a free market. “Ma’am I think we’re going off topic. I understand what you’re saying. Madaming trolls. Madaming fake news. (There are a lot of trolls. There’s a lot of fake news) That’s the free market. That’s the sad or happy reality. They will get their PR firm. No one’s stopping the LTFRB from getting their own advocates to speak out and that’s fine. No idea will last anyway if it’s untrue,” Poe said. The senator pointed out there must be a bulk of Filipinos who “enjoy” the convenience of TNCs and TNVs. “Obviously, there’s a following and there are people who are agreeing because they absolutely enjoy the service. Otherwise kung propaganda, sandali lang yan (if it’s propaganda, it won’t last). They can spend millions and it will not take off. For sure meron silang (they have) PR, lets just agree on that,” Poe said. Poe, also the public information committee chair, said she would not even try to regulate it. “No, I’m not going to regulate that. Pero yung fake news, pwede kayo maging liable diyan (but fake news, you can be held liable for that),” she said. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before Congress to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. Uber has called on the LTFRB to stop imposing ancient policies on today’s technological innovations. But taxi operators have denounced the seemingly undue advantage of Grab and Uber, saying taxis and TNCs are both engaged in the same business but the latter are not being regulated. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177568-uber-ltfrb-ancient-rules-technological-innovations/","title":"Uber to LTFRB: Don’t impose ancient rules on technological innovations","date":"Aug 3, 2017 1:25 PM PHT","snippet":"'What we are asking for is the right regulation and right process.

The focus should be on what we can limit for the TNCs, and how we can make taxi operators more competitive. They essentially offer the same service, let’s not fool each other here. It’s the same.)

Level playing field Bong Suntay, president of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA), slammed the seemingly special treatment being requested by Uber and Grab. Suntay said there should be a level playing field for TNCs and regular taxi operators. “We have always believed that the market is big enough for all of us to coexist [but] where fare competition can exist. We follow what is required of us,” he said. Suntay decried the undue advantage of Grab and Uber, saying they are all in the same business but TNCs operate without regulation. (READ: LTFRB ‘shocked’ that Uber, Grab have over 100,000 drivers) Passengers have mostly preferred riding Uber and Grab to taxis for safety and convenience. Taxi drivers have been criticized for asking higher fares or for arbitrarily declining passengers. (READ: Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB) But Suntay argued that cab drivers only earn little because government orders taxis to use meters. On the other hand, he said Grab and Uber rely on “dynamic pricing” for fares. Suntay also claimed that the Philippines has the lowest taxi fares in Asia. “May mga taxi driver nagpapadagdag. ‘Pag nagpahatid sa traffic, malulugi ang driver. This is the reason why may mga taxi driver na tumatanggi maghatid,” he added. (There are taxi drivers who ask for higher fares because if traffic is heavy, the driver would be on the losing end. This is the reason why there are taxi drivers who refuse to take some passengers.) Uber said it is open to having its vehicles apply for franchises but not the company itself, saying the latter is not involved in the actual ferrying of passengers. Grab likewise approves of getting franchises for TNVS. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/177473-uber-survives-ltfrb-hearing-more-time-defend-accreditation/","title":"Uber survives LTFRB hearing, gets more time to defend accreditation","date":"Aug 2, 2017 5:38 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber is off the hook for now","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In a show cause hearing on Wednesday, August 2, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) gave the transport network company (TNC) 5 more days to explain why they should retain their accreditation. This comes after Uber allegedly defied the agency’s July 26 order which states: “No further acceptance of additional accreditation of TNVS [Transport Network Vehicle Service providers] and/or activation of their accounts into the respondents’ respective systems shall be allowed effective immediately.” In their defense, Uber representative Joseph Castillo said they interpreted the order as still allowing them to accept new drivers without accrediting them. (READ: LTFRB orders Grab, Uber to deactivate drivers registered after June 30) Pointing to their order, LTFRB chairman Martin Delgra III said that accepting new drivers was also forbidden by the order. “The language of the order is very clear. We need to put a stop to the false expectations [of] the public that they can still get themselves accredited, and worse, get their account activated so they can run on the road as [TNVS],” Delgra said. LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada added that even accreditation can be done as they used the Uber website themselves to troubleshoot accreditation. Lizada said they were able to activate 3 accounts from July 31 to August 1. Uber asked if the LTFRB was able to book a ride through the dummy accounts, to which Lizada said they did not try. Lizada added it was enough evidence that it was indicated in the application that their accounts were “activated”. “What I find difficult to comprehend is that they can add vehicles into their accounts inside the confines of their room…I wonder how many operators are now putting vehicles in their respective accounts because this can be another way of vehicles circumventing [the LTFRB orders],” Lizada said. When asked by the LTFRB for their side, Castillo declined to comment, requesting to be briefed further about the dummy accounts first. Castillo said they have yet to check their system to determine how many applicants they have accepted since July 26. The hearing comes while the LTFRB is engaged in talks with Uber and other transport network giant Grab in regulating ride-hailing services. Delgra urged Uber to be “patient” until a resolution is reached. “On good faith, we created the technical working group to get equilibrium for supply and demand…we hope that Uber will be patient enough to wait, [to] be compliant.

During the House committee hearing on the registration and franchising or lack thereof of the two companies, Uber said it has more than 66,000 “partners who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Out of that number, only over 2,500 have either a provisional authority (PA) permit or a certificate of public convenience (CPC) franchise, which allows them to ply the streets of Metro Manila. Grab, meanwhile, has more than 52,000 vehicles accredited with only 3,000 to 4,000 of those vehicles possessing either PAs or CPCs from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “We are shocked, to say the least,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said, after the two companies stated the figures. Delgra said up until today, the number of vehicles registered under Grab and Uber had been unclear even to them. Grab and Uber, ride-hailing firms which provide an online platform for car owners and drivers to connect with passengers, has been at odds with the LTFRB as thousands of drivers operate without permits or with expired permits. Several lawmakers have filed bills before the House of Representatives to define, classify, and regulate companies like Grab and Uber. “Come to Congress, get your franchise, and don’t fight with LTFRB,” said AKO Bicol Representative Rodel Batocabe, author of a bill that would regulate TNCs. Batocabe lost his nephew to a car crash involving an Uber vehicle in Singapore last month. Lawmakers also quipped that it was no wonder traffic in Metro Manila has gotten worse, given the sheer number of TNC vehicles on the road.    Both Uber and Grab, however, clarified that not all of the vehicles registered in their networks ply Metro Manila at the same time. Some “partners” are registered with both companies. Not all drivers are full-time either, meaning they only drive their vehicles for a few hours a day at most. Bong Suntay of the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) said they are fine with operating alongside Uber and Grab so long as these ride-hailing services “are regulated just like [taxis].” “The requirements are almost the same. But the difference is in the compliance.

Here's a rundown of the ongoing controversy","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Over the past couple of days, Filipino commuters took to social media to express their anger and frustration over reports that the operations of Grab and Uber may be adversely affected following a government regulatory body’s crackdown on unregistered drivers using the ride-hailing platforms. The issue sparked fierce debate on both sides – with commuters saying Grab and Uber are essential to metro life and much more reliable than ordinary taxis, while the government insists that these need to be regulated to ensure accountability. What’s the issue about? Here’s a rundown of the ongoing controversy. Who are involved? Ride-hailing services Grab and Uber are considered Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), based on new transport categories created by the government back in May 2015.  Vehicles under Grab, Uber, and other similar ride-sharing services are considered part of the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS). The TNVS covers vehicles that provide pre-arranged transportation services for compensation. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) approved Grab and Uber as TNCs in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.  The TNCs are required to screen and accredit their drivers and register them with the LTFRB. The LTFRB, meanwhile, is in charge of issuing permits to TNVS drivers: the provisional authority (PA), or a temporary permit valid for 45 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise, which is valid for a year.  What’s the problem? On July 21, 2016, the LTFRB released Memorandum Circular 2016-008, which suspends the acceptance and processing of applications for Uber, Grab, and other ride-sharing services.  The order essentially stopped the release of temporary permits to Grab and Uber vehicles while the LTFRB further studied how to regulate the growing industry. On July 11, 2017 the LTFRB ordered Grab and Uber to pay a fine of P5 million each for letting drivers with no permits or expired permits to still operate on their platforms. Grab and Uber admitted that they accepted new drivers despite the LTFRB’s earlier order, citing strong passenger demand. Both companies said about 80% of their active drivers don’t have a PA or CPC franchise. But some Grab and Uber drivers say it’s not their fault they are considered “colorum.” They point to the LTFRB’s earlier order stopping the processing of TNVS applications. They also claimed that some 7,000 drivers who were already accredited did not get their PAs renewed last year. Because of this, many drivers had expired PAs by the end of 2016.  Aside from the hefty fine, the LTFRB also ordered Grab and Uber to clear out unregistered drivers by July 26 or face more fines.  But Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB later agreed not to apprehend unregistered TNVS until it decides on the appeal. While this came as a relief to Grab and Uber users and drivers, this decision did not sit well with operators of taxis, jeeps, and vans: they slammed what they called the LTFRB’s preferential treatment, saying they too should be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications.  What’s the LTFRB’s position? For the LTFRB, the problem began with Grab and Uber. LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III said the TNCs may have deliberately withheld telling their “partner drivers” to come to the LTFRB to get a franchise before operating. And despite public outrage on social media, the LTFRB said it’s standing firm on its position, saying the TNCs should explain to their peer operators why they were allowed to operate on the platform even without the proper permits. LTFRB spokesperson Aileen Lizada also said that Uber and Grab trips represent a “minority” in the total number of trips in Metro Manila – they account for only 2% of the 21.5 million trips per day recorded in 2015. But despite this, the LTFRB also acknowledged that the riding public will be harmed if it simply cancels the accreditation of the TNCs. Adding to the controversy were statements made by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, who said that the government should have a share from the income of Grab and Uber. The LTFRB later clarified that Tugade was referring to the unregistered vehicles.  Stoking more reactions was LTFRB’s admission that it lost the accreditation papers of Grab and Uber. The two companies’ accreditations are still pending renewal. Grab’s accreditation expired last July 3, and Uber’s is set to expire in August.    How did the public react? With the LTFRB’s crackdown on unregistered Uber and Grab vehicles, an estimated 15,000 drivers at most can remain on the road, out of the estimated 56,000 drivers. Both Grab and Uber are seeking the support of their users, launching online campaigns. On Twitter, the hashtag #WeWantGrabUber trended as commuters expressed their anger and frustration. Citing bad experiences with taxis, some netizens say Grab and Uber remain the safest way for them to commute. (READ: Cracking down on Uber and Grab will hurt commuters, not protect them)  Even the former LTFRB chief chimed in to say that the new government should listen to actual users of these ride-sharing services.   But some backed the government’s move, citing the need for accountability. During a House hearing, one lawmaker asked whether TNCs can be held accountable if a crash happens involving one of their vehicles.  Others also questioned the surge pricing system that they say needs to be further regulated.  Still, some questioned the very model of Uber and Grab. While its original idea was ride-sharing – those going a certain way can pick up co-passengers heading in the same direction – it quickly became a way to make profit, with some operating them similar to a taxi fleet. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab)  Because of this, some point to TNVS units as just an addition to traffic, a position the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief also takes. What’s next? As of Wednesday, July 26, the LTFRB ordered all Grab and Uber drivers who registered with the service after June 30, 2017 to be deactivated.   Grab stopped activating new drivers on July 17, while Uber stopped on July 18. The regulatory agency also said it’s considering setting minimum working hours for Grab and Uber drivers. The LTFRB is continuing meetings with the TNCs. The regulatory agency also plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/176882-thewrap-july-27-2017-midday-edition/","title":"Grab and Uber, Gorio, Trump | Midday wRap","date":"Jul 27, 2017 1:00 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the midday newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board orders Grab and Uber to deactivate drivers who registered with the ride-hailing companies after June 30. State weather bureau PAGASA says Tropical Storm Gorio has slowed down but maintained its strength. United States President Donald Trump announces that transgender people may not serve ‘in any capacity’ in the U.S. military.

In a press briefing, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the LTFRB qualifies transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers as “public service” so they should observe a minimum number of hours on the road – just like government workers – to fulfill that duty. “So if ever we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours na dapat online kayo. Kasi kung bibigyan kayo ng prangkisa, pero two hours a week lang kayo babiyahe, sayang. Bibigay na lang natin sa iba ‘yung prangkisa,” Lizada said. (So if we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours that they need to be online. Because if we will give franchises, but they will only work for two hours a week, it would be a waste. It would be better to give the franchise to other operators.) The board member said the measure will help regulate the drivers of TNVS operators, as there are currently 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers plying the roads. Imposing minimum working hours, Lizada said, would also respond to a recently-revealed practice of Grab and Uber drivers who only go on the road “when surge prices are high.” Currently, Grab classifies drivers as part-time if they stay on the roads below 40 hours a week, and full-time if they clock higher hours. Uber, for its part, classifies drivers as “casual drivers” if they operate below 10 hours, part-time if below 40, and full-time if above 40. The LTFRB bared the plan a day after its second technical working group meeting with Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 26. On Wednesday, the agency announced that it ordered the deactivation of drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017. Lizada said they hope to be done with the meetings by September 2017, and produce memorandum circulars to fix the regulation deadlock. After that, the LTFRB plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services. There are bills filed in both houses of Congress seeking to regulate TNVS providers. The transport network companies had earlier filed motions for reconsideration to delay the implementation of the LTFRB’s order issued last July 7, which instructed both TNCs to purge drivers without adequate documents. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176810-dotr-ltfrb-public-utility-vehicle-operators-step-up-grab-uber/","title":"Gov’t tells PUV operators: Step up because of Grab, Uber","date":"Jul 26, 2017 7:15 PM PHT","snippet":"The DOTr urges public utility vehicle operators to ensure good service, while the LTFRB says the popularity of ride-hailing firms should be taken as a 'wake-up call'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Public utility vehicle (PUV) operators need to step up because of the popularity of transport network companies (TNCs) Grab and Uber, said Transportation Undersecretary Thomas Orbos on Wednesday, July 26. “Kailangan nating ipakita rin sa ating kababayan na maganda rin ang ating serbisyo…’Yun po kasi ang nangyari diyan sa TNVS na ‘yan, naging simbolo siya [ng] tamang serbisyo, pero ang totoo po ang tamang serbisyo nasa inyong lahat po ‘yan eh, gagawin na lang po ‘yun,” said Orbos, also the general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). (PUVs need to show the public that they can also provide good service… What happened with the [transport network vehicle service] operators, they became the symbol of good service, but we all have the potential for good service, we just need to show it.) Orbos was addressing PUV transport groups in a consultation, telling them that their services can improve in simple ways. (READ: Taxi, jeep, van operators call out LTFRB for ‘unfair treatment’) He recommended that jeepney drivers keep their aisle lights on at night, and avoid wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts while working. For bus drivers, he said they should only pick up passengers from designated areas. “Napakaliit ho na bagay iyon pero kung naipatupad ninyo ‘yun makikita ng mamamayan kung ano ba talaga ang serbisyo na gusto ‘nyong ibigay sa kanila,” added Orbos. (They’re small gestures but if you can do them, people will see what service you want to give them.) Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Aileen Lizada seconded Orbos’ recommendation. Lizada told PUV operators that the public’s support for Grab and Uber should be taken as a “wake-up call,” especially because jeepneys, buses, and taxis serve the majority of the riding public. Taxi driver-operators, said Lizada, should know how to navigate, keep their cars presentable at all times, and agree to take passengers to wherever their destination is. “‘Yung mga gano’n dapat sabihan ‘nyo rin ‘yung ibang taxi drivers na ‘pag ginawa nila ‘yun (mistakes), apektado ang buong taxi denomination,” she added. (You should inform other taxi drivers, because if they [commit mistakes], the whole taxi denomination will be affected.) In line with their advice, Orbos urged the transport leaders to be open to the Department of Transportation’s PUV Modernization Program, which includes the phaseout of old vehicles and revision of transport routes. “Ito po ay pagkakataon na i-modernize (This is an opportunity to modernize your fleet)… Why don’t you take it upon yourselves?” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176782-grab-uber-riders-minority-ltfrb/","title":"Grab, Uber riders only a minority – LTFRB","date":"Jul 26, 2017 1:46 PM PHT","snippet":"'Sila lang ho 'yung maingay sa social media, [but] definitely government will not budge, we will not be allowed or influenced because of social media,' LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Grab and Uber riders constitute only a minority of the commuting public, but they’re just noisier on social media.

From bad drivers to overcrowded trains, the list of transportation woes doesn’t seem to end. Many say it’s a problem with policy: the government simply does not manage our transportation system well enough. But how can they, when our policy makers live in a bubble, travel in their posh cars, and are oblivious about the experiences of daily commuters? There have been calls to require our politicians to take public transportation, and some even did it as publicity stints. Now we know that would be hard request to make and many of you don’t have the time to take the jeep or ride the MRT. So we’ve decided to document our commute, in 360° photos, hoping that it would give you an idea on what it’s like to commute in Metro Manila. Manila traffic We are lucky enough to be able to take the afternoon to evening shift at work. This means that we are spared from the dreaded rush hour traffic. But roads are also congested in other times of the day; it simply is much heavier from 7-9 am and 5-7 pm. {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/64EiCF/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“64EiCF”></iframe> {/source} Traffic in Manila is unpredictable. Commuting is a game of chance. You can try to leave during non-rush hour windows, but that doesn’t mean you won’t get stuck in heavy traffic jams. Even at noon, we still experience heavy traffic going to the office. The estimated distance from our place in Manila to our office in Kapitolyo, Pasig is just 8 kilometers. During late nights to past midnight, we can go home from work in just around 20 minutes, but earlier in the day, travel time can take up to 2 1/2 hours due to traffic jams and bottlenecks. There are some days when we have to take the morning shift and travel to work during the busiest times of the day. The longest time that we’ve been on the road for work was around 3 hours on a UV Express – from 6:30 to 9:30 in the morning. That’s 3 long hours that we could have spent doing something productive. But instead, we were right there sitting inside a cramped FX, praying to any higher being to give us patience. Now imagine the working majority who have to get through this every single day, reliving this over and over again – as if metro traffic is a part of our own personal hell. Our daily commute to work We have 3 options when we take public transportation going to work. We can either 1) ride a jeepney, then a UV Express; 2) ride a tricycle, then a jeepney; or 3) ride a tricycle, take the LRT 2, take the MRT, then a jeepney. We know that some have to endure a more grueling daily commute than any of these but just to give an example, let us show you a quick comparison of our different commuting scenarios. OPTION 1: Jeepney + UV Express = P48 pesos We usually take the first option because it seems more convenient and more affordable compared to our other travel choices.  The jeepney ride from our home to Quiapo costs only P8 pesos, then the UV Express from Quiapo to Kapitolyo costs P40 pesos.  When we ride the UV Express from the terminal, we have to pay for a fixed fare – which means we have to pay for the van’s whole trip to Pasig’s center even if we’re already disembarking halfway there. But we still take it nonetheless, instead of hailing a ride mid-route, because it’s the only way we can be guaranteed a seat.   When you ride from the terminal, you will have to wait for the FX to be filled before it leaves. Take note: Most of the time, it won’t leave until every seat is filled. It doesn’t matter to the drivers if people come in different sizes. When they say the FX can take 10 people, 10 people have to find a way to fit inside, no matter how uncomfortable and cramped it is already. Heck, there have also been reports of drivers being rude against plus-size passengers for taking up more space. At the terminal, we almost always have to wait up to 40 minutes before we can leave. That’s when we either have to wait for the FX to be filled or endure long lines waiting for a vehicle during rush hour. But then, taking this route is still the more convenient option because after leaving the terminal, the FX can already go straight to our destination without having to take in passengers midway (this is also why hailing FXs outside terminals is hard). OPTION 2: Tricycle + Jeepney = P68 pesos On some days, when there are less UV Express vehicles available, we take the second option. A tricycle ride from home costs P50 pesos because for reasons we don’t know, they do not have a fare matrix and every ride is considered a special ride with a special fare. It’s even more expensive than our jeepney ride from Mendiola to Kapitolyo which is just Php18.  The jeepney’s cheaper fare is a tempting bargain but we still prefer taking the UV Express when possible because of the comfort. Both rides can be crowded and cramped, but at least you get closed windows and air conditioning in the latter (Metro Manila smog isn’t exactly something you’d want to breathe in).  Personal space? There’s no such thing when you commute, squeezed inside public utility vehicles (PUVs) like sardines in tin cans. (READ: ‘The 15 passengers you’ll meet on a Philippine jeepney‘ ) {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/QrJg5x/” frameborder=“0” width=’100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“QrJg5x”></iframe> {/source} When FX drivers say 10 people can fit inside, 10 people will fit inside. But when jeepney drivers say the jeepney can take 14, 16 will ride, with 2 of those (sometimes even 4) standing at the PUJ’s stirrup. OPTION 3: Tricycle + LRT 2 + MRT + Jeepney = P94 pesos Our third option when going to work involves more ride transfers as compared with the other two. We seldomly use this option mainly because we dread MRT rides especially during rush hour.  Gone were the days when train rides mean convenience, efficiency, and better alternative to other existing modes of public transportation. Every day, commuters complain about overcrowded trains and stations.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/Gzvnz3/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“Gzvnz3”></iframe> {/source} The trains are faster, yes, but the long lines during rush hour will delay your travel also. Every now and then, you’d also see commuters venting their anger against other commuters. When you’re tired from work and forced to squeeze yourself in an overcrowded train, it’s easy to lose your temper. (READ: ‘The MRT Survival Guide‘ ) There are also the occasional delays brought about by the train breaking down. Whenever the trains malfunction, you can already be assured that there’d be traffic everywhere, with commuters having to take alternative modes of transportation. Safety Safety is an issue when commuting too. Commuters like us already know better than to bring out our phones and gadgets inside PUVs or put valuables and wallets inside our pockets. Many Manila commuters have experienced crimes, like ‘holdups’ and pickpocketing. In fact, we were careful ourselves about bringing out our camera to take photos for this story. Bad driving is also a safety problem. Many PUV drivers overspeed and swerve all over the road like daredevils, never mind that it’s making their passengers scared and uncomfortable.  {source} <script src=“https://360player.io/static/dist/scripts/embed.js” async></script><iframe src=“https://360player.io/p/TAoZn2/” frameborder=“0” width=‘100%’ height=400 allowfullscreen data-token=“TAoZn2”></iframe> {/source} Comparing costs All 3 commuting scenarios are still significantly cheaper than taking a cab or any of the ride-hailing and ride-sharing services available. Taking the public transportation going to work will cost us less than P100 pesos, a faily reasonable price since we are living in one city and working in another. Without any surge in pricing (which is rare), a GrabCar ride to work costs around P200 pesos. For Uber, it can go as high as P250 pesos. Taking the more affordable alternative, a GrabShare or UberPool ride can cost us around P140 to P150 pesos. During peak hours, travel costs can skyrocket to around P350 to P500 pesos.  Seeing these huge differences in prices, one would think that taking the public transportation is automatically the better option. But then aside from safety and convenience, time is definitely of huge value. People who are conscious about the value of their time may veer toward spending more on Uber or Grab rides if it means shorter travel time. But then again, convenient as they are, ride-hailing services are not really an option for many commuters who can only hope and wait for the government to solve their transportation woes. It’s already 2017 and the Philippines need a better transportation system, and we need it fast. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/175187-iloilo-city-road-safety-problems-enforcement/","title":"With nearly 5,000 crash incidents, how do we make Iloilo roads safer?","date":"Jul 21, 2017 9:52 PM PHT","snippet":"The province of Iloilo, home to 1.81 million people, records nearly 5,000 road crash incidents in the first half of 2017","body":"  ILOILO CITY, Philippines – The bike ride to Molo Plaza was only two kilometers away, but traveling that distance turned out to be a longer, two-month road to recovery for biker Wilfredo Sy Jr. Sy, an architect by profession and an avid cyclist, recalled the crash incident that happened as he was on a nighttime biking tour in May 2016. As he was about to cross Diversion Road, one of Iloilo City’s major highways, Sy saw a car signaling a left turn. Thinking it was safe to cross, Sy crossed the road – and next thing he knew, he found himself looking up at the stars. “I fell onto the windshield, I rolled down onto the hood, down to the ground. The bike I was riding had twisted,” Sy narrated. Fortunately for him, the crash was not serious enough to leave him with major injuries. His X-ray results showed that his neck had straightened out a little, and the incident left him limping for two months. But Sy admits that he nearly had a close call. “I wasn’t even planning on wearing my helmet, but eventually I decided to wear one since everyone else in my group was wearing a helmet,” he said. Since the crash, Sy said he had become more cautious when setting out on his weekly bike rides around the city hailed as one of the most walk-friendly and bike-friendly places in the Philippines.  With a 5-kilometer stretch of bicycle and pedestrian lane along one of its major highways, Iloilo City has made a name for itself in providing alternative mobility infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. Despite these provisions for some of the most vulnerable road users, this bustling hub in Western Visayas has also racked up a number of road crashes. According to 2014 data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, 733 people died from road crash incidents in Region VI. If population is taken into account, Western Visayas is the most affected region in the island of Visayas in terms of road crash deaths. (READ: IN NUMBERS: Road crash incidents in the Philippines) Nearly 5,000 crashes The province of Iloilo, home to 1.81 million people, recorded 4,877 road crash incidents in the first half of the year, according to data from the Iloilo Provincial Police Office (IPPO) and the Iloilo City Police Office – Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Unit (ICPO-TIEU). Data from the IPPO showed there were 1,871 road crash incidents from January to July 3, 2017 in the cities and municipalities of the province, excluding Iloilo City. The bulk of these incidents – 949 cases – resulted in physical injury, while 857 cases resulted in damage to property and 65 were homicide. The hotspots in the region include the town of Pavia and the roads around Iloilo City and the Iloilo International Airport, particularly on Diversion Road. The town of Pavia covers around 7 kilometers of the national highway, and around 40,000 people travel through the town daily, according to a study of the Department of Public Works and Highways. {source} <style> @media (min-width: 992px) { .blob-full-2 { width: 183% } } </style> <div class=”blob-full-2 blob-full”> <style type=”text/css”> #map { height: 540px; } </style> <div id=”map”></div> <script> var map, heatmap; var points = []; var script = document.createElement(‘script’); script.src = ‘http://assets.rappler.com/2/versions/doc/B9E7E888708549DDA7C2413418B569F2/1/road-safety-iloilo.js’; document.getElementsByTagName(‘head’)[0].appendChild(script); map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(‘map’), { zoom: 9, center: new google.maps.LatLng(11.10, 122.55), mapTypeId: ‘roadmap’, streetViewControl: false, zoomControlOptions: { position: google.maps.ControlPosition.LEFT_BOTTOM }, }); $(“.blob-full-2”).each(function(index) { console.log(index); $(this).attr(‘id’,’mmhide-‘+index); var inView = new Waypoint.Inview({ element: $(‘#mmhide-‘+index)[0], enter: function(direction) { $(‘#sidebar-others’).css(‘opacity’,0); console.log(‘Enter triggered with direction ‘ + direction) }, exited: function(direction) { $(‘#sidebar-others’).css(‘opacity’,1); console.log(‘Exit triggered with direction ‘ + direction) }, }) }); function eqfeed_callback(results) { for (var i = 0; i < results.features.length; i++) { var coords = results.features[i].geometry.coordinates; var latLng = new google.maps.LatLng(coords[1],coords[0]); points.push(latLng); } setTimeout(loadHeat(), 10000); function loadHeat() { heatmap = new google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer({ data: points, map: map, radius: 7, maxIntensity: 2 }); } } </script> <script src=”https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyAQsVMvdSeu6Sl6AFaTgpEXJet6Q4rOxVQ&libraries=visualization”></script> </div> {/source}   Meanwhile, there were 3,006 road crash incidents in Iloilo City alone from January to June 2017, according to data from the ICPO-TIEU. Nearly 85% of these cases – 2,540 incidents – resulted in damage to property, while 457 incidents resulted in physical injuries and 9 were homicide cases. Human error remains the top cause of road crashes. Based on ICPO’s records, there were 2,529 road crash incidents in the 6 districts of the city that were caused by driver error. “Driver error” covers those who are caught making reckless turns while driving, or those who fall asleep behind the wheel, among others. Driving under the influence of alcohol is the second top cause of road crashes, with 158 incidents recorded. Among Iloilo City’s districts, the district of Jaro – the largest in the city, covering 42 barangays – recorded the most number of road crashes with 769 incidents, followed by City Proper with 740 incidents.  Of the road crash incidents recorded in the city, 2,308 incidents involved vehicles hitting other vehicles, while 449 cases involved vehicles hitting persons.  A problem of enforcement and education  The task of preventing vehicular crashes in Iloilo is a shared responsibility between road users and local government officials. In Iloilo City, the ICPO and the Transportation Management and Traffic Regulation Office (TMTRO) are in charge of enforcing road rules and regulations. On the region’s highways, it’s the job of the Philippine National Police – Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG).  Jun Batillo of the PNP-HPG emphasizes 3E’s in road safety: engineering, or the design of roads; enforcement of road rules and regulations; and education, or spreading awareness on road safety. But of these, Batillo believes education and enforcement are the two most important factors. Many of the car and motorcycle drivers the PNP-HPG apprehends, he said, either do not have drivers’ licenses or are using student permits, thinking that they are valid driving licenses. This misinformation poses a risk to other motorists, since those who drive without the proper licenses presumably do not know the rules on the road. “Education should start in the issuance of the license. Drivers should have proper training, they should be properly educated that a student permit is not a driver’s license. It’s just a permit to drive while learning to drive,” Batillo said in Filipino. Enforcing speed limits Batillo also echoed the ICPO data on what causes most of these road crashes: human error. But when asked if speeding was also a major concern, he said that it was not as serious a problem as in other places. Roads in Iloilo City, he explained, don’t go on for long enough stretches that would allow a motorist to speed. Yet the city had recently begun – and later suspended – a much publicized crackdown on overspeeding. Two years after a local ordinance was passed prescribing speed limits in Iloilo City’s roads, it was finally implemented in June this year. The ordinance set a maximum of 60 km/hr on major roads and highways while the minimum speed limit is set at 20 km/h for other roads. Some questioned this policy, however, pointing out the lack of road signs indicating the new speed limits, as well as the lack of traffic enforcers to implement the ordinance at night. Add to this the problem of verifying whether motorists had really gone over the speed limit. While the city has speed guns, the PNP-HPG does not have any at all. Despite this, Batillo gave assurances that the highway police is doing all it can to keep roads safer. “We don’t want people to think that we can’t do our jobs because we lack equipment…we’re doing all we can to enforce road rules,” he said. The ordinance has since been suspended pending amendments, after proposals to adjust the prescribed speed limits on certain roads.

They appealed to the LTFRB to lift its July 21, 2016, order, which bars TNVS applicants from getting provisional authority permits (PAs) from the agency. Without PAs, new drivers waiting for the processing of their TNVS franchises cannot ply the roads. Citing “public demand,” however, Grab and Uber continued to accept new drivers and let them ply the metro’s roads even with expired or without PAs.  Of 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers, 26,600 have expired or no permits. The LTFRB issued a July 11, 2017, order, slapping both transport network companies (TNCs) a P5-million fine each, and marked July 26 – Wednesday next week – as the start of apprehension of drivers without proper documents. Grab and Uber put the apprehension day on hold as they filed motions for reconsideration of the July 11 order. However, the order which put the PA moratorium remained in effect. In their defense, the drivers accredited only by TNCs and not by LTFRB said they also underwent screening in obtaining their accreditation. “After undergoing stringent screening, training, and drug tests, we received our accreditation from our [TNCs]…. Even though many in our ranks do not yet have a PA, it is hard to consider us as fly-by-night ‘colorum’ drivers. Remember we underwent screening, training, NBI clearance, and drug tests,” their statement said. Receiving their petition, DOTr Undersecretary for Roads Thomas Orbos said he cannot assure them anything but their “best effort” to resolve the regulation deadlock. He said he will push for their inclusion in the upcoming technical working group talks, where so far only the LTFRB, Grab, and Uber representatives are included. “I will take it up with the LTFRB. They (drivers) are stakeholders. So, definitely. I am not saying anything, that’s a decision that [the LTFRB needs] to make, but definitely they need to be heard,” Orbos said. The group initially gathered signatures manually but later put the petition online where it got overwhelming support from users of the ride-hailing applications. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/video/176226-thewrap-july-20-2017-evening-edition/","title":"Grab and Uber, SALN, Calida | Evening wRap","date":"Jul 20, 2017 8:36 PM PHT","snippet":"Watch the evening newscast with Mara Cepeda","body":"Today on Rappler: Undocumented Grab and Uber drivers can stay on the road until the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board decides on the appeal filed by the two ride-hailing companies. Public Works Secretary Mark Villar is the richest member of President Rodrigo Duterte’s Cabinet with a net worth of P1.4 billion. Solicitor General Jose Calida says he will set in motion the re-arrest of National Democratic Front consultants who were temporarily released from detention to participate in the peace talks. Malacañang urges American lawmakers to consider ‘all sides’ of the Duterte administration’s war on drugs on the same day the United States Congress is set to hold a public hearing on the issue. United States President Donald Trump’s eldest son and his former campaign manager will testify before Congress next week as part of investigations into the Trump team’s alleged contacts with Russia.  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176218-clarification-tugade-grab-uber-income-share-taxes/","title":"LTFRB clarifies: Tugade wants share in Grab, Uber taxes","date":"Jul 20, 2017 8:25 PM PHT","snippet":"LTFRB chief Martin Delgra III points out: If some 26,600 Grab and Uber drivers are not registered, then how can government go after them for taxes?","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) chief Martin Delgra III clarified Thursday, July 20, what Transport Secretary Arthur Tugade meant when he said the government should have a share in the income of Grab and Uber drivers. Delgra said his boss was referring to “colorum” drivers – or those operating without permits from government – when he said he wanted the government to get a share in the earnings of the ride-hailing drivers. On Wednesday, Tugade said in a press briefing in Malacañang: “Kailangan diyan may share din diyan ‘yung gobyerno, ‘yung kinikita doon. Kung kailangan may mekanismo at tsaka pamamaraan niyan na ‘yung plete na binabayaran o ‘yung kita na inaambag, eh ibahagi ‘nyo naman sa gobyerno.” (The government should have a share in their earnings. If needed, there should be a mechanism and a way that the government gets a share in the fares what [the drivers] get or what the share they contribute [to Grab and Uber]. You should give the government a share.) The secretary’s statement was met with online rage from regular Grab and Uber riders. “Ang punto ni Secretary Tugade at ng LTFRB, kapag colorum ang isang sasakyan, walang habol d’yan ang gobyerno. Paano mo masisingil ng tamang tax kung hindi nga sila rehistrado?” Delgra said in a press statement on Thursday. (The point of Secretary Tugade and the LTFRB is, if a vehicle is “colorum,” then the government go after them. How can you charge taxes if they are not registered?) “Like any business, TNCs and their partners are covered by laws of taxation and they must give what’s due to the government,” Delgra added. However, the LTFRB cannot collect taxes anytime soon. Their hands are tied since they had given Grab and Uber until July 26 before apprehending some 26,600 colorum drivers, whose numbers have increased since 2016. Delaying the apprehension further, the transport network companies both filed motions for reconsideration against the LTFRB’s order. According to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, they hold another meeting with Grab and Uber on July 26 to discuss how to solve the regulation deadlock. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176155-taxi-jeep-van-operators-ltfrb-unfair-treatment/","title":"Taxi, jeep, van operators call out LTFRB for ‘unfair treatment’","date":"Jul 20, 2017 3:34 PM PHT","snippet":"Public transportation groups say their members should also be spared from apprehension while waiting for the approval of their franchise applications","body":" MANILA, Philippines—”Kung puwede sa kanila, bakit ‘di puwede sa amin (If they are allowed, why not us too)?” This is the question of public utility vehicle (PUV) groups to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) after it put off the apprehension of undocumented Grab and Uber drivers until it decides on appeals filed by the transportation network companies before the office. The apprehensions were supposed to start when the LTFRB order against Grab and Uber drivers without permits takes effect on July 26. “Ang treatment dapat ay pareho. Kung papayagan nila na ang Grab and Uber na bumiyahe na walang prangkisa, dapat ‘yung iba din, provided na merong request,” said Jun Magno, president of the Stop and Go coalition. (The treatment should be the same. If they allow Grab and Uber to go on trips without a franchise, others should be allowed to, provided that they have pending requests.) He also said that while some commuters prefer Uber and Grab because of the reliability of their services, this should not allow the companies to flout the law. “‘Wag ‘nyo sabihing reliable. Hindi naman ibig sabihin porke reliable ka lalampasan mo ang batas. (Don’t cite reliability. Just because you’re reliable doesn’t mean that you can go beyond the law),” Magno said. The Philippine National Taxicab Operators Association (PNTOA)  tagged the LTFRB’s move as an “accommodation” of the popular transportation network companies (TNCs). “Obviously, Grab and Uber’s was a blatant violation of accountability…Sa akin nga what if ‘yung blatant violation, what if kami bigla na lang naglabas without a franchise?(On my part, what if there is a blatant violation, what if we were to also send out [vehicles] without a franchise)?” said PNTOA president Bong Suntay. Question of fairness Suntay also called out the LTFRB for setting up a one-stop shop for transport network vehicle services (TNVS) or ride-hailing service providers even though they also have applications that have been pending “for years.” According to Suntay and Magno, the TNCs can easily “circumvent the law” because they are online.  For them, the TNCs need to limit their volume of drivers and give them a route measure capacity (RMC) which sets a maximum number of operators. (READ: Taxis beware: Gov’t introduces 4 new transport categories) The LTFRB has been consulting the TNCs on this, but has had a hard time as there are “dual citizens” that serve both Grab and Uber. The LTFRB had also received reports that TNVS operators sell or transfer franchises, birthing new names that remain unregistered. The transport group chiefs also urged the LTFRB to further police pricing as so far, Grab and Uber have their own software to compute each fare. LTFRB has regulated this by putting a cap on the surge pricing, but Suntay and Magno said they also want a transparent price computation the same way as taxis use meters, or jeepneys add a peso for every additional kilometer. The groups’ call for a government clampdown on the TNCs was strongly criticized by netizens who slammed poor public transportation services. A trend on Twitter called out government inaction for allowing the TNCs’ application documents to pile up, and criticized the safety and reliability of PUV operators with commute horror stories. An online petition also gained ground, garnering 100,000 supporters backing Grab and Uber drivers, and calling on the LTFRB to lift its moratorium in accepting new TNVS applicants. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/176158-uhop-launch-new-service-taxi-car/","title":"U-Hop launches new services","date":"Jul 20, 2017 2:39 PM PHT","snippet":"The homegrown ride-hailing app goes beyond shuttle services, as it introduces pre-arranged taxi, private car, and social carpooling rides","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Homegrown ride-hailing app U-Hop launched its services in major cities nationwide, enticing partners with its “no commission fee” for the first 3 months.

This comes after Grab and Uber on Thursday, July 20, filed separate motions for reconsideration (MR) with the LTFRB on its July 11 order that directed the TNCs to purge themselves of drivers with expired or no permits by July 26. The order was to take effect on July 26. Without the MR, undocumented Grab and Uber drivers may be fined as high as P120,000 and detained for as long as 3 months starting July 26.

With the growing popularity of innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), it can certainly feel that way. But Accenture Philippines’ Digital Lead JP Palpallatoc is confident we’re leaving this mindset behind. During his talk about digital trends for this year’s #ThinkPH Summit at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City, he said: “We’re learning to take control of technology. The future will be shaped by people.” JP presented key insights from Accenture’s annual study called Tech Vision. This year, it was conducted among 5,400 business and tech leaders in different industries. Learn how technology will change lives in new ways with Accenture’s forecast for 2017 below. AI is the new UI “AI is permeating every user interface. If we do it right, technology disappears and becomes very natural,” said JP. There’s more to it than self-operating robots. Its integration into our usual digital tools is executed so seamlessly, we’re probably not even aware that some functions are made possible by it. Love Spotify? The personalized playlists the app prepares for each user is run by AI. It learns from human input and banks on this for future recommendations or features. “Humans and machine working together, that’s what we need to develop,” added JP. Ecosystem Power Plays Each company has their own niche of target markets or ecosystems. By building strategic partnerships with players from other industries, businesses can widen their reach. “The key decision a company needs to make is which partners or alliances they need to play with, which particular platform they want to use,” said JP. A perfect partnership should be mutualistic. Aside from creating new markets or improving logistics, these collaborations offer consumers new products to complement the services the other platform provides. Workforce Marketplace The workforce structure is getting a makeover. Old, rigid hierarchies are making way for an expanding talent pool. It allows room for organizational flexibility. “The workforce marketplace is about the rise of external talent platforms, the rise of gigsters,” said JP. And it’s already happening. It’s common for local companies, even the big ones, to outsource talents, using freelancing and crowdsourcing platforms such as raket.ph. A liquid workforce delivers speedier, cost-effective services without compromising quality. But more than that, it transforms company-employee relations, allowing creative and personal growth. Design for Humans To effectively interact with customers and provide them solutions, companies must possess an in-depth understanding of their needs and preferences. “Companies will be using human behavior behavioral science in implementing customer experience,” said JP. A customer’s relationship with a company is largely built on the effectiveness of the online experience they offer. This is why an understanding of human behavior is crucial when designing applications. “We’re generating a lot of personal information and data. By combining human centric design and data, we are now creating a hyper-personalized experience,” said JP. The Uncharted The digital evolution comes with new tools and services. It even creates new industries. But since this is completely uncharted territory, there are no rules. “Some of the government regulation and rules are not able to catch up with digital disruption. It’s the responsibility of digital pioneers to make and define the rules of the game,” said JP. Grab and Uber, for example, are new modes of transportation. Do these ride-hailing apps need to comply completely with existing regulations? It’s up for debate. A more advanced digital era is definitely in the future, but it’s not the robot-dominated world some imagine it to be. Making it human-centric and establishing rules will ensure that it creates solutions, not problems.

Senator Grace Poe and Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, as well as brothers Davao City 1st District Representative Karlo Nograles and Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Representative Jericho Nograles filed 3 separate measures on Wednesday, July 19. This was after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered TNCs like Uber and Grab to purge their register of undocumented drivers by July 26, or these “colorum” drivers would be apprehended. (READ: Grab, Uber to keep drivers on the road until LTFRB clarifies order) The LTFRB order would result to TNCs stopping the operations of 80% of their drivers, enraging Uber and Grab’s regular customers. (READ: Let us go beyond #WeWantUberGrab) “This is a classic case of a clash between what is good and what is legal. Obviously, a lot of people patronize Uber and Grab because of our horrible public transport system, but at the same time the LTFRB must exercise its mandate to ensure that all public conveyances should possess a franchise to operate. This issue would be addressed by our proposed law on TNCs,” said Karlo Nograles.  Poe and the Nograles brothers filed similar bills, which would require transportation network companies and drivers (TNDs) to “exercise diligence” in ensuring their drivers would comply with all requirements and obligations set by the government. Among the requirements to be able to operate a TNC specified under the measures are as follows:  The bills would also require Uber and Grab to strictly adopt a zero-tolerance policy on the use of drugs and alcohol of its drivers. TNCs would not be allowed to exceed the car manufacturer’s designed seating capacity for their cars. All vehicles must not be more than 10 years old and should comply with vehicle emission standards.  Meanwhile, Senator Joel Villanueva also filed Senate Resolution Number 431, calling for a probe into the process LTFRB employs in granting franchises to TNCs.  “We want to hear all the stakeholders to come up with the best solution to immediately address this problem. At the end of the day, we hope there will be a fair compromise between the government and the [TNC] providers, with the end goal of providing more covenient options to our daily commuters,” said Villanueva.  Villanueva said fellow senators Juan Edgardo Angara, JV Ejercito, Sherwin Gatchalian, and Juan Miguel Zubiri have expressed support for the investigation he is seeking. – with reports from Camille Elemia/Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176031-daily-news-highlights-july-19-2017-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, July 19, 2017","date":"Jul 19, 2017 10:50 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

He said they encountered “vociferous objections” from taxi operators back then, prompting them to issue memorandum circulars to regulate the TNVS.

But impending government regulations are about to make it downright painful. Starting July 26, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will apprehend and fine Uber and Grab drivers, and impound their cars, if found lacking the necessary permits. Before this, LTFRB fined Uber and Grab P5 million each for allowing such illegal or “colorum” vehicles to ply the streets. The LTFRB maintains that this crackdown is meant to protect commuters. One official said, “Paramount to LTFRB is the demand and the need [of the] riding public.” But will this crackdown really help commuters? In this article we argue that, given the significant value of ride-hailing services to Filipino commuters, this crackdown will invariably hurt the riding public, not protect them. Consumer value  Just how valuable have Uber and Grab become for Filipino commuters? In the US, a famous study found that UberX generated about $6.8 billion worth of “consumer surplus” in 2015 alone. That is, each dollar spent on UberX generated $1.60 worth of extra welfare for consumers—a hefty 60% return. Consumer surplus is difficult to measure, and to our knowledge no similar study in the Philippines yet exists (we are open to collaborate with Uber or Grab on this). However, one need only imagine our lives before Uber and Grab came along. Filipinos are tired of dealing with rude and crooked taxi drivers who refuse passengers based on their destinations, use rigged meters, charge arbitrary fares, and – for some reason – are always out of change. Uber and Grab allowed us to escape that horrible era. And based on commuters’ recent protests online, they’re not having more of it again. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmario.limos%2Fposts%2F10155541327053147&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”626″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} A crackdown will hurt commuters While Uber and Grab are a big win for commuters, they are a big loss for owners of regular taxis. With diminishing ridership and eroding profits, it comes as no surprise that regular taxi owners worldwide are intensely lobbying for government protection against ride-hailing. At the very least, regular taxi owners ask for a level playing field: that ride-hailing services be subjected to the same regulations as regular taxis. On the other extreme, some taxi owners call for a near or total prohibition of ride-hailing. Such a crackdown could indeed work in their favor: With prohibitive quotas on Uber and Grab vehicles, commuters will have no choice but to resort to regular taxis once more, thus increasing their market share and profits. Remaining Uber and Grab patrons will necessarily face higher prices and longer waiting times. By far, the biggest loss would come from the Uber and Grab rides that commuters can no longer hail. LTFRB’s crackdown next week promises to do just this. Around 80% of all ride-hailing vehicles are considered “colorum” by LTFRB, and cracking down on them could effectively cripple Uber and Grab’s operations. This move might raise the profits of a handful of taxi operators, but at what cost? The daily welfare of hundreds of thousands of Filipino commuters. “Colorum” not by choice Even more troubling is that many Uber and Grab drivers seem to have no choice but to be branded as “colorum.” For a year now, the LTFRB has stopped accepting and processing applications for Uber, Grab, and Uhop. In the process, 7,000 accredited drivers were denied renewal of their temporary permits, and as of January around 15,000 franchise applications have been denied. Hence, it appears that Uber and Grab drivers’ “colorum” status is not from a lack of effort to comply with LTFRB’s rules, but rather from LTFRB’s failure to act on these applications. To make matters worse, the LTFRB even threatened to discontinue Uber and Grab’s accreditations altogether if they “continue to defy the order.” One might ask: what is licensing good for, anyway, when “licensed” has come to mean rude and devious taxi drivers, and “colorum” is associated with courteous and honest Uber and Grab drivers? The term “colorum” should also be understood beyond its purely legalistic or regulatory sense: economically, it is a manifestation of an excess demand for rides. Quotas prevent the occurrence of mutually beneficial trades, so they will always incentivize “colorum” activities to make supply meet demand – irrespective of what the law says. Moreover, “colorum” was coined at a time when no technology was available to monitor vehicles and reward good customer service in real time. But with Uber and Grab, commuters can use their mobile apps to identify drivers, trace their routes, and rate their rides. Any errant driver can be easily made accountable, and drivers themselves can rate their passengers! Creative destruction Regulators also worry that Uber and Grab’s fast growth could worsen traffic congestion in the metro. But insofar as such vehicles are substitutes to taxis of the old, the growing fleets of Uber and Grab should pose no problem if we let old modes of transportation exit the roads. Indeed, every episode of rapid technological change brings with it some amount of unemployment, and is usually met by fierce opposition. In the same way that the horse-drawn carriage gave way to the automobile, the telegraph yielded to the telephone, and printed encyclopedias succumbed to the internet – the taxi industry is now reeling from the “creative destruction” brought forth by ride-hailing. But in the face of irreversible technological change, the best response is to embrace the new technology and assist those who lose their jobs in the process – not to shun or ban the new technology altogether.   Of course, this transition will require moving displaced people to alternative occupations. But in the case of taxi drivers, this need not be too difficult: with minimal training, for example, they can easily apply and work as drivers of ride-hailing services. Uber and Grab users, unite! What the majority of Filipinos need and deserve is an efficient, reliable, and safe mass transport system of trains and buses. But for a sizable segment of the riding public, Uber and Grab have provided a new, innovative, and viable option to move around the metro. Rather than just mere passing fads, ride-hailing services are here to stay. That is why a policy that prohibits 80% of ride-hailing vehicles will needlessly take away the level of convenience and dependability that commuters have come to love – and regular taxis routinely fail to provide. In a rare display of unity, commuters are protesting LTFRB’s impending crackdown in social media. An online petition to lift LTFRB’s suspension on new permit applications has already garnered 96,000 signatures, and counting. The LTFRB says they will “not succumb to pressure.” But this raises the question: whose interests are they really protecting? The advent of new technologies may catch regulators off guard. But this is hardly an excuse for them to add to the country’s roster of stupid and ridiculous policies – we already have enough of them to go around with. – Rappler.com JC Punongbayan (@jcpunongbayan) is a PhD student at the UP School of Economics.

Classified as Transport Network Companies (TNCs), Grab and Uber admitted that they allowed some Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) drivers to operate even if they do not have permits. “It appears that the TNCs are not without fault for having these TNVS [drivers] operating illegally,” LTFRB Chairman Martin Delgra III said.”We need to be mindful of our responsibilities not only as TNVS [drivers] but also as TNCs.” LTFRB gives two kinds of permits to TNVS drivers – the provisional authority (PA) permit valid for 45 to 135 days, and the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) franchise which is valid for 1 to 7 years. According to the LTFRB, of the 10,054 names of active drivers that Uber submitted, they found that the PA of 5,850 were dismissed while 3,505 are still in the process of applying. This leaves less than 2,000 as having complete permits. Grab has not submitted its list. According to TNVS drivers themselves, the number of “colorum” drivers spiked in the last year mainly because of LTFRB Memorandum Circular (MC) 2016-008 which suspended the issuance of new PAs beginning July 21, 2016. (READ: Grab, Uber drivers ask LTFRB to lift ban on new driver applications) In addition to negligence, the LTFRB also took into account the TNCs’ violation of LTFRB MC 2015-016, which mandates the following: ‘Strong passenger demand’ {source}<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZ_tcPxYSxo” frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen></iframe>{/source}   Grab country head Brian Cu admitted in the hearing that they accepted new drivers despite the earlier order of the LTFRB. “Admittedly, we accepted because if we stopped accepting we might as well have closed down the business. New drivers come in and fall out if we do not replace the drivers… we would lose drivers and not be able to serve our [customers],” Cu said. When asked by Delgra whether the move was for “marketing reasons” so that competition would not get their clients, representatives from Uber agreed. In their defense, Grab and Uber invoked passengers’ needs. “In all honesty everyone we accepted since July are still ‘colorum.’ They remain on the road. Because there is [a] demand that is needed to be met, we let them,” Cu said. Delgra noted, however, that demand does not justify illegal operations. He likened the TNCs’ alibi to a manufacturer of fake license plates who argues there is demand for such. If the LTFRB were to follow penalties stated in MC 2015-016, Grab and Uber’s operations should have been shut down. But according to LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada, the interest of the riding public “overrides” the provision. But while the transport network giants were not ordered closed, their accreditation as TNCs will still be reviewed. Grab’s accreditation expired on July 3, while Uber’s is set to expire in August. Lizada also said the LTFRB will form a technical working group that will meet with the TNCs to set a deadline for the elimination of illegal operations. – Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/tech-and-innovation/174701-road-revolution-commuting-with-tech/","title":"Road revolution: How Filipinos commute with tech","date":"Jul 4, 2017 8:03 PM PHT","snippet":"Technology has revolutionized road travel in the metro, making our everyday commute a little bit more bearable","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Traffic in Metro Manila is the bane of every commuter’s existence.

These options can be time-consuming and expensive. On bad days, say, the evening rush hour made even worse by a sudden downpour, one can spend hours on the road just driving or trying to get a ride. Today’s technology has made it possible for reliable transportation options in the city to be more accessible for anybody, anywhere at just a tap of a smartphone. Thus, Filipinos have embraced ridesharing services such as Uber, which offer easy access to rides, with the safety, reliability, and convenience that private cars offer (without actually having to acquire one). It’s especially useful for those who live in areas that aren’t along routes of major public transport options. Many have become so reliant on the app, especially since unlike other ridesharing services, Uber doesn’t reveal trip destinations or travel time to drivers before pick-up. This ensures that all riders have equal access to the service.  Rappler and Uber Philippines launched the #BeforeUBER campaign last June 21 to crowdsource stories about commuting life before the app arrived in the Philippines four years ago.  Uber riders and partners (as passengers and drivers are called) were eager to share their stories.

Here's how it can help you step up","body":"MANILA, Philippines – More Filipinos are preferring to go cashless, with a growing number of consumers owning one credit or debit card on average, according to a 2015 study by Visa. The research also indicated that at least 6 out of 10 Filipinos are using cards more frequently as it’s more secure than carrying around huge amounts of cash. Want to step up as well? Here are some ways you can go cashless and pay for your everyday transactions: Go cashless with a debit card Contrary to popular belief, you can use your debit card in other ways aside from ATM withdrawals. Your debit card works just like a credit card but instead of getting charged monthly for your purchases, the amount is automatically deducted from your bank account. To avoid queuing at ATMs, you can use your debit card directly at checkout to pay for your daily necessities! This way, you skip the long lines (especially during holidays and paydays) and the dreaded offline status. Manage your personal expenses better Nothing shows independence more than sticking to a budget and paying for your own bills. Going to different establishments just to pay your bills can waste a lot of your precious time, especially if you’re busy building up your career or taking care of your family. For fast and easy payments, have your debit card set up so that recurring bill payments can be automatically deducted from your account. Deductions usually happen as soon as bills come in so you do not have to worry about missing the deadlines, too! Celebrate personal milestones with your loved ones Promotions, birthdays, anniversaries, engagements – these milestones are best celebrated with your family and friends. There’s nothing more satisfying than treating them to a hearty meal. It’s a nice feeling to say “this meal is on me!” and share the fruits of your hard work with your loved ones. By paying with your debit card, you can avoid the embarrassing surprise of not having enough cash in your wallet in case your bill exceeds your estimated budget. Avoid overspending while abroad So you’re travelling overseas – great! Make sure you have all your transportation and accommodation booked and paid for, whether full or in part so you can lessen your worries when you arrive at your destination. Remember: not all airlines and accommodations accept cash! Did you know that you can use your debit card for transactions abroad? Shop for pasalubong you can’t get back home. Pay using a debit card connected to your personal travel fund and only bring enough cash to spend on street food and transportation! This way, you will avoid spending money on non travel-related expenses. Go from home to office and back with your favorite ridehailing app Commuting around the city is now safer, more comfortable and convenient thanks to ride-hailing services. With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can easily call for a cab or a private car without having to stand in long lines under the sun or squeezing inside cramped trains and buses during your daily commute. Complete the experience by linking your card to your go-to ride-hailing app. Trust us, your future self will thank you in case of cash emergencies. There is more to the debit card that meets the eye. By using your card, you can also enjoy great deals, discounts, and exclusive offers from select participating establishments! Experience convenience everyday and go cashless now.

Here's a list of the big issues the company has faced since 2013.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned on Tuesday, June 20, 2017 (US time), amid pressure from its investors – a culmination of a wild string of incidents that brought to light Uber issues relating to company culture, sexism, corporate espionage, stolen technologies, shady internal tools, and its treatment of drivers, among others. We round all of these up in our timeline below of Uber’s troubles leading up to resignation of its head honcho. Included are several incidents involving the Philippines: August 16, 2013 – A group of Uber drivers in the US file a class-action lawsuit, claiming that their status as independent contractors instead of official employees is a misclassification – a status that leaves them bereft of full-time employee benefits. The case is ongoing as of June 2017.  December 2013 – An Uber driver hits a family on the road, killing a young girl and seriously injuring her mother and brother. Uber is sued by the family, but the company fights back on the basis that the driver wasn’t officially booked at the time of the incident, meaning he technically wasn’t an Uber driver during that period.   January 2014 – Techcrunch and Valleywag confirm that some Uber employees intentionally booked thousands of rides from competing ride-sharing services – only to cancel them and mess with their operations.  August 2014 – The Verge exposes an Uber secret project called Operation SLOG designed to spy on, and lure drivers away from competitor Lyft.  October 2014 – Uber’s espionage on riders is exposed by Forbes, which discovered their “God View” and “Creepy Stalker View,” which tracked the trip of users. November 2014 – Former Uber senior vice president, Emil Michael, suggests that the company hire researchers and journalists to dig up dirt from the lives of its critics. He says it at a private dinner, suggesting a budget of 1 million dollars. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith uncovered the incident, and Michael is forced to apologize. February 2016 – An Uber driver is accused of killing 6 in a shooting spree in the US. Uber’s background check process is questioned, compounded by a 2014 rape incident in India involving an Uber driver. The driver has been sentenced to life in prison. In the Philippines, a woman was allegedly raped by an Uber driver on July 27; Uber Philippines removed the driver from their platform, identified as Xstian Karlou John Marie, after the incident.

Kalanick’s resignation on Tuesday, June 20, was triggered by after pressure from the company’s top investors, the New York Times reported Wednesday, June 21. This was later confirmed by Uber to multiple US news outlets. The investors, the report said, made the demand to Kalanick in a letter entitled “Moving Uber Forward,” which said the company must have a leadership change and that he leave. “I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in a statement to the Times. The Uber board, meanwhile, said in a statement to the paper that Kalanick made a “bold decision” signifying his “devotion and love for Uber.” “By stepping away, he’s taking the time to heal from his personal tragedy while giving the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber’s history,” referencing the recent death of his mother in a boating accident last May. He will still remain part of the company’s board of directors, the report added. He had earlier announced on June 13 that he will be taking an indefinite leave of absence, as the tech company is embroiled in a series of controversies over its leadership and company culture. Uber, which is the world’s richest venture-backed startup valued at some $68 billion, operates in dozens of countries despite problems with regulators in many jurisdictions and protests from established taxi operators. The pioneering company has been facing pressure to rein in a no-holds-barred management style led by Kalanick and to reform its workplace culture, which has sparked charges of harassment and discrimination. It also faces questions about its covert use of law enforcement-evading software and tactics apparently aimed at disrupting rivals in the ridesharing business.  Earlier this month the group, based in San Francisco, parted ways with its number two executive, Emil Michael, who had reportedly been linked to a number of questionable practices at Uber, including a visit to a South Korean escort-karaoke bar and an attempt to dig up embarrassing information on journalists. A week earlier Uber said it had fired 20 people after examining 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior and bullying. Uber also this month released a 13-page document calling for major reforms at the company based on a probe led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, who investigated allegations of misconduct and ethical lapses. The report, recommendations of which were adopted by the board, said Uber “should reformulate its written cultural values” to “reflect more inclusive and positive behaviors”. – with reports from Agence France-Presse / Rappler.com "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/moveph/170067-using-cellphones-while-driving-prohibited-starting-may-18-2017/","title":"Using cellphones while driving prohibited starting May 18","date":"May 17, 2017 1:25 PM PHT","snippet":"Under the Anti-Distracted Driving Act, violators will face fines ranging from P5,000 to P20,000","body":" MANILA, Philippines – A lot of motorists use their mobile phones while behind the wheel – calling, texting, going online, even playing games. Starting Thursday, May 18, it will be illegal for them to do so. On Thursday, the Anti-Distracted Driving Act will take effect. Under this new law, drivers are banned from using a “mobile communications device to write, send, or read a text-based communication or to make or receive calls.” They also cannot use “an electronic entertainment or computing device to play games, watch movies, surf the internet, compose messages, read e-books, perform calculations” while the vehicle is in motion or even when stopped at a red traffic light. Using gadgets, however, is not considered distracted driving if done using a hands-free function or similar devices. Concerns about implementation In a press conference of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) on Wednesday, May 17, concerns were raised about the implementation of the new law. For one, will it cover the placement of navigation systems on ride-hailing services like Grab and Uber? What motorists can do, said the authorities, is to set their destination on navigation apps before trips begin. Gadgets with these apps may be installed in a part of the vehicle that will not obstruct the driver’s view. If motorists need to find alternative routes while in traffic, they should pull over first. “Kung kinakailangan mong tumingin sa gadget mo na maalis ang tingin mo sa lansangan, kailangan itabi mo muna,” LTO Assistant Secretary Edgardo Galvante said. (If you need to look at your gadget and your eyes won’t be on the road, you should bring your vehicle to the side of the road first.) Another concern – how will traffic enforcers check compliance if vehicles are heavily tinted? The DOTr and the LTO reminded the public that there are standards to be followed for window tints. “[We] will be coming up with a public information campaign for the next 3 months but law [enforcement] agencies will not stop [in implementing] this,” said DOTr Assistant Secretary Mark de Leon. He added that every type of vehicle is covered by the new law, including motorcycles, bicycles, and even horse-drawn carriages. Exemptions will be granted only during emergency situations, fire, or crime. Violators, both public and private vehicles, will face fines ranging from P5,000 to P20,000. Aside from the DOTr and the LTO, the Philippine National Police (PNP), Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and local government units (LGUs) are authorized to enforce the Anti-Distracted Driving Act. Road safety According to Ronnie Corpus of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), they can also issue additional sanctions for public utility vehicle (PUV) operators who fail to educate their drivers about the law. Ultimately, the law is for the promotion of road safety. “Ayaw na natin madagdagan pa [ang mga aksidente]. One life lost from this is one too many. Pati ‘yung pagtawid sa kalsada, nagte-text or nagbabasa… ie-emphasize natin ‘to para ma-remind ang mga tao natin,” Galvante said. (We don’t want more accidents. Even those crossing the street are texting or reading. We will emphasize this to remind the public.) De Leon added: “Kung alam ‘nyo na ganito ang batas, ‘wag na kayo gumamit ng cellphone. Ang objective ng batas na ito is not on the enforcement, o sa dami ng huli, kung hindi sa naa-avoid na aksidente.” (If you already know about this law, don’t use your cellphone while driving. The objective of this law is not to catch as many violators as possible, but to prevent accidents.) Children on motorcycles Aside from the Anti-Distracted Driving Act, the Children’s Safety on Motorcycles Act will also be fully implemented. It will take effect on Friday, May 19. Under that law, a child riding a motorcycle must be able to comfortably reach the standard foot peg of the motorcycle and grasp the waist of the driver. The child also has to wear a helmet. Violators will face fines ranging from P3,000 to P10,000. (READ: What laws help keep road users safe in the Philippines?) – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/169161-globe-suspends-mobile-services-quiapo-after-blasts/","title":"Telcos suspend mobile services in Quiapo after blasts","date":"May 7, 2017 9:15 PM PHT","snippet":"(UPDATED) Police requested that cellular signals be jammed for 48 hours in Quiapo, the site of twin explosions","body":" MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Telecommunications companies temporarily suspended mobile services in Quiapo and other nearby areas in Manila starting Sunday, May 7, a day after twin explosions rocked the capital.  Globe made the announcement in a Facebook post at 7:57 pm on Sunday. {source}<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fglobeph%2Fposts%2F10154896518309748&width=500″ width=”500″ height=”325″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true”></iframe>{/source} “In compliance with a directive from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) upon the request of the Philippine National Police, Globe Telecom will temporarily suspend mobile services for 48 hours in Quiapo, Manila and neighboring vicinities effective immediately,” said Globe.   Users in the affected areas will not be able to access phone calls, text messages, and mobile data services during the suspension. “Mobile services, including internet connection, would be restored as soon as the NTC has given clearance for the company to do so.

PSG spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino, without going into details, said the unit assigned to protect President Rodrigo Duterte is already discussing the incident. He said it is routine for them to check.  “In cases like this, it is usually a joint effort of all security forces so there is no single unit operating,” Aquino told Rappler. An officer wearing a black Army bomb squad shirt was seen assisting the bomb squad of the Manila Police District (MPD). Two Rappler sources confirmed the Army officer is assigned to the PSG. “They are EOD personnel from the Presidential Security Group. They went there pero hindi na sila pina-assist ng PNP at hindi na necessary kaya nag-pull na din sila (They went there but the PNP no longer asked for their assistance since it was no longer necessary so they pulled out from the area),” said a military officer.  An MPD officer said the PSG got involved because the blast site is close to Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the Philippine President. It is less than 25 minutes walking distance.   There were two blasts on Saturday. The first killed a yet to be identified motorcycle rider of ride-hailing company Grab, who delivered the package that carried the bomb, and the man who received it, a certain Mohamad Bainga.  The package was intended for Shiite Muslim cleric Nasser Abinal of the Islamic Center. He was not at the office near the Golden Mosque when the package was delivered.  The second blast injured police officers processing the blast site. National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Director Oscar Albayalde was at the site during the second explosion but was immediately escorted out. Rappler chief photographer LeAnne Jazul, who was at the blast site, said the Army bomb squad officer who arrived after the second blast was apparently consulted when the bomb squad of the police dealt with a suspicious bag.  About 6 soldiers belonging to Joint Task Force-NCR, the military unit responsible for Metro Manila, were also spotted at the blast site much later in the night. They were intended to increase the presence of security forces in the area.  International terrorist group Islamic State (ISIS) again claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police dismissed it as propaganda. Albayalde said it is not a terror act because the bomb attack had a specific target. ISIS also claimed responsiblity for the pipe bomb explosion in the same district over a week ago, on April 28, that hurt 14 people. The police said that blast was related to a local scuffle. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/169134-grab-express-rider-killed-quiapo-blast/","title":"Grab rider was delivery boy killed in Quiapo blast, company says","date":"May 7, 2017 3:31 PM PHT","snippet":"Grab: 'We are deeply saddened the incident took the lives of two civilians, including one of our GrabExpress partners'","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing company Grab said the unidentified motorcycle-riding delivery boy who died in the Quiapo explosion on Saturday, May 6, was one of their own.  “We are deeply saddened the incident took the lives of two civilians, including one of our GrabExpress partners,” Grab Philippines said in a statement on Sunday, May 7.  Two people died in a blast near the Manila Golden Mosque in Quiapo on Saturday. The casualties were the Grab driver and the man who received the package that contained the bomb, a certain Mohamad Bainga.  The company did not name the driver. Grab is a ridesharing company that partners with owners of vehicles, including motorcycles, who agree to drive for customers who book rides through a mobile application. GrabExpress is dedicated to the delivery of packages.  CCTV footage of the explosion obtained by Rappler showed the motorcycle rider appearing to be asking for directions before proceeding to an area along Norzagaray Street in Quiapo, where the explosion happened a few seconds later. Grab vowed to cooperate with authorities. “We are one with authorities in pursuing justice for those who needlessly lost their lives and were hurt. We pledge our full support and cooperation in the conduct of their investigation,” the company said. “Grab and our GrabExpress partners will remain vigilant and work with the police to take extra care in areas that may be identified as at risk for such incidences,” Grab added. A second blast occurred two hours later, very near the site where the two men died. It injured police officers deployed to process the crime scene. Saturday’s twin blasts happened a week after another bombing incident – along Quezon Boulevard, also in Quiapo – where 14 people were hurt.   – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/169062-tencent-sorry-wechat-russia-block/","title":"China’s Tencent ‘deeply sorry’ for Russia WeChat block","date":"May 6, 2017 2:39 PM PHT","snippet":"Russian regulations require online service providers to register with the government","body":" BEIJING, China – Chinese internet giant Tencent said Saturday, May 6, it was “deeply sorry” its messaging app WeChat was blocked in Russia, adding it was in touch with authorities to resolve the issue.

But these proudly Pinoy brands are fast becoming known in Southeast Asia, with some even venturing beyond the region and bringing their products to the global market. Several brands from neighboring countries like Singapore and Malaysia are also making waves – from Grab, Malaysia’s ride-hailing service that rivals the US-based Uber, to Singapore bakery BreadTalk, with its signature open-plan kitchen that has established an international presence. Rappler lists down some regional brands in Asia that are making their mark around the world.  1. Grab (Malaysia) Grab – then known as GrabTaxi – was a gamechanger in the ride-hailing service industry when it first launched in 2012. Following in the success of the San Francisco-based Uber, the app makes it easy for passengers to hail taxis with just a few taps on their smartphones. The idea for Grab came about following a conversation between co-founder Anthony Tan and an Indonesian friend about the difficulty of hailing taxis in Malaysia. Tan, then a student at Harvard, worked with fellow Malaysian classmate Tan Hooi Ling to create a business plan for what would soon be launched in Malaysia as MyTeksi. The mobile app aimed to connect taxi drivers to passengers efficiently, making it easy for riders to get a ride and for drivers to be assured of their next passenger without aimlessly roaming around the city. (READ: GrabTaxi app: Answer to commuter woes) Since its launch in Malaysia in June 2012, the app has launched in 6 more countries around the region: the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Manila saw the app’s launch in August 2013; it has since expanded to include other Philippine cities such as Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, and Cagayan de Oro. Aside from booking taxis, the Grab app also offers booking of private cars, a ridesharing carpool service, and a motorcycle delivery service.  2. British India (Malaysia) Established in 1994, British India is a fashion label calling Malaysia – not Britain or India – as its home. It was founded by Pat Liew, who has more than 30 years of experience in the retail industry under her belt. Upon launching, the colonial era-inspired fashion brand had a cheeky tagline: “Presenting British India. An era of racism, oppression, injustice and nice outfits.” Within months since its launch, the brand came out with 4 outlets in Malaysia and 4 in Singapore by the mid-1990s. The Singapore launch, Liew said, was a testbed for the brand’s readiness for a global presence. Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the Malaysian brand has expanded into other countries in Asia, with more than 40 outlets in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.  3. BreadTalk (Singapore) BreadTalk entered the Philippine market in 2004, opening its first branch at Glorietta 4 mall in Makati City and enticing customers with its unique open-plan kitchen that offered a glimpse of how the bread was made. The Singapore-based brand was founded in April 2000, entering Singapore’s bakery industry with products that catered to traditional tastes as well as promoting and creating new varieties of bread. The bakery often has customized product offerings to fit the local flavors or preferences in their outlets in the region. They also launch new products to fit in with seasonal festivals and trends. The company opened its first overseas outlet in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003. Since then, it has expanded to more than 900 outlets in 17 countries. Its brand portfolio also includes Toast Box, Food Republic, and Ramen Play. It manages the Singapore franchise of the Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung as well.  4. TWG Tea Company (Singapore) Luxury brand TWG Tea (which stands for The Wellbeing Group) was founded by Taha Bouqdib, Maranda Barnes, and Rith Aum-Stievenard in 2008, with Singapore as the launch base of the brand. The famous teashop, which brands itself as an upscale tea salon, offers more than 1,000 fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, as well as a variety of tea patisseries and delicacies. The “1837” in the company’s branding doesn’t refer to the date it was established, but refers to the year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore, when the island became a trading post for teas. The luxury brand quickly became well-known worldwide, with its teas being served in some of Singapore’s best hotels and in the front cabins of Singapore Airlines. Food chain Dean & Deluca also brought the brand to US markets, while Harrods brought the brand to London.   5. Potato Corner (Philippines) Known for its flavored french fries, this homegrown brand has been in the industry for 24 years, with more than 500 branches in the Philippines and several more in the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Panama. Potato Corner opened its first kiosk outlet back in 1992. Two years since it started business, the brand opened 70 outlets across the country. It opened its first overseas outlet in 2006 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and entered the US market in 2012. By 2016, the brand had 800 stores and had begun operating in Thailand.   6. Jollibee (Philippines) Filipinos love Jollibee. And so does the rest of the world.  The fast food giant behind well-loved food products such as Chicken Joy and Yumburger traces its beginnings to 1975, when Filipino-Chinese founder Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice cream shop in Cubao, Quezon City. The ice cream shop would later become Jollibee’s first outlet, and would become the bedrock of the company’s rapid expansion for years to come. Jollibee boasts a presence of nearly 978 stores in the Philippines and 80 stores internationally to date. The company also operates other fast food chains including Chowking, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, and Red Ribbon. Jollibee has established an international presence in Canada, the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Brunei, Oman, and Qatar. The group caters not only to Filipinos working overseas but also to locals, who form part of the snaking lines that greet Jollibee’s store openings outside the Philippines. The company withstood the entrance of McDonald’s to the Philippine market in 1981 as it catered to distinct Filipino tastes, setting it apart from the international fast food giant.    7. URC (Philippines) Tracing its beginnings to as early as 1954, Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was started by Filipino businessman John Gokongwei, who learned to do business as a trade importer during World War II and the postwar years. The company started out as a corn mill under the name Universal Corn Products. This business would become the foundation for URC as it is known today – a household name in the snacks industry, agro-industrial operations, and commodities distribution. URC products are distributed under the company’s brands including Jack ‘n Jill, Robina Farms, Robichem, and Universal Corn Products. The company offerings include snacks, beverages, meat and poultry products, and commodities like sugar and flour. URC has expanded beyond the Philippines, distributing its products to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.  8. San Miguel (Philippines) Established in 1890 as La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, San Miguel is Southeast Asia’s first brewery and the Philippines’ largest brewery to date. The Philippine brand is also part of one of the country’s largest conglomerates: San Miguel Corporation, which has businesses ranging from food, power, oil, and infrastructure to airlines, beverages, and packaging.   San Miguel has been under the control of prominent Filipino families such as the Zobel de Ayalas, Roxases, and Sorianos. It is currently largely owned and operated by Ramon Ang and Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. The company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Hong Kong, China, and Australia.  San Miguel exports its beer to major markets around the world and is consistently part of the top 10 bestselling beer brands worldwide. Its brands include Red Horse, Golden Eagle, and the company’s namesake beer products such as household brands San Miguel Pale Pilsen and San Miguel Light.  9. Integrated Micro-Electronics (Philippines) One of the Philippines’ oldest and largest conglomerates, the Ayala group has expanded its presence beyond the country, not only in the region but also globally. The group’s largest international operations is under the company Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated (IMI), a leading provider in electronics manufacturing services and power semiconductor assembly and tests services. Established in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins Incorporated, its services cater to a number of industries including telecommunications infrastructure, consumer electronics, solar energy, automotives, medical machines, and storage devices. IMI’s global presence includes manufacturing operations in China, Singapore, the United States, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Czech Republic. The company also has sales operations in Japan and Germany. The company recently marked its entrance into the aerospace industry and defense sector this year with its acquisition of STI Enterprises, a UK-based electronics manufacturing services company.  10. Pilmico Foods Corporation (Philippines) Another Filipino conglomerate, the Aboitiz group, has established an international presence with Pilmico Foods Corporation. Pilmico operates animal farms and also produces and distributes flour and animal feeds. The company was incorporated in 1958 as Central Philippine Milling Corporation by brothers Ramon and Vidal Aboitiz. In 1962, the company partnered with The Pillsbury Company of Minnesota, USA to establish operations in Mindanao. The company changed its name to Pilmico Food Corporation in 1990, upon the sale of all its shares to Aboitiz & Company. The company’s brand profile includes Wooden Spoon flours, Home Style, and Pilmico.  In 2013, Pilmico started exporting its products to the ASEAN market, prompting it to establish operations in Indonesia and Vietnam. At present, Pilmico flour is exported to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Hong Kong. Its feeds business also currently exports to Cambodia.  11. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts (Malaysia) Founded by Chinese-Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts opened its first location in April 1971 in Singapore. Inspired by the legendary land found in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton, the Shangri-La group draws from the description of the land being an earthly paradise.  The group, now based in Hong Kong, operates 5-star luxury hotels and resorts in several locations and is famous for its world-renowned hospitality and services. According to its company website, the group’s brand portfolio includes Shangri-La, Kerry, and Hotel Jen and Traders branded properties.  Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts has a presence in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America, and the Indian Ocean islands, with over 40,000 rooms.    12. J.Co Donuts (Indonesia) The popular donut brand finds its roots in Indonesia, where it was established in 2005 by businessman Johnny Andrean. Known for its unique flavor offerings, the company opened its first outlet the same year.  In a little over 10 years, the company now operates over 214 stores in Indonesia and has expanded its presence to other countries including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Singapore.  J.Co’s donuts are known for their high quality toppings like matcha green tea, premium dark chocolate, and roasted almonds. The brand is also popular for its playful product names and has expanded into other offerings such as frozen yogurt, beverages, and sandwiches. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/165386-grabtricycle-rides-mandaluyong/","title":"Grab offers free tricycle rides in Mandaluyong","date":"Mar 27, 2017 8:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Passengers can use the ride-hailing app to book a free tricycle ride in selected areas in Mandaluyong City from March 27 to April 5","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing service Grab is beta-testing a new service using a very Filipino mode of transportation: the tricycle.  From March 27 to April 5, Grab users in Mandaluyong City can avail of free tricycle rides to get around selected areas, using the app to hail and book a ride with just a few taps.  The service is available from 8 am to 5 pm, along the following streets:  To book a ride, passengers need to choose the GrabTricycle icon on their app, select pick-up and drop-off locations within the specific areas mentioned, and add the promo code GRABTRIKE before booking.

Susan Fowler, an engineer who worked at Uber until the end of last year, said in a blog post that her manager made sexual advances shortly after she joined the company. She said she complained to upper managers and the human resources department, but was told that it was the man’s “first offense” and that they wouldn’t feel comfortable punishing a “high performer.” Fowler told of later meeting other women engineers at the company who said they had experienced similar harassment, including inappropriate behavior from the same manager she had reported. Men engineers were gifted leather jackets, while women were left out, she noted. “In the background, there was a game-of-thrones political war raging within the ranks of upper management in the infrastructure engineering organization,” Fowler said, comparing the scene to a hit fantasy television drama in which rival nobles viciously vie for power. “It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor’s job.” A New York Times report on Friday depicted a “Hobbesian environment” at Uber in which workers were pitted against one another and misbehavior by top performers was overlooked. The story included tales of a director shouting a homophobic slur in a meeting; a manager threatening to beat an underperforming worker with a baseball bat, and women employees groped at a Las Vegas retreat where cocaine was used in bathrooms during private parties. #DeleteUber  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that Holder and another attorney will look into issues raised by Fowler, “as well as diversity and inclusion at Uber more broadly.” Holder was former US president Barack Obama’s attorney general between 2009 and 2015. The lawyers were to be aided by journalist Arianna Huffington, who is a member of the Uber board. The controversy threatened to revive a #DeleteUber campaign triggered by Kalanick’s short-lived plan to be part of a business advisory group for US President Donald Trump. Kalanick quit the group under pressure from a growing movement to stop using the ride-sharing service because of his connection to the new administration, and by extension an anti-immigrant agenda. As the campaign picked up speed, rival Lyft’s popularity accelerated. “Now, they are facing yet another avoidable backlash where people are disconnecting themselves from the (Uber) app,” analyst Enderle said. “Lyft is likely the biggest beneficiary, but at the same time, Google is coming to market with its Waze carpool service – this is the wrong time for Uber to have this.” Snowball of trouble Meanwhile, the race to develop self-driving vehicles took a turn on Thursday when Google’s parent company Alphabet filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing it of using stolen technology. Alphabet contends that a manager at its autonomous car subsidiary Waymo took technical data with him when he left to launch a competing venture that went on to become Otto, Uber’s self-driving vehicle unit, in a reported $680 million deal. Waymo is calling for a trial to stop Otto and Uber from using technology taken in a “calculated theft.” Waymo also wants unspecified damages in what it described in court documents as “an action for trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement and unfair competition.” San Francisco-based Uber acquired commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto last year as it pressed ahead with a pursuit of self-driving technology. “We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,” an Uber spokeswoman said. In the eyes of consumers, Uber’s controversies pack together into “a snowball of trouble rolling down the hill getting bigger and bigger,” said brand management specialists Bruce Turkel. Once people switch to a new ride-hailing app, they are likely to stick with it and forget about using Uber, according to analysts. “Uber can do all the damage control they want, it’s not going to change who they are at their very core,” Turkel said. “And, unfortunately, when you watch Travis Kalanick when he is on TV or whatever, he has that frat boy kind of attitude anyway. So, when you hear about sexual harassment, it actually fits.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/162633-uber-philippines-insensitive-tweet-transport-strike/","title":"Uber PH draws flak for ‘insensitive’ tweet","date":"Feb 27, 2017 12:45 AM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing app is accused of trying to capitalize on the plight of jeepney operators and drivers who will go on strike on Monday, February 27","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Ride-hailing app Uber Philippines drew flak on Sunday evening, February 26, after tweeting about a promo for Monday, February 27, the day transport operators will be holding a nationwide strike.

Think again. The Philippines could lose up to P6 billion a day if traffic doesn’t improve by 2030, according to a study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Filipinos, however, stand to lose a lot more due to bumper to bumper traffic – aside from their patience. Precious time and expensive fuel are wasted. Greenhouse gas emissions increase, and so do risks to health. While the government has already come up with ways to solve traffic, results will not be apparent immediately as there’s lots to cover. There’s poor urban planning in an already-overpopulated capital, leading to a severely congested metropolis. Using public transportation is difficult. Citizens are subjected to inefficient bus services: aggressive drivers often veer off their designated bus lanes and stop in the middle of highways to drop off or pick up passengers, blocking parts of the road meant for regular traffic. Because they are paid based on how many passengers they carry, they loiter to load the whole bus, blocking other cars. The notoriously glitchy railway system is hardly a faster and more pleasant alternative. Train breakdowns lessen the already inadequate number of coaches – for which there are long queues snaking down packed train stations, especially during rush hour. (READ: MRT and the violence of our mass transport system) The country currently ranks 12th among countries with the worst traffic in the world. No wonder, then, that 30% of Filipinos consider commuting to be the worst part of their day, according to a Ford survey which has appeared on three local news sites. They are also beginning to ditch public transportation in favor of bringing their own cars to work or to school. Thanks to affordable car loans, they can purchase their own vehicles without much difficulty. But while good for the economy, this only exacerbates the issue. 32% of vehicles making trips in Metro Manila are privately owned. Rising car sales means more vehicles on the road, contributing to the so-called carmageddon on EDSA. The staggering number of cars being sold can also be attributed to ride-hailing’s surge in popularity in the Philippines. Entrepreneurial Filipinos have taken advantage of the demand for more accessible, efficient, and safe transportation options. They buy new cars in bulk, hire drivers, send them out to clogged highways, then get passengers using apps. But while this form of ride-sharing makes commuting more comfortable, it doesn’t help reduce traffic. This practice adds around 10,000 to 15,000 cars to those already on the road. Ride-sharing: the true solution Of the over 20,000 commuters from Quezon City who take their cars to work, 65% drive by themselves, according to a study by Wunder. This takes up a lot of space on the road, particularly if one is driving a large car. A simple way to help decongest the traffic is to make arrangements with other people to travel in one vehicle.  In the Philippines, carpooling comes in many forms, but true carpooling means riding with existing car owners, not buying more cars to be able to share rides. By using apps like Wunder, drivers with similar routes can offer their empty seats to passengers. Car owners can even share seats with other car owners. They turn into passengers by leaving their own cars at home to fill in those seats instead. In addition to reducing the number of cars on highways by putting more people in less cars, this lessens every commuter’s carbon footprint. Fewer cars mean less air pollution, which, according to the World Health Organization, is the cause for 7 million deaths each year. With this, the potential for respiratory illnesses lessens considerably. Sharing rides can also reduce stress experienced by commuters. It also saves money. Resources, namely car and fuel, are maximized, thereby cutting costs for everyone involved. In the end, no matter how loudly we complain to fellow passengers or honk at erring drivers, the sorry state of traffic is – for the time being, at least – here to stay. While we’re waiting for more viable, long-term solutions from the government and the private sector, we should learn how to be creative enough to come up with answers of our own. We can all be part of the solution once we realize that it can start with us. – Rappler.com   "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/161122-ford-invests-artificial-intelligence-startup-argo-ai/","title":"Ford to invest $1B in artificial intelligence startup","date":"Feb 11, 2017 10:41 AM PHT","snippet":"The venture with Argo AI will employ leading engineers and 'roboticists' to develop a 'virtual driver' system, described by Ford officials as the 'brain' of an autonomous vehicle","body":" NEW YORK, USA – Ford will invest $1 billion over 5 years in an artificial intelligence startup with the aim of developing an autonomous vehicle by 2021, the auto giant said on Friday, February 10. Ford will take a majority stake in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, started in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees who had worked on autonomous driving. The venture will employ leading engineers and “roboticists” to develop a “virtual driver” system, described by Ford officials as the “brain” of an autonomous vehicle. The setup is intended to give Ford a head start on competitors in the race to commercialize autonomous vehicles, said Ford executive vice president Raj Nair.  “This is really unique in the industry,” Nair said on a conference call with analysts.  It will have the “speed and nimbleness of a startup, but also integrated into a full production development team.” Nair said research towards full autonomy has moved “beyond the research phase,” but there remains the need for a “tremendous leap” between the driver-assist technologies now available and full autonomy. Argo AI employees will have a minority equity stake in the venture. The structure is intended to lure top engineers to the venture, Ford executives said.  Ford said the investment would help it to realize a previously announced plan to introduce an autonomous vehicle for ride-hailing or ride-sharing service in 2021. Argo AI plans to hire more than 200 people at sites in Pittsburgh, Michigan and Silicon Valley, according to a press release. Argo AI and other boosters of autonomous driving argue it could make roads safer and open up mobility to the elderly and others.  “We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move,” Argo AI chief Bryan Salesky said. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/161045-p2p-buses-transport-metro-traffic/","title":"Have you tried the P2P bus yet? It’s still a better ride","date":"Feb 11, 2017 9:30 AM PHT","snippet":"From only 3 routes in end-2015, the P2P service has since expanded its routes. But for its continued success, standards for operators must be maintained.","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Between 2015 and 2016, the transportation situation in Metro Manila seemed to be in a perpetual state of crisis: traffic-congested roads were mainstay visuals in daily news, along with the long queues snaking out of train stations. Hardly a week went by without the Metro Rail Transit (MRT3)’s constant breakdowns. With city buses full to the brim and the main thoroughfare EDSA choked with vehicles, frustrated commuters were clamoring for better solutions. The transportation department then tried a tack adapted from Seoul’s successful program that used existing bus infrastructure. In March 2015, the government launched express buses that made only one or two stops along EDSA. By the end of 2015, this expanded into the point-to-point (P2P) bus service, which made no stops at all and promised to shave off 20 to 30 minutes in travel time. (READ: Double decker bus dry run: ‘Preview’ of modern bus system) From only 3 routes in end-2015, the P2P service has since expanded to ferry passengers from the north and south ends of the metro and into the central business districts. Word of mouth and social media buzz piqued the curiosity of commuters willing to pay higher fares – nearly twice as much as ordinary city buses – in exchange for guaranteed seats, premium amenities, and buses that depart on schedule. Insurance broker Vanessa Buendia has ditched the hot and overcrowded MRT in favor of a comfortable air-conditioned seat in the P2P bus she rides from Ortigas Center to her workplace in Makati City. While she admits that the train is still the fastest way to get to her office, queueing up alone already consumes a lot of time. “The MRT is really faster but it’s not comfortable at all…It takes maybe 3 times as long from [getting the ticket] to a ride. But this is really all about the comfort for me,” she said. More riders When the P2P service launched in December 2015, a total of 20 buses ran on only 3 routes, linking Trinoma, SM North EDSA, and SM Megamall to Makati City. Three companies now operate routes from Quezon City and Ortigas Center to Makati City, and from Alabang to Makati City.  When the service first launched, Froehlich Tours had only 15 units for the 2,000 passengers riding their buses every day. Now, they have 48 buses for their 4 routes, and daily ridership has jumped to around 15,000 passengers. HM Transport, which has a partnership with Robinsons Land Corporation, operates two P2P routes from Robinsons Malls in Ortigas and Novaliches. There are a total of 14 units plying the two routes, with about 1,000 passengers riding each route every day. What attracted passengers to try the P2P service? For Froehlich Tours CEO Chris Bauer, the premium amenities not seen in ordinary commuter buses – such as wifi, comfortable seats, and onboard restrooms – may have been the main draw. “In the beginning, people were already happy to have a scheduled service. Then the next step was bringing in a double-decker bus, then a CR, leather seats, PWD functionalities…so expectations are growing whenever we launch the next service,” Bauer said. Aside from the premium bus features, the P2P service’s selling point remains its value to commuters who want a cheaper but relatively fast commute.  Jaime Matias, a former general manager of the Makati Commercial Estate Association, owns a car, but now prefers to ride the P2P bus from Alabang Town Center to Makati. He spends around P1,440 a month by taking bus rides instead of the P4,000 a month he spends in toll fees alone. “Aside from the convenience, it’s less stress since I’m already a senior citizen. I used to drive before, but now I just sit down,” he said. Matias also believes that taking the bus can help ease traffic congestion, pointing out that a bus can transport around 60 passengers and can take the equivalent of about 4 cars off the road. Interconnection, flexibility While the P2P service has expanded and attracted more riders, it’s a challenge for operators to keep up their services as metro traffic continues to worsen, with private cars and ride-hailing services adding to the congestion. “Traffic got worse, unfortunately. The number of private cars is increasing drastically…For sure, you need a certain number of these Uber and Grab vehicles, but what I can see right now, from the perspective of a transport operator, it’s getting too much,” Bauer said. Bauer added that while the Philippines has a lot of transportation options, they don’t interconnect – leaving a large number of vehicles that end up using the same road. “We are lacking this interconnection service. We have great transportation modes in the Philippines, but they don’t work hand in hand. Right now, buses are plying EDSA, [as well as] Uber, Grab, taxis, jeeps. Everybody is plying the same route up and down,” he said. To help bus operators work their way around this problem, Bauer thinks government should allow operators to be more flexible in handling the deployment of their units. Under the current system, franchises are granted based on routes. Operators can’t simply add units to augment an under-supplied route during peak hours, or to pull out under-utilized units during hours with low passenger volume. “Some people tell us we should add more buses on peak hours, but unfortunately our franchise says a maximum of 48 units for the entire routes. Every unit needs to have a special permit and provisional authority,” Bauer said. “For example, if today was a low day, instead of 48 buses I would only need 20, and the other 28 can do something else so I’m not congesting [EDSA]. But I have a franchise for 48 units, so I need to run 48 units every day on EDSA, [regardless] if there are passengers or not,” he added. Transport agencies should also be responsive to changing passenger volume. For HM’s Novaliches route for instance, there seems to be a demand for P2P rides from the Sandiganbayan area. Darwin Renolayan, regional operations manager of Robinsons Land Corporation, raised the possibility of the buses being allowed to make stops in that area to cater to passengers who could not get to the loading terminal. “For Fairview areas, it’s easy for them to go to our loading and unloading points. But how about those nearby areas? A lot of passengers there would also like to ride the P2P, but unfortunately we don’t have loading points there. So we actually requested the [transportation department] to allow us to also load in the Sandiganbayan area, because we feel that there’s a good demand of passengers there,” he said. Bauer, meanwhile, thinks that adding more bus routes is not the way to go for future P2P operations, but to figure out how to plug the gaps in the network. Instead of putting more P2P routes passing along EDSA, he said these routes should simply be interconnected so that passengers would have to transfer to existing buses that already run on the main thoroughfare. But Bauer also acknowledged the difficulties in implementing this plan, pointing out the many laws and agreements between the government and transport operators, and the many business interests that would have to be considered.  Future of P2P With demand increasing, the P2P service looks to be viable in the long run, but Bauer believes this would also largely depend on the operators’ ability to keep the service attractive to passengers. Making sure the buses run on time is a key priority, since this is one of the main reasons why passengers prefer the P2P service over ordinary buses that don’t have a guaranteed departure time. But it’s harder than it sounds, because Froehlich has had instances where some of its drivers arrive late or don’t turn up to work at all. “It’s very hard to find qualified drivers who understand the responsibility they have. They don’t mind if they don’t go to work,” he said. To address this, the company has had to offer incentives to keep drivers punctual. Froehlich Tours’ drivers can earn an additional P600 a day, on top of their regular monthly salary. With salaried drivers, well-maintained buses, and passengers who patronize the rides, the P2P bus service can look enticing to transport operators looking to enter the business. But Bauer thinks that high standards should be maintained to keep the service going. Running P2P buses means more than just branding it as a point-to-point buses; the units themselves must have premium amenities to justify the higher fares and premium bus experience. “P2P is still a great product for the country. If you give operators the freedom that any operator can interbreed P2P on its own way, it will die. So we have to set standards on operators,” he said. – with reports from Addie Pobre and Cathrine Gonzales/Rappler.com Check out the fares and schedules on the P2P buses here: Froehlich Tours, RRCG Transport, HM Transport"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/157499-ltfrb-rejects-uber-grab-franchise-applications/","title":"LTFRB rejects 15,000 Uber, Grab applications","date":"Jan 5, 2017 11:56 PM PHT","snippet":"Applicants submitted incomplete requirements or did not appear at hearings","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday, January 5, said it dismissed nearly half of franchise applications – over 15,000 out of some 32,000 – for ride-hailing services Grab and Uber.

Winston “Winnie” Castelo has filed House Bill No. 4669 or the No Price Surge Act, banning the “exorbitant” and “undue” ride rate surges by transport network companies (TNCs), like Uber and Grab. Castelo on Monday, December 26 slammed the price surging of Uber and Grab, saying the practice is unfair and predatory for the riding public. This was after the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) received complaints about price surges ranging from P2,000 to P28,000 this holiday season. Because of the complaints, Grab and Uber would put a cap to its pricing this holiday season. (READ: After LTFRB warning, Uber PH limits surge until January 15) “The said bill, if approved, will permanently protect the helpless the commuters from undue and exorbitant price fixing by [Uber and Grab],” Castelo said. Aside from banning price surges, Castelo said the bill would also put a cap in the number of vehicles under each TNC. In the Philippines, ride-hailing applications such as Grab or Uber are categorized as TNC. All vehicles under TNC must get permits from the LTFRB, which also grants and denies permits for taxis, buses, and other public transport vehicles. Not different from ‘contracting’ Castelo, who is the chairman of the House Committee on Metro Manila Development, said the price surging “makes Uber and Grab not so different with the much complained taxis that resort to ‘contracting’ instead of using the meter.” “While we thought that these providers serve as a better mode of public transportation for our people, they appear to be just the same with or worse than erring taxi cabs that charge passengers more than what the meter says,” Castelo added. Under the price surge practice, passengers of Uber and Grab can be charged as high as thrice the price of the usual rate when traffic condition is bad and demand for their service is high. “So how does the transport network vehicle service industry now become a friendly alternative each time this unfortunate situation happens to their poor patrons?” Castelo asked. He said “there should be a limit to the number of vehicles to avoid road congestion otherwise our efforts to ease traffic in Metro Manila would be rendered useless.” As the taxi industry has no monopoly of abusive and discourteous drivers, Castelo said he found it necessary for Uber, Grab drivers to undergo proper training. “This will help make sure that they truly make the difference. A polite and smart driver is as important as arriving safely in one’s destination,” the lawmaker said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/156647-daily-news-highlights-december-26-2016-edition/","title":"#ThewRap: Things you need to know, December 26, 2016","date":"Dec 26, 2016 11:33 AM PHT","snippet":"Hello!

Uber cited the suspension of transport network vehicle service (TNVS) applications since July as a reason for the price surge. “Since the suspension of TNVS applications in July, we have been in frequent dialogues with the LTFRB to find workable solutions to meet the increasing demand for ridesharing options and avoid price increases brought about by disproportionate supply and demand, longer wait times for riders, or having no available cars on the road,” Uber said. The LTFRB, meanwhile, has asked commuters to report any violation by calling its 24/7 hotline 1342 or sending pictures or screenshots of said incidents to complaint.ltfrb.gov.ph@gmail.com. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/146763-grab-raises-750m-investors/","title":"Ride-hailing firm Grab raises $750M from investors","date":"Sep 20, 2016 12:51 PM PHT","snippet":"The new investments led by Japan's SoftBank Group raises the Singapore-based firm's total capital to more than $1.0 billion","body":" SINGAPORE – Ride-hailing startup Grab said Tuesday, September 20, it has raised $750 million from investors to expand in burgeoning Southeast Asian markets including Indonesia, as it aims to build its lead over US-based rival Uber in the region. The new investments led by Japan’s SoftBank Group raised the Singapore-based firm’s total capital to more than $1.0 billion, it said in a statement. Competition between Uber and local startups has grown fierce in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and a rising middle class. Grab is considered the leading ride-hailing platform in the region, operating in nearly twice as many cities as Uber, with the startup claiming up to 1.5 million bookings a day. Singapore state investment agency Temasek Holdings was an early investor in the firm.  Grab said participants in the recent round of fundraising included both new and existing investors which it did not name, but reports last month said China’s Didi Chuxing was among those planning to back the firm. The two companies are already partners in an alliance that also includes India’s Ola and US-based Lyft Inc, allowing users to book rides while traveling to a country covered by any of the 4 apps. Grab chief executive and co-founder Anthony Tan said the latest investment was “the largest in the history of Southeast Asia consumer technology”. “We are particularly excited about the growth opportunity in Indonesia, where we see an almost US$15 billion market for ride-hailing services alone,” he said. The move follows Uber’s decision to sell its business in China to Didi Chuxing last month, ending a ferocious battle for market share that cost both firms billions. Grab operates in Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Its core product platform includes private cars, motorbikes and taxi-hailing services which are rapidly gaining popularity in the region.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/143070-intramuros-grabkalesa-promotion/","title":"Going around Intramuros?

She wakes up early to catch a UV Express shuttle from her home in Cainta, then walks the last few meters to her office in the Ortigas business district.  For pharmacist Erika Guanzon, the trip from her home in Sucat to her Bonifacio Global City office involves a shuttle and a taxi ride, which costs an average of P270. She wakes up early every day, because there’s no telling how long the shuttle queues will be – and what time the vehicles will leave. These are stories that have become all too common in the Philippine capital region, where traffic is hellish and long, and stressful commutes are more the norm than the exception. Desperate Metro Manila residents turn to various transportation options just to ease their daily suffering, increasingly trying out tech-based solutions as an answer. Sioson and Guanzon both found their own solutions through carpooling. Sioson recounted how she saw a Facebook ad promoting a new service. At the time she decided to try it out, the Germany-based company Wunder was just a month into its operations in Manila. Months since her first carpool ride, Sioson now helps manage a community of Wunder users from the eastern part of Metro Manila. The group – now 400-members strong – coordinates on pick-up points and departure times, routes, and the number of car seats available for shared rides. The whole process, coordinated via a group chat on Viber, is systematic and organized. There’s a template that drivers use to post available seats. There’s an etiquette guide for potential riders. The group bans riders who are rude or who turn up late at designated meeting points. Coming from her frustration of the hassle of everyday commute came a concerted effort to look for a sustainable and viable transport solution. It’s the marriage of technology and community organizing, as commuters take matters into their own hands to create solutions that the government cannot currently provide. Addressing safety concerns Carpooling has long been touted as one solution to the traffic menace. Last year, a government agency launched its own carpooling app which makes use of social media profiles, similar to Wunder’s approach. More recently, popular ride-hailing service Uber launched its own version, UberPOOL, which promises cheaper fares to compensate for potentially longer travel time and detours.  But Wunder sells itself as a “real carpooling service,” in that it operates on a not-for-profit model, according to the firm’s Manila community manager Arnold Cesar Romero. (READ: Getting around Manila through tech-based carpooling) “Drivers in Wunder are only allowed to set their everyday travel details from home to work and back. The app will not be able to handle intervening travels in between, thus discouraging users from using Wunder for commercial purposes. Further, the costs that passengers share are set by the application and are calculated so that profit cannot be made,” Romero said. Romero said the most active neighborhoods in their system come from Malabon, Caloocan, and Marikina, with many of the riders heading to business districts in Makati, Pasig, and Taguig. Based on their data, riders save around 21 hours every month compared to taking public transportation. Drivers also earn up to P5,000 every month for sharing empty seats in their cars. But carpooling services share the same challenge: getting riders to be comfortable with the concept of sharing rides. Both UberPOOL and Wunder require registration; Wunder also links social network profiles so that riders and drivers can check out each other’s profile and decide whether or not to share the ride. Guanzon acknowledged that everyone would feel cautious on their first carpool experience. Before taking a ride, she would look at the Facebook profile of the driver, checking to see if they have common friends. In Sioson’s case, she figured that since they are all working professionals, her safety won’t be compromised.  Romero also attributes Wunder’s acceptance in the Philippine market to the Filipino trait of being sociable. “Wunder in the Philippines grew enormously since its launch in February 2016 because Filipinos are inherently trusting and caring individuals who are willing to share what they have – for drivers, that empty seat in the car and for passengers, a few pesos for gas or toll,” he said. “The one thing they don’t want to share is the solitary feeling of standing in line waiting to get inside a cramped, poorly ventilated public utility vehicle and be stuck in traffic for hours,” he added. Romero also pointed out that Wunder users are also organizing themselves and building micro-communities. Sioson’s group, Wunder East, is one of the most active ones; the group has even formed personal bonds with each other, organizing meetups and movie nights. Advocacy While Wunder users come from different backgrounds – from lawyers to accountants to BPO professionals – they have one thing in common: they’re fed up with the daily stress of traveling around Metro Manila. Sioson believes it’s this – plus their initiative of creating a community of like-minded individuals – that got Wunder members from the eastern part of Metro Manila to organize themselves. The trips cost a little more than usual – the P60 fare, Sioson admits, is more expensive than a UV Express ride – but she gets point-to-point service and the assurance of a ride, minus the long lines and uncertainty of getting a seat in time to get to work. “This is an advocacy for us. It came to a point where we were just so frustrated at the daily hassle of commuting,” she said. For her, it began simply as a way to add structure to the unpredictability of travel in the metro. But by organizing the group, she also got to help other frustrated commuters. “It’s a big help, especially to the mothers who used to get home at 9 pm or 10 pm and find their children already asleep. Now, they get to play with them, have dinner with their families, because they can get home at 6 pm,” she said. While better transportation options are the ultimate solution to the metro’s transport woes, citizens are making do with what they have, creating their own solutions to benefit more people – and building their own communities along the way. – Rappler.com Change the Philippines through your talent in tech. Click here to find an IT and Software job on the Rappler x Kalibrr Job Board."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/141790-uber-ltfrb-investigation-driver-rape-passenger/","title":"Uber, LTFRB investigating alleged rape of passenger","date":"Aug 3, 2016 2:30 PM PHT","snippet":"In a statement, Uber says it has removed the driver from its system and is cooperating with law enforcement agencies in the ongoing probe","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Popular ride-hailing service Uber vowed to cooperate with authorities to investigate the alleged rape of a female passenger by an Uber driver in Quezon City last week.  “First and foremost our thoughts are with the rider and her family.

In exchange for the Uber China assets, Uber and its Chinese partners will receive shares equivalent to 20% of Didi Chuxing, a statement said. The combined Chinese firm will be valued at $35 billion, Bloomberg News reported. Since Uber launched its China operations little more than two years ago both companies have spent billions of dollars on subsidies for drivers and passengers in China, as well as trading vitriolic accusations, as they fought for dominance in the potentially lucrative market. But now the companies’ founders will swap public acrimony for seats on each other’s boards, with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick joining Didi’s board of directors, and Didi’s founder Cheng Wei getting a seat at Uber’s top table. In the Didi statement Cheng said the two firms “have learned a great deal from each other over the past two years in China’s burgeoning new economy.” Earlier this year Uber said it lost $1 billion annually in China, and Didi was thought to be dropping similar amounts of money. A lengthy post on Kalanick’s verified Facebook page Monday called Uber’s battle in China a “big, bold idea” and “one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had as an entrepreneur.” “Most people thought we were naive, crazy – or both” because the firm was “a young American business entering a country where most US internet companies had failed to crack the code,” he said. His at times elegiac farewell praised the company’s China team as “the smartest and most entrepreneurial sons and daughters of China” who were “nobly serving” China’s cities. But he went on: “As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as much as following your heart.” A sustainable business was “only possible with profitability,” he said, and the merger would free up “substantial resources,” while Uber will become Didi’s largest shareholder. He signed off the post “with much UberChina love.” The deal comes days after Chinese authorities announced new rules governing ride-sharing, making clear for the first time that they may operate legally in the country. The new rules will also forbid ride-sharing platforms from operating below cost, possibly restricting their scope to offer subsidies. Rides in major cities with Uber and Didi have often cost significantly less than regular cab fares due to the payments, and many drivers work for both companies at the same time. One user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service lamented the merger, saying: “This is meant to tell us that ride-sharing is now legal and we are going to raise the price.” One Didi driver was reluctant to believe the merger Monday. “If it is true, the allowance offered by Didi or Uber now will certainly decrease.” the man, surnamed Su, told AFP. Monopoly murmurs Didi, which claims almost 90% of the China ride-hailing market, said last month that it had recently raised $7.3 billion – $1 billion of which came from Apple – in one of the world’s largest private equity financing rounds. As part of the merger, Didi Chuxing will also take a stake in Uber, with reports saying it will invest $1 billion, valuing the US firm at $68 billion. Uber has become one of the world’s most valuable startups as it has expanded to more than 50 countries. But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Its China business partners include internet search giant Baidu and state-owned Citic Securities. Didi’s backers include e-commerce titans Alibaba and Tencent, along with China Life, the country’s biggest life insurer. Analysts noted that the deal would create a massive single company with near-monopoly power in China. Commentaters on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform called for an anti-trust investigation into the tie-up. “Come and suck the Chinese people’s blood together!” wrote one user. Others saw it as a capitulation by Uber in the face of an overwhelming local rival. “Uber knows when to fold them in China, after being engaged in an incredibly expensive ride war with Didi there,” technology journalist Kara Swisher wrote on her recode.net site. “Cutting the massive losses in China and turning it into a more solid investment” would clear the way for an expected Uber public stock offering next year, she added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/140102-regular-metered-taxi-allowed-naia-terminals/","title":"Regular metered taxis now allowed at all NAIA terminals","date":"Jul 18, 2016 5:55 PM PHT","snippet":"Starting Monday, July 18, unaccredited white metered taxis can pick up and drop off passengers at all NAIA terminals","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Regular white metered taxis are now allowed to enter and pick up passengers at the arrival areas of all terminals of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), a transportation official said.

While railroad and oil tycoons used to dictate the world’s markets, tech tycoons now do so from their laptops. Even the World Economic Forum in Davos, the biggest symbol of the world’s economic elite, spelled it out when it emphasized that the Fourth Industrial Revolution would center around innovation. Countries around the world are scrambling to set up their own innovation-based ecosystems in a mad dash to recreate Silicon Valley or its Chinese equivalent, Zhongguancun, in their own backyards. One successful tech entrepreneur has an interesting take on developing local innovation, however: More often than not, innovation comes from outside. “Half of all the founders in Silicon Valley, arguably the most innovative place in the world at the moment, were born outside the US,” said Peng Ong, founder and managing director of Singapore-based venture capital firm Monk’s Hill Ventures, in an interview with Rappler. Ong is set to be one of the main speakers at Rappler’s 3rd #ThinkPH summit, Back to Disruptive Basics, on Thursday, July 21. (READ: Agenda for #ThinkPH 2016) In Silicon Valley, bigwigs include Russian-born Google co-founder Sergey Brin, South African-born Tesla founder Elon Musk, and Paris-born eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar. China is different as wealth creation in technology there is mostly steered by locals, but even then, Ong noted that many successful entrepreneurs in China are returnees. For instance, Baidu co-founders Robin Li and Eric Xu both worked in Silicon Valley before returning home and starting China’s largest search engine. “That’s a very important observation if you want to understand the nature of innovation,” Ong said. “It tells you that either the very best talent or people [who] are somehow much more driven to create innovation are from somewhere else. Immigrants, basically.” For innovation to happen, perspectives from the outside are crucial. “The influence of the thinking of people who have gone away is important because innovation is first and foremost about expertise,” Ong said, adding that this is particularly relevant in developing regions like Southeast Asia. Letting expertise in Ong emphasized that it’s possible to work around a lot of things, but talent is not one of them. Singapore, he gave as an example, created funds to allow people to aggressively invest in companies. The problem right now, however, is that getting residency for engineers is not easy. This has slowed down the growth of core engineering teams – the heart of startups – and the growth of the ecosystem. “Where would you have learned to do tech companies in the Philippines in the past? And it’s the same for Singapore and Indonesia and the rest of the region. It’s how you start, you can’t be an expert from nothing,” Ong said. The single most important policy to build an ecosystem is essentially to open up borders for people who want to work in the country or region. “We don’t have enough trained people in Southeast Asia, and this is something you’re doing in the country for the first time so you need to bootstrap somehow,” Ong said. “After all, even the most innovation-driven economy in the world, Silicon Valley, has half its founders who are immigrants. What chance do we have if you don’t open up your borders to create this?”  Driving Southeast Asia innovation Ong is in a unique position to appreciate this trend, having been a serial entrepreneur and investor in both Silicon Valley and China. The companies he founded now have a total annual turnover in the billions of dollars. Perhaps most known for co-founding online dating service Match.com, Ong also started content management service Interwoven which went public on the NASDAQ, as well as Accentuate which was acquired by IBM. In China, Ong was part of GSR Ventures, an early backer of Didi Chuxing, the world’s largest ride-hailing platform in terms of active users – larger even than Uber. Didi Chuxing recently closed a $4.5-billion round of funding that included a billion-dollar investment from Apple. Having made his mark, Ong has switched to investing in startups in Southeast Asia with the aim of making a larger impact. Big tech firms operating in the country have managed to import successful Silicon Valley models such as transportation service Grab. “Innovation doesn’t necessarily mean new ideas. Innovation most of the time is taking an old idea and applying it somewhere else or somewhat differently,” Ong said. “A lot of people in Silicon Valley have this idea that innovation has to be totally new but there’s no such thing as totally new. Google was somewhat of a rip-off of a bunch of other search companies before it and Apple also took off from what Xerox was working on. So there are no new ideas, just old ideas looked at slightly differently,” he added. Playbook already written It is the ability to see these ideas and execute them that matters, according to Ong, who shared his strategy for investing: “We look for great entrepreneurs engaging in big chunks of the economy with technology. That’s it.” He added that there are plenty of lucrative opportunities in the region – from fintech to logistics and all kinds of ecommerce. “The good news for Southeast Asia is that the playbook has already been written to some extent in China and India,” Ong said. “India is a little bit behind, but still somewhat ahead of Southeast Asia. So we know what’s going to happen, it’s not rocket science.” The region doesn’t have the population base that China has, but if you look at what’s boomed in tech in China in the past decade or so – payments, ecommerce, logistics, among others – these will be taking off in the region, too. “It will play out here but faster than it played out in China. It played out in China over 10 to 15 years,” Ong said. “It will play out over 5 years in Southeast Asia because we don’t have to relearn stuff that the Chinese already did.” – Rappler.com If you want to know more about the impact of technology on society and exponential organizations, check the full agenda and list of speakers for #ThinkPH 2016 here."},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/139687-hungary-uber-suspension-ride-hailing-app/","title":"In EU first, Uber suspends Hungary service","date":"Jul 14, 2016 1:45 PM PHT","snippet":"The suspension comes as Hungary prepares to enforce a law that allows authorities to block 'a provider of taxi services operating without a proper dispatch center'","body":" BUDAPEST, Hungary – Embattled US ride-hailing service Uber announced Wednesday, July 13, its first suspension in an EU country, saying its will halt operations in Hungary on July 24 because of new legislation making it “impossible” to operate. The same day, a new law comes into force that allows the Hungarian authorities to block “a provider of taxi services operating without a proper dispatch center” for up to one year. An Uber statement said that the legislation passed by parliament last month “makes it impossible for Hungarian drivers, in spite of having licenses and properly paying taxes, to use their own vehicles to make money.” The US company has become one of the world’s most valuable startups, worth some $50 billion (44 billion euros), as it has expanded to more than 50 countries including 21 EU member countries other than Hungary. Last month Saudi Arabia pumped $3.5 billion into the company to help it fund further growth. The firm says it is not a transport company like taxi firms, and that it simply connects drivers with passengers. But it has faced regulatory hurdles and protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched. Last week a French court fined it 800,000 euros ($900,000). In Europe, Uber has filed complaints with Brussels against France, Germany, and Spain, arguing that restrictive national or city policies are in violation of European Union law. ‘Punishing innovation’ Since Uber entered the Hungarian market in November 2014, around 1,200 drivers and 160,000 riders have registered with the company. The new law followed months of protests by licensed taxi drivers who complained that orders have been decreasing sharply. They say Uber drivers – who often charge significantly cheaper fares – should be subject to the same stringent rules regulating official cabs. Uber’s head in Hungary told AFP on Wednesday however that the legislation “punishes innovation, is disadvantageous to both competition and consumers, and provides no advantage to the state.” Around 39-40% of Uber trips were ordered by foreigners, and most of their clients were between 20 and 35 years old, Zoltan Fekete said. “On several occasions we signaled our willingness to help put together a modern set of regulations, but there was no interest for that,” he said. A government ministry said that Uber had decided to leave Hungary “rather than to agree to operate legally and compete fairly on the market with tax-paying Hungarian taxi drivers.” “The government supports innovative solutions, but is committed to ensuring that players on the passenger transport market operate according to the law and pay taxes under equal terms,” said a statement by the National Development Ministry published by the MTI news agency. “Uber acquired an edge over other market competitors by dodging taxes and disregarding rules and regulations.” Uber hopes one day to restart its service in Hungary, said Robbie Khazzam, the firm’s boss in Central Europe. “Hungary stands out as the exception and not the rule,” he told AFP. “We are definitely not giving up on Hungary.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/139143-carpooling-services-metro-manila/","title":"Getting around Manila through tech-based carpooling","date":"Jul 10, 2016 9:00 AM PHT","snippet":"Services like Wunder and uberPOOL indicate that Filipinos are more open to sharing their rides even with complete strangers to get around Manila's congested roads","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In the daytime, Metro Manila is home to around 20 million people. At any given time, thousands are on the move: heading to the office, going home, running from one meeting to another. All this movement is a burden to a transport system that’s woefully inadequate to deal with the demand. The trains are either bursting at the seams or suffering technical glitches; buses are full to brimming. Private cars with a passenger or two crawl along EDSA, while passengers try to hail taxis sometimes pressured to pay additional tips. In the last couple of years, the Philippines has seen the entry of app-based ride-hailing services that provide passengers with transport options at the touch of a button. Uber and Grab are the best-known names in the industry, providing passengers with their own cars simply by using their smartphones. But critics say these services are exacerbating the traffic problem. They point out that enterprising businessmen buy more vehicles and hire drivers for Uber and Grab, essentially increasing the number of vehicles crowding an already congested road network. Transport officials have underscored their focus in proposing solutions: move more people, not cars. Last year, the Metropolitan Manila Development Agency launched an app to encourage Facebook friends to start carpooling. There have also been suggestions to allot a high-occupancy lane along EDSA exclusively for cars with 3 or more passengers. (READ: Taming Manila traffic: Hits and misses of 2015) Last month, Uber followed suit with the launch of its newest ride-sharing service, uberPOOL. The company said this aims to put more people into fewer cars, coordinating the logistics of a traditional carpool setup using technology. The new service promises a fixed fare that’s estimated to be 25% cheaper than usual UberX fares. In exchange for cheaper fares, passengers have to share the ride with others, and they should expect longer travel time as the vehicle makes several detours to pick up or drop off other riders. As with Uber’s initial launch in Manila two years ago, the concept of uberPOOL carried with it a degree of uncertainty, said Uber Manila’s general manager Laurence Cua. But, he added, Filipinos’ quick adoption to uberPOOL showed that they’re becoming more open to trying out new technology solutions. “I think what we’re learning is that people in the Philippines are very tech-savvy, they’re very progressive, very open-minded about embracing new concepts. And with technology, something like carpooling becomes safer and more convenient because you don’t have to match or pre-plot…With uberPOOL, we knew that we could solve those problems efficiently with a tap of a button,” Cua said. Carpooling with tech But before uberPOOL was launched, another carpooling app had already entered the Philippine market. European carpooling app Wunder launched earlier this year, with the goal of connecting riders with others who have empty seats in their car. Unlike Uber and Grab, trips on Wunder are limited, so that passengers only chip in for the cost of gas as drivers travel to or from their destination. It is not meant to be a profit-making business. The launch of carpooling apps in the Philippines may indicate that Filipinos are not hesitant to take to the ride-sharing concept. (READ: Uberpool in Manila: Adjusting to the metro’s unpredictable traffic) “Carpooling in general is not a very new concept, especially for the Philippines. We’re a very communal people, we’re very friendly. And we don’t mind sharing things, mabait tayo eh…People are just more socially dynamic,” Cua said, noting the positive feedback two weeks since the launch of uberPOOL. But the traditional carpooling setup, where groups of people discuss what time to leave and where to meet up, is a process that’s been made easier by technology. Instead of having to pre-determine carpool trips beforehand, these technology-based apps allow on-demand ride-sharing services. Cutting cars on the road Uber touts its carpool service as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly option: riders cut their transportation costs, while helping cut down on greenhouse gases with fewer cars on the road. “If you keep doing that again and again, with thousands and hundreds of thousands of people, then you’re now able to make scalable and high-impact changes on how people move around,” he said. But despite this new thrust in the company’s goals, Cua said drivers who want to partner with Uber should not be concerned that the company will also cut down on driver applications. He pointed out that demand for decent transportation in Metro Manila remains high. “As long as there are people who are looking for a ride to get around, then there’s gonna be demand for something like Uber. And so that should not be a concern…We do want to see more drivers use Uber, and the main reason for that is there are people looking for their services,” he said. The carpooling service also aims to discourage people from buying more cars, which end up being underutilized in parking lots anyway, Cua added. But what about criticism that Uber is actually encouraging people to buy more cars? Cua pointed out that car ownership has been steadily growing over the last 10 years, buoyed by more purchasing power for consumers and riding on a growing economy. This, Cua said, happened even before Uber entered the Philippine market. When Uber entered the scene, it became an avenue for drivers to make extra income to help pay for the vehicle that they would have bought anyway, Cua said. He also said that the company is hoping to discuss with government the current limitations on the cars allowed on Uber. Currently, only cars that are 3 years old or newer are allowed on Uber, but Cua said they’re eyeing to relax this as long as the vehicle is still in good shape. By doing this, drivers won’t feel compelled to get a new vehicle, he added. “Rather than having it sit in a parking lot or forcing people to buy new cars, let’s just use what’s out there and put them on UberPOOL, or even just UberX, or both. Now the concept of car-sharing can tap into more underutilized assets,” he said. Complementary government solutions With a new set of officials handling the Metro Manila traffic situation, Cua hopes that ride-sharing can be more widely adopted by Filipinos and readily supported by the new administration. He also said that Internet connectivity should be improved and made more reliable, so that transport solutions that rely on technology would be more efficient. Improving public transportation systems should remain a top priority, he added. In developed countries with efficient public transport, Uber plays a role in addressing the last-mile problem, or ferrying riders from the bus or train station to their final destination. “Here in Manila we know it’s already happening on some level, and as infrastructure gets better, Uber can also play a complementary role to help out those people who use those modes of transport,” he added. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/136674-china-didi-chuxing-new-capital/","title":"China’s Uber rival Didi Chuxing raises $7.3B in new capital","date":"Jun 16, 2016 10:00 PM PHT","snippet":"The ride-hailing app says it will use the funds to upgrade its technology, conduct research, improve rider/driver experience, and explore new opportunities","body":" BEIJING, China – Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a bitter rival of US-based Uber, has raised $7.3 billion in one of the world’s largest private equity financing rounds, the company said in a statement Thursday, June 16. Didi is locked in a war of attrition with Uber over drivers and riders but claims almost 90% of the market in the world’s most populous nation, with about 300 million registered passengers and more than 14 million rides a day. The funds “will be used for technology upgrading, big data research and operations, investments in improving rider/driver experience, as well as explorations into new business lines and opportunities,” the statement said. Following the closing of this round, Didi stands as one of the world’s best-funded Internet companies with approximately $10.5 billion in disposable funds. The latest financing deals value the firm at close to $28 billion, Bloomberg News reported. The huge fundraising includes $4.5 billion in equity investment from backers such as Apple – which forked out $1 billion last month – and Chinese backers like China Life, the country’s biggest life insurer. Apple’s injection was the “single largest investment the company has ever received,” Didi said when the deal was announced. Mainland Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent also have investments in the company, which said the round included a debt package worth $2.5 billion from China Merchants Bank. Chief executive Cheng Wei said: “We are greatly inspired by strong support from investors worldwide.” Didi has invested in Uber’s US rival Lyft last year, along with Alibaba and Tencent, and announced last month that it would cooperate with it to compete with Uber on its own turf. Didi is “targeting” a listing in New York next year, Bloomberg News has reported, citing unnamed people “familiar with the matter.” (READ: Didi Chuxing denies initial public offering reports) Uber, which has received funding from Chinese search firm Baidu along with state-owned Citic Securities, has said it wants to delay its listing plans as long as possible, Bloomberg News reported. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/136477-uber-carpool-move-people-fewer-cars/","title":"Uber’s carpool service aims to move more people in fewer cars","date":"Jun 15, 2016 12:41 PM PHT","snippet":"uberPOOL aims to provide passengers with cheaper fares while using fewer cars – its contribution to help ease Metro Manila's traffic woes","body":" MANILA, Philippines – Transport network company Uber on Wednesday, June 15, launched its newest carpooling service that aims to provide on-demand rides to its passengers, while using fewer cars in a bid to avoid worsening the traffic problem in Metro Manila.  The newest uberPOOL service allows passengers to share their rides with up to 3 other people heading to the same destination, and pay fares that are typically 25% cheaper than the company’s cheapest service, UberX.  Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua said riders only need to select the uberPOOL option on the app, select their destination, and choose how many people they want to share the ride with. The system then calculates a route to pick up and drop off the passengers.   Because it is a ride-sharing service instead of a point-to-point service, it may take a bit longer for passengers to get to their destination. But Cua said that the benefits outweigh a few minutes of waiting. (READ: UberPOOL in PH: How Uber’s carpool feature works)  “It does change a little bit of behavior, but we do think overall, in the bigger scheme of things, that additional 5 to 10 minutes is worth the effort. It’s not too big of an inconvenience, and it will help in taking cars off the road,” Cua said in an interview during the service’s launch at the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) compound in Quezon City. Cua said the latest service is the company’s solution to Metro Manila’s traffic woes, which cost the Philippines P2.4 billion a day in productivity losses. Experts have also pointed to the boom of car sales as one of the causes behind the gridlock in the metro.  Currently, 40 cities around the world have the uberPOOL service. Since it was first launched in 2014, Uber said more than 100 million rides have been taken using the service.  Aside from providing cheaper fares for passengers, Cua said the new service would also benefit drivers and the environment. Since passengers share rides, drivers would have less idle time waiting for passengers. Fewer cars would also be needed on the roads – which, in turn, would cut harmful carbon dioxide emissions. Based on its estimates, Uber said that its carpooling service has saved about 1.8 million gallons of gas and 16,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions in the first 4 months of 2016 alone. LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez also expressed his support for uberPOOL, noting its contribution to helping ease congestion in Metro Manila. He also clarified that there will be no new franchises issued for the new carpooling service. “UberPOOL will use UberX cars. This is not a new franchise. All those that were authorized already will be using the same authority, so no authority, no new license will be issued,” Ginez said. Meanwhile, Cua assured passengers that sharing their rides with others won’t compromise their safety. He said that all Uber users are validated because they are required to provide their credit card information and mobile number, among others, before using the ride-hailing service.  “Drivers on Uber cannot just pick passengers off the street. When you register, you have to have a credit card, mobile number, email. So everything is tracked. And besides that, we have a support system in the backend. If a passenger has a complaint, they can email and we respond very quickly,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/135092-uber-saudi-investment-fund/","title":"Uber raises $3.5B from Saudi investment fund","date":"Jun 2, 2016 2:20 PM PHT","snippet":"The investment boosts Uber's cash holdings to more than $11 billion, giving its global expansion plans a lift","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Uber announced Wednesday, June 1, that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia has pumped $3.5 billion into the ride-sharing giant, helping fuel its global expansion plans. Terms of the investment give what was already one of the largest venture-funded startups a valuation, or implied value, of $62.5 billion, according to the company. The deal comes as Saudi Arabia strives to diversify its economy away from reliance on oil production to include more entrepreneurship, open markets, and productivity. The new funding also helps Uber’s global expansion, including in the Middle East and North Africa, which the company sees as among its fastest-growing regions. In addition to the investment, which will boost Uber’s cash holdings to more than $11 billion, the head of the Saudi fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, is joining the Uber board. “We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,” Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a statement. “Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.” Rumayyan said in a statement that the fund “is excited to have completed this important strategic investment with Uber, an extraordinary company with an inspiring mission.” He added that the plan fits with the kingdom’s Vision 2030, the blueprint for diversifying its economy away from oil. According to Uber, the company is committed to investing $250 million in the region, which includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Qatar, and Morocco. In Saudi Arabia, around 80% of Uber’s riders are women, the company said, explaining that the service can help improve mobility for women, who cannot drive in the country and typically avoid public taxis. Egypt tightens reins Egypt in March said it will regulate ride-hailing services Uber and Careem after they sparked protests by taxi drivers in Cairo over allegations the smartphone apps bypass regulations. Cab drivers contend that not only are they losing clients to Uber and Careem, but the two services use vehicles that are unregistered for ferrying commuters. Egypt’s Cabinet said the authorities would take steps to regulate the two ride-hailing services. Uber and Careem drivers would “have to pay taxes” and their apps would need to establish a “suitable framework for traditional taxi drivers to join them,” the Cabinet maintained. San Francisco-based Uber has expanded to hundreds of cities worldwide, despite complaints from established taxi operators and regulators. Eyes on oil Saudi Arabia’s push to diversify away from oil comes amid a significant global oversupply. OPEC, which pumps about a 3rd of the world’s crude, has contributed to the chronic problem, led by kingpin Saudi Arabia. Some OPEC ministers expressed hope that the oil market would improve in the second half of the year after prices took a beating from abundant supplies as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prepared to open its biannual meeting Thursday, June 2, in Vienna. However most analysts do not expect the 13-nation cartel will announce any measure to reduce output, especially since prices have rebounded nearly 90% from February lows. – Sophie Estienne, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/134222-volkswagen-toyota-ridesharing-uber-gett/","title":"Volkswagen, Toyota buy into ridesharing","date":"May 25, 2016 4:15 PM PHT","snippet":"Toyota signs a memorandum of understanding with Uber to explore collaboration, while Volkswagen makes a strategic investment in Gett","body":" SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Toyota and Volkswagen announced separate partnerships Tuesday, May 24, with rideshare companies Uber and Gett, in the latest such moves by major carmakers. Japan’s Toyota and ridesharing titan Uber said they had entered into a memorandum of understanding to explore collaboration, starting with trials in countries where ridesharing is expanding. “Through this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient, and attractive mobility services to customers,” Shigeki Tomoyama, senior managing officer of Toyota Motor Corporation, said in a joint statement. The deal includes a strategic investment by the Toyota Financial Services Corporation and its Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership, although no figure was disclosed. The partnership will create new leasing options enabling car buyers to lease their vehicles from Toyota Financial Services and cover their payments with what they make as Uber drivers. Toyota and Uber are also exploring collaboration on developing in-car apps and setting up a program to sell Toyota and Lexus vehicles to Uber. “Toyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide and we look forward to collaborating with Toyota in multiple ways going forward,” said Emil Michael, Uber’s chief business officer. Separately, German auto giant Volkswagen said it had made a $300 million strategic investment in Uber competitor Gett, which has a presence in more than 60 countries worldwide including London, Moscow, and New York. “The ride-hailing market represents the greatest market potential in on-demand mobility, while creating the technological platform for developing tomorrow’s mobility business models,” it said in a statement. Shahar Waiser, Gett’s chief executive and founder, said the company “provides VW with the technology to expand beyond car ownership to on-demand mobility for consumers and businesses.” Toyota and Volkswagen are not the first carmakers to link up with rideshare apps.

It’s not clear which of the two Silicon Valley giants will emerge on top in a contest which highlights the contrast of very different business models. For a brief time early this year, Google parent Alphabet overtook Apple as the world’s largest company by market value. Apple then regained, lost, and recovered the leader position in May in a battle that appears set to continue for some time. At the close Friday, Apple was worth some $522 billion, to $496 billion for Alphabet. The two companies have both been hugely profitable in recent years, for different reasons. Apple has delivered a line of must-have iPhones and other gadgets that have set trends around the world but now “appears to be a little bit immobile,” says Roger Kay, analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. Apple shares have slumped some 30% over the past 12 months over concerns that its stunning growth pace is slowing and that the iPhone won’t be able to rake in profits as it has up to now. Finding next thing Kay said Apple may be losing the position of innovation leader it achieved after the iPhone, with no new major hit products coming. “They haven’t really changed the nature of the game,” Kay said. “The (Apple) Watch came in, it was kind of interesting, people liked it… but developers are still searching for exactly how to use it.” Google, meanwhile, has been evolving from a pure search engine to a leader in mobile with its Android operating system. And it has at the same time been investing in “moonshots” – grand ventures that may have potential such as self-driving cars, fiber networks, and Internet balloons. Google “has positioned itself well, through organic investments and acquisitions, for most of the major trends in consumer Internet: mobile, video, local,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note. Kay said the Android system which powers some 80% of mobile handsets is a valuable franchise that helps Google’s mobile advertising efforts. “The narrative that has boosted Google is the one about technology innovation and being at the wellhead of various important technologies,” Kay said. “That may or may not finally pay off. But they’re looking. They’re using their money to try to find innovative things to make the next big thing, whatever it is.” For Apple, a key moment will come later this year with the expected unveiling of its iPhone 7, a test on whether it can keep up its innovation and entice consumers to trade up. The two companies have a virtual duopoly on the smartphone market, but Apple makes its own hardware and software while Google provides only the free Android software for handsets, including many made by low-cost manufacturers. Showing intelligence Google has been taking pains to show off its software and artificial intelligence. At its just-concluded developer conference, Google unveiled a virtual home assistant as well as an upgraded messaging platform. Google claims it is ahead of its rivals in artificial intelligence, and cites as proof its victory in the ancient game of Go by its supercomputer AlphaGo. And Google also has shown its interest in virtual reality, adapting its upcoming version of Android to deliver more lifelike images, which could help in its battle against Apple. But few are ready to count out Apple, which is known for keeping its research efforts secret, and which has a massive cash stockpile of some $233 billion. Apple is widely believed to be working on some automobile project, and recently announced a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride hailing app Didi Chuxing, the bitter rival of US-based Uber. Apple also moved to expand its global footprint by announcing plans for a development office in Hyderabad, India and a new app design center in Bangalore. Even with Apple’s share price in a slump, billionaire Warren Buffett disclosed he had taken a $1 billion stake, suggesting the shrewd investor sees Apple as undervalued. The research firm Trefis said the latest Apple investment in Didi “signals that the company could get more creative” in using its vast financial resources. – Sophie Estienne, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/133502-uber-carpool-uberpool-jakarta/","title":"Uber launches carpooling service in Southeast Asia","date":"May 18, 2016 7:01 PM PHT","snippet":"The launch of uberPOOL came just weeks after the start-up introduced a motorbike taxi service in Jakarta","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Uber launched Wednesday, May 18 a carpooling service in Jakarta allowing commuters to share journeys, as competition between ride-hailing apps intensifies in the traffic-choked Indonesian capital. It’s the first time the service – known as uberPOOL – has been offered in Southeast Asia and continues Uber’s expansion in Indonesia, one of its fastest-growing markets worldwide. The carpooling function will match passengers in the same area traveling in the same direction, enabling them to split the fare by sharing the car. Although it adds travel time, Uber says carpooling fares can be 25% cheaper than their regular service. Drivers also benefit as they collect more passengers for each journey. “Every seat is an opportunity to make money,” Uber’s regional general manager for Asia-Pacific Mike Brown told reporters. “It starts to become as competitive as taking a bus.” If it takes off, Uber believes carpooling could ease traffic in the sprawling capital, routinely ranked among the world’s worst. The scheme has proved popular elsewhere, with 20 million uberPOOL trips made every month in China, company data shows. In San Francisco, nearly half of all Uber trips are shared by passengers. US company Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, has high hopes for Jakarta. A combination of poor public transport, notorious traffic gridlock and high smartphone use by tech-savvy citizens has seen the popularity of ride-hailing apps explode in recent years. The launch of uberPOOL came just weeks after the start-up introduced a motorbike taxi service in Jakarta. The contest between Uber and its rivals – chiefly local startup Go-Jek and Southeast Asian company Grab – has been fierce. New services are constantly being offered and prices kept low, as the competing outfits battle for the millions in Jakarta who rely on their service every day. Like in other parts of the world, all have met with resistance from traditional taxi companies, who complain the tech-based services operate illegally and threaten their livelihoods. Thousands of taxi drivers staged a violent protest in March, blocking major roads in the capital, clashing with rivals and setting tyres alight. Uber meets with government officials on a weekly basis to ensure it is meeting local regulations, a process Brown said “is going very well”. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/technology/133245-didi-chuxing-denies-initial-public-offering-rumors/","title":"Didi Chuxing denies initial public offering reports","date":"May 16, 2016 6:00 PM PHT","snippet":"An earlier report says the ride-hailing app and service is targeting a New York listing in 2017, but the company denies this, saying it does 'not have IPO plans as of now'","body":" BEIJING, China – Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing is mulling an initial public offering, a report said on Monday, May 16, after US technology giant Apple invested $1 billion in the rival to Uber. Didi is “targeting” a listing in New York next year, Bloomberg News said, citing unnamed people “familiar with the matter.” The exact timing would depend on how its battle with US-based Uber goes in China, the sources were quoted as saying. Didi denied having such intentions at present. “We do not have IPO plans as of now,” a company spokeswoman told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). Apple on Friday announced it had invested $1 billion in Didi in what the Chinese firm called the single largest investment it had ever received. Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, claims to have almost 90 percent of the Chinese ride-hailing market with nearly 300 million registered passengers and more than 11 million rides a day.

The announcement comes as Apple faces headwinds in China, where it has seen huge drops in sales of its popular electronics, but is working to expand its mobile payments service and is even believed to have ambitions for driverless cars. Didi, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, is China’s largest ridesharing service, and the tie-up may serve as a way for Apple to get to know the Chinese market ahead of a long-rumored expansion into the transportation sector. “We decided to make the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including the chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,” chief executive Tim Cook told the official news agency Xinhua. Apple is thought to be one of a number of tech companies, including Google and Chinese search giant Baidu, that are developing driverless cars. The move may also be intended to help Apple expand its Apple Pay service, which faces strong Chinese competition, analysts said. The twin prospects may help soothe investors nervous about Apple’s prospects in the Middle Kingdom. The company’s shares have dropped more than 13% since April 26, when it reported its first ever fall in iPhone sales, largely due to waning interest from Chinese consumers. On Thursday, May 12, the stock closed down 2.4%, losing its coveted spot as the world’s biggest publicly traded company to Google parent company Alphabet. The fall from grace, blamed on the company’s failure to expand into the lower-priced handsets popular in developing markets, came amid a string of bad news from China. Last month, authorities shut down Apple’s movie and book services. Adding insult to injury, it was revealed to have lost a court case over the use of its iPhone trademark. Hoping for a turnaround, Cook will travel to Beijing later this month to lobby senior leaders. ‘Burning through cash’ Didi, which also has backing from Chinese Internet behemoths Tencent and Alibaba, likely hopes to use the deal to strike a death blow to US-based Uber, its main competitor for the Chinese ridesharing market. Apple’s injection was the “single largest investment the company has ever received,” said Didi, which dominates the car-hailing sector in China and says it has almost 90% of the market. Uber, which has received funding from Baidu, along with state-owned Citic Securities – is a small, but scrappy competitor. Didi and Uber both have deep pockets and have been locked in a war of attrition for riders. In February, Uber said it lost $1 billion annually in China as it competes for market share and Didi is thought to be dropping similar amounts as both companies subsidize users’ rides, which are much cheaper than regular cab fares. Last September, Didi’s president Jean Liu said the company was “burning through cash”, according to a report by Bloomberg News. ‘Large user base’ Though Apple’s investment in Didi is large, the deal seems more notable for its strategic rather than financial significance. There are “lots of opportunities for closer cooperation between the two companies,” Cook told Xinhua. One area they are likely to explore is mobile payments, according to Chinese analysts who say the investment could be a good opportunity for Apple Pay. The service was recently launched in China but has to contend with well established existing competitors owned by Alibaba and Tencent – now its fellow shareholders in Didi. Didi says it has more than 300 million passengers registered and provides over 11 million rides a day – numbers that provide an excellent opportunity for Apple Pay, according to an article on Chinese web site Huxiu. “It is undoubtedly a good value for Apple to tie up with an app that has a large user base and where frequent payments are made,” it said. It is technically illegal in China for private cars to offer rides for payment, and authorities occasionally stage stings to arrest drivers, but regulations are not often enforced, creating an opening for ridesharing services to flourish.

Car makers Ford and Volvo along with ride-sharing start-up Uber’s rival Lyft rounded out a roster of 5 founding members of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. Former US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Strickland was named as coalition counsel and spokesperson. “Self-driving vehicle technology will make America’s roadways safer and less congested,” Strickland said in a release. “The best path for this innovation is to have one clear set of federal standards, and the coalition will work with policymakers to find the right solutions that will facilitate the deployment of self-driving vehicles.” The US Department of Transportation has estimated that self-driving vehicles could help significantly reduce the severity and frequency of crashes, the vast majority of which are caused by human error in this country, according to the coalition. “Self driving cars can help save millions of lives as well as cut congestion in our cities,” an Uber spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry. “That’s an exciting future, and one Uber intends to be a part of.” Google, Lyft, and auto industry executives urged lawmakers last month to help create a regulatory fast lane to facilitate the introduction of self-driving cars. In testimony at a Senate hearing, representatives of General Motors and auto-equipment maker Delphi touted what they said were numerous safety and environmental benefits of autonomous vehicles. Chris Urmson, who heads the Google self-driving car project, said a consistent regulatory framework is important to deploying those technologies, and that conflicting rules in US states could limit innovation. “The leadership of the federal government is critically important given the growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars,” he said. In the past two years, 23 states have introduced legislation that affect self-driving cars, “all of which include different approaches and concepts,” he noted. Five states have passed such legislation, all with different rules, Urmson said. But the Senate panel should exercise caution, said Mary Cummings, who heads the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She said it’s not yet clear that self-driving cars can operate safely in all situations. “I am wholeheartedly in support of the research and development of self-driving cars,” she said. “But these systems will not be ready for fielding until we move away from superficial demonstrations to principled, evidenced-based tests and evaluations.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/129496-grab-ubermotor-gojek-test-cheap-taxi-cab/","title":"I tested UberMotor and here’s what I found out","date":"Apr 15, 2016 6:37 PM PHT","snippet":"How does UberMotor compare to other motorbike apps?","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Want to try a new motorcycle taxi service in Jakarta? A new motorcycle taxi app service – UberMotor, entered an already highly competitive motorbike-cab market in Indonesia on Tuesday, April 12. Uber launched a motorbike taxi service – UberMotor, to compete with Grab and Go-Jek, which is widely used by Indonesian commuters. The drivers of UberMotor wear a black jacket representing their company, as well as a helmet with the Uber logo on it – similar to Grab or Go-Jek drivers. I tried to hail UberMotor at around 9 am in Kuningan City in South Jakarta on April 13, a day after it launched, but I couldn’t find any drivers through the app at that time. The app showed there were no motors available.  Cheaper Later that evening, I successfully ordered an UberMotor near National Monument from Monas to my home. The trip was a 5-kilometer ride, and surprisingly cost me only “Rp 3.500” or $0.26. The fare stunned me. Can you buy anything with that price? It was especially a shocker compared to GrabBike’s minimum fare: Rp 10.000 ($0.76). Acording to Uber’s official website, the base fare is Rp.1.000 ($0.076) and it charges customers another Rp.1.000 per km and and Rp100 ($0.0076) per minute. Payment options are also different. I can pay my UberMotor fare with cash or credit card, while GrabBike and GoJek only accepts cash. It seems that UberMotor has the upper hand with its local rivals GoJek and Grab, however because it is so new, it might take you more than 10 minutes to request a UberMotor.Long wait  I waited for 15 minutes for UberMotor, and I could not find any driver when I tried the app at the first time. Meanwhile, it takes me less than 5 minutes to grab a motorbike using Grab. “I think there are only 200 drivers today,” the UberMotor rider told me. He said that he worked for GoJek before. Uber’s expansion to motorbikes I believe, is a benefit to Indonesian commuters. They now have more choices. However, other motorbike or taxi drivers must be unhappy with the added competition – especially taxi drivers who held a protest against ride-hailing apps in Jakarta last month. The protest turned violent, with some cab drivers attacking GoJek drivers. What has been your experience with UberMotor? Would you try it out?

UberMOTOR is a great way to help hundreds of thousands of people get access to cheap, reliable transportation, and get around Jakarta, with a little help from technology,” said Dian Safiti Wibowo, Uber’s Head of Communications in Indonesia. In a statement, uberMOTOR said its new motorbike service is the most affordable ride in town. Rides are calculated using a base fare of 1.000Rp, while every additional kilometer is charged at 1.000Rp and every minute is worth 100Rp.  Other leading motorbike service charge 15,000Rp for up to 5 km. UberMOTOR is also giving away free rides to first time users, using promo code “uberMOTOR” to get a free ride worth Rp 75,000, valid until July.  Uber’s expansion comes less than 3 weeks after a protest by cab drivers against ride-hailing apps – Uber, Grab and the motorbike service Go-Jek – turned violent.  In response to the protest, the government urged ride-hailing apps Uber and Grab to become business entities and partner with a local transport business by May 31 or face a ban.

The partnership produced the OpenTraffic Initiative, launched on Tuesday, April 5. It is designed to provide real-time data to traffic management agencies and city planners. The open source platform uses GPS data taken from smartphones in Grab’s vehicles and translates it into traffic statistics which include speeds, flows, and delays at intersections. This is done real-time with data transmitted every 6 seconds. The data is then compiled in the OpenTraffic platform where information can be used by government agencies to study critical areas in traffic management. These areas include peak hour analysis along key streets, travel time reliability, and street vulnerability to bad weather and traffic accidents.  “If governments can see precisely what traffic congestion looks like in the Philippines, it can alleviate its impact by optimizing traffic signals, revising the planning of public transportation routes and schedules, and making effective decisions for implementation of key infrastructure such as overpasses,” said Deevya Desai, Grab’s regional head of public affairs, at the platform’s launch. In addition, Grab and the World Bank plan to integrate another open source tool called DRIVER, by late May, which will provide real-time notifications of traffic incidents to government agencies. The application is designed to help governments identify and prioritize cash-prone areas and allow for faster response times. While the Philippines was chosen as the initial country to pilot the project, Grab and the World Bank plan to eventually make it available to all governments throughout Southeast Asia. “Through this initiative, the Philippines will leapfrog traditional approaches to road safety, traffic management, and planning,” said Holly Krambeck, senior transportation specialist at the World Bank.  From calculators to Excel sheets The newly launched platform will be made available to the government at zero cost. The World Bank and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) have trained 200 government staff from different agencies to use it. The initial agencies with personnel trained include the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Philippine National Police (PNP), Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and the Cebu City Transportation Office “As they say whoever controls information controls decision-making. Once you have timely and reliable info, then decision-making and implementations become easy,” said DOTC Undersecretary for Planning Rene Limcaoco. Limcaoco said the agencies will initially use the data to focus on travel patterns and durations so that they can get an accurate picture of where the demand for transportation is and to which specific destinations. With that information, he added, “the government can then plan and implement through the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), more responsive public transportation policies and/or new rules.” The upgrade was needed because, until recently, the government’s major source of traffic data came from manual surveys. Limcaoco pointed out that these surveys ran the risk of being obsolete once completed due to the length of time needed to conduct them. “It’s like moving from manual calculators to Excel,” he said. Real-time data, however, is not a panacea to all of the country’s data collection woes, according to Ricardo Sigua, director of the UP Institute of Civil Engineering. It is a good indication of the level of usage of roads but to fully understand traffic, other variables involved such as traffic law and density should also be considered, he explained. “Most of the data for this platform will be gathering from Grab drivers which is a subset of road users. To have an overall assessment of what’s going on, on the road, we need to complement this project with other activities,” Sigua said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126918-grab-uber-ultimatum-protest/","title":"Indonesia gives Grab, Uber ultimatum after protest from cab drivers","date":"Mar 24, 2016 11:07 PM PHT","snippet":"Ride-hailing apps are ordered to partner with local transport businesses or face a ban from government","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – The government Thursday, March 24 urged ride-hailing apps Uber and Grab to become business entities and partner with a local transport business by May 31 or face a ban after a protest organized by taxi drivers on Tuesday. “It’s in line with a government regulation from 2009 that all public transportation needs to be a legal entity, register and work together with legal taxi businesses,” said ministry spokesman J. A. Barata. In response to the order of government, Grab’s Indonesian unit said it was already working with a local Indonesian partner. “Grab is now trying to ensure that our partner can and will follow every requirement from the government,” said Ridzki Kramadibrata, managing director of Grab Indonesia.  There was no immediate comment from Uber. Ride-hailing apps are being blamed by taxi drivers for dwindling their income. Thousands of taxi drivers gathered in Jakarta to express their anger on Tuesday, a protest that escalated quickly and turned violent.  Once incident involved protesters attempting to rip off the jacket of an ojek or motorcycle driver, while another involved taxi drivers taking an ojek driver’s helmet and tossing it. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Free ride A day after the protests, Blue Bird taxi company provided free service for 24 hours in an attempt to restore its image following violent protests involving some of its drivers. “The meter runs but I don’t have to pay,” Stuart Burney from Australia said in Jakarta after taking Blue Bird taxi on Wednesday, March 23. “Taking a free ride offered by the taxi company is pretty good.” Burney was one of the lucky ones since many people found it difficult to hail or order a Blue Bird cab on Wednesday. Netizens also complained about the supposed lack of taxis on Twitter, saying there was no point of it being free. Some Jakartans also expressed fear of taking a Blue Bird. “I am afraid to take Blue Bird taxis even if it offers us a free ride, after seeing drivers attack ojek riders on TV,” Daboe, a commuter in Jakarta, said to Rappler. New apps like Go-Jek have also allowed commuters to hail rides with motorcycles. She also worried that ojek riders might be vengeful towards taxis. Frightened Many drivers of ojek including Go-Jek and Grab, protected themselves from being attacked the day after the protests by taking off their uniform. Instead of their jackets that showed off their companies, they wore their own shirts instead.  “I don’t want to wear my Grab jacket today,” Igun, a rider working for Grab Taxi said. “The taxi drivers attacked my co-workers,” he added. Agus, another Grab rider, said that since Tuesday, he decided to not wear his uniform. Many of his friends who work for Grab Taxi made the same choice. “Maybe I will wear my uniform tomorrow,” he said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/126810-photos-protest-jakarta-taxi-drivers/","title":"IN PHOTOS: Angry Jakarta taxi drivers violently protest ride-hailing apps","date":"Mar 23, 2016 10:31 AM PHT","snippet":"Scenes of the protest show the demonstration turned violent as drivers stopped driver of ride-hailing apps to attack them","body":"JAKARTA, Indonesia – On Tuesday, March 22, a protest organized by the Association of Public Transport Drivers (PPAD) against ride-hailing apps – Uber, Grab and the motorbike service Go-Jek – turned violent.

Drivers yelled and waved rally signs, and blasted their horns throughout the protest.   An ojek rider was also attacked by taxi drivers during the protest, and was forced to get off his motorbike and run away. Drivers smashed the rider’s helmet and overturned his motorbike then chased him.  Another rider wearing a Grab Bike jacket was stopped by taxi drivers. The drivers tried to take off his jacket.   “It is okay to protest peacefully but attacking is absolutely illegal,” Mohammad Iqbal, spokesman for the Jakarta Police, said. He added that police will surely move against those who engaged in illegal acts.  Several armed police with guns and riot shields guarded the parliament building. The Jakarta Police estimated up to 6,000 drivers were involved protest while about 6,000 police were deployed to the streets.  Traffic jams sprouted up in Jakarta as taxi drivers occupied the main street. The demonstration was 3 times the size of last week’s protest.    Driver Mustakim, working for Express Taxi, told Rappler that his earnings have dropped over 20% since Uber and Grab apps became popular. “I hope the government would close down these apps because it is so hard to get passengers now,” he said.    What do you think of the protest?

The protesters adorned their vehicles with signs saying “stop illegal taxis” and rallied in front of parliament and government buildings, in an upsurge of anger at technology they say is threatening their livelihoods. As convoys of vehicles brought downtown Jakarta to a standstill, the demonstration turned violent, with protesters jumping up and down on vehicles that refused to take part, while stone-throwing drivers and rivals from app-based services clashed in several areas of the city.  Commuters faced morning rush-hour travel chaos, with even the motorcades of President Joko Widodo and the vice president getting stuck in the gridlock, making both men late for a meeting. Some people were left bloodied and bruised, with at least one person needing hospital treatment, while police detained 60 drivers from popular motorbike taxi-hailing service Go-Jek. Anger has been growing among taxi drivers worldwide at the challenge presented by US company Uber, one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, and a flurry of other app-based services that typically offer cheaper fares than traditional transport operators. Herman, a 49-year-old taxi driver involved in the Jakarta protest, who goes by one name, said his earnings had dwindled from around 250,000 rupiah ($20) a day several months ago, to almost nothing due to the increased competition. “I haven’t paid my rent, and I need to feed my 3 children and my wife,” he said. The demonstration, which also involved motorized rickshaw and bus drivers, came after weeks of rising tensions between traditional public transport operators in the sprawling, traffic-clogged metropolis of 10 million and a flurry of new ride-hailing services.    As well as Uber, Malaysian app Grab and Go-Jek are providing stiff competition for Jakarta’s taxi drivers.   ‘Unfair competition’ Traditional taxi, motorbike taxi, and other public transport drivers are angry that the new services are offering rides at lower prices, claiming they are not paying taxes, and are operating without official permits. “Why should thousands of people who didn’t pay tax, get a permit, or undergo car checks roam the roads freely while we have had to fulfil those duties?” said Yohannis Rorimpandey, a protester who works for Blue Bird, one of Indonesia’s biggest taxi groups. After rallying outside parliament, where several tires were set alight, a large group of protesters moved to the communications ministry, demanding that the minister block the apps. Uber and other app-based services currently operate in a legal gray area in Indonesia, and there is a division in the government about how to handle them. Indonesian law gives a narrow definition of “public transport,” which does not include the ride-hailing apps, and the transport ministry has sought to ban them.  However the communications ministry has refused to block the services, saying that it is committed to supporting the growth of the digital economy. Jakarta police said that up to 6,000 drivers were involved in Tuesday’s protest, and 6,000 officers were out on the streets for the protest. It was the second anti-app protest by drivers in the space of a week, although the first was on a much smaller scale. However, there was little sympathy for the protesters among commuters caught in the rush-hour travel chaos in the heaving capital. “Must it be anarchy? This only scares passengers and makes them prefer app-based taxis,” said Twitter user Petricia Yuvita. And there was no sign that the government was ready to give in to the protesters’ demands. “You can’t defy technology, it just needs to be regulated,” said Vice President Jusuf Kalla. – Olivia Rondonuwu, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/126147-egypt-regulate-uber-careem/","title":"Egypt to regulate Uber, Careem ride-hailing services","date":"Mar 17, 2016 1:20 PM PHT","snippet":"Egyptian authorities will first review other countries' legislation for ride-hailing services like Uber and Careem","body":" CAIRO, Egypt – Egypt said on Wednesday, March 16, it will regulate ride-hailing services Uber and Careem after they sparked protests from taxi drivers in Cairo over allegations the smartphone applications bypass traffic regulations. Conventional taxi drivers are up in arms as more and more commuters opt for the two apps for rides in the Egyptian capital. The cab drivers protest that not only they are losing clients to Uber and Careem, but the two services use vehicles that are unregistered for ferrying commuters. Egypt’s cabinet said the authorities would take steps to regulate the two ride-hailing services. The parliamentary affairs ministry would “prepare legal amendments to regulate the applications after reviewing similar legislation in other countries,” the cabinet said, adding the changes would be presented within a month. Uber and Careem drivers would also “have to pay taxes” and their apps would need to establish a “suitable framework for traditional taxi drivers to join them,” the cabinet said in a statement. Earlier this month, Uber agreed with the Moscow government to use only officially licensed taxi drivers. Since its launch in San Francisco 5 years ago, Uber has enjoyed spectacular global growth, and is now operating in more than 60 countries. It began services in Egypt from November 2014. The United Arab Emirates-based Careem, which operates across 20 cities in the Middle East, has also made inroads in Egypt. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/125398-cairo-uber-careem-taxi-drivers/","title":"In crowded Cairo, ride-hailing apps leave cabbies fuming","date":"Mar 10, 2016 10:30 PM PHT","snippet":"The Egyptian capital is one of Uber's fastest growing markets, and taxi drivers are complaining","body":" CAIRO, Egypt – For 32-year-old banker Hani, it was always a nightmare riding in Cairo’s battered taxis through traffic gridlock and thick exhaust fumes that sputter out of rickety vehicles. But with the arrival of ride-hailing apps Uber and Careem, Hani now travels with ease across the vast city of 25 million – notorious for its dusty streets and polluted air. The use of the smartphone applications has taken off in Cairo, so much so that Uber says the Egyptian capital is one of its fastest growing markets. But not everyone is happy. Taxi drivers have been protesting against them for weeks as they lose more and more clients to the rival services. Many commuters have taken to social media to share their experiences. “I took a taxi with my children, and the driver lit a cigarette. I asked him to stop, but he said there is pollution everywhere and made us get out on a bridge,” Egyptian singer Samia Jaheen tweeted. Commuters like Hani say they are tired of conventional taxis and see the new options as a welcome change. “I think and my friends also feel that these apps have made life easy,” said Hani, who uses Uber or Careem at least twice a week. “Some use Uber even to send their children to school.” Hani’s frustration with taxis is common in Cairo, where a typical ride in a traditional black or white cab tests the patience of most people. Journeys often start with the driver ruminating over whether to take the trip, and then they often suggest a price or ask “how much will you pay.” ‘They’ve snatched our bread’ The suggestion of turning on the meter is often a non-starter for drivers. On the other hand, many of them are rigged to make fares more expensive. After a deal is agreed, a hair-raising ride ensues as the taxi accelerates past trucks and minibuses, swerving at the last moment to avoid potholes and bumps. In summer, when temperatures soar around 40 degrees Celsius (over 100 Fahrenheit), most drivers refuse to turn on their air conditioners, and some ask for more money to do so. At the end of the ride, many drivers will say they do not have change after taking their payment. Taxi drivers are up in arms as commuters unsurprisingly flock to Uber and Careem. For weeks they have been demonstrating against the two ride-hailing services.  “They’ve snatched our bread. We roam for hours without finding customers,” said Adel, 48, who drives a taxi to supplement his earnings as a technician. The father of 3 said he spent about 6,000 euros ($6,600) just to get a taxi license. He said most cabbies avoid using meters because of low prescribed fares. “A car that runs daily costs money… we need to increase the meter rate. It’s unfair to the driver,” an agitated Adel said. Mahmoud Lotfy, who drives his brother’s taxi, said conventional cabs should be operated by companies in a similar way to ride-hailing services. “In this way, a driver who commits a mistake can be held accountable,” he said. Uber, which began operations 5 years ago in San Francisco and is now operating in about 60 countries, and the United Arab Emirates-based Careem are meanwhile winning new customers daily.  Safety, comfort, cleanliness “Safety, customers’ comfort and cleanliness is what Uber brought,” said Ahmed Mahmoud, an Uber driver. Mahmoud makes more than 8,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,022) per month, an earning well above the average monthly salary of 3,000 pounds ($383) for a mid-level government employee. “Uber in Egypt offers work opportunities for over 2,000 drivers a month. More than 40% of drivers were unemployed prior to joining Uber,” said Abdel Latif Wakid, director of operations of Uber in Egypt. Careem, which operates across 20 cities in the Middle East, has also made inroads in Egypt. But the apps have met opposition. In February, two videos published by newspapers caused a stir. The footage shows taxi drivers posing as passengers hailing Uber cars and then handing them over to traffic police on allegations their vehicles were unregistered. A senior traffic official told AFP the two companies were operating “illegally” as their cars were not in the category of passenger transport vehicles. Hossam Ossama, an owner of a limousine service that partners with Uber, said 70% of his fleet of about 500 cars is privately owned. Three of his cars were briefly confiscated, he said, arguing that his company was legally entitled to work since it paid taxes. “We are in contact with the authorities to explain our mode of operation,” he said. On Wednesday, a cabinet statement said a ministerial panel had been formed to look into the status of the two ride-hailing services. – Tony Gamal-Gabriel, AFP / Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/121948-uber-launch-uberhop-manila/","title":"Uber brings carpooling service UberHOP to Manila","date":"Feb 10, 2016 3:50 PM PHT","snippet":"Uber Technologies tests out a carpooling service with specific pick-up and drop-off locations","body":" MANILA, Philippines – San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, Incorporated launched its new carpooling service in Manila on Wednesday, February 10.

But the motorcycle ride-hailing service is being operated by a separate company – Grab Bike Incorporated – even though it also uses the same app-based platform.  “We are still operating GrabBike as we speak. The cease and desist letter was sent to the wrong entity….Once the GrabBike entity receives the cease and desist, we will honor that,” Teng said. Last week, the LTFRB ordered the suspension of the GrabBike service, saying MyTaxi.PH has not been accredited to offer the use of motorcycles or bikes as part of its business model. (READ: Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?) “We will have no option but to cancel MYTAXI.PH’s accreditation if they continue to offer motorcycle transport service which is not part of its business model and not what the Board had envisioned for TNCs and TNVS,” LTFRB Chairman Winston Ginez said in a statement. During the House hearing, Teng said the GrabBike service aims to address a strong demand from commuters for a faster and more efficient form of transport, given Metro Manila’s hours-long traffic jams. She said that most GrabBike passengers take the service when they are in a hurry, or if they only need to travel shorter distances, such as transferring from the train station to a bus stop. Teng also said that around 2.6 million motorcycle drivers stand to gain from the employment opportunities provided by the company. But committee chairman Catanduanes Representative Cesar Sarmiento said that with the absence of approval from the LTFRB, GrabBike should cease operations because it is still operating illegally as a public utility vehicle. “If you are transporting passengers from one point to another, then you are a public utility vehicle. And if you are a public utility vehicle, you must secure an authority coming from the LTFRB. In the absence of an authority from the LTFRB, you are a ‘colorum’ [vehicle],” Sarmiento said. While Teng said the company would comply once it receives the cease and desist letter, she also said Grab would like to work with transport authorities to craft regulations specifically for the motorcycle service, similar to what it did  when the transportation department laid out rules for new transport categories covering the ride-hailing services. “We also want to offer a solution to the government….If you take the case of GrabCar, it wasn’t regulated at first. Now it is. When it first began, it really was a service for the people, just like GrabBike,” Teng said. She added that the GrabBike service, which operates much like the local habal-habal, aims to create a safer, more regulated form of motorcycle-based public transport. “If you’re going to have habal-habal in Metro Manila anyway, and it’s unsafe and operating illegally, and there’s a solution to make it safer and to regulate it with the government, we’re very open to explore that option,” Teng said. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/120639-road-testing-grabbike/","title":"Road-testing the GrabBike","date":"Jan 28, 2016 8:30 PM PHT","snippet":"But the LTFRB warns GrabBike it can face cancellation of its accreditation if it continues its operations without accreditation","body":"Tired of endless Metro Manila traffic jams?

Since November last year, GrabBike has been on beta testing, servicing Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. I’ve tried out GrabBike to find out the pros and cons of riding one. I book a ride in Tordesillas Street in Makati City going to Bonifacio Global City. In less than 5 minutes, I was able to get GrabBike driver Noel Barredo to accept my request. As a rule, Grab Bike drivers offer the passenger a disposable face mask and shower cap before wearing helmet The base fare for off-peak hours is 40 for the first 2 kilometers, with an additional P10 per kilometer for the first 2 to 7 kilometers. GrabBike was first offered in Jakarta, Indonesia in May 2015. Following its huge success in Jakarta, Grab Bike is now pilot testing in Metro Manila where there are now hundreds of  units. GrabBike provides a new source of income to Filipinos like Noel, who used to work for a shipping company. NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: The demand for GrabBike is high and the income is just right for our needs. It’s actually better than the minimum. I just resigned from my previous job and this is now my full time work.   Despite the heat, Noel says he logs around 12 hours a day, transporting an average of 10 passengers.  NOEL BARREDO, GRABBIKE OPERATOR/DRIVER: Yesterday I booked my highest number of trips so far. I had 10 rides. I earned around P800, which is the highest so far. Although the ability to zigzag through traffic jams is their edge over four-wheeled vehicles, passenger safety remains Grab Bike’s priority. Noel asked several times during the ride if he was going too fast, or if I am fine with his driving. After all, they still have to abide by traffic rules. And unlike riding a car, there’s no airconditioning while you’re on a Grab Bike. Expect to be sweaty because of the heat. In less than 15 minutes, we get to my destination in BGC, to the tune of 80 pesos. The ride is fast, cheap, but a bit sweaty.

Its new company name says that it no longer only offers pre-arranged taxi rides – the service it started out in 2012.

Grab’s regional focus allows the company to navigate the Southeast Asian terrain smoothly, helping the firm to win over traditional taxi companies. Tan said when it comes to profit, “Grab will sustain the growth in 2016 and continue shooting for the sky.” Beefed up services With its new branding, Grab has also beefed up its smartphone app with more user-friendly features, including personalized pickup and dropoff locations, GrabPay mobile wallet, and GrabWork. GrabPay allows passengers to go cashless, either via credit or debit cards.  GrabWork, meanwhile, is aimed at business professionals who can now tag their rides and track receipts easily for expense claims purposes. According to Tan, their company is also investing in engineering centers, with one each in the United States, Beijing, China, and Singapore.   On a ‘friendlier’ road To help win the Southeast Asian market, Grab VP for Marketing Cheryl Goh said her company is taking a friendlier road than its rivals. While some of Grab’s rivals have developed a reputation for being combative, Goh said they are leaning towards a “more open and collaborative working environment” with regulators. In the Philippines, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday ordered Grab to cease operations of GrabBike until proper guidelines are promulgated. “We’re not going to fight the government. We will, instead, discuss with them how to go about it. I think all of us have the same end-goal: Provide better transport for the commuters. It’s not all about profit,” Goh said. While Uber hurdles legal battles in Germany and the United States, among others, GrabTaxi has avoided disputes with transport regulators to “provide as many public transportation options to commuters as possible,” Goh added. According to Goh, Grab’s end-goal is to influence people to make ride-hailing a daily habit. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/120487-grabbike-suspension-ltfrb-philippines/","title":"Could this be GrabBike’s last ride in the Philippines?","date":"Jan 28, 2016 11:07 AM PHT","snippet":"With the Philippine land transport regulator's order to suspend GrabBike operations, many motorbike drivers and commuters are disappointed","body":" MANILA, Philippines — With Metro Manila’s horrendous traffic situation and insufficient public transportation, many Filipinos turn to motorbikes to get around. Southeast Asian ride-hailing app company GrabTaxi saw this as a sound business investment. In November last year, GrabTaxi decided to pilot its motorcycle service called GrabBike in Makati City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. But just two months after, GrabBike faced resistance from the government. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Wednesday, January 27, ordered GrabBike to cease operations until the regulator has promulgated guidelines to authorize the service. For hundreds of GrabBike drivers like Noel Barredo — a former liaison officer at a shipping company — this is bad news. “Nagresign ako sa trabaho ko at napagdesisyunan na gawin itong full-time kasi mas maganda ang kita dito kaysa sa minimum [wage of P466 per day]. Pero ngayon, hindi ko na alam gagawin ko (I resigned from my previous job because I decided to make this full time as the pay is better than the minimum wage of P466 per day),” Noel, who has been working as a full-time GrabBike driver for two weeks, said in a phone interview. “Siguro, hanap muna ng ibang pagkakitaan habang naghahanap ng bagong trabaho (Maybe, I’ll look for another source of income while finding a new job),” Noel replied when asked if he has other sources of income. Noel added that an average GrabBike driver works around 12 hours a day, ferrying an average of 10 passengers. This equates to an average income of P800. It’s not just the GrabBike drivers who are disappointed with LTFRB’s order, commuters who rely on the motorbike service are dismayed as well. {source}<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>But why, LTFRB?

Citing the 2015 World Health Organization road safety report, the LTFRB said more than half (53%) of those who die in road accidents in the Philippines are motorcycle riders.  The LTFRB also cited a leading builder of Japanese motorcycles and motorcycle parts, which says motorcycle accidents ranked 4th as the top causes of death in the Philippines. “The motorcycle maker said that there are 3.4 million motorcycle users in the Philippines and most of them are beginners. Because motorcycle is the most economical and easiest means of transportation to beat traffic congestion in the city, they are also involved in alarming statistics on motorcycle accidents in the country,” the Philippine land transport regulator said. According to Transportation Assistant Secretary for Planning Sherielysse Reyes-Bonifacio, the GrabBike service, locally known as habal-habal, is not covered by any transportation category promulgated by the government. “It’s a bit of a gray area. Motorbikes used as public transport aren’t covered by the new department order on transport network vehicle services (TNVS) like Uber. Only four-wheeled vehicles are covered by TNVS,” Bonifacio told Rappler in an interview last week. “Commuters should understand. How can we protect them if this public transport service isn’t regulated?” she added. LTFRB’s Ginez warned that GrabTaxi could face a cancellation of its accreditation if it continues to offer the motorcycle service. Until the government decides whether it will set up new rules for motorbike services, four-wheeled vehicles will remain the king of the streets in Metro Manila. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/120433-ltfrb-orders-grabbike-suspension/","title":"LTFRB suspends GrabBike service","date":"Jan 27, 2016 12:09 PM PHT","snippet":"The GrabBike service is ordered suspended until the government releases guidelines for ride-hailing services for motorcycles","body":" MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) suspended the operations of ride-hailing service GrabBike on Wednesday, January 27.

But for the likes of Charito Manglapus, there are worse problems than the faulty trains, overloaded buses, abusive taxi drivers, and paralyzing traffic that Metro Manila commuters encounter every day. Charito, 61, is a person with disability (PWD). Born with cerebral palsy, the 61-year-old Marikina resident has weak arms and legs. She is practically stuck to her wheelchair.  While she has gotten used to her condition, she has one wish: to be able to watch movies in the cinemas – something not possible because there is no easy way for her to travel from her humble home to the nearest mall in the city. “I’ve never watched a movie at the mall. Even if I want to go to the mall, I have no means,” she told Rappler in Filipino with a sad smile. She shared how hard it is for PWDs like her to go around town and enjoy the different amusements it has to offer. “Sa totoo lang po, hangga’t maaari, ayokong lumalabas ng bahay. Kasi mahirap sa akin ‘yung binubuhat, tapos parang nahihiya ako sa nagbubuhat sa akin,“ she said. (Truth be told, as much as I can help it, I don’t want to go out of the house. Because it’s difficult that someone has to carry me, I’m embarrassed that someone has to carry me.) But worse, public vehicles more often than not deny her a ride. “Kapag sa taxi, tinatanggihan kami. May experience po ako na tiningnan ako from head down, tapos sasabihin ay, di po p’wede,” she said. (Taxis refuse to convey us. I experienced a driver looking at me from head to toe, then saying, it’s not possible.) She couldn’t even help but share an instance when she had to go home from Intramuros in Manila and a taxi driver told her to rent his unit for P500 instead of paying what was on the meter. When taxi drivers ask her to pay what is on the meter, they usually ask for a tip. “We are not fighting for pity. What we are asking is for them to respect our rights regardless of our disabilities. Because, in a way, we are all equal,” said Charito, a member and former president of the Cerebral Palsy Association of the Philippines. PWD-friendly trikes Charito and her fellow PWD have less commuting woes now. On Monday, January 11, the city government of Marikina launched the prototype of a PWD-friendly tricycle – a first of its kind in the Philippines. “‘Yung public transportation, nakalagay lang naman dun [sa accessibility law] na there should be a priority space for PWDs. Pero ang problema, how can the PWDs avail [themselves] of the priority seats kung di naman sila nakakasakay?” Vice Mayor Jose Cadiz told Rappler in an interview.  (The accessibility law only says public transportation should provide priority space for PWDs. But the problem is, how can PWDs avail themselves of the priority seats when they can’t even get on the vehicle?)  Cadiz, a doctor by profession, designed the simple yet innovative ride, inspired by the PWD-friendly units he saw in developed cities abroad, like Tokyo and Hong Kong.  Compared to an ordinary tricycle, Marikina’s recent innovation has a larger space to accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair and seats up a maximum of 3 companions of the PWD. It also has a ramp to easily draw the passenger into the vehicle. To ensure safety, the tricycle has straps to secure the wheelchair on board and a siren to alert other vehicles on the road. For now, the city government only has one unit, which will serve as prototype for the units they intend to produce with the help of the private sector. “It will be a public-private venture. The government will regulate the operation and the private sector will be the ones to fund it,” Cadiz said. He also encouraged prospective operators of this project since it will cost less than a regular tricycle. According to the vice mayor, the unit itself will be P10,000 more than the regular tricycle but the terminal membership fee of P50,000 will not be needed since these units would not be parked in a terminal. Their office is working on a software, much like the ride-hailing services like Uberand GrabCar, so that PWDs and senior citizens won’t have to travel to terminals and just be picked up from specific points. PWD-friendly cities  Aside from the re-modeled tricycles, Marikina City is also installing braille tiles along sidewalks of the city hall, health center, and the public market. This is to help PWDs, especially the blind, to walk safely in the city. Other local government units in Metro Manila have their own initiatives in providing services to the PWDs. Marikina and Quezon City have their own Persons with Disability Affairs Office (PDAO), while Makati City launched in 2013 its pedestrian lanes specially designated for disabled persons. It also hosted a competition for the city’s most “PWD-friendly” establishments. In August 2015, Antipolo City launched its free film-viewing program every Monday for disabled persons in the city. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/116380-uber-gojek-app-ban/","title":"Indonesia backtracks on ban of Uber-like apps after online furor","date":"Dec 18, 2015 3:42 PM PHT","snippet":"'Hindering innovation and progress for the sake of bureaucratic red tape?

Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan announced Thursday he had ordered police to properly implement an existing law that gives a narrow definition of public transport, meaning apps such as Uber and motorbike taxis popular in Indonesia known as “ojek” should be illegal. But as anger mounted Friday, Jonan did a U-turn, announcing in a statement that motorbike taxis and app-based transport can continue operating “until there is decent and reliable public transport”. Uber and other services, including the popular motorbike taxi app Go-Jek, have been able to operate in Indonesia despite the law, becoming immensely popular in traffic-choked cities with little public transport. Jonan’s move, which followed pressure from traditional transport operators, triggered a flood of online anger, with #SaveGojek becoming a top trending topic on Twitter.

Go-Jek has more than 200,000 drivers across the country, also providing courier, food delivery and even house-cleaning services. A flurry of other motorbike taxi-hailing apps have appeared following its success. Uber is also popular but has faced difficulties, with some of its cars seized in Jakarta.

Go-Jek is the poster child of Indonesia’s new, digital economy on the rise. And it’s not always a pretty picture. It began with “traditional” ojek drivers protesting the new, app-based on-demand system Go-Jek introduced. Ojek is the Indonesian word for independent, informal motorcycle taxis. Go-Jek couldn’t be stopped. Its promise to drivers (more income, more efficiency) and passengers (more safety, cheap promo fares) overpowered doubters. Mid-year, Go-Jek signed up tens of thousands of new drivers onto its partner network in a mass recruiting event. But not everything is fine and dandy for Go-Jek.  Hidayat, Sadarno, and Lokot are 3 drivers I met at Gojek Warkop. They were thoughtful and extremely well-informed about recent media coverage on Go-Jek, mainly the recent suspension of 7,000 drivers after being accused of fraud.  All of them joined the company about four months ago, as part of the mass recruitment effort in August. Together, we identified three areas the company could improve in to shed its evil image. 1. How it treats driver partners None of the 3 drivers I interviewed ever received a suspension from Go-Jek, but they agreed Go-Jek’s communication with drivers could be better. “We are called partners, but we’re not involved in decision-making,” Hidayat said. He was the most talkative of the group. “When they changed the tariffs, we had no say in this. If we were truly partners, we should be involved.” Hidayat also criticized the company for hiring too many drivers, too fast. “It used to be that we were all a team, supportive of each other. Now, we are competitors.” It’s more difficult to get bookings these days, he said. Hidayat thinks GrabBike does a better job at pairing supply with demand. “GrabBike hires in waves, and makes sure each wave of drivers gets enough rides.” Where before Go-Jek drivers could remain stationary and wait for bookings to come in, they are now expected to roam around and search for passengers proactively. Clever drivers found a workaround in using the app “FakeGPS,” Hidayat told me. With this app, drivers can pretend to be at different locations, to search for orders without tiring themselves out. But using this app, Hidayat says, is now forbidden. It’s not clear whether using this app constitutes one element of fraudulent behavior in Go-Jek’s consideration, or how it detects if drivers use this app. When asked about its stance on FakeGPS, a company spokesperson declined to comment. Hidayat insists using FakeGPS isn’t wrong, because the bookings taken via this app are real. Go-Jek drivers do not have a formal organization or representative body – there isn’t anyone to speak on behalf of drivers in an argument with Go-Jek’s management. Building a representative body is something Go-Jek could help facilitate to mediate future conflicts. In the US, app-based drivers associations are starting to emerge. 2. Focus on the core product Go-Jek’s app is very often “error,” everyone agrees. “Error” being Indonesia’s universal word for buggy and unreliable. As a regular Go-Jek passenger, I’ve had that experience myself many times. Bookings freeze or can’t be canceled. If the app’s functions fail, the call center is difficult to get through to. Drivers seem to be experiencing a similar unreliability. If drivers are judged based on the number of double bookings, cancellations, and other data tracked by the app, Go-Jek’s priority should be to increase the app’s performance and reliability. But rather than dedicating itself to increasing app stability and the flawless functioning of its core products, Go-Jek rolled out new features, and has another major product announcement lined up for the new year. 3. Release more data Of the 3 drivers I spoke with at the cafe, none had been a traditional ojek driver before. Hidayat worked at a hip restaurant in the business district, but decided to give Go-Jek a try because he wanted more freedom. Lokot and Sadarno were both peddling other jobs on the side. Driving motorcycles for Go-Jek, to them, is just one source of income. But they all voiced concern for drivers who relied on Go-Jek entirely, and even suggested those who don’t have other jobs should be given more bookings. Go-Jek sits on a wealth of data about people working in the informal sector, and it wants to play an even bigger role in Indonesia’s services industry with its cleaning, beauty salon, and massage services. Go-Jek could improve its public image by releasing more data. How many of its current partners rely on the service for a living? How many do it part-time? How many have made the switch from being a traditional independent motorcycle taxi driver to joining Go-Jek? This would help understand the impact of on-demand services, and would at the same time deliver valuable data about Indonesia’s informal labor sector. Loyalty not guaranteed Hidayat, Sudarno and Lokot accept that Go-Jek is an opportunity they have now, but that it might not last. “We got by before Go-Jek, and we will get by without Go-Jek,” Hidayat concludes. He says he is still loyal with Go-Jek for now, but would also consider trying out other motorcycle services, if those offered better conditions. Drivers pay attention to the details: they criticized Go-Jek for limiting the opportunities to withdraw money from their accounts. GrabBike, on the other hand, transfers the money, which they find preferable. Can Go-Jek keep the loyalty of its supposed network of 200,000 drivers once the days of cheap promotions for passengers are over? There are plenty ofalternative apps waiting for the opportunity to carve out a niche. One of them is the up-and-coming Philippine startup U-Hop, which has plans to come to Indonesia with its own on-demand motorcycle fleet this month. U-Hop founder Marvin Dela Cruz is quite critical of Go-Jek. He says drivers “deserve better.” He believes U-Hop’s system, which offers monthly subscriptions for regular users, is much better at providing security for the drivers, because they get a fixed base rate. U-Hop will even end up costing less than the existing on-demand motorcycles for subscribers, claims Marvin. Go-Jek will soon face competition from companies with new ideas, alternative driver compensation models, and a pronounced “pro-driver” attitude. It should start shedding some of its “evil” ways to retain user confidence and driver loyalty. – Rappler.com This article was originally published on Tech in Asia. "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/113909-grab-taxi-ph-grabheli-grabpay/","title":"GrabTaxi PH launches GrabPay, GrabHeli","date":"Nov 24, 2015 7:47 PM PHT","snippet":"The credit, debit card payment options, and the chopper service are the newest offers of the ride-hailing app company","body":" MANILA, Philippines – On-demand ride-hailing app company GrabTaxi on Tuesday, November 24 launched two new services in the Philippines: card payment option GrabPay and chopper service GrabHeli.  GrabCar, which became the first ride-sharing app to accept cash transactions for rides, has added credit and debit cards to its payment options.

It’s on helping your economy grow,' Uber Senior Advisor David Plouffe says on the sidelines of #APEC2015","body":" MANILA, Philippines — With rivals and critics slamming the ride-hailing company for its aggressive tactics, San Francisco-based Uber Technologies, Incorporated positioned itself as a solution to the Philippines’ economic challenges. “In a country like the Philippines, debate is not on regulations. It’s on helping your economy grow,” Uber Senior Advisor David Plouffe told a media roundtable on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit 2015 in Makati City on Monday, November 16. As of now, Uber is in 66 cities in the Asia-Pacific region. Plouffe said that around 1.1 million drivers are on the Uber platform as of November 2015. “Our growth does not come from people who are not taking taxi trips. It comes from people not driving their own cars. There’s a lot of economic activity,” Plouffe added. Five-year-old Uber has asked all 21 APEC member economies to allow the company to operate legally and safely in their jurisdictions. Despite its young age, Uber continues to face difficulties in making inroads into China, Korea, Japan, and Canada, partly due to regulatory hurdles. ‘Smart regulations’ “The misperception about Uber is that we don’t want to be regulated.” Plouffe said. “We are eager to work with governments to have smart regulations.”  The Uber chief advisor said one characteristic of having “smart regulations” is not putting a cap on the number of Uber vehicles operating in a certain city. “That has two really negative impacts: One, something almost all of us can do — drive — is being taken away from us as an opportunity to make additonal income,” Plouffe said. “Two, it forces people into car ownership, as there is not enough supply on the road to give them an alternative to get around locations,” he added.  Behavior change In the Philippines, there are about 4,465 vehicles used for ride-hailing services, a letter from a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) showed. For Plouffe, these vehicles are helpful to address Manila’s car-centric roads. In underserved markets where transportation is too hard – taking much time and money – most people turn to car ownership, he said. “What comes as we scale up – in places that are transportation deserts – is behavior change around car ownership,” he said. “With Uber, even if we are just in the infancy [stage], 10% of millennials say they had given up a car.” “Not just that, over a million of people are earning because of the Uber platform, and we want that number to continue to grow,” he added. So far, the Uber chief advisor thinks the Philippines has the best framework and transportation regulations in the world, aimed at easing traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.” “Now, we are sitting down with the government and non-profit organizations and saying, ‘We’ve got a really powerful platform. So now, how can we help you to solve economic challenges?'” Plouffe said. — Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/112594-body-odor-uber-jek-app/","title":"Indonesian transportation app bans smelly drivers","date":"Nov 12, 2015 8:18 PM PHT","snippet":"'This test will be conducted for customers' satisfaction as there have been many complaints about drivers' foul-smelling body odor'","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – Life is about to get a little easier for Indonesians who use motorbike taxis to weave through Jakarta‘s notorious traffic-choked streets – a new ride-hailing app is promising to ban smelly drivers.

UberJEK – which is not associated with the popular US-based ride-sharing service Uber – hopes its pledge to hire only fragrant drivers will give it an edge in a crowded market that has been flooded by motorbike taxi-hailing apps over the past year.  Other services have also taken an innovative approach, such as Ladyjek and Sister Ojek, which offer female drivers for women travellers. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/111608-indian-court-jails-uber-driver-for-life-rape/","title":"Indian court jails Uber driver for life for rape","date":"Nov 3, 2015 9:18 PM PHT","snippet":"An Indian court sentences an Uber driver to life in prison for raping a young woman passenger in New Delhi, a case that inflamed fears over sexual violence in the capital","body":" NEW DELHI, India – An Indian court on Tuesday, November 3, sentenced an Uber driver to life in prison for raping a young woman passenger in New Delhi, a case that inflamed fears over sexual violence in the capital. The Delhi court last month convicted Shiv Kumar Yadav of abducting and raping the 25-year-old passenger as she returned home from dinner with friends in December. Yadav, dressed in a white checked shirt, wiped tears from his cheeks as the judge read out the sentencing, the maximum possible jail term for rape. “He will serve rigorous imprisonment, which shall mean imprisonment til natural death,” Judge Kaveri Baweja told the court in New Delhi. Yadav, 32, was convicted last month of four charges – rape, abduction, intimidation and causing harm – and the prosecution had been expected to argue for the maximum punishment of life in jail. Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said in the courtroom the sentencing should send “a message” to society “where a person cannot even think of committing such an offence.” “She is not the only victim, rather the whole society is the victim,” he said, alleging Yadav had a “criminal history” dating back to 2001. California-based Uber was accused of failing to conduct adequate background checks after it emerged that Yadav had been accused of assaulting other women, although he had no previous convictions. “This man has changed,” defence lawyer Dharmender Kumar Mishra said of his client, adding he was the sole breadwinner for his poor family. “On the day of his conviction, he cried… he had gone to the extent of wanting to commit suicide,” Mishra said, adding that his client would appeal the sentence at a higher court.  Yadav’s wife broke down in the courtroom, howling inconsolably, as the pair’s crying daughters tried to console her. ‘Rape capital’  Uber was officially banned from Delhi in the aftermath of the attack, but the ban has not been strictly enforced and the company’s cars continue to operate in the capital. The former Uber driver was tried by one of the fast-track courts introduced in 2013 following the fatal gang-rape of a student on a bus in Delhi, a crime that sparked nationwide protests about dangers to women.  The rape occurred days before the second anniversary of that now notorious attack, which earned Delhi the title of India’s “rape capital”, and brought the issue of violence against women back into the spotlight. Yadav’s sentencing was delayed from October 23 because of a shortage of police in the Indian capital, which was preparing to host a summit of African leaders. Uber set up its India operation in September 2013 and now works in more than a dozen cities. Last month India’s federal government published new guidelines for web-based ride-hailing firms – including installing emergency alarms – a move seen as a boost for Uber’s battle for legal status. India recorded 36,735 rape cases in 2014, with 2,096 of them in Delhi alone. Experts say those figures are likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg. – Rappler.com  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/111218-congress-penalty-colorum-buses/","title":"Lawmaker wants stiffer penalties for colorum PUVs","date":"Oct 30, 2015 6:05 PM PHT","snippet":"Several bus operators abuse the high demand for land transportation during All Saints' Day","body":" MANILA, Philippines – In light of the surge of passengers going home to their provinces for All Saints’ Day, Congress is pushing for stricter apprehension of out-of-line public utility vehicles (PUV), more commonly referred as “colorum.”  Citing “colorum” vehicles as “patent causes” of accidents and worsening traffic, Angkla Partylist Representative Jesulito Manalo filed House Bill 4076 before the Committee on Transportation. The bill entitled, “An Act penalizing persons found to be operating or owning motor vehicles identified as colorum, and for other purposes,” aims to impose stricter penalties on unregistered PUVs. Under the proposed law, operators of unregistered PUVs shall be imprisoned or be penalized depending on the type of vehicle driven: All of their permits and franchises, including those for the legally-registered units, shall be revoked. They will also be permanently disqualified from engaging in transport-related businesses.  The license of the driver of an apprehended “colorum” vehicle will also be confiscated for the first offense and revoked for the second. Meanwhile, owners of private vehicles who use their units as “colorum” PUVs will also be “perpetually disqualified from applying for and operating any kind of public land transportation.”  Out on ‘Undas’ Earlier on Friday, the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Regional Office in Bicol apprehended a Super 5 bus en route to Davao from Pasay due to lack of registration papers.

Aside from buses, LTFRB also required private vehicles using ride-hailing applications such as Uber and GrabCar to register with the agency.

On Friday, October 9, the 5-year-old ride-hailing company asked all 21 APEC member-economies to allow Uber to operate legally and safely in their jurisdictions. “[We have] asked the regulators earlier and said we are very, very open to regulations. Uber as a company is a different type of service, it’s a non-traditional transportation, so we’d like to work very closely with the government, with all regulators, to establish the right framework,” Uber Asia President of Business Eric Alexander told reporters on the sidelines of the 9th APEC Transportation Ministerial Meeting at Shangri-La’s Mactan Resort and Spa Cebu. Despite its young age, Uber has been accused by rivals and critics of using unreasonable tactics, while others have praised its way of disrupting the unreliable, regular taxicab industry. As of now, Uber has presence in 66 cities in the Asia-Pacific region. But the company is facing major legal roadblocks from other APEC member-economies, like Canada, Japan, Korea, and China, according to a news report by the Huffington Post. Uber has started its operations in Japan, Canada, Korea, and China, but the company continues to face difficulties making inroads into these major markets, partly because of intense competition from taxi operators. “The Philippines is probably the best example in the world as [a country] that embraced the Uber model. [The Philippines] worked with us to establish the framework, guidelines, allowing us to operate safely and effectively within a city,” Alexander told reporters. Despite praises, Uber faces issues in PH Every APEC member economy, according to the Uber Asia official, wants a dialogue with the company; “but the challenge is, there is vested interest with existing transportation providers that make it difficult for us to enter.” “I would extend the offer that we will meet with all of them, sit down, and have a dialogue. Hong Kong is one of them, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore,” Alexander said, adding “[the regulation] just have to be the right one. It’s hard to put this in an existing box, sometimes you have to make a new box like the Phlippines has done.” The Philippines in May introduced a new mode of public transport called Transportation Network Vehicle System (TNVS), allowing ride-hailing services like Uber to fall under rules that allow “pre-arranged transportation services” using smartphones and other similar technologies. But in a letter signed by Antonio Enrile-Inton Jr, who is a board member of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), dated Thursday, October 8, the board is facing opposition and complaints on the accreditation of TNVS, particularly the issue of oversupply of Uber cars plying and earning from the public transportation. According to Inton’s letter, there is a total of 4,465 accredited TNVS units to date; while around 3,500 applications are being studied by the LTFRB. The LTFRB board member, in his letter, asked Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya’s approval to impose a moratorium on acceptance of applications for TNVS units. But this was opposed by Uber’s Alexander, saying “instead of the government regulating the cap, this is I think where the private industry does a great job.” “[Imposing a] cap is not the right answer. The right answer is to let us, as a business, manage. The part of the game is building demand. So that is why when we come to a country like the Philippines, we spend a lot of money in marketing – to make people more aware of the service and make the pie much bigger,” Alexander added. So far, the Uber Asia executive thinks the Philippines has the best framework and transport regulations in the world aimed at easing traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.” – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/world/105876-wrap-haze-uber/","title":"The wRap Indonesia: Haze emergency, Abbott out","date":"Sep 15, 2015 7:00 AM PHT","snippet":"An Indonesian province declares a state of emergency due to the haze, Uber defends itself from authorities, and other top news in Indonesia and around the world","body":" JAKARTA, Indonesia – From an Indonesian province declaring a state of emergency due to the haze, to Uber accusing officials of intimidation in Jakarta, here is the top news to start your day.   1.

Jakarta police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal said that while the cars were seized for operating illegally, the drivers themselves had not been detained.   Uber spokesman Karun Arya said that Uber drivers in Jakarta had been victims of “frivolous and unreasonable intimidation by the enforcement authorities”. He added that Uber was looking forward to holding talks with Indonesian authorities and working towards a long-term solution, but Yansyah insisted vehicle seizures would continue until the firm made moves to adopt an official permit. Uber has been maintaining an aggressive international expansion plan despite fierce opposition in some countries from regulators and established taxi industry players.

Regular taxi operators went through tedious process and inspection just to get franchise for our units. Foreign companies, like Uber, are given leeway, while local operators had difficult time just to get license,” Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA) President Jesus Manuel Bong Suntay said in a phone interview. The government earlier announced the introduction of 4 new transport categories aimed at easing traffic congestion through “efficient use of road space.” These new categories are the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), Premium Taxi, Airport Bus, and Bus Rapid Transit. After the announcement, the Land Transportation and Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB) also in May laid out the rules and regulations for the new transport categories. Under the guidelines, those who want to operate a TNVS should always be in good standing with its accredited Transportation Network Company (TNC). “The franchise for the TNVS will be revoked if the accreditation is cancelled by the TNC or if the certificate of the TNC is revoked by the Board,” the LTFRB memorandum circular read. Equal, fair fight “That regulation is unfair. Why is the TNC accrediting TNVS? Shouldn’t it be LTFRB? Regular taxi cabs are being accredited by LTFRB. It should be the same with TNVS,” Suntay said. “In addition, LTFRB limited the number of units every regular taxi operator should have. But with TNCs, there is no limit. Why is that the case? This just goes to show that there is an unfair treatment,” Suntay said. “The government is even allowing them [Uber vehicles] to ply even if they still haven’t applied for accreditation. In fact, dapat hulihin sila because they are still considered colorum,” Suntay added. The chief of PNTOA, however, clarified that the taxi industry is “not against the ride-sharing service providers, we are just asking them to do it legally.” “The only thing we want is an equal and fair fight,” he added. Suntay said his association has already asked the transportation department and LTFRB “to change the regulations for TNVS and give us a fair fight, but they did not hear us.” Here to stay Despite the local taxi industry’s bid to change the TNVS regulations, transportation spokesperson Michael Arthur Sagcal said that his department accepts that ride-hailing applications like Uber, GrabTaxi, Easy Taxi and Tripda, are part of the contemporary landscape. Sagcal added that technological developments that enabled Uber “are here to stay.” “We understand the threat that taxi operators feel due to the TNVS classification as concern about their business interests. The government’s concern, however, is providing better commuting options,” Sagcal said. Rather than fight the government over these ride-sharing service apps, the taxi industry should modernize and improve its services, he said.  “The public taxi operators should improve and modernize their servces rather than deprive the public of an efficient safe comfortable transport options,” Sagcal said. – Rappler.com Black and yellow taxi card with taxi car image from Shutterstock  "},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/66857-uber-not-cool-jakarta/","title":"Über not cool in Jakarta","date":"Aug 21, 2014 11:01 AM PHT","snippet":"","body":" Jakarta is the latest to target Uber, an app that has sparked protests from taxi drivers in several countries as it allows customers to hail private rides through their phones.

Jakarta authorities are just the latest to target Uber, an app that has sparked protests from taxi drivers in several countries as it allows customers to hail private rides via their phones. “In our opinion, the service Uber provides is just like a taxi service, but it doesn’t have a license to operate as one in this city,” Jakarta transport agency chief Muhammad Akbar told AFP. “Registered taxis in Jakarta have to meet certain standards, including some to do with safety, so if Uber wants to operate here, it must be held to the same standards – otherwise it’s not fair.” Authorities are concerned that Uber’s service will undercut the current market for taxis and that the company may evade tax if not registered legally, Akbar said. The agency is working with the ministry for IT and communications to have the app shut down, Akbar said, adding that it had invited Uber to a meeting a month ago but never received a response. Uber could not be immediately contacted for comment, but has fended off similar criticism in the past by explaining its service merely links customers looking for a ride with those who have a car, and does not own or operate its own fleet. Uber began by linking users of its apps to luxury car operators, but then decided to offer a broader selection of cars and include a ridesharing option. In Jakarta, it currently only links to services offering paid-for trips in upmarket cars. The California-based app, operating in 170 cities spread across dozens of countries, is the most prominent of several that are shaking up the traditional taxi landscape in cities around the world. Uber has already faced significant resistance from regulators in several countries, who accuse it of unfair competition and lack of standards.

And for 4 days thereafter, it was the same story: tents were being blown off the beach, boats were capsizing even before the start of the races.   But there would be no calling off of races, which sometimes happens in regattas when the wind is deemed too overpowering and unsafe. This is the Challenge, after all, and so race officer Jerry Rollin had the difficult task of ensuring that everyone in the fleet of 20 Hobies made it safely from Coron to Pangalusian island (now owned by El Nido Resorts) some 400 km to the south.  For 5 days, sailors went on their southward trek in what was called the best Challenge ever: 5 days of steady wind from 20 knots gusting up to 35 knots.   Exploration, the Hobie way What a wild and wonderful way it was to see the islands.   Imagine yourself careening at windsurfer speed through passages between hundreds of little islets or rocks (Coron alone has 800 of them), playing giant chess on the sea with the best sailors in the world. There is no other event like this elsewhere because there is no other place like the Philippines.  Thailand has similar looking islands but they seem not as varied nor as rugged and undiscovered as in Palawan. I remember passing through a “safety gate” which was a bright red buoy placed just a few hundred feet from a 100-feet limestone cliff with crashing waves.  Safety gate — what an oxymoron. For if I had capsized, the 6-foot waves would have sent me crashing to the rocks.    All of a sudden, screeching right behind me comes Rex Puentespina, a crazy compatriot from the Taal Lake Yacht Club who looked as if he was going to be engulfed by a large wave just 30 feet away from me. We composed ourselves as we prepared to gybe or turn our boats in the other direction; we just needed to catch a lull in the big swells.  And whoooosh! The boom came across and I sprawled down, for this was the first time I had ever gybed and seen my rudder flying in the air. The huge gusts were driving the front hulls into the water to the point  of a forward flip. We kept gybing all the way down the Linapacan straight that I became quite used to it. The Linapacan straight is feared by bangkeros because of its fickle personality. It is the opening to the South China Sea that separates northern Palawan from the mainland, hence the big Pacific rollers that come washing over the shallower Philippine shelf, causing the large waves and strong winds. Aaahh, Philippine beaches After sailing for 5 hours in extreme conditions, nothing is as welcoming and uplifting to the spirit as landing on a pristine white beach. Every day for 5 days we arrived on an island that was just as beautiful as the last: Balinsasayaw in Coron bay, Malcapuya in the Cullion island group, the twin islands of Ariara and Manligad in Linapacan, Pangaraycayan in Darocotan bay on the mainland of Palawan, and, finally, Pangulasian in the northwest of Palawan.  When we landed on Pangalusian after 5 days, waiters attended to us with cold towels and fresh juice and we were finally able to take hot showers. Then we were ferried to Miniloc Island where we stayed for the next 2 nights. We swam and snorkeled and drank too many rum cokes.  The adventure was not yet over.   For what is the point of all this beauty if we are not to rejoice in it? The next day, we organized another short regatta for the locals on behalf of our sponsor, Shell, whose Malampaya Foundation was organizing a town fiesta in Bacuit Bay. Even there, there are too many islands for me to pronounce. And again, the wind was blowing, which made for a very exciting race.   Level-up Surprisingly, the CEO of El Nido Resorts, Laurent Lamasuta, could not resist the urge to sail on one of our boats. Laurent said he used to sail Lasers in his teens, so I lent him my boat and he and took his water sports manager with him for a ride. By the look on Laurent’s face afterwards, we knew we had a new convert to the Hobie catamarans.    That evening was the culmination of our event and Laurent pulled out all the stops for us. We were ferried from Miniloc to yet another island where we had a splendid buffet set up with tents and candlelight, and the resort staff sang for us.  Such a spectacular setting did not go unnoticed by the world champions who took just as many photos and drank as much rum as we did.  Jasmine Hill said to me that she has never seen a regatta like this, and she has already been to the world championships in Fiji, Australia, and South Africa. The PHINSAF (Philippines Inter-island Sailing Foundation) really put a world-class event together for our sponsors and our competitors.  Typical, not! What set the Challenge apart was the format.   A typical regatta consists of a triangular course which is marked by 3 buoys that are anchored a few miles apart. The Hobie Challenge, meanwhile, was an endurance race very much like a car rally, which occurred for over 5 days or legs. Essentially, we island hopped from beach to beach. A big differentiator is that the Philippines has 7,100 islands and about a 3rd of these islands can be found in Palawan alone.   “This is why we can change the route every year in numerous permutations,” says to Monchu Garcia, PHINSAF chair. And this is why elite international sailors like Bradley Wilson, Bruce Tardrew, Bob Engwirda, and now perhaps Mick Butler and the Hill sisters will come back next year for a different taste of the fiesta islands.   The Blackberry 12th Philippine Hobie Challenge: The Palawan Challenge winners Blackberry Top 5 “The Philippine Hobie Challenge is truly one of the must-do events in the world. Thank you to all the organizers and competitors for a week of fun and thrills. The amount of hospitality, camaraderie, and amazing scenery (and rum) that flowed throughout the event has to be experienced to be believed.

Simon hit key baskets near the end game and led all locals in scoring with 18 points to help the B-MEG Llamados secure game one of the PBA Commissioner’s Cup Finals, 88-82. The Llamados’ offense was clicking in the first half which featured a long 2-point buzzer beater from Joe Devance that put B-MEG on top by 11, 25-16 at the end of the first quarter. Tim Cone’s squad also got a lift from their 2nd unit which continued the hot streak of the starters.  Talk ‘N Text import Donnell Harvey kept them in the game by finishing the first half with 15 points to go with 5 rebounds. The Texters started to rally in the third quarter thanks to their tight defense.  Larry Fonacier completed a rare 4-point play to tie the game at 56. A couple of possessions later, Ryan Reyes hit one from beyond the arc to give Talk ‘N Text the lead at 59-58 with 4 minutes left in the 3rd quarter.  ‘Machine Gun’ Kelly Willams closed the 3rd quarter with another triple that pushed the Texters’ lead to 5, 67-62 but it was all PJ Simon and B-MEG from that point on.  Simon hit back-to-back baskets in the 4th quarter to put B-MEG ahead by 3 markers, 71-68. He was whistled for his 5th personal foul with 5 minutes left to play after extending B-MEG’s lead, 76-69.  Talk ‘N Text was without a field goal for nearly 7 minutes until Jared Dillinger scored on a putback at the 4:52 mark of the 4th quarter.  Jimmy Alapag hit a 3-ball to narrow the gap to 4 points, 86-82, with 29.9 seconds left in the game but that was the last field goal that Talk ‘N Text would convert for the game.  The Texters shot poorly from the free throw line who missed 20 from the charity stripe.  “If we had made fifty percent (50%) of what we missed, we could have won by two,” said Texters coach Chot Reyes.  Llamados coach Tim Cone expects Talk ‘N Text to make the right adjustments, “I’ve always felt the loser has the advantage coming into the next game,” but hopes to “reach deep, come back and win Game 2.” Social Media The PBA Commissioner’s Cup also generated buzz in the social networking site Twitter. Best player ‘PJ Simon’ reached as high as number 2 in Twitter’s Worldwide trending list.  ‘PJ Simon’ hit number one in the Philippine trending list followed by ‘Go B-Meg’ while other PBA-related topics ‘#PBAFinals’ and ‘James Yap’ were also present in the list.  Simon also used Twitter to thank the ‘B-MEG planet’ – regarded as the 2nd largest PBA Team fanbase next to Ginebra’s ‘Barangay’.  – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/nation/1211-questions-for-corona/","title":"Questions for Corona","date":"Jan 31, 2012 12:23 PM PHT","snippet":"The quick payments made by the Coronas for 2 condominium units give rise to inconsistencies in his assets declaration","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The Coronas had a great deal of cash from 2005 to 2009  to be able to buy 2 posh condominium units in cash and short installments, and it is now up to the defense panel to show that the money was sourced through legal means.But already, documents presented so far to the Senate impeachment court, as well as previous public statements by his defense counsels, cast doubts on the integrity of Chief Justice Renato Corona’s Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN).We base this conclusion on the following:1.) The Coronas paid for the P14.5-M Bellagio property in Taguig in 2009. The payment was completed only in 3 installments from 2008 to 2009, based on records that a Megaworld official attested to in Monday’s impeachment trial.Submitted to the impeachment court on Monday, January 30, 2012, were 3 official receipts from the Coronas for the purchase of the 113-sq-m condominium unit in Bellagio.2.) The Coronas paid for the P9.1-M Bonifacio Ridge property in Taguig within a month’s time – in April 2004. The payment was made in an “almost cash basis,” according to a prosecution witness from the Fort Bonifacio Development Corp. This is broken down into: P2.2-M check issued by the Chief Justice and a P6.9-M check issued by Cristina Corona. Yet, in his 2010 SALN, Corona said in a “note” that he sold 2 properties in Quezon City – one in La Vista and another in Ayala Heights – in 2010 to purchase or pay for the loan that was used to buy their units in Bellagio and Bonifacio Ridge. The certificate transfer of title for the Ayala Heights property shows that it was sold in April 2010 for P8-M. Corona did not even indicate the exact selling price in his 2010 SALN.The Coronas also sold their La Vista lot to their daughter Carla Corona-Castillo in November 2010 for P18-M. 3.) Apart from the P11 million loan from his wife’s family corporation which he declared in 2003, Corona declared no other liabilities in his SALNs from 2003 to 2009.     Corona’s disclosures from 2003 to 2009 also show that, on top of the property acquisitions, this liability has been gradually decreasing, indicating that–on top of the property purchases–Corona has also been making payments to the loan during those years. In his 2010 SALN, Corona declared zero liabilities.  Based on these, we raise 2 questions:1.) How can Corona use the proceeds from the 2010 sale of 2 properties to buy condominium units that were already fully paid by 2004, in the case of Bonifacio Ridge, and 2009, in the case of the Bellagio property?2.) If, as indicated in his SALN 2010, he paid for the condominium units partly through loan, the documents submitted to the impeachment court show otherwise. No loan transactions were attested to either by Megaworld (for Bellagio) or the Fort Bonifacio Development Corp. (for Bonifacio Ridge).In the first days of the impeachment trial, lead defense counsel Serafin Cuavas was quoted by the media as saying that the Coronas paid for their 2 condominium units in “staggered terms.”The payment of the 2 properties in Taguig indicate that the Coronas were very liquid, but this cash liquidity could neither be established in his SALNs or his income records that were presented to the impeachment court last week by Bureau of Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares.The most that Corona received as a Chief Justice is slightly more than P600,000 annually. But his net worth by 2010–according to his own SALN–was already at P22.93-M, the bulk of which comes from real estate properties. McKinley lotAlso, the Chief Justice never declared his purchase of McKinley Hill in 2008, which is under the name of his youngest daughter Charina, a physical therapist based in the US. Private prosecutor Joseph Perez told the court on Monday that the Buyer’s Information Sheet in the hands of Megaworld Corp, which built and developed McKinley Hill, showed that the Chief Justice was the declared buyer of the 203-sq-m lot in Taguig. The reservation for the property, as well as offer to purchase, was made by Cristina Corona, wife of the Chief Justice, on May 9, 2006.All the 27 official receipts for the purchase of the lot were in the name of the Chief Justice, based on Megaworld records. It was only after these payments were made when, in September 2008, Corona requested Megaworld to state that the deed of absolute sale be in the name of Ma. Charina Corona.Per BIR records submitted last week, Charina Corona registered as a one-time Philippine taxpayer in 2008 only for the sole purpose of buying the McKinley lot.One question remains unanswered: was the special power of attorney that Charina granted her father an afterthought to conceal the real ownership of the property?The defense panel said they could prove that it was indeed Charina’s money that paid for the lot, but that she coursed this through her parents since she was living abroad. – Rappler.com"},{"url":"https://www.rappler.com/business/1208-battle-over-per-pulse-phone-billing-may-reach-sc/","title":"Battle over per-pulse phone billing may reach SC","date":"Jan 31, 2012 10:02 AM PHT","snippet":"The phone companies and their regulator may bring they legal battle over the per-pulse mobile call billings all the way to the Supreme Court after the appellate court denied both parties' motions for reconsideration","body":"MANILA, Philippines – The phone companies and their regulator may bring they legal battle over the per-pulse mobile call billings all the way to the Supreme Court after the appellate court denied both parties’ motions for reconsideration. In a January 19 promulgation, the Court of Appeals denied both the request of National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to implement its order to the phone companies to implement a per-pulse or per-6-second billing scheme, and the request of the phone companies, which are contesting the proposed billing method. “The motions for reconsideration and the motion for partial reconsideration filed by CURE (Connectivity Unlimited Resources Enterprises, Inc.), Smart Communications Inc., Globe Telecom Inc., and Innove Communications Inc., respectively, and the motion for partial reconsideration filed by the NTC are denied for lack of merit,” the 11-page decision signed by associate justice Hakim Abdulwahid stated. NTC commissioner Gamaliel Cordoba, when sought for comment, said the agency may elevate the case before the SC. “I haven’t read or receive a copy of the decision so I really can’t comment. But as always, it is an option for us to elevate the case to a higher court.”  Maximum of P7.50 per minute The NTC wants the phone companies to charge mobile phone call bills based on length of calls per 6-seconds (one pulse) instead of the prevailing per-minute method. To implement this way back in 2009, the NTC issued Memorandum Circular No. 05-07-2009, which imposes the following rates for intra-network and inter-network calls: This order was supposed to assure phone subscribers that they will not be billed over P7.50 per minute vis-a-vis the P6 average costs of the telcos. The CA recognized NTC’s mandate to implement a default billing system on a per-pulse basis, but questioned NTC’s computation of the imposed rates. It also said the phone companies failed to submit documents supporting their cost figures.  “This Court carefully perused the records and did not find any basis for the NTC’s imposition of such rates and its setting of limits on the total of the same,” said the CA. “The NTC did not give any justification for its disposition that the flag-down rate for the first two pulses shall in no case exceed P3, and that the total of the flag-down rate and the sum of the 8 remaining pulses for the first minute shall in no case exceed the prevailing rate.” Pre-fixes The phone companies had contested the NTC’s order, citing difficulties in implementing the proposed billing system in their backend. They said the NTC’s order is equivalent to price-fixing which is illegal since the industry is deregulated. They made an appeal at the CA in December 2010 after the NTC snubbed their requests not to push through with the per-pulse billing. “If both parties accept the decision of the CA then the telcos will file for a new application as the court ordered. If it is not acceptable to any of us or to the NTC then the case can be elevated to the Supreme Court,” said Smart lawyer Roy Ibay in a separate interview.  The telcos maintained they should use prefixes instead of a default billing system. Smart had proposed a flag down rate of P3 for the first two pulses or 12 seconds and P0.31 for Talk N Text and P0.43 for Smart on the succeeding pulses of the first minute. For succeeding minutes, P0.55 (for  Talk ‘N Text) and P0.65 (for Smart Buddy, Smart Gold and Infinity) per pulse will be charged. However, the subscribers should use the following prefixes (Smart Gold and Infinity: *5433, Smart Buddy: *5434, Talk and ‘N Text: *2255), plus the number being called. Globe, meanwhile, said its network already imposes a per-second charging for Globe-Globe/TM and TM-TM/Globe when subscribers dial 232 plus the 10-digit Globe or TM number. – Rappler.com"}]}
