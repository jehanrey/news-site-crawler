The victim, Carla Antasuda, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in Quezon City on April 2, Police Major Elmer Monsalve of Quezon City Police District Crime and Detection Unit said over Teleradyo. Reports said Antasuda booked a ride through the ride-hailing app Grab past 11 p.m. at UP Techno Hub on April 1, to bring her home in Pasig City. She was able to book a Toyota Innova with plate number NDA-3563, driven by the suspect John Lester Alhambra.  The vehicle that arrived to pick her up, however, was a Mitsubishi Montero but with the same driver indicated on the app. Antasuda got inside the vehicle anyway, without knowing that another person, identified as Bryan Kennet Yumol, was hiding at the back.  The suspects later declared a holdup, but the victim resisted. She was stabbed several times and her body was thrown in a vacant lot in Barangay Sauyo, Novaliches, Quezon City. The victim’s remains were found at noon the next day. The two suspects were arrested later at night at the Sauyo Flea Market. Monsalve said that the Grab app was secure but some people find ways to take advantage. “Napaka-secure niyan. Kaya lang wala naman system na perfect. Nasa tao pa rin ang problema hindi sa platform. Ang problema mismo yung driver,” he said. (The app is secure, but no system is perfect. The problem is with the people, not the platform. The problem is with the driver.)  The police official suggested the riders to share their location to their family and friends through the Grab-tracking locator for their own safety. Alhambra and Yumol are now detained and facing charges of robbery with homicide.

This leaves the three original players—Angkas, Joyride and Move It—to operate in the fast-growing segment.  The TWG, in a Dec. 10 letter to Francis Juan, CEO of Move It, said its members decided to “permanently terminate” their partnership with Grab Philippines. Allowing the tie-up to continue will make Grab Philippines “the fourth de facto player, which is not allowed under existing conditions of the pilot study”, the TWG said in the letter.  The TWG ordered the suspension of the partnership on Sept. 30 after a week of operations. The taxi motorcycle TWG made references to satisfying other stakeholders in its letter.  “[A]llowing the collaboration to proceed will only rekindle the issues that were raised by the complainants and will further put the MC Taxi TWG in a very tight and compromising position from both the House of Congress and Senate, the two other players and the stakeholders.” Despite their short collaboration, the TWG acknowledged that Grab and Move it were successful in recruiting more drivers. “The MC Taxi TWG was very pleased to know that you were able to onboard substantial numbers of riders that [were] enough to carry out Move It’s role in the pilot study,” it said in the letter. “Nevertheless, the pilot study is now on its concluding stage, thus, onboarding new recruits may no longer be necessary at this point in time,” the TWG said. It added that Grab Philippines may choose to enter the motorcycle taxi sector after a law legalizing the segment is passed. The letter was signed by retired Brig. Gen. Manuel Gonzales and retired Police Col. Joel Pernito, who sit as cochairs of the TWG.

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

During a transportation committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Delgra expressed shock at the numbers provided by Uber and Grab on the number of ride-hailing and -sharing vehicles operating in Manila.  Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.  READ: ‘Defiant’ Uber probed; execs air lament Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu for his part said of the 52,398 Grab cars, only 3,000 to 4000 have provisional authority from the LTFRB.  Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added. READ: DOTr: Grab, Uber must follow rules Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi for his part said as much as 60 percent of Uber drivers do not go full time, and that only less than 10,000 vehicles drive for the ride-sharing services at any point.  He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

Grab’s surge pricing during the morning rush hour on Monday shocked a number of commuters, who were forced to look for other means of transportation just to get to work.  One of them was Joyce Yu who opted to take the bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip that usually costs her up to P250 only. Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares, which range from P300 to P600. A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set back riders by almost P300, when hours earlier the same trip only cost around P150.  Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times, while the government processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. Grab government communications manager Fiona Nicolas said that while they have already implemented the new surge rate that the LTFRB imposed, fares may remain high in in the interim because of the limited number of drivers that are currently in their system.  “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its former rival’s Southeast Asian operations. This was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive to Uber to cease its operations as a TNC, despite an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue to serve the public for the duration of the motu propio review on the deal. To protect the public from Grab’s exorbitant fares, the National Center for Commuters Safety and Protection called on the LTFRB to expedite its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto to provide the riding public an alternative.  “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” the group’s head Maricor Akol said. Meanwhile, the LTFRB called on the public to report to them picky Grab drivers as well as those who force them to cancel their bookings. The board said that show cause orders will be issued against these drivers, who would have to explain why their franchises to operate should not be revoked."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1510676/4-cagayan-cops-sacked-over-relief-ops-credit-grab","title":"4 Cagayan cops sacked over relief ops ‘credit grab’","date":"05:10 AM November 05, 2021","snippet":"TUGUEGARAO CITY — Four police officers in Cagayan province were relieved of their posts on Wednesday after they reportedly tried to grab the credit from a private youth organization that was distributing relief goods to typhoon-hit villagers in Santa Teresita town, an official of the Cagayan Valley police said.","body":"TUGUEGARAO CITY — Four police officers in Cagayan province were relieved of their posts on Wednesday after they reportedly tried to grab the credit from a private youth organization that was distributing relief goods to typhoon-hit villagers in Santa Teresita town, an official of the Cagayan Valley police said. Police Lt. Col. Andree Michelle Abella, the Cagayan Valley police spokesperson, said Police Senior Master Sgt. Rodrigo Sapla, Police Cpl. Maria Theresa Castillo, Patrolman Ernesto Belen Jr., and Patrolman Valerie Calagan were all placed on a floating status and would undergo a “reorientation” seminar.  Abella clarified that Police Capt. Ranolfo Gabatin, the Santa Teresita police chief, was not relieved of his post contrary to an earlier statement of the regional police office. Gabatin, he said, was not informed about the activity of his subordinates. A video of the incident went viral on social media after Zach Xavier Singson, team leader of the youth group Oplan Bangon Cagayan, posted about their experience with the four police officers while his group was distributing relief goods at Barangay Mission in Santa Teresita on Oct. 31.  In a phone interview on Thursday, Singson said they were caught off guard when the four police officers showed up during the relief distribution and put up a tarpaulin with “Duterte Legacy” on it. The Philippine National Police launched in September a community relations program called the “Duterte Legacy: Barangayanihan Caravan Towards National Recovery,” mainly a food aid drive. Singson said the youth volunteers were then asked to take at least two photos of the officers while handing out some of the relief goods after putting up the tarpaulin in the background.  “We were shocked. We initially thought that the barangay (village) and the MDRRMO (Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office) had a prior agreement for the same activity,” Singson said. Singson said they tried to explain to the police officers that it was a private relief operation. “While we were still having a discussion, they (police officers) already had their photos taken with their tarpaulin and then left the place,” Singson added. Singson said he had since met with Police Brig. Gen. Steve Ludan, Cagayan Valley police director, who told him that it was an “isolated case” caused by a “misunderstanding” but assured that proper actions were already taken against the police officers. Earlier, Gabatin maintained that the police officers were “nonpartisan” and that they went to the relief operation to ensure that health protocols against COVID-19 were followed. In a comment on Singson’s post, Gabatin even justified the putting up of the “Duterte Legacy” tarpaulin as “just part of our activity when we lend help in coordination with other people or group.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1510171/tarp-carrying-cagayan-cops-draw-flak-for-credit-grab","title":"Tarp-carrying Cagayan cops draw flak for ‘credit grab’","date":"05:06 AM November 04, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Members of a police station in Cagayan province were accused of politicizing and trying to grab credit for an outreach mission conducted by a civic organization for typhoon-hit families, after they showed up unannounced at the venue and put up a poster branding the activity as part of the “Duterte Legacy” police community relations program.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Members of a police station in Cagayan province were accused of politicizing and trying to grab credit for an outreach mission conducted by a civic organization for typhoon-hit families, after they showed up unannounced at the venue and put up a poster branding the activity as part of the “Duterte Legacy” police community relations program. The complaint came from volunteers of the youth group Oplan Bangon Cagayan, who conducted a relief operation on Oct. 31 at Barangay Mission, Santa Teresita, one of the areas affected by Severe Tropical Storm “Maring” last month.  “While we were having our relief goods distribution, we were surprised that a (patrol car) came and police officers put up a tarpaulin with ‘Duterte Legacy’ on it,” said Zach Xavier Singson, the group’s project head. Singson said one of the officers then approached the volunteers and asked if they could take a photo of the policemen as they handed out their group’s donations with the tarpaulin in the background.  Singson said they turned down the request since they were a private organization. But instead of letting them be, he said, one of the officers grabbed a plastic bag of relief goods and handed it to the recipients for a photo op, after which the officers took down the tarp and “left without assisting us.”  Singson said the barangay chief and the coordinator of Santa Teresita’s municipal social welfare and development (MSWD) office were present and were “shocked” by what they saw. “Ashamed” of what the police officers did, the local officials apologized to the volunteers. The MSWD coordinator also told them that she would report the incident to her superior. PNP chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar has yet to reply when the Inquirer sought his comment on the matter on Wednesday. “What’s the purpose of putting up that tarpaulin? Our only concern is our donors and (their) trust in us,” Singson said in an online post. Photos and videos of the incident were posted on social media, drawing angry reactions.  But in a comment under Singson’s post, Police Capt. Ranolfo Gabatin, chief of Santa Teresita municipal police, denied that his subordinates engaged in credit-grabbing, insisting they were “nonpartisan.” He said the officers went to the relief operation to help and ensure compliance with health protocols. According to Gabatin, they took a photo while at the site as “reference that a group of good people came to our aid (as) Teresianos.” As to why they had to put up a “Duterte Legacy” tarp, Gabatin said: “[It] is just part of our activity when we lend help in coordination with other people or group.” Addressing Singson, the police colonel wrote: “We helped you, sir, in good faith.

It all started when Reddit user sabinijo detailed her frustrating experience in booking a ride through the Grab app last Monday, April 16.  Despite the driver being only two minutes away, the car wasn’t budging to pick her up. Eventually, she booked through her sister’s app and was able to get a ride. She still hadn’t cancelled the first booking and in the vehicle, she asked the driver if there was something wrong with the app.  “Lagi naman nagloloko si Grab (Grab always messes up),” replied the driver who used to work with Uber. “Mas maayos Uber (Uber is more organized).” When she recounted that her first driver did not move from his spot despite trying to contact him, she was told not to cancel the ride.  “Ay naku Ma’am, beterano yan! Naghihintay yan na kayo mag-cancel! Wag n’yong i-cancel Ma’am, bayaan nyo sya. Strikto Grab sa mga nagka-cancel,” was the driver’s advice. (Ma’am, he’s a veteran! He’s waiting for you to cancel! Don’t cancel it Ma’am, let him be. Grab is strict about those who cancel.) Finally, after more than 30 minutes, she noticed the car moving and that the ride had been cancelled. “Buti nga sa kanya! Maghapon nya nang babawiin yung rating nya; madaming ganyan na beterano na nananamantala!” noted the driver. (Good for him! He’ll have to recover his rating the whole afternoon; there are many veterans who take advantage.)  In an INQUIRER report, Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, said that the system can detect if a driver is stalling to cancel a trip. He explained that after an investigation, offending drivers face suspension or removal from the platform. Drivers’ woes The driver had his own troubles to share on what made working with the platform difficult. According to him, “incentives are lower” and “riders are harder to find” compared to his stint with Uber. He said before picking her up, it took him 15 minutes to get a passenger. He attributes this to people’s lack of interest in Grab’s service. He also cited that for him, the app is problematic as it takes a longer time to load the fare. Money woes plague him, said the driver: “Grab takes a bigger cut, and he has to constantly make sure his G-cash has credit because Grab immediately gets its take and if he runs out of credit, he can’t get riders.” Angelica (full name withheld upon request), a 23-year-old who works for a local media outlet, tells INQUIRER.net a driver told her that compensation was an issue for them. During her April 17 ride, she was told that Grab promos, which can deduct about P40 to P60 a ride, are not shouldered by the company. Like the previous driver, he felt that Grab takes too high a percentage. Despite customer complaints that the ride service is too pricey, he felt that they weren’t charging enough. READ: Grab PH admits failure to inform riders of P2-per-minute charge He also preferred to be paid in cash rather than card “so he can actually keep some of his earnings.” The company allegedly owes him P17,000 of his cut. And if customers feel neglected by the company’s customer support, so do drivers. He has experienced “unruly customers who don’t pay” but was not assisted by Grab on the matter. Earlier that day, his passengers did not pay the exact amount and he felt it futile to report it because “Grab barely responds.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Riders prefer Uber On the Reddit thread, users of both Uber and Grab said they had also experienced the hassle of forced cancellations. However, some said they still preferred Uber’s service, despite the app shutting down this week. “Uber has a better quality of drivers IMO (in my opinion), payment is quicker and I don’t have to pay for the toll (bring out cash),” said ygipaez. For baconcheesus, the best Grab drivers were former Uber drivers. “Sila yung matitino (They’re the decent ones).” Prodigaldaughterph observed that Grab only responded when a complaint was posted on social media. The original Reddit poster, sabinijo, said the customer support of both ride-hailing apps was disappointing but her issues with Uber were always resolved with refunds. She has since deleted the Grab app from her phone but has kept Uber’s in the event of “some miracle of sorts.” Angelica says she’ll keep using the service because there is “no other option when the car I drive is coding.” She adds, “But I’ve been trying to ride the bus as an alternative since I don’t trust the MRT.” JB RELATED STORIES:(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/984731/500-grab-drivers-suspended-banned-amid-complaints-of-commuters","title":"500 Grab drivers suspended, banned amid complaints of commuters","date":"07:24 AM April 24, 2018","snippet":"Some 500 drivers of Grab in Metro Manila were suspended or banned by the app-based transport network company (TNC) in the wake of mounting complaints against its picky drivers.","body":"Some 500 drivers of Grab in Metro Manila were suspended or banned by the app-based transport network company (TNC) in the wake of mounting complaints against its picky drivers. The punishment came after Grab conducted last week an internal investigation of the complaints of booking cancellations from commuters.  “We will never tolerate any behavior that compromises the quality of our service. We apologize that our services fell short,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines head, said in a statement on Monday. Following Uber’s exit from the country last week, Grab was swamped by complaints, mostly about drivers forcing riders to cancel their booking requests.  Deliberately snubbed Some drivers were also reported to have snubbed passengers even if the app showed that they were just near the area.  Among those who fell victim to the bad service was theater actor Topper Fabregas. He lamented that booking a “proper ride” from Grab had been quite difficult, especially on Saturday when it took him almost an hour to get a ride. Fabregas said that one Grab driver canceled his booking after making him wait for 15 minutes and even when the app showed that he was already outside the condominium. On Twitter, netizen KJ Castillo said she had to wait for 30 minutes for the Grab driver to arrive. When she asked where the driver was, Castillo did not receive a reply. She said the driver later canceled her trip request, with a fare of P76.  Artificial demand rise Some passengers have claimed that the behavior of the drivers creates an artificial surge in demand in their area. Grab, however, maintains that its current crew of drivers was not enough to address demand. Cu said Grab expected more drivers to be disciplined in the coming days as the company intensified its monitoring of those who went beyond the allowed 10 percent weekly cancellation rate. The company, he said, had rolled out additional and stricter measures to address cancellations. While most Uber riders have already migrated to the Grab platform, Cu earlier said that the number of drivers in its system had gone up by only 30 percent. Uber deal Last month, Uber Technologies Inc. agreed to sell its business in Southeast Asia to regional rival Grab. Under the deal, Uber will take a 27.5-percent stake in Singapore-based Grab and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join Grab’s board. In July, Grab was valued at $6 billion. Further aggravating Grab’s situation was an order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last week for the company to suspend its collection of a P2-per-minute travel charge.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Without the travel charge, a number of Grab drivers now earn less, forcing them to drive less frequently, according to Cu. On Friday and Saturday, he said, driver cancellations rose to 11 percent. “No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them resorted to canceling bookings, especially when they know they will traverse traffic[-congested areas],” Cu said. On Friday, Grab asked the LTFRB to reconsider its order, citing possible “irreparable damage” to the thousands of drivers on its platform. It pointed out that Order No. 2015-011 issued by the then Department of Transportation and Communications had allowed Grab to set the fares to be collected but “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions of the market.” The LTFRB has already accredited three new TNCs — Hype, Hirna and Golag — but Grab remains to be the lone ride-hailing app serving commuters today. Two other firms, Owto and Micab, have pending applications."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/279988/grab-puts-some-good-in-its-app","title":"Grab puts some good in its app","date":"04:58 AM September 29, 2019","snippet":"From transport service, to super app, to a superhero of sorts for microentrepreneurs and small businesses—such is the evolution of Southeast Asian tech company Grab, which recently announced a new initiative aimed at empowering these underserved entities, as well as improving financial and digital literacy, in the countries they operate in.","body":"From transport service, to super app, to a superhero of sorts for microentrepreneurs and small businesses—such is the evolution of Southeast Asian tech company Grab, which recently announced a new initiative aimed at empowering these underserved entities, as well as improving financial and digital literacy, in the countries they operate in. Launched last Sept. 24, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Grab for Good is the company’s social impact program targeted toward three main goals: to improve digital inclusion and literacy in Southeast Asia; empower the region’s microentrepreneurs and small businesses; and build a “future-ready” workforce.  According to Grab’s first social impact report, which was also released in Jakarta, the company now has nine million microentrepreneurs—a combination of drivers, delivery partners, merchants, and business agents—on their platform. The company started with just 40 taxi drivers in 2012.  The report also revealed that the company has: 1) contributed almost $6 billion to the Southeast Asia economy in the past year; 2) helped around two million previously unbanked individuals open accounts, as required before becoming a driver-partner; 3) empowered the livelihood of nine million microentrepreneurs; 4) and influenced more people on the use of cashless payment channels. By 2025, Grab CEO and cofounder Anthony Tan said the company plans to help over five million more traditional businesses and small merchants digitize their workflow and processes under the Grab for Good program.  They also aim to bring digital literacy and inclusion to three million Southeast Asians through partnerships with both private and public institutions, as well as nonprofit organizations; and train 20,000 students through its tech talent initiatives. In the Philippines, Grab’s focus, when it comes to helping small businesses and microentrepreneurs, are the food stalls that line the streets of Makati City, more popularly known as “jollijeeps.” Grab Philippines public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said around 20 of these food stalls already offer delivery services, through GrabFood, to customers within the five-kilometer radius of their respective locations. The formal announcement of these plans have yet to be made, but Pasigan painted a positive picture for these small businesses—she said that the food stalls on the platform, including the popular Sisig sa Rada, were able to make an additional P2 million in revenue in less than six months. Regionally, Tan said the Grab for Good program would also empower more members of an underserved segment: deaf microentrepreneurs.  Tan announced the further expansion of their “Break the Silence” initiative, which allows the deaf to become driver-partners on their platform. Grab currently has over 500 deaf drivers in Malaysia and Thailand; the initiative will now roll out in Indonesia and Singapore. Also, to “ensure that the knowledge of digital skills and technology is not limited to only those who go to good schools,” Grab sealed a partnership with Microsoft, also under the Grab for Good program. The University of Indonesia and Bandung Institute of Technology have so far partnered with the two companies for their tech talent development initiatives. Cheryl Goh, Grab’s group vice president for marketing, said that they plan to establish partnerships with schools in the Philippines in the coming year. Grab driver-partners will also have access to Microsoft’s Digital Literacy certification via the Grab driver app, where they can complete basic tech courses, completion of which will earn them certification from Microsoft for free. “Grab for Good is only the beginning for us.

The victim, Carla Antasuda, was found dead with multiple stab wounds in Quezon City on April 2, Police Major Elmer Monsalve of Quezon City Police District Crime and Detection Unit said over Teleradyo. Reports said Antasuda booked a ride through the ride-hailing app Grab past 11 p.m. at UP Techno Hub on April 1, to bring her home in Pasig City. She was able to book a Toyota Innova with plate number NDA-3563, driven by the suspect John Lester Alhambra.  The vehicle that arrived to pick her up, however, was a Mitsubishi Montero but with the same driver indicated on the app. Antasuda got inside the vehicle anyway, without knowing that another person, identified as Bryan Kennet Yumol, was hiding at the back.  The suspects later declared a holdup, but the victim resisted. She was stabbed several times and her body was thrown in a vacant lot in Barangay Sauyo, Novaliches, Quezon City. The victim’s remains were found at noon the next day. The two suspects were arrested later at night at the Sauyo Flea Market. Monsalve said that the Grab app was secure but some people find ways to take advantage. “Napaka-secure niyan. Kaya lang wala naman system na perfect. Nasa tao pa rin ang problema hindi sa platform. Ang problema mismo yung driver,” he said. (The app is secure, but no system is perfect. The problem is with the people, not the platform. The problem is with the driver.)  The police official suggested the riders to share their location to their family and friends through the Grab-tracking locator for their own safety. Alhambra and Yumol are now detained and facing charges of robbery with homicide.

This leaves the three original players—Angkas, Joyride and Move It—to operate in the fast-growing segment.  The TWG, in a Dec. 10 letter to Francis Juan, CEO of Move It, said its members decided to “permanently terminate” their partnership with Grab Philippines. Allowing the tie-up to continue will make Grab Philippines “the fourth de facto player, which is not allowed under existing conditions of the pilot study”, the TWG said in the letter.  The TWG ordered the suspension of the partnership on Sept. 30 after a week of operations. The taxi motorcycle TWG made references to satisfying other stakeholders in its letter.  “[A]llowing the collaboration to proceed will only rekindle the issues that were raised by the complainants and will further put the MC Taxi TWG in a very tight and compromising position from both the House of Congress and Senate, the two other players and the stakeholders.” Despite their short collaboration, the TWG acknowledged that Grab and Move it were successful in recruiting more drivers. “The MC Taxi TWG was very pleased to know that you were able to onboard substantial numbers of riders that [were] enough to carry out Move It’s role in the pilot study,” it said in the letter. “Nevertheless, the pilot study is now on its concluding stage, thus, onboarding new recruits may no longer be necessary at this point in time,” the TWG said. It added that Grab Philippines may choose to enter the motorcycle taxi sector after a law legalizing the segment is passed. The letter was signed by retired Brig. Gen. Manuel Gonzales and retired Police Col. Joel Pernito, who sit as cochairs of the TWG.

These preparations, Grab country head Brian Cu said, are meant to address the physical distancing standards set by the country’s ad hoc task force on containing the coronavirus pandemic.  Grab, alongside other car-hailing services, were banned from operating starting March 16 when President Duterte declared a lockdown in Luzon that was thereafter enforced in other parts of the country. Short of an actual ban, Grab’s new rules said senior citizens, those below the age of 21, the sickly and pregnant women are “highly encouraged” not to leave, subject to exemptions by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases.  Other regulations are now standard, such as mandatory wearing of masks, deep disinfection per trip, and contactless transactions via GrabPay or through credit or debit cards. But others may be deemed drastic: Drivers are the only ones allowed to open and close doors. Passengers, in turn, are not allowed to book for other people anymore, in aid of effective contact tracing. A rider is required to show his or her booking code to the drivers.  Each car is only allowed two people at most, and both are required to sit close to the windows at the back of the vehicle. Passengers are allowed to cancel a ride if the driver is not wearing a mask. The company expects to deploy around 20,000 drivers during the first week of the general community quarantine. Country head Brian Cu allayed fears of similar “Christmastime” carmaggedon scenarios, when the demand for cars outpaced the available drivers on the road three-to-one.

During a transportation committee hearing at the House of Representatives, Delgra expressed shock at the numbers provided by Uber and Grab on the number of ride-hailing and -sharing vehicles operating in Manila.  Asked by lawmakers on the number of vehicles operating under Uber, Uber Philippines government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said there are 66,000 Uber cars which had travelled at least one trip for one year. Of the 66,000 Uber vehicles, 2,500 have provisional authority from the LTFRB, while there are 1,000 with pending extension of this authority.

Delgra lamented that Uber and Grab during a previous hearing with the LTFRB said each of these companies only have 28,000 vehicles plying Metro Manila streets. “During the July hearing, they have about 28,000 more or less each. And today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked,” Delgra said. “The number we heard today… These are the data we’ve been trying to get since last year, because we need to understand precisely the issue of accountability,” he added.

He said the sheer number of registered Uber vehicles in Manila does not mean it is equivalent to one ride-sharing car per one taxi, belying criticisms that the deluge of transportation network service vehicles worsened the traffic in the metropolis. “We seem to be getting stuck to the numbers, this and that. I want to make it clear, that one taxi is not equivalent to one ride sharing car… What’s relevant is how many cars are at any one point,” Kassabgi said. He added that Uber only deploys enough number of vehicles to meet the riders’ demand. “60 percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. One taxi car is equivalent to one ride sharing car is simply not true.. It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here,” he added. Cu added that Grab only deploys enough vehicles to meet the demand numbering around five percent. “As of now the numbers we accredited, they don’t ply the roads on an hourly basis…. If we don’t grow supply by three percent a week, then there would be passengers who would not get a ride,” Cu said.

Grab’s surge pricing during the morning rush hour on Monday shocked a number of commuters, who were forced to look for other means of transportation just to get to work.  One of them was Joyce Yu who opted to take the bus from North Avenue to Ortigas since Grab was charging her P450 for the trip that usually costs her up to P250 only. Several netizens also took to Twitter to express their disappointment over Grab’s high fares, which range from P300 to P600. A 6.5-kilometer trip from Makati to Manila at 8 a.m., for example, set back riders by almost P300, when hours earlier the same trip only cost around P150.  Last week, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered Grab to “immediately” bring down its surge pricing cap from twice the regular rate to just 1.5 times, while the government processes the accreditation of new TNCs that would take the place of Uber. Grab government communications manager Fiona Nicolas said that while they have already implemented the new surge rate that the LTFRB imposed, fares may remain high in in the interim because of the limited number of drivers that are currently in their system.  “The onboarding of TNVS (transport network vehicle services) is not yet at 100 percent while most, if not all, Uber passengers have already downloaded the Grab app. The onboarding [of drivers] from Uber to Grab is still ongoing,” Nicolas said. Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu earlier explained that while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in their system only rose by around 30 percent. On Monday, the Uber app went offline in the country following Grab’s acquisition of its former rival’s Southeast Asian operations. This was also in compliance with the LTFRB’s directive to Uber to cease its operations as a TNC, despite an earlier order from the Philippine Competition Commission that it continue to serve the public for the duration of the motu propio review on the deal. To protect the public from Grab’s exorbitant fares, the National Center for Commuters Safety and Protection called on the LTFRB to expedite its accreditation of new TNCs Lag Go, Hype and Owto to provide the riding public an alternative.  “It is incumbent on the LTFRB to approve these applications. We think that LTFRB should hurry up so that there will be competition,” the group’s head Maricor Akol said. Meanwhile, the LTFRB called on the public to report to them picky Grab drivers as well as those who force them to cancel their bookings. The board said that show cause orders will be issued against these drivers, who would have to explain why their franchises to operate should not be revoked."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1510676/4-cagayan-cops-sacked-over-relief-ops-credit-grab","title":"4 Cagayan cops sacked over relief ops ‘credit grab’","date":"05:10 AM November 05, 2021","snippet":"TUGUEGARAO CITY — Four police officers in Cagayan province were relieved of their posts on Wednesday after they reportedly tried to grab the credit from a private youth organization that was distributing relief goods to typhoon-hit villagers in Santa Teresita town, an official of the Cagayan Valley police said.","body":"TUGUEGARAO CITY — Four police officers in Cagayan province were relieved of their posts on Wednesday after they reportedly tried to grab the credit from a private youth organization that was distributing relief goods to typhoon-hit villagers in Santa Teresita town, an official of the Cagayan Valley police said. Police Lt. Col. Andree Michelle Abella, the Cagayan Valley police spokesperson, said Police Senior Master Sgt. Rodrigo Sapla, Police Cpl. Maria Theresa Castillo, Patrolman Ernesto Belen Jr., and Patrolman Valerie Calagan were all placed on a floating status and would undergo a “reorientation” seminar.  Abella clarified that Police Capt. Ranolfo Gabatin, the Santa Teresita police chief, was not relieved of his post contrary to an earlier statement of the regional police office. Gabatin, he said, was not informed about the activity of his subordinates. A video of the incident went viral on social media after Zach Xavier Singson, team leader of the youth group Oplan Bangon Cagayan, posted about their experience with the four police officers while his group was distributing relief goods at Barangay Mission in Santa Teresita on Oct. 31.  In a phone interview on Thursday, Singson said they were caught off guard when the four police officers showed up during the relief distribution and put up a tarpaulin with “Duterte Legacy” on it. The Philippine National Police launched in September a community relations program called the “Duterte Legacy: Barangayanihan Caravan Towards National Recovery,” mainly a food aid drive. Singson said the youth volunteers were then asked to take at least two photos of the officers while handing out some of the relief goods after putting up the tarpaulin in the background.  “We were shocked. We initially thought that the barangay (village) and the MDRRMO (Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office) had a prior agreement for the same activity,” Singson said. Singson said they tried to explain to the police officers that it was a private relief operation. “While we were still having a discussion, they (police officers) already had their photos taken with their tarpaulin and then left the place,” Singson added. Singson said he had since met with Police Brig. Gen. Steve Ludan, Cagayan Valley police director, who told him that it was an “isolated case” caused by a “misunderstanding” but assured that proper actions were already taken against the police officers. Earlier, Gabatin maintained that the police officers were “nonpartisan” and that they went to the relief operation to ensure that health protocols against COVID-19 were followed. In a comment on Singson’s post, Gabatin even justified the putting up of the “Duterte Legacy” tarpaulin as “just part of our activity when we lend help in coordination with other people or group.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1510171/tarp-carrying-cagayan-cops-draw-flak-for-credit-grab","title":"Tarp-carrying Cagayan cops draw flak for ‘credit grab’","date":"05:06 AM November 04, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Members of a police station in Cagayan province were accused of politicizing and trying to grab credit for an outreach mission conducted by a civic organization for typhoon-hit families, after they showed up unannounced at the venue and put up a poster branding the activity as part of the “Duterte Legacy” police community relations program.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Members of a police station in Cagayan province were accused of politicizing and trying to grab credit for an outreach mission conducted by a civic organization for typhoon-hit families, after they showed up unannounced at the venue and put up a poster branding the activity as part of the “Duterte Legacy” police community relations program. The complaint came from volunteers of the youth group Oplan Bangon Cagayan, who conducted a relief operation on Oct. 31 at Barangay Mission, Santa Teresita, one of the areas affected by Severe Tropical Storm “Maring” last month.  “While we were having our relief goods distribution, we were surprised that a (patrol car) came and police officers put up a tarpaulin with ‘Duterte Legacy’ on it,” said Zach Xavier Singson, the group’s project head. Singson said one of the officers then approached the volunteers and asked if they could take a photo of the policemen as they handed out their group’s donations with the tarpaulin in the background.  Singson said they turned down the request since they were a private organization. But instead of letting them be, he said, one of the officers grabbed a plastic bag of relief goods and handed it to the recipients for a photo op, after which the officers took down the tarp and “left without assisting us.”  Singson said the barangay chief and the coordinator of Santa Teresita’s municipal social welfare and development (MSWD) office were present and were “shocked” by what they saw. “Ashamed” of what the police officers did, the local officials apologized to the volunteers. The MSWD coordinator also told them that she would report the incident to her superior. PNP chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar has yet to reply when the Inquirer sought his comment on the matter on Wednesday. “What’s the purpose of putting up that tarpaulin? Our only concern is our donors and (their) trust in us,” Singson said in an online post. Photos and videos of the incident were posted on social media, drawing angry reactions.  But in a comment under Singson’s post, Police Capt. Ranolfo Gabatin, chief of Santa Teresita municipal police, denied that his subordinates engaged in credit-grabbing, insisting they were “nonpartisan.” He said the officers went to the relief operation to help and ensure compliance with health protocols. According to Gabatin, they took a photo while at the site as “reference that a group of good people came to our aid (as) Teresianos.” As to why they had to put up a “Duterte Legacy” tarp, Gabatin said: “[It] is just part of our activity when we lend help in coordination with other people or group.” Addressing Singson, the police colonel wrote: “We helped you, sir, in good faith.

It all started when Reddit user sabinijo detailed her frustrating experience in booking a ride through the Grab app last Monday, April 16.  Despite the driver being only two minutes away, the car wasn’t budging to pick her up. Eventually, she booked through her sister’s app and was able to get a ride. She still hadn’t cancelled the first booking and in the vehicle, she asked the driver if there was something wrong with the app.  “Lagi naman nagloloko si Grab (Grab always messes up),” replied the driver who used to work with Uber. “Mas maayos Uber (Uber is more organized).” When she recounted that her first driver did not move from his spot despite trying to contact him, she was told not to cancel the ride.  “Ay naku Ma’am, beterano yan! Naghihintay yan na kayo mag-cancel! Wag n’yong i-cancel Ma’am, bayaan nyo sya. Strikto Grab sa mga nagka-cancel,” was the driver’s advice. (Ma’am, he’s a veteran! He’s waiting for you to cancel! Don’t cancel it Ma’am, let him be. Grab is strict about those who cancel.) Finally, after more than 30 minutes, she noticed the car moving and that the ride had been cancelled. “Buti nga sa kanya! Maghapon nya nang babawiin yung rating nya; madaming ganyan na beterano na nananamantala!” noted the driver. (Good for him! He’ll have to recover his rating the whole afternoon; there are many veterans who take advantage.)  In an INQUIRER report, Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, said that the system can detect if a driver is stalling to cancel a trip. He explained that after an investigation, offending drivers face suspension or removal from the platform. Drivers’ woes The driver had his own troubles to share on what made working with the platform difficult. According to him, “incentives are lower” and “riders are harder to find” compared to his stint with Uber. He said before picking her up, it took him 15 minutes to get a passenger. He attributes this to people’s lack of interest in Grab’s service. He also cited that for him, the app is problematic as it takes a longer time to load the fare. Money woes plague him, said the driver: “Grab takes a bigger cut, and he has to constantly make sure his G-cash has credit because Grab immediately gets its take and if he runs out of credit, he can’t get riders.” Angelica (full name withheld upon request), a 23-year-old who works for a local media outlet, tells INQUIRER.net a driver told her that compensation was an issue for them. During her April 17 ride, she was told that Grab promos, which can deduct about P40 to P60 a ride, are not shouldered by the company. Like the previous driver, he felt that Grab takes too high a percentage. Despite customer complaints that the ride service is too pricey, he felt that they weren’t charging enough. READ: Grab PH admits failure to inform riders of P2-per-minute charge He also preferred to be paid in cash rather than card “so he can actually keep some of his earnings.” The company allegedly owes him P17,000 of his cut. And if customers feel neglected by the company’s customer support, so do drivers. He has experienced “unruly customers who don’t pay” but was not assisted by Grab on the matter. Earlier that day, his passengers did not pay the exact amount and he felt it futile to report it because “Grab barely responds.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Riders prefer Uber On the Reddit thread, users of both Uber and Grab said they had also experienced the hassle of forced cancellations. However, some said they still preferred Uber’s service, despite the app shutting down this week. “Uber has a better quality of drivers IMO (in my opinion), payment is quicker and I don’t have to pay for the toll (bring out cash),” said ygipaez. For baconcheesus, the best Grab drivers were former Uber drivers. “Sila yung matitino (They’re the decent ones).” Prodigaldaughterph observed that Grab only responded when a complaint was posted on social media. The original Reddit poster, sabinijo, said the customer support of both ride-hailing apps was disappointing but her issues with Uber were always resolved with refunds. She has since deleted the Grab app from her phone but has kept Uber’s in the event of “some miracle of sorts.” Angelica says she’ll keep using the service because there is “no other option when the car I drive is coding.” She adds, “But I’ve been trying to ride the bus as an alternative since I don’t trust the MRT.” JB RELATED STORIES:(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB accredits ridesharing firm Hype to rival Grab Grab: We don’t allow doubling of rates outside Metro Manila"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/984731/500-grab-drivers-suspended-banned-amid-complaints-of-commuters","title":"500 Grab drivers suspended, banned amid complaints of commuters","date":"07:24 AM April 24, 2018","snippet":"Some 500 drivers of Grab in Metro Manila were suspended or banned by the app-based transport network company (TNC) in the wake of mounting complaints against its picky drivers.","body":"Some 500 drivers of Grab in Metro Manila were suspended or banned by the app-based transport network company (TNC) in the wake of mounting complaints against its picky drivers. The punishment came after Grab conducted last week an internal investigation of the complaints of booking cancellations from commuters.  “We will never tolerate any behavior that compromises the quality of our service. We apologize that our services fell short,” Brian Cu, Grab Philippines head, said in a statement on Monday. Following Uber’s exit from the country last week, Grab was swamped by complaints, mostly about drivers forcing riders to cancel their booking requests.  Deliberately snubbed Some drivers were also reported to have snubbed passengers even if the app showed that they were just near the area.  Among those who fell victim to the bad service was theater actor Topper Fabregas. He lamented that booking a “proper ride” from Grab had been quite difficult, especially on Saturday when it took him almost an hour to get a ride. Fabregas said that one Grab driver canceled his booking after making him wait for 15 minutes and even when the app showed that he was already outside the condominium. On Twitter, netizen KJ Castillo said she had to wait for 30 minutes for the Grab driver to arrive. When she asked where the driver was, Castillo did not receive a reply. She said the driver later canceled her trip request, with a fare of P76.  Artificial demand rise Some passengers have claimed that the behavior of the drivers creates an artificial surge in demand in their area. Grab, however, maintains that its current crew of drivers was not enough to address demand. Cu said Grab expected more drivers to be disciplined in the coming days as the company intensified its monitoring of those who went beyond the allowed 10 percent weekly cancellation rate. The company, he said, had rolled out additional and stricter measures to address cancellations. While most Uber riders have already migrated to the Grab platform, Cu earlier said that the number of drivers in its system had gone up by only 30 percent. Uber deal Last month, Uber Technologies Inc. agreed to sell its business in Southeast Asia to regional rival Grab. Under the deal, Uber will take a 27.5-percent stake in Singapore-based Grab and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join Grab’s board. In July, Grab was valued at $6 billion. Further aggravating Grab’s situation was an order from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) last week for the company to suspend its collection of a P2-per-minute travel charge.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Without the travel charge, a number of Grab drivers now earn less, forcing them to drive less frequently, according to Cu. On Friday and Saturday, he said, driver cancellations rose to 11 percent. “No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them resorted to canceling bookings, especially when they know they will traverse traffic[-congested areas],” Cu said. On Friday, Grab asked the LTFRB to reconsider its order, citing possible “irreparable damage” to the thousands of drivers on its platform. It pointed out that Order No. 2015-011 issued by the then Department of Transportation and Communications had allowed Grab to set the fares to be collected but “subject to oversight from the LTFRB in cases of abnormal disruptions of the market.” The LTFRB has already accredited three new TNCs — Hype, Hirna and Golag — but Grab remains to be the lone ride-hailing app serving commuters today. Two other firms, Owto and Micab, have pending applications."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/279988/grab-puts-some-good-in-its-app","title":"Grab puts some good in its app","date":"04:58 AM September 29, 2019","snippet":"From transport service, to super app, to a superhero of sorts for microentrepreneurs and small businesses—such is the evolution of Southeast Asian tech company Grab, which recently announced a new initiative aimed at empowering these underserved entities, as well as improving financial and digital literacy, in the countries they operate in.","body":"From transport service, to super app, to a superhero of sorts for microentrepreneurs and small businesses—such is the evolution of Southeast Asian tech company Grab, which recently announced a new initiative aimed at empowering these underserved entities, as well as improving financial and digital literacy, in the countries they operate in. Launched last Sept. 24, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Grab for Good is the company’s social impact program targeted toward three main goals: to improve digital inclusion and literacy in Southeast Asia; empower the region’s microentrepreneurs and small businesses; and build a “future-ready” workforce.  According to Grab’s first social impact report, which was also released in Jakarta, the company now has nine million microentrepreneurs—a combination of drivers, delivery partners, merchants, and business agents—on their platform. The company started with just 40 taxi drivers in 2012.  The report also revealed that the company has: 1) contributed almost $6 billion to the Southeast Asia economy in the past year; 2) helped around two million previously unbanked individuals open accounts, as required before becoming a driver-partner; 3) empowered the livelihood of nine million microentrepreneurs; 4) and influenced more people on the use of cashless payment channels. By 2025, Grab CEO and cofounder Anthony Tan said the company plans to help over five million more traditional businesses and small merchants digitize their workflow and processes under the Grab for Good program.  They also aim to bring digital literacy and inclusion to three million Southeast Asians through partnerships with both private and public institutions, as well as nonprofit organizations; and train 20,000 students through its tech talent initiatives. In the Philippines, Grab’s focus, when it comes to helping small businesses and microentrepreneurs, are the food stalls that line the streets of Makati City, more popularly known as “jollijeeps.” Grab Philippines public relations manager Krhizzy Pasigan said around 20 of these food stalls already offer delivery services, through GrabFood, to customers within the five-kilometer radius of their respective locations. The formal announcement of these plans have yet to be made, but Pasigan painted a positive picture for these small businesses—she said that the food stalls on the platform, including the popular Sisig sa Rada, were able to make an additional P2 million in revenue in less than six months. Regionally, Tan said the Grab for Good program would also empower more members of an underserved segment: deaf microentrepreneurs.  Tan announced the further expansion of their “Break the Silence” initiative, which allows the deaf to become driver-partners on their platform. Grab currently has over 500 deaf drivers in Malaysia and Thailand; the initiative will now roll out in Indonesia and Singapore. Also, to “ensure that the knowledge of digital skills and technology is not limited to only those who go to good schools,” Grab sealed a partnership with Microsoft, also under the Grab for Good program. The University of Indonesia and Bandung Institute of Technology have so far partnered with the two companies for their tech talent development initiatives. Cheryl Goh, Grab’s group vice president for marketing, said that they plan to establish partnerships with schools in the Philippines in the coming year.

In a press briefing, Grab Country Head Brian Cu said there were no communications made through their application to inform the riders of the charge, which was a component of their fare.  “There was no comms to the riders inside the app. In the information card, we’ve updated that, but when we raised the P2 per minute, we did not include that. So ‘di namin nailagay,” Cu told reporters. But Cu pointed out that unlike in usual taxi rides, the price for Grab rides is “not a pre-agreed per minute or per kilometer fare.”  He said what is important is that the riders were at least informed of their total fare when using the application. “There’s nothing illegal with failing to update the information,” he said.  Grab earlier said that they “unilaterally” implemented the charge, which they said was allowed under the Land Transportation and Regulatory Board’s (LTFRB) Department Order 2015-011. The order allowed TNCs to set its own fares but with the oversight of the LTFRB. Grab’s legal counsel Miguel Aguila said the LTFRB was informed of this change during a technical working group meeting in late July 2017. “Per minute charges remain part and parcel to Grab’s fare structure today and we have continuously been transparent about this truth,” Grab said in a previous statement. Last week, Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) part-list Rep. Jericho Nograles said Grab should refund its customers around P3.2 billion because based on his research, it “illegally” charged customers P2 per minute of travel charge.READ: LTFRB starts probe of Grab’s unauthorized travel charge  This charge, he said, is on top of Grab’s P40 flagdown rate and P10 to P14 per kilometer charge. Apart from this, he said Grab has also “committed acts of deception by putting out online collaterals claiming that unlike regular taxi services, they do no impose extra charges for travel time.” After Tuesday’s hearing on the petition filed by Nograles before the LTFRB, Chair Martin Delgra III told reporters that in one of their technical working group meetings last year, there were “discussions” about Grab’s plan to collect a P2 per minute travel charge.

Pastor made this disclosure after Senate Grace Poe asked about the decision of the TWG on the said partnership, which allows Move It to offer its motorcycle taxi-hailing services to more passengers through the Grab platform.  In a statement, last week, Grab Philippines earlier noted that its partnership with Move It aims to “provide more Filipinos greater access to the motorcycle taxi services of Move It, in addition to the passengers that Move It riders can serve through the Move It app.” “Through this landmark partnership, we are confident that many Filipinos will experience and enjoy its many benefits, and we are hopeful that the bike-hailing industry will continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic,” Move It president and CEO Francis Juan also said.

Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed, said it was high time that Mr. Duterte stepped in to address the issues faced by their sector, saying thousands of drivers affected by the moratorium just want “to work and earn a decent living for their families.”  “Tatay Digong, we are calling on you to help us. We fully support your programs. We only want to have a good and proper job,” Coronel said in a press briefing in Quezon City. Coronel and several allied groups went to the Department of Transportation to submit a written appeal, which they said bore the signaturesof 122,000 passengers and drivers, mostly from transport network company (TNC) Grab.  Tim Orbos, the undersecretary for road transport, assured the groups they would “find ways to solve this impasse,” but said they should also “understand [the government’s] point of view.” “We do not want them to stop their operations. We have to do our task as government. We understand that there’s a problem [in our mass transport systems]. Definitely, we would not do something that would further inconvenience the public,” he said.  In July last year, the LTFRB issued the moratorium as it cited the need to look into various concerns arising from the rapid acceptance of app-based transport services, such as surge pricing, passenger security and accountability of the drivers. Earlier this month, the LTFRB announced it would start apprehending Grab and Uber drivers whom the TNCs allowed to operate without a provisional authority (PA) or certificates of public convenience (CPCs). The crackdown, which could affect more than 40,000 drivers, was supposed to take effect on July 26 but was put on hold on Thursday after Grab and Uber filed motions for reconsideration. At present, just about 3,700 drivers have been issued PAs and CPCs. The LTFRB earlier said it would fast-track the approval of around 11,000 applications. Meanwhile, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada yesterday disclosed that the original accreditation documents of Uber and Grab could not be found when she and other appointees of the Duterte administration took over the board last year.  “We tried to locate the accreditation folders of both Uber and Grab. However, after searching the office of the executive director and the chair, they were nowhere to be found,” Lizada said. But the matter was a nonissue for former board member Ariel Inton.“It is very easy to get a copy, assuming it was lost,” Inton said. “If it was lost in the executive director’s office, there are other copies [in other offices].” Inton added that all LTFRB documents were “properly turned over” by former chair Winston Ginez to his successor, Martin Delgra III. Grab’s accreditation as a TNC expired earlier this month while that of Uber will expire next month. Lizada explained that the loss of the accreditation papers would have no effect on the renewal of their accreditation. Both TNCs have already submitted their petitions for renewal."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1208559/grab-users-dismayed-by-measly-refund","title":"Grab users dismayed by measly refund","date":"05:48 AM January 03, 2020","snippet":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated.","body":"When PJ, 23, heard news that ride-hailing giant Grab would be sending out refunds to its customers, he was elated. In the past year, he had used the app almost every day. He estimates that he has spent thousands of pesos on the premium hailing service for a faster commute in Metro Manila.  But on New Year’s Eve, he was surprised to see a refund of only P27 split in three tranches: P15, P9 and P3. “It was frustrating,” he said. “Obviously I had spent much more than what I got.”  He’s not the only one. Millions of Grab passengers on Tuesday had also received almost the same amount, as Grab rolled out the P19.4-million penalty imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for charging beyond the acceptable fare-in-range during two separate monitoring periods. Each peso a user received stands for every P1,200 (for those who used the app in February-May) or P400 (May-August) he spent on the app.  PJ’s P27 rebate means he spent anywhere between P10,800 and P32,400 for the ride-hailing service. Beyond that, however, Commuters of the Philippines founder Julius Dalay said the recent rebate rollout was symptomatic of the government’s lax regulation of transport network companies (TNCs) like Grab, leaving passengers vulnerable to overcharging fares. While Grab maintains that it abides by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB)’s fare matrix, the variables in the fare (P2-minute travel fee and surge rate) means it sometimes go beyond the acceptable fare-in-range set by the PCC. “This is more a symptom of regulation not being strengthened,” Dalay said in an interview. “Both the LTFRB and the PCC need to coordinate and put in place a system where they can better monitor if Grab is overcharging its passengers.” The LTFRB earlier launched an initial investigation into Grab’s alleged price-gouging practices and found that a large number of the complaints it filtered were not instances of overcharging, but the result of severe traffic doubling the time rate of the fare matrix.  A large part of this is the surge component, which is computed by adding time and distance and multiplying it to up to 2x. Grab uses an estimated travel time to compute its fares upfront, which could make other fares seem like “overcharging.” The two sample fare breakdowns shown by the LTFRB to reporters illustrated as much. In one of the sample fares that cost P478, covering 12 kilometers under 49 minutes, Grab had “overcomputed” the distance rate at P187.80 (P12x15 should have been P180) and the time rate at P122 (P49x2 should have been P98), but had adjusted the surge rate by P181. Another trip that cost P439, which took 43 minutes covering 10 km “undercomputed” its time rate: P62 (should have been P86). It then “overcomputed” its distance rate by P1.20. It’s why the initial results are inconclusive, said LTFRB technical division chief Joel Bolanos. For the LTFRB to charge Grab of overcharging, it must have proof that the excess computations are systematic, not outliers. Dalay added that there was also an issue with the way the rebates were rolled out. Passengers have no way of knowing if the rebates matched their actual expense. “The way that the rebates were computed is not transparent. There’s no counterchecking. While Grab can claim they have a system in place, people should still have the capacity to know how the rebates was obtained,” he said. Moving forward, he also urged Grab and other TNCs to be more transparent with their fare breakdowns so commuters can verify for themselves if they are being overcharged. “This is not only for the benefit of the passengers but also for them. So that when the time comes and regulators again question discrepancies, they can easily pinpoint where overcharging has taken place,” he said."},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/196451/militia-used-by-china-for-territorial-grab-extolled-in-music-video","title":"Militia used by China for territorial grab extolled in music video","date":"05:06 PM May 21, 2021","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines—China may be denying on the world stage the existence of its maritime militia, but back home, it has its own official music video.","body":"MANILA, Philippines—China may be denying on the world stage the existence of its maritime militia, but back home, it has its own official music video. The music video was produced by Sansha Garrison, called “Song of the Sansha Maritime Militia,” the Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported early this week, as part of its extensive investigation on the nature of Sansha City’s maritime militia.  Sansha City was established in 2012 to administer China’s territorial grab in the South China Sea, which included Philippine waters in the West Philippine Sea. The music video was uploaded on Chinese video sharing website Bilibili on April 13, 2020.  RFA said the video depicts the city’s maritime militia training with weapons, surveillance tactics, boarding operations and other related activities. In a translation provided by Andrew Erickson, a professor at US Naval War College and a leading expert on the Chinese maritime militia, part of the lyrics reads:  The Maritime Militia is the guardian of the ocean frontier/ Serve the Country and be loyal to the Party/ In peacetime, be the vanguard of rights protection/ In times of emergency, join the battle and win the war/ Be proud, we are the Sansha Maritime Militia Ships that looked like the “Qiongsanshayu” Chinese militia vessels were also seen in the music video, RFA reported. According to Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and satellite imagery, these vessels were deployed to parts of the South China Sea in 2020, including to Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal, which China grabbed following a standoff with the Philippines in 2012, it added. The steel-hulled vessels called “Qiongsanshayu,” the RFA report said, were part of the Sansha City Fisheries Development, which RFA said was likely a civilian front for a paramilitary force, citing documents it gathered. Determining the real character of the Chinese militia vessels had been tricky. Most pose as fishing vessels, but they are not actually fishing. Militias are being used to aggressively enforce China’s territorial theft in the South China Sea, including West Philippine Sea, without sparking overt war. Formally, they are part of China’s armed forces.  The Philippines has protested the incursions of China militia vessels in the West Philippine Sea. Beijing trashed and ignored the protests, saying the vessels were for fishing and not part of a militia, a claim described by Philippine officials as a brazen lie.

But a Grab official warned that allowing that  many players without the government allowing more app-based vehicles to operate could actually spell more hassles than benefits for commuters.  Grab country head Brian Cu said only “two to three TNCs could survive” at the current cap of 66,750 set by the LTFRB. The number refers to the maximum number of vehicles that can use ride-hailing applications. “If you have too many TNCs that the TNVS (transport network vehicle services) need to attach themselves to, that supply will spread out. It would result in more difficulties in booking a car,” Cu said in an interview on Wednesday.  Uneven densities Because the cap fixes the number of app-based drivers on the road regardless of platform (Grab, Uber, for example), more TNCs would mean uneven “densities” of drivers as their networks thin out, he said.  “For example, if I book a car using Owto and it has 1,000 cars, it’s very unlikely that those cars are in a constricted area. Those cars would be all over Manila because that is where the demand would bring them. If the supply (of drivers) is spread out and the density is very low on a per TNC basis, people will find it harder to get a car.” Cu’s remarks follow the LTFRB’s accreditation of Micab, a Cebu-based taxi hailing app, on Monday. Alongside Hype, Hirna, Go Lag and Owto, this fifth TNC is expected to challenge Grab’s dominance in the country since its acquisition of Uber’s Southeast Asia operations. While stressing that he was not worried about Grab’s competitiveness in the market, Cu warned that the entry of several new players could actually cause an “overall network deficiency.” “If the current cap is concentrated within two or three TNCs, that’s OK. But once you get to five or six, the concentration becomes fragmented,” he said. Complaints vs Grab  Asked whether the regulatory agency would reopen discussions to adjust the cap for TNVS, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said they would first observe how the TNCs would be drawing from the current pool of available TNVS. Grab has come under fire of late amid mounting complaints from passengers, mostly about canceled bookings and difficulty in booking cars. This prompted the TNC to impose sanctions on almost 500 drivers. However, the company maintained that the root problem was the severe lack of app-based vehicles authorized to service passengers. To explain the undersupply, Cu said Grab received at least 600,000 booking requests every day but had only 35,000 vehicles in its fleet to serve riders. Of the 19,000 active Uber vehicles prior to the Grab acquisition, only 11,000 moved to Grab. At least 6,000 were not allowed to continue operating as TNVS as they were not part of the LTFRB’s masterlist, Cu said. Cu said the company had appealed to the LTFRB to allow the 6,000 drivers to be absorbed by Grab. “With an average of 12 rides a day, this is already an additional 72,000 rides, which can help ease the plight of riders,” he said."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1282346/grab-to-implement-addtl-safety-measures-in-car-services-vs-covid-19-spread","title":"‘New normal’ ushers in Grab’s ‘no-touch policy’ in car services","date":"02:07 PM May 28, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Call it a chivalrous move, or maybe Grab drivers are just practicing self-care for the so-called “new normal”. Once ride-hailing services of Grab Philippines resume, passengers will have to wear face masks at all times and will no longer be allowed to open and close the doors by themselves.  This, after Grab Philippines released on Thursday additional safety and hygiene protocols in its ride-hailing services to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) once it resumes its operations. In an online media forum, Grab head of Transport and Shared Services Ronald Roda said its car services will comply with the two-passenger limit and cashless payment.  Passengers and drivers will also be required to wear face masks at all times. Vehicles must also be disinfected at the end of every trip. Drivers must also install a barrier between them and passengers, Roda said.  Both drivers and passengers will also be allowed to cancel their trips, or what Roda called “valid cancellation,” if either of them is not wearing a face mask or not abiding by other safety protocols. “Effectively, … if the passenger does not have a mask or there’s more than two in a car, the driver is allowed to cancel the ride,” he said. Under its guidelines, Grab drivers will have to open and close the doors for passengers, as passengers will no longer be allowed to touch the doors themselves in order to minimize contact. Passengers will also not be allowed to book their rides for others for contact-tracing purposes. However, this rule may be set aside emergency cases. Grab cars will not be allowed to transport COVID-19 patients. “They are required to show their booking code to their respective driver-partner before entering their assigned vehicle. However, exceptions will be made in specific cases of emergencies wherein the destination is a hospital and the account holder or companion was the one who made the booking,” Grab said in its statement.  Eating and/or drinking will not be allowed inside the car, Roda said. Passengers and drivers will receive messages and notifications to remind them of the proper safety and hygiene protocol during their rides. “Our focus is on safety, and we are leveraging all the tech that is necessary to the point of having to remind both passengers and drivers all the time, with messaging on the app and pop-ups that there are new rules to be followed,” Roda said. Drivers have to undergo safety training before they will be allowed to ply the road again, Roda said. About 20,000 drivers are expected to be ready for deployment once transport network vehicle service (TNVS) units are once again allowed on the road upon the easing up of lockdown measures. Metro Manila and other “high-risk” areas have been under strict quarantine measures since March 17, which shifted to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) starting May 15 to May 31. The further downgrading of quarantine measures, or the shift to general community quarantine (GCQ), is looming after the metropolis’ mayors as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force against Infectious Diseases (IATF) recommended such to the President. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make an announcement on the community quarantine measures on Thursday night.

Grab announced Monday it would take over Uber’s operations and assets in the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, ending months of speculation.  In exchange, California-based Uber will get a 27.5-percent stake in the combined business—a move seen to cut Uber’s massive losses as it prepares to go public next year. Grab said the figure reflected Uber’s market share in the region. In the Philippines, Grab has taken out a key rival in an environment where growth has been constrained by a ride-sharing vehicle cap implemented by regulator Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).Moreover, the companies might need the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission before completing the deal in the country.PCC commissioner Johannes Bernabe said if the deal met the agency’s transaction thresholds, then the parties must file a transaction notice.“Parties have 30 days from execution of their definitive agreement within which to notify the PCC,” he said in a text message on Monday. He said parties “are not supposed to consummate their transaction” while PCC reviews the deal.According to Grab, Uber’s service in Southeast Asia would be available until April 8 this year as drivers transition to Grab’s platform. Moreover, Uber’s business services would no longer be supported in Southeast Asia after the transaction.“With a larger fleet of drivers on our platform, passenger transportation needs will be met faster. Passengers will get to enjoy shorter waiting times, more convenient and affordable rides through one platform,” Grab said.It said the fare structure for passengers alongside incentives and benefits for drivers would remain the same.  A Grab spokesperson declined to share domestic figures although the company, which launched in 2012 as a taxi-booking service, claimed that around five million people use its platform every day. The ride-sharing demand-and-supply gap is pronounced in the Philippines, where a more than 10-minute wait for a ride is not unusual. LTFRB recently capped the supply of transport network vehicle services (TNVS) at 65,000 for Metro Manila, 1,500 units for Cebu and 250 for Pampanga. This followed an almost two-year moratorium.  LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said on Feb. 23 that the cap would be enough to serve around 75 percent of existing demand. It will be reviewed every three months. Lizada said passengers should ideally wait just two to three minutes for their ride. The transition worried the likes of Marcial, who declined to have his surname published. He cited key differences in how Grab and Uber drivers accept passengers. Grab drivers are allowed to view the destination of riders before accepting a trip— a feature not allowed in Uber. As noted, Grab and Uber would be “working together to promptly migrate Uber drivers and riders” over the next two weeks. “We are very excited to welcome Uber drivers to our Grab family.

MMDA General Manager Jojo Garcia sought to temper fears, however, that the high-resolution, China-made cameras would entitle Grab drivers to special treatment from the agency. “Let’s not put malice into it,” Garcia told reporters, adding: “There are private sectors who really want to help because when traffic frees up, they also benefit.”  The president of a commuters’ group also welcomed the donation, saying it would be “beneficial to all stakeholders involved.” But at the same time, she called on the terms of the endowment to be made clear. “We know that when there are donations, people wonder, ‘What do they want?’” said Maricor Akol, head of the National Center for Commuter Safety and Protection.  “So there are no lingering doubts, the deed of donation must state clearly that there are no strings attached,” Akol told the Inquirer. Part of Grab’s CSR efforts Grab’s public affairs head, Leo Emmanuel Gonzales, said the donation, which was part of the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, would “not in any way protect erring Grab drivers.” “The fact that we offered this as a donation, we are putting our foot forward in saying please, go ahead, if there are any erring drivers under Grab, then apprehend them by all means,” Gonzales stressed. If drivers who violate traffic rules introduce themselves as Grab employees and are allowed to walk free, it will be caught on camera and MMDA enforcers will face the consequences, Garcia warned.  “These cameras will bolster transparency and protect enforcers who are cursed at, fought with or injured,” he added. “For motorists, it will protect them from enforcers who ask for bribes.” The body cameras, costing around P9,000 each, will cover only a small fraction of the MMDA’s 2,000-strong bevy of traffic enforcers. Garcia expressed hope, however, that more donations from the private sector would enable at least half of them to be equipped with body cameras this year. The MMDA does not have enough money to buy the equipment for its men, he said. The Grab-donated cameras would likely be distributed to enforcers assigned to Edsa this week after they undergo training, Garcia added. According to Gonzales, the cameras were “very easy to use.” He said the LCD-equipped devices with a battery life of 12 hours would produce high-quality video and voice recordings, even at night. The MMDA added that the cameras would record nonstop and enforcers would be asked to explain any gaps in the footage. Speedy apprehension process Aside from reinforcing transparency, body cameras could also help decongest various choke points throughout Metro Manila by speeding up apprehensions, according to Akol. “Now, when violators are caught, they move to the side and hog the lane. With body cameras, it’s a swift transaction; no questions asked,” Akol said. Garcia said the footage captured by body cameras would be regularly reviewed to spot misdeeds committed by both enforcers and motorists. “I’m giving a warning to motorists: If you do something wrong, don’t make any attempt to bribe [the enforcer],” the MMDA official added. “You are testing [their] personality and honesty. Let’s help them change.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919875/think-tank-scrap-limit-on-uber-grab","title":"Think tank: Scrap limit on Uber, Grab","date":"05:25 AM August 03, 2017","snippet":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab.","body":"A group of prominent economists under the Foundation for Economic Freedom (FEF) urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to do away with restrictions on permits issued to drivers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Grab. FEF — an advocacy group for good economic governance and market-friendly reforms — said Uber, Grab, Easy Taxi, Wunder carpool, Angkas and similar ride-sharing services were doing the riding public a service that regular public utility vehicles had been unable to provide.  The benefits come from on-demand service, ability to provide feedback and choice despite the lack of visible markings, as well as safety and peace of mind due to thorough screening and training provided by the ride-sharing services and feedback from the riding public, the group said in a statement on Wednesday. FEF said it was therefore “untimely and inappropriate” for the LTRFB to curtail the service by capping the number of permits issued to the drivers of these ride-sharing services.  It stressed: “Limiting the number of vehicles allowed to do ride-sharing is not only anticompetitive, but it also forces the riding public to use their own cars on the road to add to the traffic congestion and also compels them to bear with the abuses perpetuated by regulated private utility vehicles, such as taxis.” FEF is chaired by former Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, with Romy Bernardo as vice chair and Calixto Chikiamco as president. Its senior advisers are former Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cesar Virata and UP Economics Professor Emeritus and former Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat.  Market forces, public good Board members include Anthony Abad, Art Corpuz, Eduardo Gana, Felipe Medalla, Vaugh Montes, Simon Paterno, Perry Pe and Gloria Tan-Climaco. The group added that recent discussions on minimum working hours for drivers and other comments demonizing surge pricing should be reconsidered by looking at this from the perspective of how market forces could serve the public good. Surge pricing during peak hours, it said, encourages drivers to make themselves available when they are needed most. From the point of view of riders, it encourages them to plan their trips to avoid the busy, more expensive periods. “Surge pricing, therefore, creates behavior that self-corrects fares to lower levels.  In contrast, minimum working hours only fill the street with additional cars when less needed, adding to traffic congestion, wasting fuel and oversupply,” FEF said.  The group said there’s a clear need to update and modernize the Public Service Act to account for this wave of technology-enabled transport services with the objective of serving and protecting the public. The regulators must incorporate the principles of technology and the market to improve public transport services in cities around the country, FEF said. In addition, FEF said Congress should review Executive Order 202, which created the LTFRB, to clarify the mandate and regulatory powers of the agency “in light of new technology and the need of the public for safe, affordable, and convenient public transport services.” ‘Shocked’ at House hearing The group issued the statement three weeks after the LTFRB imposed a P5-million fine each on Uber and Grab for violating its year-old moratorium on the acceptance of new partner drivers. When it ordered the ban in July 2016, the board said it had to review guidelines concerning surge pricing, passenger security and drivers’ accountability, among others. In a House committee hearing on Wednesday, the two TNCs disclosed the current size of their driver memberships and vehicle accreditations—figures that “shocked” LTFRB chair Martin Delgra. Uber government relations and public policy head Yves Gonzalez said the company had 66,000 partners “who have taken at least one trip in the past year.” Of this number, only 2,500 drivers have provisional authority to operate while another 1,000 have pending motions for extension, he said. Meanwhile, Grab country head Brian Cu said the company had 52,398 accredited vehicles, of which 3,000 to 4,000 had provisional authority to operate. Delgra said the huge figures came as a shock to him and the agency. “During the July hearing (at the LTFRB),” he recalled, “they said they have 28,000 more or less each. Today, they’re saying twice or more than twice as many. That’s why we say we are shocked.” “It is good you were able to solicit the numbers directly from them,” Delgra told the House transportation committee. “These are the data we have been trying to get since last year to exact accountability as well as address the issue of price surging.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); But Uber’s public policy director Damian Kassabgi said policymakers should not put too much weight on the number of drivers, as only a small proportion of them actually plied the road at any given time. “Sixty percent of our drivers do not see themselves as full-time drivers. Many drive for less than 10 hours a week. [To say that] one taxi car is equivalent to one ride-sharing car is simply not true,” he said. “It’s important not to get stuck on the numbers here.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/978890/drivers-start-massive-migration-to-grab-as-uber-exits","title":"Drivers start massive migration to Grab as Uber exits","date":"09:59 PM March 28, 2018","snippet":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people.","body":"Hundreds of Uber drivers flocked to the Megatent Events Venue in Quezon City on Wednesday – part of a massive migration effort that could involve as many as 24,000 people. It was the second day of an “onboarding” session for Uber drivers in Manila after Singapore-based ridesharing giant Grab acquired the Southeast Asian operations of its main rival.  Should Grab Philippines succeed in luring all of Uber’s drivers, it would corner about 90 percent of Metro Manila’s ridesharing sector, capped at 65,000 units by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). That prospect has consumers worrying about higher costs and poorer services, following the notion that fewer competitors provide fewer incentives for private enterprises to do better.  Standing beside a row of Japanese compact sedans and AUVs, ridesharing’s most popular car models here, Uber driver Patricia was indifferent to a business deal that had only served to disrupt her main source of income. “I have no choice but to move. I borrowed money to buy my car and I need to pay it off,” she told the Inquirer.  In ridesharing, Patricia found a way to make money on her own terms by transporting passengers using Uber’s technology platform whenever she had the free time. In exchange, Uber takes a 25 percent cut. Patricia was among dozens of drivers, some with their young children in tow, gathered outside the Megatent on Wednesday. Near the entrance, a Grab staffer was reading out names from a so-called master list provided by the LTFRB. Only those people in the list would be allowed to move to Grab. Uber will cease to operate in Southeast Asia by April 8 this year. But Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu told reporters they would continue to process and accept Uber drivers even after that date.  “We will continue this until all Uber drivers on the master list of the LTFRB are activated on our platform,” Cu said. The mood was lighter inside the air-conditioned Megatent, which could accommodate at least 1,000 people. Migrating Uber drivers, welcomed inside as “Uberkads,” were seated while waiting to be called again to submit their requirements. It was noontime and pastries from a local bakeshop chain were being distributed to the waiting drivers. In another part of the hall, Grab staffers were holding mini orientation sessions for their former rivals. Inside, the Uberkads mused about the driver-friendly features of Grab, such as the ability to see a passenger’s destination before accepting a trip. This is not allowed by Uber. Grab also offers better incentives, they said. They noted that one drawback with Grab was that drivers would need to keep a minimum amount of money in its system to continue booking passengers. It is from this fund that Grab takes it commission. According to Cu, services are also expected to improve. He noted that when there were two big operators, drivers simply switched networks when penalized for bad behavior, such as frequently canceling rides. “Now, there is a bit more weight to following the rules,” Cu said. He added that the enlarged network of Grab would help control prices, given the supply-demand algorithms utilized by the ridesharing sector, and improved waiting times.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said in a press conference Wednesday that fare hikes would also be strictly regulated. Moreover, new competition is on the way with local companies Lag Go, Owto and Hype each seeking to operate as a transport network company, the formal category for businesses like Uber and Grab. “So if you say there is no competition, soon there will be,” Lizada said. Later addressing the drivers on queue, Lizada urged them to follow regulations, ridesharing being a public service. “Let us start on the proper footing,” she said. Getting started is the most important issue for Rex Restauro, who has been an Uber driver for eight months. Restauro, who owns a computer shop, uses ridesharing to make extra income in the evening. He said he has no qualms about switching to Grab. “I’m in this industry anyway so it’s a waste to stop it now. Even if you have a day job, you can make money here,” he said. /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/957172/breaking-grab-fuel-excise-tax-train-law-tnvs","title":"Grab wants P10 to P13 fare hike amid looming higher fuel excise tax","date":"02:42 PM January 03, 2018","snippet":"","body":"    Transport network company Grab has announced its plan to seek a fare hike of around six to 10 percent, or P10 to P13, citing the anticipated higher operating expenses amid the impending increase in fuel excise tax brought about by the government’s new tax reform package.  Under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, which took effect on January 1, the government would impose higher excise tax rates on vehicles and petroleum products. “We will file a petition with the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to request for a fare change,” Grab Philippines head Brian Cu said in a press conference.  “Now, we are still computing the exact impact of that fare change, but we are looking at a fare increase of anywhere between 6% to 10% of current fares,” he said, adding that the rates would mean a P10 to P13 increase in the fare. Cu explained that a Grab driver consumes an average of P800 to P1,000 worth of fuel a day, among other daily expenses to operate as a Transport Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) partner.“When we compute the average income of the driver of what he needs to make to make a sustainable to 3,200 to 3,600 in fares. Of that amount, P900 to P1,100 for fuel. That’s 20 to 22 liters,” Cu said. When the higher excise tax rates are applied, Cu said there would be an increase of around five percent, in addition to maintenance and vehicle spare parts of two percent to three percent in the Grab driver’s operating expenses. “Because of excise tax on petroleum products, this would definitely impact their daily expenses, which would then impact their monthly earnings,” Cu said. “Our biggest worry is the day to day operations with regards to the fuel they (drivers) need. If a fare adjustment is not made, this would put into question their income on a monthly basis,” he said.  In case the LTFRB finds merit in their petition and approves it, Cu said the fare hike would only be effective should they observe a “significant change” in fuel prices. “Hindi pa naman nagaakyat ang mga gas stations ng fuel prices. The increase should not apply to old stock, according to the government,” Cu said. “We will not increase it until we see a significant change in pump prices,” he said.               /kga"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1020818/hype-ltfrb-petition-vs-grab-license-to-operat","title":"Hype asks LTFRB not to renew Grab’s license to operate","date":"07:22 PM August 13, 2018","snippet":"Transport network vehicle service (TNVS) Hype has filed a petition to the Land Transportation and Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) asking it not to renew the Grab Philippines’ license to operate.","body":"Transport network vehicle service (TNVS) Hype has filed a petition to the Land Transportation and Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) asking it not to renew the Grab Philippines’ license to operate.

According to Hype, Grab has been engaged in “unfair” business practices, making the ride-sharing market uneven for both drivers and operators. Jen Silan, chief operating officer of Hype Transport Systems, Inc., said her company met with other TNVs stakeholder and they agreed that Grab had violated some terms under the rules governing transport network companies.  “Their issues with Grab came to the forefront of the discussions, and with their blessing, we have decided to make these known and elevate them to the proper authorities,” Silan said Silan noted that some of the violations of Grab included illegally charging P2 per minute of waiting time and charging its passengers a taxi booking fee of up to P100 or higher during peak hours.  Hype also has a pending case filed at the LTFRB regarding its own issue on the P2-per-minute charge. Hype categorically denied the allegation.

De Guzman is in critical condition after an accident in a Grab ride, causing him to sustain “severe traumatic brain injury.” A viral Facebook post from Marko’s cousin, Steffi de Guzman, said Marko and his friend, Alia booked a Grab car last Oct. 26 along Taft Avenue, Manila. She said the Grab ride was allegedly running too fast and was driven by a sleepy Grab driver.

Karen, who studies law at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told the Inquirer on Monday that while she understands that transport network companies should follow the rules on franchises, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) should be more considerate since thousands of commuters rely on this “convenient” and “efficient” mode of transport.  She said that should the LTFRB push through on July 26 with its decision to apprehend app-based drivers who do not have franchises to operate, she would be forced to ride in taxis whose drivers are sometimes rude and refuse to bring passengers to their destination. Karen added that without the transport network companies (TNCs), her studies might be affected as commuting to school using other mass transport systems like jeepneys and trains would be too tiring.  Regular Uber user Jef Manalac shares Karen’s predicament, adding that some taxi drivers tamper with their meters or do not give the exact change. He noted that instead of focusing on a system that works, the LTFRB should crack down on “colorum” vans and taxis. However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada stood firm on Monday on their decision against the TNCs, pointing out that they “were simply cleaning up the mess that the TNCs created.”  “The board gave both TNCs the opportunity to comply [with our order] to show good faith. In the event that they refuse or fail to comply, then enforcement is in order. The board will not be influenced nor will it succumb to pressure,” she told reporters. Last week, the LTFRB fined Grab and Uber P5 million each for violating the terms and conditions of their accreditation, such as the inclusion in their platforms of drivers who do not have franchises to operate. Lizada said the TNCs were not given the harshest penalty which was cancelation of their accreditation out of consideration for the riding public. By July 26 though, Grab and Uber drivers without franchises will be fined P120,000 and their vehicles impounded for three months should they continue to operate. Lizada warned that if TNCs defy the LTFRB’s order, “the board might be constrained to apply the full force of the law considering that both [their] accreditations are under review.”  Of the estimated 56,000 drivers of the two TNCs, only more than 3,000 were given franchises by the LTFRB until it imposed a moratorium last year. Bobby Coronel, founder of drivers’ group TopSpeed and a Grab driver, said that they have been trying to comply with the LTFRB’s requirements for the issuance of a franchise. He added though that should the agency push through with its order, they would have no choice but to comply with it. Despite the LTFRB order, Grab said in a statement yesterday that “at this time, we will not deactivate any of our partners.” “Grab will continue reaching out to the government to seek clarity on its order. We urge the LTFRB to convene the technical working group as soon as possible so we can discuss important matters affecting the TNC-TNVS (transport network vehicle service) industry, more so the riding public,” it added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1125274/solons-why-isnt-grab-giving-automatic-senior-discounts","title":"Solons: Why isn’t Grab giving automatic senior discounts?","date":"05:18 AM May 31, 2019","snippet":"Lawmakers on Thursday ordered the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to investigate ride-hailing firm Grab for certain practices that they said was indicative of the company’s reckless monopoly of the industry.","body":"Lawmakers on Thursday ordered the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to investigate ride-hailing firm Grab for certain practices that they said was indicative of the company’s reckless monopoly of the industry. Grab was accused of not providing the mandated 20-percent discount to senior citizens, as well as operating around 8,000 “colorum” vehicles, among other violations.  While the accusations are not new, pressure from Congress could place Grab at the cusp of another legal battle that could end in hefty fines. “How come with other players we can impose the full law but with big companies like Grab, they barely get beyond a slap on the wrist?” asked Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves during the House committee hearing.  Teves noted the company’s seeming lack of mechanisms to ensure that the senior citizen discount automatically applies whenever they book rides or order food via the app. Grab spokesperson Nicka Hosaka told lawmakers that Grab already recognizes and applies the discount for senior citizen users who register onto the platform.  Registration includes inputting one’s age and other personal information followed by a three-day verification process, after which registered users are allowed to enjoy the discount.  But Teves argued: “Let’s say I, a nonsenior citizen, books a ride, but it is my grandmother who will actually ride. Do they get a discount?” Blatant violation When Hosaka said no, Teves turned to LTFRB technical division chief Joel Bolano and said: “See, that is a blatant violation of the law.” LTFRB board member Ronaldo Corpus explained that the matter had already been brought up in previous hearings. In a separate interview, Grab public affairs head Leo Gonzales told the Inquirer that the 8,000 colorum drivers still in their books were a carryover problem from Uber’s Southeast Asian operations, which Grab acquired in April 2017.  While Grab was getting rid of about 500 colorum drivers a week, doing so drastically could “cause the entire market to collapse,” Gonzales said. That dire prediction illustrates Grab’s monopoly, Teves said, such that a slight change in their ecosystem could provoke “carmageddon.” The LTFRB had allowed unregistered transport network vehicle service units to continue operating provided they apply for renewal."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/941377/good-samaritan-grab-driver-shot-dead-gerardo-maquidato-jr","title":"Good Samaritan Grab driver shot in back of his head by lone carjacker","date":"05:52 PM October 29, 2017","snippet":"A Grab driver who went viral months ago for helping out a sick passenger was killed by a gunman who pretended to be a passenger, bringing with him the victim’s car on his escape.","body":"A Grab driver who went viral months ago for helping out a sick passenger was killed by a gunman who pretended to be a passenger, bringing with him the victim’s car on his escape. Gerardo Maquidato Jr., lauded by the transport network vehicle service (TNVS) as one of its “best drivers,” was shot dead on Bonanza Street, Barangay 189, Don Carlos Village in Pasay City on Thursday evening by a lone assailant.  According a report by case investigator PO3 Henry Manong, Maquidato sustained a lone gunshot wound in the back of his head. The slug exited through his left eye. The silver Toyota Innova with conduction sticker YV 7109 was also carnapped by the suspect on his escape.  A witness told the police that he was on Bonanza Street, Don Carlos Village at 7:45 p.m. on Thursday when he spotted a parked Innova with a broken front passenger window. He thought it was a case of a parked vehicle being vandalized until he saw a man in a white shirt pull out the body of a bloodied man in the driver’s seat.  The man dumped the body on the pavement and drove away in the Innova. The incident was captured on a closed circuit television camera. Chief Insp. Rogelio Hernandez, chief of Pasay police investigation, said police were looking initially at carjacking as the motive. He said they were still waiting for Grab to forward to them the information of Maquidato’s last passenger and the other bookings he received on that day. In a statement, Grab said it mourned for the “needless and untimely death of one of our best driver-partners.” “Grab condemns this sensless murder and is alredy collaborating authorities to esnure that justice will be served and perpetrators will be put behind bars,” it added.  According to Grab, it has reported at least six confirmed incidents of carnapping perpetrated by criminals pretending to be legitimate passengers. It said it had started cooperating with Task Force Limbas of the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group. Fearing for the security of other drivers, Bryan Cu, Grab PH country head, said the firm’s officials were still in talks with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to implement a “know your customer” scheme for its riders. This includes asking passengers to take a photo of themselves with a government issued ID. He also said they were in plans to subsidize the cost of dashboard cameras of its drivers and put trackers on their cars. “Grab is doing what it can to support its Grab partner drivers and ensure safety on the road,” he said on his Facebook video. In October last year, Maquidato was recognized as one of its best drivers after he gave a free ride to a sick passenger. On her Facebook post, Divine Lactao Ornum said she booked a GrabCar for her sister Prima, who was on her way to Quezon City from Pasay to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato did not ask for any payment for the trip. The post went viral and the Grab driver was praised of more than 100,000 people. On Aug. 22 last year, Prima died of complications due to diabetes. But Maquidato’s kindness for the Ornum family was not forgotten.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); In another post on Friday, Ornum said Maquidato even volunteered his car to ferry attendees of Prima’s burial. During the awarding in October, Maquidato invited Ornum’s family to share his award with them. The driver even gave some of the freebies he received to Ornum’s relatives. Come Christmas last year, Maquidato went out of his way and returned to Ornum’s house and gave Christmas gifts to her children relatives since Grab had given him his bonus. Ornum also called for justice for Maquidato’s death and help be extended to his family. “Kuya Gerardo, may you rest in peace,” Ornum said. “I hope that you meet my sister [in heaven] where she can finally thank you.” /atm"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/941647/grace-poe-backs-grabs-move-to-boost-security-for-drivers","title":"Poe backs Grab’s move to boost security for drivers","date":"08:43 PM October 30, 2017","snippet":"Sen.

Grace Poe backed on Monday Grab Philippines’ move to add security measures that would help verify its passengers’ identity following the death of Gerardo “Junjie” Amolato Maquidato Jr., one of the transport network company’s drivers who was hailed a “good Samaritan.” Last Oct. 28 evening, Maquidato was robbed and shot dead in Pasay City by an unknown assailant who booked a ride and posed as a passenger.  “We condemn the killing of Grab driver-partner Gerardo ‘Junjie’ Amolato Maquidato Jr. and exhort the concerned authorities to arrest the perpetrators,” Poe, chair of the Senate public services committee, said in a statement. “Grab Philippines should show utmost cooperation with the police in sharing relevant details that could help track down these killers on the loose and in retrieving the vehicle of Junjie,” she added.  Grab Philippines country chief Brian Cu has expressed his support for the investigation into the death of Maquidato, who was hailed by their company as one of their best drivers last October 2016, for providing a free ride to a passenger who was about to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Cu said they would provide a reward of P100,000 to anyone who could give any leads on Maquidato’s killing.  He also moved to institutionalize additional security measures to verify the identity of passengers booking rides. “We support the plan to institutionalize in the system of Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS) additional security measures that would help verify the identity of the passengers, especially those contracting ride-hailing services at night. This should be done, of course, with the understanding that the information would be kept confidential,” Poe said. As the Senate public services committee drafts the law on app-based riding services, Poe said they would take into account and include provisions that would not just ensure the safety of the riders but the drivers as well. “It is lamentable that in the past months, the TNVS community has become the target of lawless elements, victimizing its driver-partners. They need protection, as well,” the senator said. “Swift justice is the least we could give to Junjie, who is known to be a good samaritan among his colleagues and passengers for his generous deeds,” she added. /atm"},{"url":"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/396387/grab-ph-bans-over-100-delivery-drivers-in-cebu-city-for-availing-promo","title":"Grab PH bans over 100 delivery drivers in Cebu City for availing ‘promo’","date":"August 25,2021 - 08:23 PM","snippet":"","body":"CEBU CITY, Philippines — Grab PH drivers in Cebu City has sought the help of the Cebu City Council on their loss of livelihood after they were allegedly banned by the food delivery application. A group of drivers told reporters that they were banned by Grab PH on June 28, 2021, and July 4, 2021, after they were alleged of involving in fraudulent activities due to availing of a promo from a local restaurant that offers piso-delivery and a P20-off for any order without minimum orders. The promo was hyped in June 2021, because people could buy food from the local restaurant in Cebu City at P2 pesos per pancit canton due to the P20-off promo and the additional piso-delivery promo of the app. The pancit canton was priced at P21. One of the Grab drivers, whose name will be omitted for protection, said that they availed themselves of the promo at night because they were hungry. He claimed there were no rules against Grab drivers using the app outside duty hours and availing of any subsequent promos thereof. “Daghan kaayo nipalit ato nga promo kay dos pesos nalang gud ilang gibayran. Dili man pud ka buot if kami gibook. So kami pud, kung mopalit mi didto, dili pud mi kabuot kinsa among nabook,” he said.  However, on the eve of July 28, 2021, the Grab drivers who either availed of the promo or booked a client availing of the promo were informed that fraudulent activities were observed in their usage of the app. The drivers said they were banned from the app an hour after they received the text warning and were interviewed for an investigation by Grab PH Cebu’s local administrators in the days that followed. “Giingan mi nga almost 300 kuno mi nga i-ban kay lagi niapil atong promo. Dili man mi makabuot sa among booking. Nya kami man pud gutomon man mi, mao na mopalit pud mi,” said one of the drivers. The drivers alleged that because Grab lost income due to the promo, they were “punishing” the drivers who got booked for the promo or availed the promo themselves. After the second batch of banned drivers on July 4, 2021, the drivers approached Cebu City Councilor Niña Mabatid for help. The banning of drivers subsequently stopped as well. More than 100 Grab drivers were banned before the local administration stopped the banning temporarily. The councilor sought an explanation from Grab but she did not get a reply even after a month, prompting Mabatid to bring the issue to the council.  In her privilege speech, Councilor Mabatid pointed out the importance of delivery drivers during the pandemic when most people could not leave their homes. “Just for everyone to know, ang income sa GRAB is a total of 49 pesos. 9 pesos goes to the grab company while the 40 pesos goes to the grab driver.” “Ayahay ang GRAB kay walay puhunan gi pa gawas. Ang GRAB DRIVER man tawn ang mo advance ug bayad ngadto sa merchant like Jollibee and Mac Donald’s. Luoy gani kung naay mag binoang og order kay ang driver gyud ang alkansi,” she said. Mabatid urged the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Commission on Human Rights (CHR), and other relevant government agencies to investigate the incident. The councilor notes that DOLE through Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has already come up with an advisory on the labor standards for food delivery riders. Labor Advisory No. 14 Series of 2021 dated July 23, 2021, has been “issued to ensure compliance for all delivery and courier activities with applicable  general labor standard and occupational safety and courier activities using the digital platform.” Under Section IV of the said Advisory, delivery riders who are deemed employees shall be entitled to the minimum benefits provided under the Labor Code and other labor laws, such as minimum wage, holiday pay, and other benefits under existing laws, including the right to security of tenure, self-organization, and collective bargaining.   For the councilor, Grab has treated the drivers unfairly and unjustly due to the immediate ban without proper explanation to the riders. She urged the City Council to investigate the incident through an executive session inviting the affected drivers, Grab PH, and other pertinent government agencies. The City Council agreed to do so and has called for an executive session to probe the incident. The Council also passed a resolution urging the companies, partnerships, or individuals,  operating delivery and courier activities using digital platforms in Cebu City to comply with applicable general labor standards and occupational safety. Finally, the City Council urged the City’s Department of Manpower Development and Placement (DMDP) to assist and accommodate the unemployed Grab Drivers to find gainful employment. “I am not saying it is the Grab company’s fault nor the drivers fault. We just want the truth to come out. If sayop sa mga drivers then show us! Ipakita kung unsa ilang sala, Unsa ilang na violate para fair,” said Mabatid. In a text message to CDN Digital, Grab PH said they will investigate the incident in Cebu. “We are carefully investigating the matter, and we will continuously rely on the facts and our open communication channels with our delivery partners. We thank Councilor Mabatid for supporting our delivery partners and rest assured that we will reach out to our partners and address this matter in private.” “Grab will always be committed to supporting the needs of our partners during these difficult times, and we also have a responsibility to ensure that all partners on our platform are incentivized through their honest work – and key to this, are rules and policies that continuously upholds the safety, security, and wellbeing of our consumers, merchants, and partners,” said the food delivery app.            /rcg "},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1224888/grab-told-stop-test-on-video-audio-recording-of-passengers","title":"Grab told: Stop test on video, audio recording of passengers","date":"05:22 AM February 06, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The country’s privacy watchdog has suspended a pilot test of Grab Philippines to keep video and audio recordings of its passengers, noting that the company was concerned more about its own commercial risks than the privacy of its customers.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The country’s privacy watchdog has suspended a pilot test of Grab Philippines to keep video and audio recordings of its passengers, noting that the company was concerned more about its own commercial risks than the privacy of its customers. The National Privacy Commission (NPC) has also suspended the selfie verification program of Grab for the same reason.  These three initiatives, the NPC said, “may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.” The issue marks another conflict between regulators and Grab, which remains the biggest player in the local ride-hailing market after it bought out Uber, its main rival, back in 2018, and triggered competition concerns that were not always dealt with.  In this case, the personal data collected by Grab is supposed to help authorities piece together an incident in cases of disputes between driver and passenger, giving the police, upon request, a proper picture of what actually happened during the ride. The video recording system gives employees in the Grab office a front-row seat to what is happening inside a vehicle, but only when the driver prompts them through an emergency button.  Despite the good intentions, the NPC noted how these efforts failed to strike a balance between security interests and privacy rights. Moreover, Grab had not given much thought to the risks its passengers would be exposed to, according to the NPC, and that “only the risks faced by the company were taken into account.” “While this Commission believes that the security of passengers and drivers is a primordial concern, their [passengers’] privacy rights must not be disregarded,” it said. In its cease-and-desist order, the NPC cited a document submitted by Grab called a privacy impact assessment. In the document, Grab evaluated risks under four main categories, namely: “operational downtime, people, reputational damage[,] and financial loss.”  The risks cited by the company led NPC to conclude that Grab had not given much thought to the risks its passengers would be exposed to, and that “only the risks faced by the company were taken into account.” The NPC sent the cease-and-desist order to Grab on Tuesday, a few days after the NPC flagged the company’s deficiencies in a notice issued on Jan. 31. The notice came about a week after Grab had already begun its pilot test. The pilot test began on Jan. 13 and covered 180 Grab vehicles in Metro Manila for two to six weeks. Half of the cars were to be equipped with cameras inside the vehicles while the rest would be equipped with in-car audio recorders. In launching its pilot run, Grab said the recordings would be another “layer of security” for both drivers and passengers. Similar programs were launched by Grab in Jakarta and Uber in the United States. Grab said that they were compliant with the Data Privacy Act, but the NPC said the company failed to state its legal basis for processing the collected data. Based on the documents submitted by Grab, NPC also said the company was not able to establish whether the benefits outweighed the risks, and whether these programs were the only way to achieve their objective. Grab had previously tried to play down concerns, saying riders could always opt not to be recorded without incurring any penalty since they would be informed about the recordings beforehand. If a passenger consents to being recorded, Grab said the audio recording would be encrypted and stored in its data base for seven days and the videos for 10 hours. While this much is true, the NPC said that the details on how to use this opt-out mechanism were “not sufficiently communicated to passengers.” NPC said it was also not clear if and how the data processing would be affected once consent was withdrawn.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The NPC gave the company 15 days from Jan. 31 to comply with the remedial measures it had imposed. The agency did not specify what those measures were. The cease-and-desist order, on the other hand, would remain in effect for each of Grab’s programs, until the company has fully resolved the deficiencies flagged by the NPC. The NPC clarified that the order was not a penalty, but an opportunity to fully comply with the law. “The move, in effect, secures the riding public from unwanted privacy exposure and in the same manner enables the company to modify its system to be compliant with the DPA,” the NPC said. A Grab spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday that the selfie feature and the pilot test were “introduced as pioneering safety technology features with the aim of further protecting our ride hailing community.” “These features follow the legal criteria for lawful processing of data,” the statement read. “However, we recognize the mandate of the NPC to protect user privacy. Passenger selfie feature and audio and video recording pilot tests have been temporarily suspended as we work with NPC to address their concerns,” Grab said. “We will fully cooperate with NPC in providing necessary supporting documents to adhere to their standards, implement additional corrective measures, and ensure that NPC’s expectations and our approach for safety are mutually understood,” it added."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1241529/grab-driver-is-pampangas-first-covid-19-case","title":"Grab driver is Pampanga’s first COVID-19 case","date":"07:47 PM March 13, 2020","snippet":"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO—Pampanga’s first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case is a driver of ride-hailing company Grab, who had serviced routes in Clark Freeport and Pampanga.","body":"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO—Pampanga’s first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case is a driver of ride-hailing company Grab, who had serviced routes in Clark Freeport and Pampanga.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Tuesday that it would review the Grab-Uber deal, hoping to buy more time by convincing the popular ride-hailing firms to delay their transaction.  This developed days after Grab said it would acquire Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, calling it the largest acquisition by a Southeast Asian Internet company. Uber is already scheduled to stop operations on April 8. PCC would be reviewing the deal even after the parties involved said that the transaction was not notifiable under current PCC rules. Technically, Uber and Grab are already allowed to push through with their deal.  However, the law also allows PCC to review a non-notifiable deal if the antitrust body finds a “reasonable basis” to do so, according to PCC Chairman Arsenio Balisacan in an interview with reporters. Notifiable transactions are mergers and acquisitions (M&As) that meet certain requirements deemed to be potentially anti-competitive in the market. Such deal is not allowed to be acted on until PCC finishes its review of the notifiable M&A.  Depending on how the companies would cooperate, the review, which would see if the acquisition is anti-competition, could take months. The first phase of the review takes at most 75 days, Balisacan said. However, if there would be “serious gaps in our analysis because of a lack of information,” the review could extend for another 120 days at most, he added. What would happen in the meantime is yet to be seen. PCC officials would meet with Grab and Uber to discuss interim measures which both PCC and the companies would have to agree on.  “The interim measure is intended so that the review would not be compromised. [Essentially, it means] that the situation that was prevailing before the consummation of the transaction would continue to prevail,” he said. It is still unclear if the upcoming monopoly would agree on PCC’s terms. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/283629/grab-to-obey-pcc-order-for-p5-m-refund-to-customers","title":"Grab to obey PCC order for P5-M refund to customers","date":"03:55 PM November 18, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing company Grab Philippines will comply with the order of the Philippines Competition Commission (PCC) for a P5-million refund to its riders.

Grab added it will “work closely with the PCC in implementing the agreed mechanics for the payment, which will be communicated to the public at least five (5) days before paying.”  PCC earlier announced its imposition of a P23-million fine to Grab after it cited breach in the ride-hailing firm’s pricing commitments.

In an order issued to the two TNCs, the LTFRB limited the maximum allowable fare price surge to “twice the rates for time covered and distance traveled, excluding the base fare.”  Under this computation, the surge price for a 10-kilometer ride lasting for an hour should cost an Uber passenger only P348. A Grab passenger taking the same route will spend a minimum of P200 (Grab Sedan) to at most P280 (Grab Premium). This is on top of the base fare of TNCs, which will not be affected by surge pricing. Grab’s base fare is P30 while its premium service is at P70. UberX charges a base fare of P40 while UberBlack is at P90.  The LTFRB also directed Grab to lower its fare per km rate from between P12 and P16 to P10-P14, depending on the type of vehicle used. Earlier, several commuters complained to the LTFRB about the unreasonable surge prices being charged by the TNCs—as much as P28,000 for one ride.

In recent days, passengers have complained of Grab’s high fares following the announcement that Uber would be stopping its Philippine operations. ‘Due to lack of drivers’  Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu maintained, however, that his company was not taking advantage of the situation, saying the price surge was due to the lack of drivers. According to Cu, while there has been an increase of up to 70 percent in passenger bookings, the number of drivers in Grab’s system rose only by around 30 percent.  Cu also pointed out that Uber’s fare was lower compared to Grab’s because Uber’s approved per kilometer rate was P5 while theirs was P11. In fact, had Uber’s pending fare hike petition been approved, it would be charging P12 per kilometer, making the two TNCs’ fare rates almost the same, he added. Three other TNCs are seeking accreditation from the LTFRB: Lag Go, Hype and Owto. LTFRB, PCC at odds Meanwhile, the LTFRB has ordered Uber to stop operations in the country by April 16, a directive that contradicted that of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).  “In the interest of all TNVS and the riding public, we are giving you until April 15 to exist as a TNC. On April 16, you will cease and desist to exist as a TNC,” Lizada said in the board meeting. The LTFRB order came just days after the PCC directed Uber and Grab to continue operating separately in the country pending its motu propio review of the deal which resulted in Uber’s exit from Southeast Asia and gave it a 27.5-percent stake in Grab’s operations in the region. The PCC had expressed concern that the deal would give Grab a monopoly of the ride-hailing industry in the country. During the hearing, Uber Philippines’ counsel Joseph Omar Castillo told the LTFRB that while they intended to withdraw their pending petitions for a fare hike and reaccreditation as a TNC in preparation for halting their operations in the country, the PCC order prevented them from doing so. Lizada said that while the LTFRB understood Uber’s predicament, prolonging its operations would affect the riding public and thousands of app-based drivers. The PCC review is expected to last for around six months. Just for compliance “The soonest possible time that you will be able to resolve your concerns with PCC, the better,” she told the Uber representative. Earlier, Cu said that in line with their transaction service agreement with Uber, they decided to continue funding the operations of the Uber app until April 15 just to comply with the PCC directive. The app was initially scheduled to go offline starting on April 9. He noted, however, that their action not only defeated the purpose of the PCC order but also placed the riding public in danger since Uber no longer  has any back-end support in the country to address complaints and look after passengers in the event of a road crash."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1210597/follow-government-rules-grab-asks-prospective-tnc","title":"Follow government rules, Grab asks ‘prospective TNC’","date":"05:06 AM January 09, 2020","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — The biggest ride-hailing company in the country has called out “a prospective transport network company (TNC)” for defying the policies and regulations set by the government, saying this could have a “negative cumulative effect” on the whole sector.","body":"MANILA, Philippines — The biggest ride-hailing company in the country has called out “a prospective transport network company (TNC)” for defying the policies and regulations set by the government, saying this could have a “negative cumulative effect” on the whole sector. Although Grab did not name names, it was widely believed to be referring to Angkas which had been at odds with members of the technical working group (TWG) in charge of an ongoing pilot test for motorcycle taxis.  In a statement, Grab categorized the ongoing dispute as “disrupt(ive) (to) the commuting public.” “The ride-hailing sector is at a volatile state at the moment, and any unnecessary trial by publicity and government defiance will only cause anxiety and inconvenience to the public and a negative cumulative effect on the entire ride-hailing sector,” it said. “As TNCs, we are bound by our responsibility to provide safe and convenient mobility solutions to the Filipino commuters, while providing meaningful livelihood opportunities to our driver-partners, all under the guidance and oversight of the government regulators. We enjoin all market players to abide by these rules. Any contention must be expressed to the proper channels, without sacrificing the welfare of the millions of Filipinos counting on us,” Grab said.  Its statement came a day after it expressed interest in reviving its GrabBike services with the government considering making motorcycle taxis legal. The TNC, however, has had its fair share of run-ins with transportation officials. In July 2018, it was slapped a P10-million fine for unilaterally charging a P2 travel fee. Last year, the Philippine Competition Commission fined Grab P39.6 million for overcharging and frequent booking cancellations.  While Grab is the dominant car-hailing service in the country despite eight other competitors, its closest rival in the past year has been Angkas, believed to corner over 300,000 bookings a day. Unlike cars, motorcycles offer a faster commute despite heavy traffic. Angkas, on the other hand, now appears to be willing to extend an olive branch to state transport regulators after a threat that it might be blacklisted for violating some pilot test guidelines. But while it promised to continue working with the government in the second and final leg of the pilot test, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca said they would not let up on their call for the TWG to drop the 10,000 cap on motorcycle drivers. “I would like to emphasize that our fight is with a particular provision and not with government bodies.

Marcos filed on Wednesday Senate Resolution No. 283 urging the appropriate Senate panel to conduct an inquiry into the alleged “abuse and poor service of Grab PH and its effective monopoly of ride hailing services.”  “Various reports state that Grab prices (are) increasing to exorbitant amounts during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, with commuters experiencing more than double their usual fare,” the resolution read. “In addition to the high fares during the recent pre-Christmas holiday rush, Grab commuters also experience difficulties in booking a ride, with reports of booking times reaching about an hour, if they get a booking at all,” it added.  Under the mandate of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) as defined by the Philippine Competition Act, Grab’s acquisition of Uber in the Philippines was subjected to “quality and pricing standards in clearing the transaction which were part of the voluntary commitments signed by Grab to address the competition concerns raised by the antitrust authority,” Marcos noted in her resolution. “Commuters using Grab services have consistently complained that fares are becoming more expensive now, after Uber sold its business to Grab, leaving them with no other ride-hailing company to choose from,” she added.  The PCC recently imposed a P16.15-million fine on Grab Philippines for overpricing and cancellation of users’ rides.

Grab was monitored by the PCC for one year starting August 2018 and found that it had overcharged riders and its drivers canceled too many bookings from May to August this year.  The commission slapped fines on the company amounting to more than P39 million, largely for overcharging. It ordered that P19 million be refunded to customers, including the P14.15 million May-August 2019 overcharges. Because it had no real competitor, the PCC recently revised the conditions imposed on Grab to include a “disgorgement mechanism,” a process in which ill-gotten money is paid back or returned.  It said the P14.15 million must be paid back to Grab’s customers within 60 days and the P2 million to the agency within 45 days. Grab said it would comply but called the money to be returned to its riders a mere “disbursement.”  “As the new monitoring year begins with the new systemwide average monitoring scheme, Grab is hopeful in fulfilling its commitments to the PCC,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It, however, added that “pricing will still be influenced by factors such as lack of supply, and the traffic situation.” The PCC tapped London-based audit firm Smith & Williamson to look into Grab’s operations for a year after it acquired Uber, then its only competitor in the ride-hailing business. When the disgorgement mechanism was announced last month, Grab insisted that it did not overcharge and only followed the fare matrix set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). “You can be legalistic about it, but the point is you committed [to keep rates low]. In any case, the longer-term solution to this is really to have an effective competitor to Grab,” PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in an interview earlier this month.  “[It has to be] another player, just like Uber, who has deep pockets, because from our analysis, none of these small players will be able to compete effectively with that kind of resources Grab [has],” Balisacan said. The PCC orders came as the price of booking a Grab ride in the middle of the day””not to mention during rush hours””this holiday season had skyrocketed. Noting complaints of exorbitant rates, a party list representative urged Grab to “moderate your greed” while a senator called for an investigation of its alleged poor services. In her resolution calling for the probe, Sen. Imee Marcos said that aside from the high rates, commuters also complained about difficulties in booking a ride from Grab. Grab explained that there were 3 million booking requests every day, based on data from last week. It said it could only serve 400,000 riders per day, with about 36,000 drivers on the road. Marcos said Grab was supposed to cap its fare increases this month at 22.5 percent of its average rate. The PCC had set a monthly fare cap for Grab based on its monthly fares before the company acquired Uber in March 2019. The agency said the cap rate was confidential but included a certain range within which Grab could still raise its fares. For most of the year, including this December, the range was up to 22.5 percent. Any excess was to be refunded to Grab customers. The LTFRB has summoned Grab over complaints of “unreasonable price surges” from passengers since the start of the holiday season.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); LTFRB Chair Martin Delgra said he would look into alleged price-gouging, reminding transport operators to adhere to the approved fare matrix and a cap on surge rates. Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Rep. Jericho “Koko” Nograles on Wednesday said the LTFRB should ensure that Grab would solely shoulder any fines imposed on it, and not pass them on to customers. He expressed concern over the “excessive”commissions that Grab has been getting from its drivers. “Even just until the end of December, please moderate your greed. Leave some for your drivers,” he said. He said the charges that Grab had supposedly been imposing were taking a toll on its drivers, which was aggravated by the heavy holiday traffic. Nograles urged Grab to give discounts to its loyal riders and drivers during the Christmas season by lowering its surge prices. “Have mercy on the riding public who are left without a choice but use your ride-hailing services,” he said. —With reports from Leila B.

In a text message to reporters, IAS chief Attorney Alfegar Triambulo disclosed that Norial, accompanied by her sister Aubrey Norial and boyfriend Mirza Miguel Shahzad, was willing to submit evidence against Police Captain Ronald Saquilayan in a clarificatory questioning for the incident. “Mag-submit siya [Norial] bukas ng statements at evidence like CCTV footage and affidavit of witnesses. Within this week ma place na ang case ni Capt. Saquilayan and others under summary dismissal proceedings,” Triambulo said.  (She will submit statements and evidence tomorrow. Within this week, a case against Captain Saquilayan and others will be placed under summary dismissal proceedings.) Triambulo noted that cases of “grave misconduct, and serious irregularities and conduct unbecoming of a police officer” could be filed against Saquilayan, the chief investigator of Pateros police.  Shahzad disclosed that after seven days of detention, Norial is “recovering” and willing to file the complaints. “She [Norial] is recovering naman po medyo may takot din pero linalakasan po loob [niya],” he said in a separate message responding to reports of filing complaints against Saquilayan.

When consulted about the filing of cases against Saquilayan, Shahzad said they were still waiting for their lawyer’s advice.  He also confirmed that he accompanied Norial to Camp Crame for the clarificatory questioning by the IAS pre-charge investigator. On Oct. 7, Norial picked up her passenger from a coffee shop in Barangay Ususan, Taguig when she was being blocked by the car of Saquilayan, who was parking his car while waiting for his daughter who was buying food at the establishment. Norial needed to leave the driveway to go to her next destination, so she approached Saquilayan to ask him to leave the driveway but to no avail. At one point, Norial said the police officer hit her with his car door. Saquilayan, meanwhile, said it was Norial who assaulted him. Saquilayan arrested Norial on the spot and called for other police officers to bring the Grab driver to a nearby police station. Saquilayan filed alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority case against Norial. After almost a week, Norial was released for posting P3,000 bail after the Taguig Prosecutor’s Office decided to charge Norial with unjust vexation. The prosecutor said it did not find probable cause to charge Norial with alarm and scandal, direct assault, and disobedience of a person in authority.

Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo raised the question of market competition at the hearing of the House Metro Manila development panel regarding the pilot program of the Department of Transportation on motorcycles-for-hire.  “Do you consider the effect of your policies on Grab? Is that part of your determination?” she asked Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) board member Antonio Gardiola Jr., head of the technical working group on motorcycle taxis. Gardiola replied in the negative, saying the LTFRB had no comparative analysis with transport network companies like Grab. Quimbo, an economics professor at the University of the Philippines, advised him to take competition into account.  “I was concerned because it would appear that Grab would continue to be a monopoly. I hope you will closely study its effect on Grab,” she said. “If you remove its competition, there will be no more competitive constraints.” This might mean Grab’s policies, including its surge pricing during rush hour, would be “more unrestrained,” Quimbo said. At present, Angkas, JoyRide and MoveIt are on a three-month trial period to determine their viability and safety to continue operating. The three motorcycle taxi companies share a cap of 63,000 drivers who may ply the streets during the trial run, outside of which they are still considered illegal.  Several bills authorizing motorcycle taxis as a public utility vehicle are pending approval in the House. Quimbo also quizzed Gardiola on why the LTFRB decided to divide the 63,000 cap equally among Angkas, JoyRide and MoveIt. She said “dividing the market” was actually a violation of the Philippine Competition Act."},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1204827/smash-and-grab-crime-gangs-prey-on-hong-kong-protests","title":"Smash and grab: Crime gangs prey on Hong Kong protests","date":"02:07 PM December 23, 2019","snippet":"HONG KONG — The Hong Kong seller of luxury watches looked on in horror as masked men wielding the biggest sledgehammer he’d ever seen smashed through the door of a neighboring watch store, held a machete to the owner’s throat, scooped up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of timepieces, and then scattered into the city’s maze of streets.","body":"HONG KONG — The Hong Kong seller of luxury watches looked on in horror as masked men wielding the biggest sledgehammer he’d ever seen smashed through the door of a neighboring watch store, held a machete to the owner’s throat, scooped up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of timepieces, and then scattered into the city’s maze of streets. Less than two weeks later, armed robbers attacked again. This time, the watch merchants of Kowloon fought back.  Among them was the watch seller who had witnessed the previous robbery. He says he grabbed an iron pipe he had handy for just such a confrontation and sprinted out to join the battle against the robbers who were smashing the front of Past & Future Times with hammers, trying to get to the store’s high-end watches, while other gangsters brandishing machetes formed a menacing shield around them. “I heard ‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’ People shouting,” said the merchant, who asked that he be identified only by his surname, Pan, because he feared for his safety. So much so that he now keeps a large meat cleaver in the drawer of his front desk and has protected his store with a new double door and toughened glass.  The robbers came at the merchants with their knives and then, seemingly scared off, ran away, he said. “All the shops came out to help. We’re very united now,” Pan said.  They have to be. Hong Kong’s 30,000-strong police force has been so stretched by a half year of anti-government protests that it is struggling to keep the peace. Armed robbers and burglars are seemingly exploiting policing vacuums caused, in part, by the redeployment of officers to riot-control duties. Police said the proud reputation of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory of 7.5 million people as an Asian haven of tranquility, with crime rates lower than other cities its size, is being eroded. “We used to be a very safe city, six months ago, but somehow we face a lot of challenges,” said Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen, a spokesman for the police force. Still, Hong Kong remains a city where visitors don’t need to think twice about venturing out at night. It had six times fewer homicides last year than New York, seven times fewer burglaries and 88 times fewer robberies. But the mass demonstrations that erupted in June over proposed extradition legislation and then mushroomed into a sustained anti-government movement pushing for full democracy and other demands have burned through police manpower. Officers have been diverted from crime prevention as police fought street battles with hard-core protesters — black-clad youths who have hurled gasoline bombs and destroyed property. Prison officers and customs and immigration agents have been drafted to bolster police ranks. The police overtime bill has soared, approaching 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($128 million).  May Chan said police patrols that used to walk the beat, morning and afternoon, past the Times watch store in Kowloon, where she sells timepieces for tens of thousands of dollars, stopped abruptly in August, after the protest movement picked up steam and radicalized. It was also around that time that a man brandishing a knife burst into her store, cowing Chan’s colleague into submission before making off with about $130,000 in watches, she says. “It’s the protests,” Chan said. “It has become dangerous. The police no longer come out. They don’t have enough people.” The latest police figures appear to bear out the suspicions of store owners in Kowloon — where riot squads and demonstrators have repeatedly clashed on canyon-like streets of high rises — that Hong Kong is experiencing a protest-related crime wave. In the first half of the year, police recorded just 44 robberies — or about one every four days. But the number soared to 126, closer to one robbery per day, from July to November as the protests and related violence increasingly stretched the force. When compared to the same period of 2018, robberies increased by 147%. Burglaries also increased in the past five protest-gripped months, to 1,270, or eight per day, double the number for the same period of 2018. Some protesters suspect police are turning a blind eye to robberies to reinforce Hong Kong government arguments that protests are damaging the city. That charge is denied by Kwok, the police spokesman. But trust in the force among supporters of the protest movement has largely evaporated in the clashes, in which police have used 26,000 tear gas and rubber-bullet rounds and made more than 6,100 arrests. On a recent peaceful day with no mass protests, timepiece seller Jan Leung said she does not understand why she’s still seeing no police patrols on her Kowloon street even after two nearby robberies, including the Po Tat watch store earlier this month. Video posted online showed a masked robber stuffing a bag with the loot while another stood guard with a machete. “It’s so peaceful now. There is nothing happening. But there is still no police,” Leung said. “Saying the police are busy at protests … it’s [just] excuses.” Police said officers are patrolling instead in vehicles and that foot patrols have been scaled back in part to protect them from violent protesters. Police also said that because protesters deliberately seek to avoid riot squads by popping up out of the blue, and because demonstrations have been so widespread, the force has had to set aside reserves of manpower to quickly respond to any unexpected violence, further directing resources away from day-to-day crime.] Pan, the watch seller, said police patrols are resuming again in his repeatedly robbed area of Kowloon, but in larger squads of around a half dozen officers because they fear being “hit with a petrol bomb or a brick.” And if robbers do come back, the watch merchants are ready. They’re hiring private security and have set up an alarm system so they can alert each other if attacked, he said. “We’re all armed with weapons,” he said. “I never believed it would happen in Hong Kong.”"},{"url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1041664/solon-quells-power-grab-hints-arroyo-wants-vp-back-in-succession-line-too","title":"Solon quells ‘power grab’ hints: Arroyo wants VP back in succession line, too","date":"02:04 PM October 11, 2018","snippet":"House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo also wants to “correct” the line of succession under the lower chamber’s draft federal Charter, a lawmaker said Thursday, dismissing any insinuations of an alleged “power grab” attempts by the House leadership.","body":"House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo also wants to “correct” the line of succession under the lower chamber’s draft federal Charter, a lawmaker said Thursday, dismissing any insinuations of an alleged “power grab” attempts by the House leadership.

The Duterte administration welcomes all well-meaning businessmen,” Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade told investors during a gathering in Davao City last Friday.  He made the statement as Uber and Grab drivers appealed to Mr. Duterte to intervene and order the lifting of a yearlong moratorium on the issuance of franchises for app-based transport services. Tugade said the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has asked transport network companies (TNCs) to submit the necessary papers so their accredited transport network vehicle service (TNVS) drivers could operate legally.  At the same time, he wondered why it was taking the drivers such a long time to submit the requirements such as their financial statements and income tax returns. Tugade assured TNCs that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) would process their drivers’ documents as quickly as possible.  “If things can be worked out, if things can be logical, if things can be done on a win-win basis, then let’s shake hands and do business,” he said. The LTFRB earlier announced it would start apprehending TNC drivers without a valid franchise starting on July 26. Last week, however, it agreed to put off the crackdown after Grab and Uber filed separate motions for reconsideration. The LTFRB also said it would fast-track the processing and release of around 11,000 pending franchise applications. According to the transport board, both TNCs have a combined total of 42,000 accredited drivers. Of the figure, however, only 3,700 have been authorized by the LTFRB to operate, making the rest “colorum” vehicles.  Tugade said that the transport department, through the LTFRB, was holding consultations with both Grab and Uber “to clarify some issues on the mess they have created.” “What we are doing right now is putting some sense of reason and sanity [in] the business model Grab and Uber are trying to introduce,” he added, saying the TNCs should “do business on a platform of compliance to level the playing field.” Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez agreed with Tugade that all modes of public transport should operate on equal footing by securing all requirements set by the government. “But we should not prevent them from coming in. As long as the market, the consumer and riding public need these extra services, we should not prevent an entrepreneur from offering something that there’s a demand for in the market,” he said. “It’s really about services and availability.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) officials slapped the company with a P6.5-million fine, citing inconsistencies in Grab’s data about its pricing.  PCC Chair Arsenio Balisacan alleged Grab submitted “deficient, inconsistent and incorrect data for the monitoring of its compliance with its voluntary commitments.” Also on Friday, Grab said it would file a motion for reconsideration.  Grab’s takeover of the regional operations of its rival Uber in March last year made its business a virtual monopoly in the Philippines. While this gave the company a stronger market power, many riders complained such advantage did not necessarily translate to better services as higher fares preyed on the traffic-weary public.  The PCC had flagged the deal and launched a review even as the deal pushed through. Months later, the antitrust body set this review aside after Grab agreed to “voluntary commitments,” whereby the company would be monitored by an independent trustee. Balisacan said these commitments were made to address concerns on the company’s pricing behavior and maintain service quality “in the absence of a significant competitive pressure in the market.” “However, the commission cannot effectively enforce these commitments without the submission of correct, sufficient, consistent and timely data by Grab,” he said. The PCC did not say how this would affect further actions in the future. “We do not want to presume that this is going to be a continuing trend towards violating their undertaking,” PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said.  Then PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo had said the government could cancel the Grab-Uber deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments. In a separate statement, Grab Philippines president Brian Cu said the company wanted to know why the fine reached P6.5 million. He said the PCC required Grab to submit data that covered the period after the transaction was made in March. Given the nature and huge volume of data required, he said the company worked “under very limited timelines to meet PCC’s deadline.” “During the voluntary commitment negotiations, Grab recommended various ways to present the requested data based on how the system can best provide them. Given enough time, we can reconcile our data structure with theirs,” he said. “Three out of four penalties were set at a maximum amount of P2 million pesos each. Given the breakdown of the fines vis-a-vis the severity of the lapses alleged by the PCC, we would like to better understand PCC’s rationale for imposing a maximum penalty,” he added."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/278521/grab-investing-150-million-in-ai-to-build-regional-super-app","title":"Grab investing $150 million in AI to build regional super app","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing start-up Grab Holdings intends to invest US$150 million into artificial intelligence (AI) research over the next year, accelerating its expanding business that now includes food delivery, digital payments and digital content.","body":"SINGAPORE — Southeast Asian ride-hailing start-up Grab Holdings intends to invest US$150 million into artificial intelligence (AI) research over the next year, accelerating its expanding business that now includes food delivery, digital payments and digital content. Grab, in hot competition with rival Gojek to become Southeast Asia’s do-it-all super app, outlined for the first time a blueprint for its use and deployment of AI.  It will build on the US$100 million it had previously invested in the technology, said co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, and improve its fraud prevention and natural language processing (NLP) technology. “We want to go from AI-powered to AI everywhere,” Ms Tan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the Sooner Than You Think tech conference in Singapore.  She sees successful technology companies building “great platforms that are very localised to the problem they are trying to solve”. So Grab is working with Microsoft on delivering better NLP and making the region’s leader in ride hailing, food delivery and digital payments even more tailored and accessible to users in the various markets.  Technology companies like Grab are preparing as blazing-fast fifth-generation networks spread, powering complex AI applications and catalysing the emergence of futuristic technologies like self-driven cars. But Grab, according to Ms Tan, is focused on its customers and their immediate needs. “We won’t just build AI for the sake of AI,” she said. Grab, which is raising more than US$4.5 billion in its latest funding round from heavy hitters, including SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund and Tencent Holdings, is hiring thousands of people and setting up research centres from Beijing to Seattle. At the heart of its global effort is an ambition to create an all-in-one “super app” akin to Tencent’s WeChat for China. The company’s GrabPay service already allows consumers to pick up the tab for rides and order food, and it is expanding into lending and insurance.  Last year, it debuted a financial technology platform and launched Grab Ventures to fund promising start-ups. The company is also said to be considering applying for a digital banking licence if Singapore allows it. Ms Tan concluded by saying that Grab, which is valued at about US$14 billion, according to CB Insights, is “very much on track” to match or even slightly exceed forecasts of US$2 billion in revenue for the year."},{"url":"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/152735/duterte-trump-grab-puso","title":"Duterte to Trump: ‘Grab them by the puso’","date":"11:31 PM February 20, 2017","snippet":"","body":" Click Here for article  "},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/214568/citi-grab-roll-out-cashless-transport-solution","title":"Citi, Grab team up on cashless payment","date":"11:42 AM September 06, 2016","snippet":"GLOBAL banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing commuters to use their credit card points as currency.","body":"GLOBAL banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing commuters to use their credit card points as currency. The partnership – a first for Asia – will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab, said in a joint press statement with Citi. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as away for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region enabling credit card holders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions — in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depends on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam – markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes. Grab is also testing new services such as social carpooling, as well as last mile and food deliveries."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249435/grab-philippines-extra-travel-charges-jericho-nograles-ltfrb","title":"Solon says Grab ‘defrauded’ customers by not announcing extra charge","date":"05:30 PM April 18, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines “defrauded” its passengers by implementing a P2-per-minute extra travel charge without informing its customers, according Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA) party-list Rep.

Jericho Nograles. Nograles made the statement on Wednesday after Brian Cu, Grab Philippines country head, admitted in a press briefing that the transportation network company implemented the travel charge starting in July 2017.  “There was no comms to the riders inside the app,” he said. “In the information card, we’ve updated that. But when we raised the P2 per minute, we did not include that. So ‘di namin nailagay.” But he said there was “nothing illegal” about not disclosing the information.  Still Nograles, in a message to INQUIRER.net, said: “Isn’t that unfair to consumers that they have false, deceptive, and misleading advertising?” According to the lawmaker, the Grab website clearly indicates that they “don’t charge per minute.”  “They only changed that on April 11 to reflect that they charge P2/min,“ he said. “But I have a screen grab. So there’s already evidence that they committed fraud to deceive not just their riders but the government as well.” But in an earlier statement, Grab said the per-minute charges “remain part and parcel to Grab’s fare structure today and we have continuously been transparent about this truth.” It said it provided the basic formula for and computation of the fare, including the per-minute charges, in instances that riders raise questions on their fares. But this justification did not sit well with Nograles. “The LTFRB [Land Transportation and Regulatory Board] has taken cognizance of this issue,” Nograles said. “That means that their liability and punishment is being determined and pending before the Board.”  Grab defended the additional charge as a way to “ensure that… hard-working TNVS [transportation network vehicle service] drivers would have a greater chance of making ends meet and supporting their needs.” But Nograles said Grab should spare drivers from refund obligation. “I am appealing to Grab and the LTFRB to impose a refund of the estimated P3.2B in illegally collected fares. Since the drivers are unaware of this malicious act, Grab should charge this refund from their own pocket. Grab management ang mastermind niyan eh at wala namang alam diyan ang mga drivers,” the lawmaker said. After Tuesday’s hearing on the petition filed by Nograles before the LTFRB, Chairman Martin Delgra III told reporters that in one meeting of his agency’s technical working group last year, there were “discussions” about Grab’s plan to collect a P2-per-minute travel charge. But he said Grab did not inform the LTFRB when it was implemented. Pressed if that meant that Grab had been illegally charging passengers, Delgra said: “We have not decided on that yet.” /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/287034/jack-ma-grab-eye-opportunities-in-singapore-digital-bank-battle","title":"Jack Ma, Grab eye opportunities in Singapore digital bank battle","date":"06:19 PM January 13, 2020","snippet":"Singapore is opening up its banking industry to digital lenders in a reform that could shake up the sector across Southeast Asia, with Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and ride-hailer Grab among those seeking licenses.","body":"Singapore is opening up its banking industry to digital lenders in a reform that could shake up the sector across Southeast Asia, with Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and ride-hailer Grab among those seeking licenses. Traditional banks are being challenged by a new generation of online-only competitors that can offer better savings and borrowing rates, as they don’t need to spend money on overheads such as physical branches.  The introduction of digital lenders into the Singaporean market heralds the biggest liberalization of the financial hub’s banking sector for two decades, and follows similar moves in the United States, Britain, Japan and Hong Kong, among others. With most adults in the city already having access to financial services, firms awarded licenses are likely to use the city-state as a gateway to the wider region, where many consumers still lack bank accounts.  “It’s a total reconfiguration of the terrain — we’re talking about radical changes,” Lawrence Loh, a professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, told AFP. “Singapore is the launchpad for Southeast Asia.” An eclectic group of 21 applicants are vying for five digital banking licenses, Singapore’s central bank and financial regulator said this month.  They range from Alibaba founder Ma’s online platform Ant Financial, as it ramps up efforts to expand outside China, to a consortium that includes Southeast Asian ride-hailing behemoth Grab and the region’s biggest telecom player, Singtel. Other bidders are Asia’s biggest massage chair maker, V3 Group, and an alliance featuring computer gaming firm Razer and a supermarket chain operator. ‘Challenging old models’ Two of the licenses will be for full banking operations, allowing holders to take deposits from consumers, while three will be for “wholesale” banking — which limits a lender to mostly dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises. The winners will be announced in June, with operations starting in 2021, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.  Observers say the overhaul is unlikely to spark immediate, dramatic changes in Singapore itself — where traditional banks such as DBS and UOB have already introduced digital services. But the future impact could be massive if the new online lenders expand across a region of more than 600 million people, which is home to booming economies and where many are getting access to the internet for the first time via smartphones. The opportunities appear huge — nearly a third of people in Southeast Asia still do not have bank accounts, according to a report by Google, Singapore investment firm Temasek and business consultancy Bain & Company. Another 98 million individuals own bank accounts but have insufficient access to financial services, while millions of small and medium-size businesses are in need of funding, the report said. And it projected digital lending in the region would rise five-fold to $110 billion (around P5.5 trillion) by 2025. The rollout worldwide of ultra-fast, 5G smartphone infrastructure over the next five years is also expected to accelerate the digital transformation, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. “This is fundamentally challenging the old business model of retail banks, particularly in competing for the business of younger generations,” he told AFP. There could be difficulties in expanding across a region where some governments have traditionally sought to shield domestic banks from foreign rivals. But analysts say regulators have gradually been removing barriers to competition, while Loh from NUS saw a bright future for digital lending, saying: “People are very quick to adapt.” “E-commerce, online supermarkets, food delivery — they are all done online.” IB/JB(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); RELATED STORIES: Internet magic: A look back at Jack Ma at Alibaba 5 things you could do better with an all-digital bank High spirits at Singapore’s school for gin Harrods to head to China in 2020, with first stand-alone outside the UK"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/212314/processing-uber-grab-applications-stopped","title":"Processing of Uber, Grab applications stopped","date":"01:00 AM July 23, 2016","snippet":"Uber and Grab went on the defensive Friday, saying their operations helped ease road congestion as the Department of Transportation ordered a review of existing regulations and placed on hold thousands of new applications in Metro Manila.","body":"Uber and Grab went on the defensive Friday, saying their operations helped ease road congestion as the Department of Transportation ordered a review of existing regulations and placed on hold thousands of new applications in Metro Manila. The government’s review of policies for the Transportation Network Vehicle Service (TNVS), which covered this sector, was due to the “sheer volume of applicants” and ridesharing fare-setting schemes that remained unregulated, DOTr spokesperson Cherie Mercado said.  Both US-based Uber, which has a wide global footprint, and Malaysia’s Grab, the biggest ridesharing company in the region, insisted that they provided a crucial service and that      their presence did not worsen Metro Manila’s traffic-strangled roads. “TNVs do not add to the congestion on the roads in Manila. In fact, we offer the solution by providing vehicles the technology that utilize GPS data to work around traffic and road hazards,” Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu said in a statement.  “At the moment, there is still more demand for our services than supply and the capping of applications will only take away an alternative for individuals who want to earn extra or those who want to improve their livelihoods,” Cu added. Uber Philippines issued a similar statement, citing its carpool service to lessen vehicles on the road.  “This decision also impedes our goal to get more people into fewer cars. Fewer drivers on Uber leads to lower reliability of service for riders in Metro Manila, who have come to rely on Uber as a viable alternative to buying and driving their own private vehicles,” Uber said. According to the DOTr, the review would affect about 29,000 pending applications as of July 15 this year. Of these, 23,000 applications alone are for Uber. Grab had 5,727 applications while UHOP had 131. The review was formalized via a memorandum from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) dated July 21, 2016. In line with this, it ordered the “suspension of the acceptance of all TNVS applications proposing to ply on the route within Metro Manila or entering Metro Manila.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/267319/pcc-no-findings-yet-on-grab-pricing-issue","title":"PCC: No findings yet on Grab pricing issue","date":"05:06 AM March 25, 2019","snippet":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) could still not make any conclusive findings on whether Grab had significantly lowered its prices a year after it bought Uber, as the antitrust body was not even sure if Grab’s data were reliable.","body":"The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) could still not make any conclusive findings on whether Grab had significantly lowered its prices a year after it bought Uber, as the antitrust body was not even sure if Grab’s data were reliable. In August last year, the PCC put Grab Philippines under monitoring following its acquisition of Uber, its biggest competitor in the local market.  Done by an independent trustee, the monitoring is meant to cover a period of one year, during which Grab’s performance will be measured against its operations before the buyout deal in March last year. Through this, the PCC was hoping to see how far Grab had gone in restoring competition in the market, which should be similar to when Uber was still operating in the country.  For now, PCC Commissioner Johannes Bernabe said they were focusing on Grab’s fares, given how important the issue of pricing was to consumers. The problem, however, is that half a year worth of data from the monitoring report could not lead to any conclusive findings, he said. This is mainly because of questions surrounding the reliability of the data submitted by Grab.  “The data were supposed to be in their [Grab’s] system. So we’re dependent on that,” Bernabe told the Inquirer in a chance interview last week. “To the extent that it is generated by the system, it should be reliable. If it’s not within the system and it was generated some other way, then we have to determine whether that’s a credible way of preparing that data,” he added. This is not the first time that PCC has flagged Grab’s data. Last January, PCC fined Grab with P6.5 million for submitting “deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring.” He said PCC was still trying to understand certain issues about the data that Grab gave the independent trustee, such as how Grab came up with its pricing figures before and after the buyout deal. “So unless we are certain that the methodology is the same, we can’t make any conclusive findings at this point. The same problem [still exists] in the second quarter,” he said.  A PCC representative clarified that its monitoring report in the first quarter covered the period Aug. 10 to Nov. 10, 2018. The second quarter report, meanwhile, covered Nov. 11, 2018  to Feb. 10, 2019. In response to charges that it submitted “deficient, inconsistent, and incorrect data for the monitoring,” Grab said in a statement in January that  it had “very limited time” to work on the data. Grab also questioned the fine slapped on it by the PCC then. “Is that a sufficient response? They made the voluntary commitments,” Bernabe said, noting the conditions that Grab had committed to comply with in exchange for PCC’s clearance of the buyout deal. After being fined last January, Bernabe said Grab had “attempted to make corrections.” It’s not clear at this point why those corrections are not enough. After seeing the monitoring reports, Bernabe said they sought clarifications from the company’s trustees on certain issues. He, however, did not give details on the said issues. When asked if this was the fault of international firm Smith & Williamson, the independent trustee that had also handled high-profile cases overseas, he said “it’s not the trustee, because the trustee is only going to work with the data that it gets its hands on.”"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249694/grab-punishes-almost-500-drivers-unjustified-booking-cancellations","title":"Grab punishes almost 500 drivers over unjustified booking cancellations","date":"11:57 AM April 23, 2018","snippet":"","body":" Grab Philippines has meted sanctions on nearly 500 drivers last week following an internal investigation over mounting complaints against drivers who inexcusably cancel passengers’ ride bookings.

The National Privacy Commission (NPC) had also suspended the selfie verification program of Grab for the same reason.  These three initiatives, the NPC said, “may endanger the privacy rights of the riding public.” The issue marked another point of conflict with regulators, as Grab Philippines remains the biggest player in the local ride hailing market after buying out Uber, its main competitor, in 2018.  The Uber buyout triggered competition concerns that were not always addressed. In this case, personal data collected by Grab was supposed to help authorities piece together information in cases of conflict which would allow Grab to give police the entire picture if requested.  The video recording system, for example, will give Grab employees in the Grab Office a front row seat to what is happening inside a vehicle in cases of the driver pushing the emergency button. The NPC said despite good intentions, the efforts failed to strike a balance between security and privacy. The commission added that Grab had not given much thought to the risks passengers are being exposed to and “only the risks faced by the company were taken into account.” The NPC said while it “believes that the security of passengers and drivers is a primordial concern, their privacy rights must not be disregarded.” The commission sent a cease and desist order to Grab last Tuesday (Feb. 4) a few days after the NPC flagged Grab’s deficiencies in a notice issued on Jan. 31.  The Jan. 31 notice came long after Grab had already started its pilot test of the new security features, which began on Jan. 13 for 180 Grab vehicles in Metro Manila. The pilot test ran for two to six weeks with half of the number of cars being equipped with cameras while others equipped with audio recording equipment. At the launch of the pilot test, Grab said the new measures were another “layer of security” for drivers and passengers. Similar programs were launched in other countries, such as Grab in Jakarta and Uber in the United States. Grab had said it was complying with the Data Privacy Act but the NPC said the company failed to cite a legal basis for collecting passenger data. The NPC also said Grab was unable to establish if benefits outweighed risks and if the new security layer was the only way to achieve its objective. Grab had tried to downplay privacy concerns by saying that riders always had the choice to opt out without penalty after being informed in advance of the recording equipment. If the passenger consented, Grab said audio and video recordings would be encrypted and stored in Grab’s database for seven days for audio and 10 hours for video. The NPC, however, said details about how passengers could opt out were “not sufficiently communicated.” The agency added it was not clear how data processing would be done if consent had been withdrawn. The NPC gave the company 15 days from Jan. 31, or until the first half of February, to comply with proposed remedial measures. The measures were not specified.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The cease and desist order would remain in effect on a case-to-case basis for each of Grab’s data privacy programs until Grab had addressed the deficiencies cited by the NPC. The NPC clarified that the order was not a penalty, but an opportunity for Grab to fully comply with the law. The NPC stopped short of saying whether it would bar Grab from using the recording systems subject of the order. “The move, in effect, secures the riding public from unwanted privacy exposure,” said the NPC. It also gave Grab a chance to “modify its system to be complaint with the DPA,” the NPC added, referring to the Data Privacy Act.

Unlike before, a driver can now drive for any of the existing accredited TNCs since the provisional authority or franchise to operate given to them is generic and does not bare the name of any of the TNCs.  However, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said that the drivers would still need to have themselves accredited by the TNC of their choice for accountability. To date, four more TNCs are awaiting to be accredited by the LTFRB. These are Hirna, Go Lag, Micab and Owto.  Delgra said that the LTFRB would accredit the other applicants once they had complied with the requirements. For one, he said that these TNCs must show proof that they could accept responsibility and respond to passenger complaints. Hype’s entry comes at a time when Grab continues to be criticized for its high fare and its picky drivers. Brian Cu, country head of Grab Philippines, assured the public on Wednesday that, apart from the passenger complaints mechanisms already in place, his company’s system could also detect and determine if a driver was deliberately forcing a rider to cancel a requested trip. Cu said that once verified that a driver forced a passenger to cancel a booking that driver would be called to the Grab office for investigation. The drive could then be suspended or even removed from the platform. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/249014/grab-extra-charge-two-pesos-perm-minute","title":"Grab denies illegally charging riders an extra P2 per minute","date":"08:00 PM April 11, 2018","snippet":"Grab Philippines denied on Wednesday that it had been illegally charging riders an additional P2 per minute of travel time, noting that the Land Transportation and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was aware of its pricing structure.","body":"Grab Philippines denied on Wednesday that it had been illegally charging riders an additional P2 per minute of travel time, noting that the Land Transportation and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was aware of its pricing structure. In a statement, the firm’s public affairs head and official spokesperson, Leo Gonzales, denied the allegation of PBA Rep. Jericho Nograles that the LTFRB was not aware of this additional charge.  “Department Order 2015-011 allowed TNCs [transportation network companies] to set its own fares with the oversight of the LTFRB,” Gonzales said. “In June 2017, Grab, upon review of its pricing structure, initiated per minute pricing of 2 pesos. This was integrated to the existing per km charges and is not added to the upfront fares.” “The per-minute charges were implemented to ensure that despite serious congestion issues on the road on a daily basis, hard-working TNVS drivers would have a greater chance of making ends meet and supporting their needs,” Gonzales added. “During this time, we corresponded with the LTFRB to present these changes and was given the opportunity to present in full our business model, supply and demand models and pricing structure during one of the Technical Working Group meetings in late July 2017.”  According to Gonzales, the per-minute charge remains part of Grab’s fare structure to date, and the company has been “continuously transparent about this truth.” “In fact, during times when questions were raised about fares in certain trips, we would always back compute and provide the basic formula for the same, including the per minute charges,” he said.  On Tuesday, Nograles said Grab should refund to its customers some P1.8 billion because based, based on his research, it “illegally” charged customers P2 per minute of travel time. According to him, this charge is on top of Grab’s P40 flagdown rate and P10 to P14 per kilometer charge. “The LTFRB should impose a refund. Otherwise, they are liable for graft,” Nograles said in an interview over CNN Philippines’ morning show “The Source.” “Grab charges P2 per minute illegally. They’re not allowed to charge P2 per minute. The LTFRB has not allowed them to charge P2 per minute but they have charged P2 per minute to everyone,” he added. For the past five months alone, he said Grab had already overcharged its customers some P1.8 billion.  Nograles pointed out that, apart from this P2 per minute additional charge, which he claimed was not approved by LTFRB, Grab also “committed acts of deception by putting out online collaterals claiming that unlike regular taxi services, they do no impose extra charges for travel time.” Apart from demanding for a refund, Nograles also questioned Grab’s recent merger and acquisition of Uber Philippines. He noted that this is a clear violation of prevailing anti-trust laws, particularly the provisions of the Philippine Competition Act, as this might lead to a “virtual monopoly.” Earlier, Uber said its service would continue to be accessible only until April 8 following Grab’s acquisition of its Southeast Asia operations. But in compliance with an order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), Grab said it would keep the Uber app running until April 15. /atm"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/284246/grab-slams-critics-claims-of-overcharging","title":"Grab slams critic’s claims of overcharging","date":"05:06 AM November 28, 2019","snippet":"MANILA, Philippines — Ride-hailing giant Grab Philippines pushed back anew against allegations of overcharging made by a leading critic, PBA Rep.

Nograles earlier claimed that Grab should have been fined P15 billion after “(making) a direct admission of 3 million offenses (of overcharging),” referring to the 3 million passengers covered by the P5 million refund as imposed by the Philippine Competition Commission. “Under the Joint Administrative Order 2014-01, each offense merits a fine of P5,000. Therefore, Grab should be liable for P15 billion worth of fines,” Nograles said in a statement.

This was disclosed by the ride-hailing firm on Monday, as it defended its move to implement the travel charge in order to help drivers recoup their expenses and earn better. According to the transport network company (TNC), their driver cancellation rate reached 11 percent last Friday and Saturday, and were predominantly due to the low fares brought about by the suspension of the P2 per minute travel charge.  Grab said the low fares made drivers opt to drive less, and only enabled the company to service half of the demand last weekend. “Drivers have to buy gas, pay the monthly amortization for the vehicle, or the daily boundary, and when traffic stalls them, it is only the P2 per minute that saves their income. So with the P2 gone, many of our drivers earn less and drive less, if at all,” Grab Country Head Brian Cu said in a statement.  “No matter how willing they are to drive, they are left with no choice but to think of ways to recover their expenses. Sadly, most of them have resorted to cancelling bookings especially when they know they will traverse traffic,” he added. Last week, LTFRB issued an order immediately suspending Grab’s P2 per minute travel charge. This came after Grab admitted that there were no communications made through their application to inform the riders of the fare component. READ: Grab PH admits failure to inform riders of P2-per-minute charge / Grab ordered to stop P2/minute of travel charge ASAP Grab obeyed the order and implemented a stop to the P2 per minute travel charge since Friday but has appealed to the LTFRB by filing a motion for reconsideration, explaining that the P2 per minute travel time fare component was legal based on the 2015 order of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). The DOTr order authorizes TNCs to set their own fares but with LTFRB’s oversight.  READ: Grab stops collecting P2 travel charge Cu said the P2 is not a Grab income because 80 percent goes directly to the driver while the 20 percent is spent on driver incentives and rider promos. “Let’s face it: ‘pag lugi ang driver, hindi lalabas ‘yan.

The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) monitored the market before and after Uber ended its Philippine operations in April, following Grab’s regional acquisition of Uber in March.  “Results of the market investigation, as well as comments from the riding public on the effects of the Transaction submitted to the Office, indicate that the quality of services of Grab has decreased post-Transaction in the following manner: (i) increased driver cancellation; (ii) forced cancellation of rides; and (iii) increased waiting times,” the PCC statement of concerns noted. “This is compounded by the loss of a competitor in Uber where trips were less likely to be cancelled due to features which mask the destination of a prospective rider until the start of a trip,” it also stated.  The PCC’s statement of concerns was published on Monday. It is part of PCC’s ongoing review of the Grab-Uber deal, wherein the watchdog could approve, block, or allow the transaction while imposing conditions to address anti-competitive concerns. However, even in the absence of a verdict, the statement of concerns issued by PCC’s Mergers and Acquisitions Office (MAO) hinted that the market has already become problematic after the Grab-Uber deal.  Higher fares after Uber’s exit After Uber left the market last month, Grab imposed higher fares and more frequent surge-pricing “despite an increase in the supply of Grab drivers,” PCC said, noting Grab now has a 93 percent hold of the market after Uber drivers switched apps. The antitrust body based the post-acquisition price increase on more than 27,000 booking requests and 1,100 rides surveyed before and after Uber’s exit on April 16. PCC said the surveys gathered information on the actual prices, service, and booking conditions of Grab and its potential competitors. The deal has “resulted and will likely continue to result in substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market,” PCC said. Moreover, PCC found out that transport network companies (TNCs) such as Grab cater to a captive market, “an overwhelming majority” of whom would still choose to book a ride despite price increases.  Not enough market pressure against Grab Amid pressure to allow more players in the market, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) have so far accredited five TNCs. PCC, however, said that historical data shows that it would require “a significant amount of time and cost” to grow their operations that would be enough to contest Grab. “During such period, Grab will not be constrained by any competitor, allowing it to exercise its market power in the relevant market. Therefore, the [MAO] finds that new entrants in the relevant market are not likely to exert sufficient competitive pressure on Grab,” PCC said. The parties involved have 10 days to comment on the PCC-MAO’s statement of concerns. A representative from PCC said that Grab and Uber received their copies on May 23. Conflict with LTFRB order In April, PCC tried to keep Grab from flexing its muscles in the unchecked market by imposing some interim measures. However, this became more difficult after the LTFRB stepped in. The PCC imposed those interim measures on Grab and Uber prior the release of the statement of concerns to keep the findings of the review accurate. Those interim measures included the resumption of independent and separate operations for the time being. Scheduled to end its services on April 8, Uber, at the time, agreed to extend the availability of its app until April 15, given the ongoing PCC review. Grab-Philippines, on the other hand, had said it shouldered the costs of Uber’s one week extension. However, following the release of PCC’s interim measures, the LTFRB slapped Uber with a cease-and-desist order, requiring the firm to stop its operations on April 15."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/231677/grab-backs-govt-transport-plan-seeks-action-expiring-accreditation","title":"Grab backs gov’t transport plan; seeks action on expiring accreditation","date":"09:38 PM June 19, 2017","snippet":"MANILA — Grab Philippines has thrown its support behind the Philippine government’s plan to modernize the public utility vehicle sector, saying the transport network firm stood ready to extend technological assistance to authorities for the plan.","body":"MANILA — Grab Philippines has thrown its support behind the Philippine government’s plan to modernize the public utility vehicle sector, saying the transport network firm stood ready to extend technological assistance to authorities for the plan. At the same time, the local unit of the firm that originated in Malaysia and is headquartered in Singapore, has asked the government to act on the renewal or extension of its operating license which expires in two weeks.  In a press statement on Monday, Grab Philippines country head Brian Cu asked the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to act on Grab’s renewal of accreditation, which would be due on July 3. Cu said the company has already submitted all its requirements to the LTFRB, and it has been hoping for a schedule of its hearing soon.  The company expressed full support for the PUV modernization program which was launched Monday afternoon by the Department of Transportation and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. Cu lauded the government’s decision to implement a comprehensive modernization plan within the first year of the Duterte administration, explaining that it would “clearly benefit the riding public, drivers and even the environment” and would “align with the entry of more modern, technology-based transportation solutions.”  “Grab Philippines strongly supports the Transportation Department in its efforts for PUV modernization,” he said, adding that the firm would actively participate in the DOTr’s efforts in improving the country’s transport system. “It’s the first step towards a real multi-modal transport system through the synergy of national government and LGUs,” Cu said. “This can only be achieved through the use of technology such as Grab’s.” Cu noted that the PUV modernization program, if executed effectively, would make public transport safer and more convenient for the commuters, and more cost-effective for operators and drivers. “Grab has always been about providing safety, convenience and reliability to its commuters, and we are one with the DOTr in this principle,” Cu said. He added that Grab would support this program in the areas of finance and training.  SFM"},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/290948/grab-expands-from-just-food-to-kitchen-too","title":"Grab expands from just food to kitchen, too","date":"04:05 AM February 21, 2020","snippet":"There are problems you keep to yourself, and problems that you can brag about. The company behind the popular bubble tea drink CoCo grappled with the latter when it partnered with Grab Philippines back in 2018.","body":"There are problems you keep to yourself, and problems that you can brag about. The company behind the popular bubble tea drink CoCo grappled with the latter when it partnered with Grab Philippines back in 2018. Back then, only 10 of the 30 CoCo outlets were chosen to participate in Grab’s food delivery service aptly called GrabFood. With a few taps on your phone, you could order a bubble tea, a drink more commonly known in the Philippines as milk tea.  Then came the problem. As if the milk tea craze were not enough, the demand spiked so fast that Grab saw an order for CoCo Bubble Tea every four minutes. CoCo just had too many orders.  “That was insane,” recalled Larry Evans Tan, general manager of CoCo Fresh Tea and Juice Philippines, who had an interview with reporters on the sidelines of a Grab launch last week. “There was such a surge in orders [that] the riders can’t keep up. The stores can’t keep up. The app can’t keep up,” he said.  It was the success of merchants like CoCo that eventually convinced the ride hailing giant—whose reputation in food delivery contrasts to the mixed reactions over its ride hailing service—to take the next logical step. Grab’s food delivery business has significantly grown since it was launched in 2018, according to GrabFood country head EJ dela Vega, with around 12,000 merchant outlets under its wing. But GrabFood can only do so much. It can only deliver to customers who live within a certain distance from a physical merchant, much so that a store in Mandaluyong can’t deliver food to a customer in Makati, for example. And so the next step for Grab is to find a way that will not only help merchants sell to a wider market via delivery, but will also remove the need for a business to build an actual store in the first place. Here comes GrabKitchen, a food court of sorts wherein partner-merchants can have their own private kitchens without ever having to pay rent, as long as Grab gets a certain share from their revenues.  The first GrabKitchen was launched at Glorietta Mall in Makati City last week. It partnered with six merchants, five of which do not have any commercial footprint in Makati. CoCo was one of the partner merchants. It was the only one that also had an outlet in Makati. In fact, it was also located in Glorietta, which only speaks volumes about the demand for milk tea in the area. The other five merchants are Omakase, Mister Kabab, 24 Chicken, Recovery Food, Frank and Dean. Customers can either have the food and drinks delivered via GrabKitchen, or eat in the actual store since it has a few tables inside. GrabKitchen, however, is not out to replace GrabFood. The latter, which Dela Vega said gets millions of orders in a month, will keep on. There will be three new GrabKitchens in other locations in six months, each would be able to accommodate a few partner merchants. “Without GrabFood, there is no GrabKitchen,” he said in a phone interview last Friday. “We view it more as a service to our partners. We created GrabKitchen for partners who want to expand but maybe could not invest in the same level as other [bigger companies],” he said. The new service marks Grab’s move to make its pre­sence felt even more in the lives of the public, in ways some consumers probably would not have imagined before from a ride-hailing business. Now, a rider can order food using Grab, get a document delivered, and even pay using a mobile wallet. In 2018, it called its app an “everyday super app”—a phrase that might ring like a buzz word for some, but a phrase that nevertheless becomes more true over time as the company surprises you with where else it could still go from here."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/105988/regulate-uber-grab-now","title":"Regulate Uber and Grab now","date":"05:00 AM August 01, 2017","snippet":"There is no denying that Uber and Grab are quite successful in our country, or at least in Metro Manila.

They provide a very much appreciated service for people on the go, who get picked up at the front door and dropped off at the destination much like a taxi service, in the comfort of a clean and newer vehicle. The passengers do not even have to carry cash, and the drivers for the most part are well-spoken and officially identified by the network. The ride experience itself is also rated.  In short, Uber and Grab are the next step in the evolution of what taxis ought to be, and the taxi industry should seriously start adapting the new practices. There is no denying, however, that some smarty pants are really trying to go around the system taking advantage of the platform to virtually start their underground cab business, and some individuals are lured by the false pretense that it is okay to do it full time like a legitimate regular job.  This fad or notion of the “share” or “gig” economy took off in other countries, and we decided to copy it. A lot of people invested in new vehicles with the notion that the vehicles will eventually pay for themselves and at the same time give them a handsome income depending on how long they drive per day or week. I think the fault really lies in a combination of factors. First, there were no clear-cut guidelines set forth by the governing agency. And secondly, there is a lack of a nondisclaimer on the part of Uber and Grab toward their “employees.” Uber and Grab have failed to properly explain the concept of a “ride-share” and most likely willfully distorted the goal and aim of the app-service from a “sharing” economy to a full-time “gig” economy.  To fix this, there should be an imposed rest period or break period after a drop, at least a three-hour period, to show at least that the service is not used like a regular cab. If they are operating like a nonstop service from all points  crisscrossing the metro, then obviously there is a violation and they are clearly guilty of operating like a gypsy or “colorum” cab. It may be high time that the LTFRB started selling franchises to existing Uber and Grab operations, especially those which operate like a cab. In the meantime, regular taxis should start developing apps for their services to be able to directly compete with Uber and Grab; this will be specially helpful for cabs that are going in a certain direction and cannot refuse a passenger going in the opposite direction. Plus they don’t have to waste gas roaming around trying to chance upon passengers on the street, not to mention having drivers in databases that are identifiable and having the convenience of cashless transactions. There is obviously a market with wide public support, but unfortunately it is operating in a gray area.  It’s high time the LTFRB started upping its game and sort this issue. If Uber or Grab are operating like a cab service, then all the necessary fines and penalties should be imposed. But if the services require a franchise and an obvious niche is filled, then hopefully the governing bodies will do the right thing for the sake of the riding public.

Top officials of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) said on Wednesday the companies had made the review process unnecessarily difficult, despite clear orders against such actions.  Grab Philippines, now the largest transport network company in the country, would shoulder bulk of the fine. Uber would still be asked to pay despite having left the country. The issue stems from a regional takeover deal earlier this year, wherein Grab acquired Uber’s operations here in Southeast Asia.  The PCC had flagged this, launching a review amid concerns the deal might come at the expense of the ride-hailing public. “The fines are imposed for causing undue difficulties on the PCC review and decision making process,” said PCC Commissioner Stella Quimbo in a press briefing.  The review was later set aside after Grab committed to make certain changes in its operations, albeit the violations during the process have been underscored. These promised changes, or the voluntary commitments, are currently being monitored. A violation could lead to more fines, and even an unwinding of the deal “in an extreme situation where there would be a blatant disregard” of the commitments, she said. Broken down, both companies were collectively fined P4 million for failure to keep their businesses separate. Grab, for its part, has been penalized to pay P8 million for failure to maintain premerger conditions such as pricing policies, rider promotions, driver incentives and service quality. Uber, as the acquired party, was fined P4 million for the same set of violations. In a statement, Grab Philippines public affairs head Leo Gonzales said: “We are currently studying all our legal options with regard to the fine imposed by the PCC.

Anderson became the first rookie pitcher with five no-hit innings in a World Series game since 1912 as the Braves grabbed a 2-1 edge in Major League Baseball’s best-of-seven championship, which continues in Atlanta on Saturday and Sunday.  Anderson, a 23-year-old American right-hander, walked three and struck out four while throwing 39 of his 76 pitches for strikes. Reliever A.J. Minter mystified Houston in the sixth and Luke Jackson kept the Astros hitless in the seventh.  But Atlanta left-hander reliever Tyler Matzek lost the no-hit bid in the eighth when Astros pinch-hitter Aledmys Diaz singled on a fly ball to left field that dropped in front of Braves outfielder Eddie Rosario. The only no-hitters in MLB playoff history have been Don Larsen’s perfect game for the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series and the late Roy Halladay’s no-hitter for Philadelphia in 2010.  An Astros batting lineup hitting .276 in the playoffs with five or more runs in 10 games struggled to solve Atlanta’s masterful pitching until the eighth, when Houston threatened to tie the game. Jose Siri replaced Diaz as a pinch runner, stole second base and took third on a throwing error by Braves catcher Travis d’Arnaud. But Matzek got Michael Brantley to fly out to third base to end the inning with Atlanta still leading 1-0. D’Arnaud smashed a solo homer for Atlanta in the eighth to double the lead and left-handed pitcher Will Smith entered for the Braves in the ninth to try and finish off Houston.  Alex Bregman led off with a single but Yordan Alvarez, Carlos Correa and Kyle Tucker each flew out to end Houston’s final threat. The Braves improved to 6-0 at home in this year’s playoffs in the first World Series game in Atlanta since 1999. The Braves seek their first championship since 1995 while the Astros, in their third World Series in five seasons, won the 2017 crown but lost the 2019 title to Washington in seven games. Anderson and Houston right-hander Luis Garcia were only the eighth rookie starting pitchers to oppose each other in a World Series game and the first since 2006. The Braves tagged Garcia for a run in the third. Rosario walked and took second on a Freddie Freeman single. Garcia retired Ozzie Albies on his fifth strikeout but Austin Riley doubled down the third base line to score Rosario and Atlanta led 1-0. Jorge Soler walked to load the bases but Adam Duvall popped up and d’Arnaud struck out to end the threat. Garcia became the first rookie pitcher in World Series history with multiple strikeouts in each of the first three innings. The Astros stranded two runners in the fourth after Alvarez walked and Correa was hit by a pitch, but Anderson kept Houston hitless and scoreless through four innings. Anderson was the youngest pitcher since 1947 not to allow a hit in the first four innings of a World Series game and he retired the Astros in order again in the fifth to conclude his magical run.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Braves manager Brian Snitker removed Anderson for left-hander Minter to face the top of Houston’s batting order in the sixth. Minter hit Bregman on the foot to give the Astros a base runner but kept them hitless and scoreless after six before he was removed for a pinch hitter. Jackson, a right-hander, took the mound for Atlanta in the seventh and sent down Houston in order again. Correa grounded out to second, Tucker flew out to centerfield and Yuli Gurriel grounded out to third.

In line with this, Grab has struck a strategic partnership with multi-sector Vietnamese conglomerate Sovico Group to collaborate on mobility and logistics solutions to improve Vietnam’s first and last-mile delivery networks.  The US$500 million investment will also go into launching new services, and expanding Grab’s transport, food and payments networks in Vietnam. In its “Tech for Good” development roadmap, three main areas Grab will look at are lifting communities from poverty, helping build a skilled workforce, and working with city governments for urban planning.  Grab aims to partner financial institutions to provide financial solutions to micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses – which includes driver-partners, delivery partners and merchant partners. This includes access to credit and insurance products to grow and protect livelihoods. It also plans to grow its research and development (R&D) headcount in Vietnam and invest in building Vietnamese tech talents. It will also encourage tech entrepreneurship and support growth in the market’s startup scene through its GrabVentures program.  Grab also aims to work with city governments and policymakers in harnessing data to make better urban planning decisions to alleviate problems like traffic congestion and pollution. It will also look to put sustainability at the centre of its business by targeting to reduce plastic waste for its GrabFood delivery service. Grab Vietnam country head Jerry Lim said that by the end of 2019, Grab would have invested “more than US$200 million into the country to better the livelihoods of users and partners of its services. “By aligning our business with the government’s socio-economic development plan, we want to make a significant and meaningful contribution to Vietnam’s long-term socio-economic growth, and support the country’s Industry 4.0 ambitions,” Mr Lim added. Grab added that it has made “an open call for partnerships” with public and private sector stakeholders who share the same Tech For Good vision. As for its tie-up with Sovico Group, the conglomerate will provide its expertise and networks in aviation, finance, real estate and hospitality, together with Grab’s technology and platform, to accelerate Vietnam’s economic and technological development, said Grab upon the signing of a memorandum of understanding.  Sovico Holdings owns private airline Vietjet Air, and also runs several resorts and hotels including Furama Resort Da Nang, Ana Mandara and An Lam Ninh Van Bay. Grab head of regional operations Russell Cohen added the country’s rapidly developing economy and young, mobile-first population makes it ripe for the adoption of digital services. “As we scale our food, parcel delivery, transport and payments business across the country, we hope to tap and invest in new opportunities emerging in the fintech, mobility and logistics space, in order to bring about greater value and innovation for our customers and partners,” he said."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/214601/grab-citi-forge-deal-cashless-payments","title":"Grab, Citi forge deal on cashless payments","date":"03:31 AM September 07, 2016","snippet":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting.","body":"Global banking giant Citi and Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing platform Grab have teamed up to promote cashless payments, enticing credit card holders with discounts and freebies and allowing the use of credit card points as currency in commuting. The partnership—a first for Asia —will be rolled out in five markets in Asia-Pacific, beginning in the Philippines and Singapore, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow shortly, Citi announced in a statement from Singapore.  “By grounding our reputation in safety, quality and availability, Grab is now the trusted, ride-hailing leader in our six markets with one in eight smartphone users in Southeast Asia already on our platform. As customers use Grab for their regular transport needs, many of them are choosing to go cashless by adopting GrabPay for a more seamless ride experience. We are thrilled to partner with Citi to extend its best-in-class loyalty capabilities to make it easier to serve and reward our customers in the region,” said Joel Yarbrough, head of payments and commerce product at Grab. “Our strategy in consumer banking is to be the world’s leading digital bank which includes delivering a remarkable client experience in key digital ecosystems. We have seen that the rapid adoption of mobile and other digital channels has truly transformed how and where people bank and we are delighted to partner with Grab. By integrating our services into key applications such as Grab we also will drive growth in our cards business via new acquisitions and increased customer loyalty,” said Anand Selva, head of Citi’s Asia Pacific consumer banking.  As part of the initial phase, customers who added their Citi credit card to GrabPay, Grab’s mobile payment platform, would receive a discounted first ride. The partnership is also seen as a way for Citi to attract cardholders among Grab users. Grab customers who sign up for any Citi credit card through the partnership gets a number of free rides worth up to $50.  The next phase will allow customers to pay for Grab rides using points. Citibank credit cardholders who charge their Citi credit card on GrabPay will receive a SMS from Citi requesting if they would like to redeem the ride for points. Upon replying with their acceptance, the redemption will be made automatically and reflected in the customer’s monthly statement. This innovative pay for rides service is the first in the region, enabling credit cardholders to easily exchange their points for on-demand redemption for smaller, daily transactions—in one step. For Citi cardholders, the points earned depend on the type of card. Generally, a cardholder earns one point for every P30 of spending. Citi and Grab will announce soon how points will be converted to Grab peso bill. Grab currently operates in 30 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam—markets and cities through which Citi offers consumer banking services including credit cards. Grab seeks to solve critical transportation challenges for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. It began as a taxi-hailing app in 2012 but it has expanded its core product platform to include private cars and motorbikes.  Grab is also testing new services such as social carpooling, as well as last mile and food deliveries."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/85714/bistek-tried-to-mislead-p-noy-in-land-grab-row","title":"Bistek tried to mislead P-Noy in land-grab row","date":"12:11 AM June 12, 2015","snippet":"What is happening to the Quezon City government under Mayor Herbert “Bistek” Bautista?

Worse, Bautista wants to involve President Aquino in his land-grabbing activities.","body":"What is happening to the Quezon City government under Mayor Herbert “Bistek” Bautista? It has become a shameless land-grabber. Worse, Bautista wants to involve President Aquino in his land-grabbing activities. On Dec. 8, 2014, Bautista wrote a letter to the President asking him to amend Proclamation 1670, s. 1977, that granted a usufruct to the Manila Seedling Bank Foundation (MSBF) over seven hectares of land, which is part of the National Government Center owned by the National Housing Authority (NHA), and give the land instead to the Quezon City government.  In his letter, Bautista tried to mislead the President with misrepresentations and outright falsehoods. He wanted the President to violate the Constitution and be a land-grabber, too. A usufruct is a contract protected by the Constitution. Depriving the MSBF of its usufructuary rights to the 7-hectare property would violate Section 10, Article III (Bill of Rights) of the l987 Constitution, which proscribes the passage of any law impairing the obligation of a contract. Similarly, any amendment to the proclamation revoking the grant to the MSBF of the usufruct will violate Section 1, Article III of the Constitution forbidding the deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law.  Besides, Bautista’s act of requesting an amendment to Proclamation 1670 constitutes an unwarranted interference by third parties in contracts, which makes him liable for damages under Article 1314 of the Civil Code. No less than the Supreme Court upheld Proclamation 1670 on April 13, 2008. In its decision in National Housing Authority v Court of Appeals, Bulacan Garden Corp. and Manila Seedling Bank Foundation, the tribunal upheld the usufruct granted to MSBF for 50 years, or until 2027.  It will be recalled that on July 10, 2012, Bautista sent Quezon City policemen, members of his Department of Public Order and Safety, private security guards of Marban Security Agency, and hired goons to forcibly take over the MSBF Gardens and destroy the administration building and all the plant nurseries and gardeners’ stores. In January 2014, the Quezon City government, using brute force, physically expelled the MSBF and all of its tenants from the 7-hectare usufruct area. Bautista’s excuse was that the Quezon City government had become the owner of the property, having forfeited it for nonpayment of real estate taxes since 1981. But this is completely illegal. First, property owner NHA is exempt from paying real estate taxes under the Urban Development and Housing Act. This exemption was recognized by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in BIR Ruling 071-98 dated May 25, 1998, and by the Land Registration Authority in Circular 1-2004 dated Jan. 26, 2004. Second, under Article 597 of the Civil Code, the MSBF, being the usufructuary of the NHA property, is also exempt from real estate taxes which, during the usufruct, may be imposed on the property. These exemptions are in full force and effect and are not disputed by Bautista himself.  In short, the Quezon City government is not and has never become the owner of the 7-hectare property. To date, there is no annotation in the Torrens title of the NHA over the property regarding its supposed acquisition by the Quezon City government. Neither has the Quezon City government any title issued in its name over the property. Moreover, in forfeiting the property on account of unpaid real estate taxes, the Quezon City government did not comply with the Quezon City Revenue Code of 1993. Not having complied with this Code, the Quezon City government did not become the property’s owner, nor did it become entitled to possession of the property. The Supreme Court is clear on this issue. In its decision in City Mayor of Quezon City et al. v. Rizal Banking Corp., Aug. 3, 2010, it held that what the Quezon City government should comply with is not the Local Government Code but the Quezon City Revenue Code of 1993 in forfeiting a parcel of land for nonpayment of real property taxes on it. Not being the owner, the Quezon City government had no right to expel the MSBF from the property. Moreover, Bautista has publicly admitted that the Quezon City government does not own the MSBF property. At the opening of a 2013 horticulture show at the Quezon Memorial Circle, he said: “Here at the Quezon City Memorial Circle we can assert our ownership. This is ours. Not like the Manila Seedling Bank property, which is still owned by the National Housing Authority.” The mayor also lied to the President when he said that the MSBF’s certificate of registration had been revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is false. First, the Quezon City government is estopped from denying the corporation personality of the MSBF. It has all the while recognized and transacted with the MSBF as a corporation. It tried to collect real estate taxes; it has actually collected business taxes from it. Second, the SEC itself does not consider the revocation of the MSBF’s certificate of registration as final. It gave the foundation until Dec. 31, 2015, to petition for the lifting of the revocation. In fact, the MSBF filed its petition with the SEC last Feb. 4. Third, the MSBF has not been dissolved; much less is it in a state of dissolution. It continues to exist and operate in another address. It was also grossly dishonest of Bautista to tell the President of provisions of the Corporation Code and the Civil Code, as these provisions refer to a dissolved corporation."},{"url":"https://business.inquirer.net/262150/grabs-acquisition-of-uber-may-have-broken-law-in-vietnam","title":"Grab’s acquisition of Uber may have broken law in Vietnam","date":"Asia News Network","snippet":"HANOI —  Grab’s acquisition of Uber may have violated the Competition Law, according to the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA).","body":"HANOI —  Grab’s acquisition of Uber may have violated the Competition Law, according to the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA). The VCA on Wednesday said it had completed an investigation into the acquisition and transferred its conclusions to the Vietnam Competition Council for consideration.  The investigation found that Grab did not notify its purchase of Uber to market regulators and the deal could make Vietnamese taxi companies vulnerable due to a smaller market shares and changes in customer habits. The two violations are stated in sections 5 and 6 of Chapter 5 of the Competition Law.  The VCA added that within 30 days from receiving the documents, the council could make one of two decisions: returning the file for additional investigation (within 60 days) or suspending the case and open a hearing to issue a decision on the handling of the case. Grab announced on March 26 it had purchased Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.  Following the merger, Uber now holds a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, while Uber’s CEO has joined Grab’s management board. The VCA has sent a dispatch to Grab requesting information and documents related to the acquisition. However, Grab claimed that since the combined market share of both Grab and Uber in Vietnam was less than 30 percent, it did not have to inform the competition authority before proceeding and completing this transaction in Vietnam. The VCA held a working session with Grab’s legal representative on April 6, but the firm failed to provide evidence proving its claim. Grab is one of the most frequently used O2O (online-to-offline) mobile platforms across 195 cities in Southeast Asia. More than five million people use the combined platform daily. If the concentrated share of parties accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the market without informing the VCA before an acquisition, firms would be fined 10 per cent of their total revenue from the previous financial year. If the rate was more than 50 per cent, the transaction would be prohibited, the VCA added."},{"url":"https://opinion.inquirer.net/118966/i-spent-p159088-on-grab","title":"I spent P159,088 on Grab","date":"05:02 AM January 19, 2019","snippet":"I’m not sure it’s possible to justify spending that much money, but what I learned from making that choice warrants discussion. I’m emotionally healthier than I’ve ever felt—at least, as far as traffic is concerned.","body":"I’m not sure it’s possible to justify spending that much money, but what I learned from making that choice warrants discussion. I’m emotionally healthier than I’ve ever felt—at least, as far as traffic is concerned. In 2018, I sat in someone else’s car and paid the equivalent of the household income of many Filipino families. With a click of a button—and more importantly, without the hassle of haggling the fare, reminding the driver to turn on the meter, or telling him that he is conveniently P1 short of my change—I asked more than 740 strangers to drive me, bring me food, or deliver a package. All the equivalent of a round-trip ticket to London—four times. I could have ridden a jeepney with the same amount to and from my work more than 8,800 times. I constructed a world of privilege in which very little of what I don’t have to deal with gets through the car window.  And I would do it all over again. The ill effects of traffic mismanagement, poor road conditions, bad drivers and equally inconsiderate pedestrians—all of us—are an old story. Metro Manila loses P3.5 billion a day due to traffic conditions, according to a 2017 report by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. This is about P1.2 trillion a year. If we consider the cash remittances of overseas Filipino workers  that same year at about P1.4 trillion, based on figures from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, this means 85 percent sent home by our hardworking loved ones is money down the sewage. Think of how much could also be available to manage our plastic pollution.  Traffic congestion does no better for our health. It is linked to stress, anxiety, anger and respiratory problems. Some of us get up early for work or stay longer to beat the rush-hour traffic. This means less sleep and less time spent with friends and loved ones—all linked to poor emotional health. Consider also that secure and safe attachment begins very early in life. Children with secure attachment become adults with higher self-esteem, greater self-reliance and lower rates of depression and anxiety. Every moment a baby or infant spends away from stuck-in-traffic parents or caregivers is lost investment in the future. Imagine also what we could be doing with all that lost time. In Manila, we spend a little more than one hour each day—or about 16 days a year—stuck in traffic, a 2017 Boston Consulting Group study says. With the average person reading at a speed of 280 words per minute, we could repurpose those days and read “Noli Me Tangere” 44 times. We could also lower our blood pressure by an average of 4-9 millimeters of mercury by walking, dancing or running for 30 minutes a day.  Medicines for diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol might no longer have value-added tax starting this year, but traffic congestion means 800 lost opportunities to do a half-hour’s worth of aerobic activity—and for some, lost chances to reduce blood pressure better than some medication, according to the Mayo Clinic. With the time we spend in traffic, we could also learn basic Chinese—twice—and have sex 4,600 times, not including foreplay. Grab was my way of reclaiming lost time and money. I answered emails, held conference calls, prepared lesson plans, drafted talks and presentations. What you are reading now—I wrote some of it in a Grab. I did work—and worked hard to allow me to afford the amount I paid. All in the comfort of someone else’s car that I myself did not have to park, did not have to put gas in, and did not have to drive in the cruel and downright apocalyptic roads of Metro Manila. And I would do it all over again. My choice is afforded by privilege. It reeks of our fast-growing consumption culture and can even be questionably elitist. It is a shortcut for those who take advantage of venture capitalism at the expense of mom-and-pop workers. Many Filipinos have limited choice. I wish I did not have to pay for this extravagant amount. I am acutely cognizant of where that money could have been spent—savings, vacation, emergency funds, retirement, donations to improve waste management. However, I feel healthier, less stressed and get more work done. The local ride-sharing economy is not perfect. After Uber left the country in early 2018, Grab has a monopoly, effectively making it impossible for Hype, Owto, Hirna and other transport network companies to make big dents against Grab’s dominance. It is not clear if the efforts of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to break this virtual monopoly are working. Securing capital investments and getting riders continue to plague the competition.  And we suffer for it. Grab essentially controls the price—with ever deeper hands into our wallets. Surge pricing is also no joke. After more than 700 trips, I myself have noticed how increasingly difficult it is to book a ride. I do not expect these to change this new year. I also do not have high hopes for significant improvements in our public transportation, one that would be efficient and comfortable for commuters as well as profitable and fair for owners and operators. The Build, build, build (BBB) program might ease traffic congestion and improve transportation in the longer term. But I am a clinical psychologist who knows that one of the best predictors of future behavior is past behavior—because change is very hard. Knowing what you know about government-related projects in the past, how do you think the BBB will fare in the future? You already know the answer. So, as long as I can afford a ride alternative like Grab, I will take that opportunity and milk it for all it is worth. You should, too, because you deserve something better. You should not have to choose between sitting in a jeepney for 16 days and spending time with loved ones. You should be able to read Rizal’s great works and still have sex as many times as you want. I suggest including foreplay. The strength of exercising our choice is a threat to the passivity that is the essential feature of government inefficiencies and poor regulatory implementation. We need to exercise our choice for alternative rides. I choose Grab. Dr. Ronald del Castillo is professor of psychology, public health and health policy at the University of the Philippines Manila.
